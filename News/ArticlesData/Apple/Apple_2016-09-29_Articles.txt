The bad news? It can’t make enough of those things to ship to everyone quick enough. So, if rumors of an all-glass iPhone next year come to bear, will Apple step up to meet the demand — if there is any? We’ve got plenty of questions to mull over and twelve whole months to do so, but let’s start with more about the all-glass design for what may be the iPhone 8 next year. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has another research note out today. AppleInsider reports that just as Apple has limited the new Jet Black option to the 128GB and 256GB storage options of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the company may go in the same direction again next year. Part of that may relate to the desire to achieve an all-glass chassis for the iPhone 8. Kuo believes that there won’t be enough R&D progress to make such a phone structurally sound. “[A] metal frame surrounding the edge is necessary for reinforced structure design,” Kuo stated. “As stainless steel has a better look than aluminum and costs more, we expect only high-end new iPhone models to come with a stainless steel frame next year.” Unlike this year’s easily marked Jet Black finish, though, the all-glass design will be just as glossy while being more resistant to scratches. Kuo also rumors that the mostly glass build will be on both the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus next year, contradicting the notion that just the Plus models would be getting it. We also may expect an edge-to-edge OLED display that will completely cover the face of certain, if not all iPhones. The home button, earpiece and the FaceTime camera might actually be tucked beneath the screen. Just what kind of research has Kuo and KGI been up to? We don’t know. The firm has called plenty of shots correctly, though it missed on a few major ones before. We’d like to see if these rumors make it past the spring, though.

But there is no need for Apple fans around the world to start panicking. No, iPhone 7s are not exploding just like the Note 7s and there is a very high chance that there will not be a recall on Apple's new smartphones. Photos of a iPhone 7 Plus that appears to have exploded were posted on Reddit this week, and have since fueled rumors that all iPhone 7s are about to meet the same fate as the Note 7 and burn up in flames. The Reddit user kroopthesnoop informed the community about the situation his co-worker found himself in when his iPhone 7 Plus arrived. The smartphone appeared to be "running a little hot" as the title of the post humorously suggests because photos reveal that the device appeared to overheat while out for shipping. In a series of photos shared, there is no denying something horrible happened to this iPhone 7 Plus before reaching the customer. The device packaging does looks crisp and black marks reveal it could have been burned. The damage was extensive enough to rip past the iPhone and the AT&T packaging, with dents and damage clearly being caused to the device itself. (Photo : kroopthesnoop ) The redditor claims the co-worker did not use the phone, and it came shipped this way. After making headlines, Apple reportedly reached out to the redditor to get more information about the incident. The company then called the customer and reportedly is working with AT&T to provide a replacement. Apple and AT&T have not publicly commented on the matter. Despite having photos to prove the iPhone 7 Plus was severely damaged, even if the cause of the explosion was overheating, this is most likely an isolated incident. It doesn't mean that all iPhone 7s are going to start exploding, too. And it's not like the smartphone blew up in flames when being charged or when in the customer's pocket. We can't blame the battery or make any assumptions as to how this one case of the iPhone 7 Plus exploded. It could be that maybe something happened while it was out for shipping to cause it to get this amount of damage. Still, the truth is that unfortunately sometimes phones explode. And iPhones are not exempt from this. For example, there have been cases the iPhone 6 exploding, with an Australian customer as recent as last month suffering from third-degree burns when it happened to him. While it's safe to assume the iPhone 7 Plus won't be recalled for exploding any time soon, one can never say never. It started with just one Samsung Note 7 explosion report. Then more and more incidents were reported, which then led to the mass recall. Apple did openly admit that the Jet Black iPhone 7 scratches easily, so if there were in fact a mass problem, customers could only hope the company would address it immediately. Until then, don't cancel your preorders as customers continue to wait for their Jet Black models. There is a good chance it will arrive combustion-free.   Source: Reddit TAG iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 7 Rumor, iPhone 7, Apple, AT&T, Smartphone, exploding iPhone, Exploding iPhone 7 Plus, Explosion © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

By John Gruber Archive The Talk Show Projects Contact Colophon RSS Feed Twitter Sponsorship BlackBerry vs. iPhone Friday, 9 May 2008 1: Wherein Neither ‘RIM’ Nor ‘BlackBerry’ Are Even Mentioned, but Rather the Stage Is Set for Showing Why They Might Be Seriously Screwed Along the lines of can’t-really-be-answered-but-gosh-they’re-fun-to-ponder questions like, say, “Who’d win in a fight, Batman or Spider-Man?” or “Star Destroyer vs. U.S.S. Enterprise?”,1 here’s one regarding the iPhone: What historical Mac is a current iPhone most analogous to, spec-wise? I.e, complete this sentence: “An iPhone is like having a tiny ____ in your pocket?” Now of course the comparison can’t be precise. Different software, different use cases, different purposes. But there’s no denying that an iPhone is a computer. And unless you’re really young, it’s faster — a lot faster — than the computers you owned not so long ago. So, seriously, stop here for a moment and think about it. My first answer, pulled simply from recollection of how fast machines felt to use, was the original iMac. But that machine — announced 10 years ago this week — had a 233 MHz G3 and, by default, a paltry 32 MB of RAM. Apple has never officially released the CPU specs of the iPhone, but Craig Hockenberry poked around with undocumented system APIs which indicated the iPhone’s CPU runs at 400 MHz with a bus speed of 100 MHz, and that there’s 128 MB of RAM. As we all recall from the PowerPC era, MHz is not a precise metric for comparing the performance of CPUs across different architectures; I wouldn’t be surprised in the least to find out that a 400 MHz PowerPC G3 is a faster chip than the 400 MHz ARMwhatever that’s in the iPhone, if only because of the power constraints. But, still, it’s something. So, my answer to the question: the original “Pismo” G3 PowerBook. The numbers match up pretty closely: 400 MHz CPU, 100 MHz bus speed, 64 MB of RAM. (The higher-end Pismo had a 500 MHz CPU and 128 MB of RAM.) Even storage sizes are similar: hard drive options for the Pismo were 6, 12, or 18 GB. Another possible answer: the original blue-and-white Power Mac G3 — again, 400 MHz CPU, 100 MHz bus speed, 64-128 MB of RAM, and 6-12 GB hard drives. Think about that — in just nine years, the specs that then described Apple’s top-of-the-line desktop computer now describe their phone. One thing that makes this comparison hard is that there’s not much software in common. You can’t use most of the real-world tasks commonly used for ballpark benchmarking, like, say, Photoshop image processing or ripping MP3s from AIFFs, because the iPhone doesn’t do them. But there is one processor intensive task we can compare: web page rendering. In the early days of the web, it took a while for even moderately large web pages to render in a browser, even when you were loading them from HTML files right on your hard drive. If you were to plop yourself down in front of one of these vintage 1999-2000 Macs for an afternoon of web browsing, even with a decent Ethernet connection to the Internet you’d find the experience pretty damn slow by current standards. For all the incessant chatter about the demand for and purported certainty of 3G wireless networking in the next generation of iPhone hardware, the truth is that current iPhones are held back, web-surfing-wise, by more than just the speed of EDGE (which admittedly, is indeed pretty slow). Recall this video pitting a 3G Nokia E61i against an iPhone on EDGE — total rendering time was more or less the same, and in a few cases, the iPhone came out ahead. You can see that browsing speed — which is what matters — depends on more than just networking speed simply by comparing how long it takes to render a web page on the iPhone using Wi-Fi: a lot longer than it takes to load the same page using Safari on a Mac. For example, it takes about two or three seconds for Safari to load the Daring Fireball home page on my new MacBook Pro. Using the same Wi-Fi network, it takes my iPhone about 15 seconds. (Using EDGE, it takes about 60 seconds to completely load, although you can start reading much sooner than that.) Point being that even if 3G wireless networking were as fast as Wi-Fi — which it’s not — browsing on an iPhone would still be pretty slow compared to browsing on a modern desktop or laptop. If you frequently use Wi-Fi on your iPhone, a faster processor in the next-generation hardware would make a bigger difference to the overall experience than faster phone-carrier networking. And so here’s the point I’m driving at. If a 2007 iPhone is loosely equivalent in terms of computing power to a 2000 PowerBook or 1999 Power Mac, that puts the spread at around seven or eight years. Extrapolate forward, and it’s therefore not at all unreasonable to think that a 2014 iPhone will pack the computing power of today’s MacBook Pro. Or, nearer term, that an iPhone introduced two years from now might pack the punch of a 2003 Aluminum PowerBook G4 — quite a difference from the Pismo. Even if your estimate of the iPhone’s equivalent-horsepower Mac is further back in time than mine, there’s no denying that Moore’s Law applies to handhelds, too. Eventually there will be a computer that fits in your pocket that is more powerful than today’s Mac Pros. But the path from here to there is riddled with difficult engineering problems — heat dissipation, battery life, and OS integration chief among them. There is marketing. There most certainly is design. But at the core of this market — by which I mean the market for handheld multitasking web-surfing networked-everywhere “phones” which are really computers — is engineering. Apple is the best handheld computer engineering company in the world today, hands down. They’re also the best handheld computer user experience design company. And they’re not sharing. 2: Why RIM Is Screwed When the iPhone was announced, I saw Apple as staking out ground far afield from the territory RIM occupies with the BlackBerry. Last year, I didn’t see Apple implementing Exchange support in the iPhone OS, and clearly that was, well, completely wrong. The “enterprise” features Apple has announced for the imminent 2.0 release of the iPhone OS — remote wipe, push email, automatic calendar and contact synching — pretty much encompass every single feature that’s been held up as a reason the iPhone wouldn’t sell to enterprise users. It remains to be seen how well these new iPhone features will actually work, but if the answer is “as well as promised”, and if the iPhone’s Mail app is improved in ways targeting people who receive a high number of messages, it’s hard to see a single software advantage in the BlackBerry’s favor. Which leaves hardware, which leaves the keyboard. Two Sundays ago, the New York Times ran a lengthy business-section piece by Brad Stone, titled “BlackBerry’s Quest: Fend Off the iPhone”. Regarding the upcoming BlackBerry 9000, the focus turned to the keyboard: Photographs of the device, leaked to gadget news sites, also indicate that the new BlackBerry will have elegant curves suggestive of the iPhone. It will also have a physical keyboard like previous R.I.M. devices, as opposed to the glass touch screen found on the iPhone. There’s a reason that R.I.M. is averse to the iPhone’s glass pad. “I couldn’t type on it and I still can’t type on it, and a lot of my friends can’t type on it,” says Mike Lazaridis, R.I.M.’s co-chief executive and technological visionary. “It’s hard to type on a piece of glass.” Mr. Lazaridis thinks that e-mail-dependent BlackBerry owners demand the reliability and tactile feedback of a keyboard. But, despite his critique of the iPhone, he does not dismiss the possibility that R.I.M. may itself one day sell a touch-screen phone, aimed specifically at consumers without the e-mail demands of BlackBerry’s core users. Translation: “We’ll emphasize the physical keyboard as a differentiating factor as long as it seems to work, at which point we’ll try a touch-screen keyboard too.” The only other angle RIM seems to be hanging its hat on is “security”: RIM is also betting on security, which hinges on the fact that its handsets and e-mail systems are relatively impervious to hackers. Mr. Lazaridis predicts that corporations will not give iPhones to their workers because they have already proved vulnerable to hackers eager to pry iPhones off AT&T’s system and make them work on other wireless networks. “It’s not that simple for an I.T. manager to give up security,” he said. The idea that iPhone carrier unlocking is a “security problem” is a conflation between what an attacker can do to your phone, against your will and/or unbeknownst to you, versus what a phone’s owner can do to their own phone. It’s not like these “hackers” are attacking happy AT&T-subscribed iPhone owners and switching them over to T-Mobile against their will. To understand why Apple is making a concerted effort to appeal to BlackBerry users, consider an analogy to the board game Risk. RIM has a large army (read: users), but they’re all massed together in one spot on the map. They care about email, they care about exactly the sort of enterprise features Apple has announced for the iPhone, and they are known to be willing to pay several hundred dollars for a handset. A lucrative target that can be attacked all at once. And the BlackBerry is weakest where the iPhone is strongest: web browsing, music, and video. Compare and contrast with, say, a software platform like Windows Mobile, or a hardware maker like Nokia — their users are spread across a wide variety of phones and platforms. It was far easier to turn the iPhone into something almost every BlackBerry customer might at least consider than it would have been to make a lineup of iPhones that appeal to every Nokia customer. RIM doesn’t really have any lock-in other than user habits. The BlackBerry gimmick is that it works with the email system your company bought from Microsoft. Replace a BlackBerry with an iPhone (2.0) and the messages, contacts, and calendar events that sync over the network will be the same as the ones on the BlackBerry you just tossed into a desk drawer. In broad terms, BlackBerrys are optimized first for email; the iPhone for the web. What’s more important, an email client or a web browser? For most people, and perhaps even most current BlackBerry users, the answer is clearly the web. Many people in fact read their email entirely through the web. Unless you’re Richard Stallman, you probably don’t read the web through your email client. The iPhone would be a credible, useful device with just two apps: Phone and Safari. But it doesn’t just have those two apps. It has a slew, and they’re all better on the iPhone than the BlackBerry and the difference with regard to anything other than email is only going to get more stark once the iTunes App Store opens its doors. If nothing else, consider games, games, and games. As I wrote when the iPhone’s upcoming enterprise features were announced, the iPhone can do more BlackBerry-ish things than the BlackBerry can do iPhone-ish things. Apple doesn’t wait for someone else to knock one of their hit products off its throne or slowly run it into the ground (cf. the Motorola Razr) — they do it themselves. For six years pundits have been declaring that competitors would “soon” catch up to the iPod, but the iPod has never been a static target — over the same six years Apple has released significant new iPods every year. There are no signs that RIM has the engineering chops on either side of the ball — hardware or software — to compete with where the iPhone is now, let alone where it’s going to be. We know that Apple has an OS that can scale to take advantage of faster (and multi-core) processors, because OS X is doing that already. If a two-years-away 2010 iPhone might be like having a 2003 PowerBook G4 in your pocket, for RIM’s sake a 2010 BlackBerry had better be something more than a BlackBerry with a brighter screen. Correct answers: Batman, Star Destroyer. ↩︎ Previous: Is This Microsoft-NBC ‘Copyright Cop’ Thing Bullshit or What?

We also know that while Apple’s attempt to control the ecosystem and maintain a closed platform may be good for Apple, developers want more options and customers want to fully access the overwhelming majority of web sites that use Flash. We think many customers are getting tired of being told what to think by Apple. And by the way, RIM has achieved record shipments for five consecutive quarters and recently shared guidance of 13.8 – 14.4 million BlackBerry smartphones for the current quarter. Apple’s preference to compare its September-ending quarter with RIM’s August-ending quarter doesn’t tell the whole story because it doesn’t take into account that industry demand in September is typically stronger than summer months, nor does it explain why Apple only shipped 8.4 million devices in its prior quarter and whether Apple’s Q4 results were padded by unfulfilled Q3 customer demand and channel orders. As usual, whether the subject is antennas, Flash or shipments, there is more to the story and sooner or later, even people inside the distortion field will begin to resent being told half a story. – Jim Balsillie, Co-CEO at Research In Motion (RIM) Share Read more about: blackberry playbook, tablet os Join the conversation Show comments Hide comments + - http://twitter.com/bbindiaforums BBIndia Forums Great reply.

Real Deal If we are talking only smartphones here, RIM does not have the biggest market share – and it’s falling. Meanwhile Apple’s market share is climbing. And Apple has a bigger share of profit then RIM. Get your facts straight. Real Deal If we are talking only smartphones here, RIM does not have the biggest market share – and it’s falling. Meanwhile Apple’s market share is climbing. And Apple has a bigger share of profit then RIM. Get your facts straight. Misterf00 Actually, Real Deal you are incorrect. My husband works for RIM and all I can say is that they are kicking it in market share. We have the real numbers and the analysts out there don’t always give accurate info. Mario And so it is! Besides RIM makes huge business esp. here in Indonesia their biggest and fastest growing market right now (end of this year Indonesia has 150 million mobile phone users out of a population of 250 million). Here it’s all BB and Apple is nowhere in the numbers like RIM. Your not in business here without your BB and PIN… Doc only one major carrier has iPhone. All the major carriers have Blackberries why don’t you do the math instead of regurgitating what Apple tells you http://twitter.com/FoxRoxYourSox Greg Fox Actually Doc, iPhone is carried by AT&T, T-Mobile (Germany, UK, Netherlands), SoftBank, Orange, O2, Vodaphone, TELUS Mobility, Rogers and Bell Mobility. HardcoreMommy What do you mean only one carrier has iPhone? Even Walmart has iPhone … for 3 different carriers alone… are you serious? Jaq walmart does not qualify as a carrier , the carriers are AT&T, T-mobile, Verizon etc. Vugar http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-20012627-94.html apple does have the biggest market share SheaSF Android has the biggest market share, Real. I-phone only held the distinction for a year or two. BlackBerry dominated the market until then. AT&T sucks in a lot of places. Android, and BB have not been eclipsed by a long shot. Luther He didn’t specify whether his statement was directed at only smartphones. Therefore his facts are still correct. Get your LOGIC straight. Chris M http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1421013 http://www.dailyhaha.com/linkout.asp?linkID=2579&cat=hotlinks http://www.engadget.com/2009/03/11/nokia-continues-to-hemorrhage-smartphone-marketshare-to-rim-app/ Please learn your facts before posting … i phone sucks BB rules i cant stand i phone or in that aspect anything apple puts out i cant stand their os it sucks. http://twitter.com/ross_ritchey Ross Ritchey Uhm… yeah. RIM doesn’t have the biggest market share Android has more market share than Apple. – True RIM has more than double the market share that Android has – True RIM’s market share is falling – True Androids market share is growing – True Apples market share is growing – False Distortion fields go away when you look at the real numbers. Apple is good a marketing – this doesn’t mean they have the market share – and in fact, they don’t want the market share. They are getting plenty of profit off of the share they currently have. Bmbartels I read a transcript of what Steve said and just became disgusted. You killed it! This is why I will be a BlackBerry forever, y’all are good, honest people who make the best products. http://pulse.yahoo.com/_CLR3KAHSRGJUXLZD74TSIBFAHI reece Great. Now please demo a working Playbook unit. Don’t just hold it in your hand, but use it. Because right now, it looks like the Playbook is just vaporware. ShortChange If customers are tired of ‘being told by Apple’ …sales would reflect that? Come on Balsille, RIM needs to step up their game and you know it. Developers ‘may’ want to build on flash for your systems, and that’s because you have a terrible software platform which isn’t capable of making good applications. Your application offerings are slim pickings; a fraction of the quality and quantity of Apple’s. You are losing market share by the hour. Your products are severely outdated. If you can’t face reality, the board needs to replace you. Step up the game, or become a thing of the past. Hoho How about you realize that this post IS NOT ABOUT SMARTPHONES… its about tablets!!! http://twitter.com/HoracioRivera Horacio Rivera I now own a BB i8350 and sucks BIG TIME, nextel has made already 5 REPLACEMENTS and the freaking thing has one problem or other, it seem like finally they will finally cancel my contract and start a new one without smartphone involved. I prefer beeing stuck with wife’s 2G iPhone than to read a Facebook coment on my i8350, crap cominig out of a bull, thats what my BB is. Ben Why don’t you try dropping your iToy and I’ll drop my Blackberry, let’s see which survives. Oh and please remove that cute little bumper you had to buy to make the phone work properly. T1 Yep gotta get me that Fart app for my phone…yessirreee. pshh! What are you reading…Apple weekly? Some Apple pushing dork running down the latest BB release? You should pay a little more attention to where the articles come from….OR…heres an idea actually test drive the new BB’s! At least you’d be providing a fresh perspective instead of recycled drivel from years past – cause I’ve heard these exact comments before….funny its usually around the time a new BB product is scheduled for release…or is making news. Lovin’ my BBB! Dennycranium If my sales reflect anything- its that Rim is gaining ground. I sell smartphones throughout North America and my numbers show BB as the biggest seller. Feedback from my customers tell me they prefer the Rim product. I’ve had customers switch to apple or droid only to call me 3 months later asking to go back to Blackberry. Some people may feel that Rim needs a sexier or more “souped up” device in terms of processing but Rim understands the smartphone market. Its about creating a stream of revenue for them and for the carriers. Their sales results show this again and again. Anonymous Forbes should instate a new award category: Most Arrogant CEO of the decade. No points for guessing who the winner would be… http://twitter.com/wallner67 Phillip Wallner Steve Jobs? Michael Howie No need to be rude to Steve. http://twitter.com/ross_ritchey Ross Ritchey Obviously Steve Jobs. Hands down. No competition. http://twitter.com/rtorcato Richard Torcato Apple has the earnings to back it up. When will Rim stop doing the BOGO deals and show how many people actually want to buy their phones. dieter the response is lame… of course 7inches are far inferior to 9inches! especially when most of that real estate is clobbered up with flash commercials. you apple haters out there! try an ipad and you’d realize that life without flash is a blessing….i can’t wait to get rid of my bb and to receive mail on my ipad instead… Marcopolo Yeah bigger is not always better! Anonymous Looks like nobody cares what RIMM says! Only 4 response? Mr CEO, Let the ppl speak for your products. Also, I am not saying what SJ or Apple says is always correct but Apple is one of the top firms that profits through innovation and that is what matters in the end! What RIMM has done in the last few years that is innovative or ground breaking? The smoke and mirror tablet that was showcased some time back is nothing more that another Storm! Let’s see anyway!!! UrbanKhoja Whilst we all appreciate you taking the time to post, did you actually research first? You’re forgiven if you were simply too busy playing with your Lego and train set. Anyone old enough to go see a film without the need for an abundance of ID would know the benefits of both devices. Yes the iPhone is a great piece of technology, but it’s not perfect by any means. The BlackBerry isn’t perfect either, it’s based on a terribly outdated OS and lacks the build quality of Apple products. But all that aside, it’s evident the BlackBerry is a better device and thus easier to get things done. Which device caused big shenanigans in the middle east as the governments couldn’t intercept messages etc? Ergo which device will be one that will keep your data secure? The BlackBerry. It saddens me that Apple consumers don’t have the mental capacity to see beyond the Apple slogans and advertising, I feel RIM ought to set aside a charitable trust to help them recover and educate them in the ways of BlackBerry. Lastly, I would like to think that Her Magesty will duly see Mr Balsillie and reward him with some form of peerage for his comment above. Jim’ll fix it anyone? http://pulse.yahoo.com/_JIHUENU4IWPQHI7KHHISVRBJ2U Kimo Do you work for BB? If you do that is great, you’ll be the talk of the office for 5 minutes. If not, I believe your comments would certainly classify you as a “follower.” Hope you don’t live in a glass house because you are throwing stones. And, to degrade someone you do not know and try to masquerade your comments with gibberish in an “undergrad” manner unveils some input into your social character. Don’t get me wrong I believe you have the right to feel the way you do, just try not to sound academic then finish the document with “Jim’ll fix it.” And use words that are applicable please. No person would receive peerage over a comment and I believe her Majesty would be quite upset to be acknowledged by the wrong word. Also please look up the definition of shenanigans, it does not mean problems. I agree with the overall message, just not the way you represented the cause. http://digitaldaily.allthingsd.com/20101019/qotd-a-rim-shot-for-steve-jobs/ QOTD: A RIM Shot for Steve Jobs | John Paczkowski | Digital Daily | AllThingsD […] Jim Balsillie, co-CEO of Research In Motion, takes issue with Steve Jobs’s declaration that tablets with […] Gerry Daman Steve Jobs may have been a bit harsh, but until RIM actually ups their game to compete with real smartphones, people will continue to look elsewhere. Examples of disappointment from RIM in my eyes: 1. The Torch – the same screen from the disappointing Storm?! 2. The Playbook – no prices, no working demo, just specs on a sheet. Vaporware. Jackie Real devices were demoed at the Devcon in SFO last month. http://www.facebook.com/people/Dave-Thomson/663213839 Dave Thomson Oh really ? I must have missed the demo of the playbook then… Squeaky192 Exactly. There’s a reason Verizon gets a new Android device every 28 days and they fly off the shelves. http://twitter.com/wallner67 Phillip Wallner Errm, the same screen as the Storm? I’m pretty sure the Storm had that terrible “SurePress” screen, while the Torch has a capacitive multitouch screen. And just to clue you in, that’s how all devices start – as specs on a sheet. But you probably think Steve Jobs said “let there be iphone” and it magically appeared in his hand. Just because Apple doesn’t release any of their concepts before actually designing them doesn’t make them better (or worse). To the guy who made the point about new Android devices – could that possibly be because there are currently 25 companies who manufacture Android phones? RIM is in trouble, but don’t invent problems that aren’t there. Hayzus What are you talking about man? Same as Storm? Have you actually seen the phone? It’s not a big button anymore. And it’s a helluva lot faster than the iPhone. Edgard Yuo are right man, I am a BB user BB8100, BB8320, BB8900, BB8520, and now a BB9550. I was hoping that the next generation “Storm” will have a 1gzh processor and a Super Oled or Amodel Screen. I like BBs and how they help to stay organized and I love the multitask, ah yes the mail too. But now I thinking to triad an Adroid phone. Ah! the Playbook will be my first table, but I need to know, microsd slot?, capacity? price? (Please excuse my English is it is bad written, Edgard from Perú) Chris M The Torch doesn’t use the same screen as the Storm. Besides, if you’ve ever used a Storm 2 instead of just reading crap on the internet, you would know that its actually very good and easy to use. The Playbook isn’t vaporware just because people didn’t get to use it at the announcement. If that were the way it is, then the Torch would be vaporware too … Me The Torch has a COMPLETELY different screen than the Storm. The Torch has a capacitive screen with all the fingertip zooming, etc. that you expect. The Storm was a failed short sighted response to the iPhone – the Storm (and II) was simply a bad idea. The Torch may be the best cell phone available ATM. Logout Think different. I believe the meaning of that slogan changed. James RIM just please make a quality tablet that works, you even had the nerve to have a fake one on stage,http://www.singularityhacker.com/2010/09/blackberry-playbook-doesnt-exist.html Until then I’m not buying into the RIM “Distortion Field” that you know how to make an ideal tablet that just works. http://twitter.com/ross_ritchey Ross Ritchey The “just works” bull is part of the Apple distortion field, FYI. Apple computers haven’t just worked…. ever. They have some nice bells and whistles, but they don’t “just work” And the iPhone – doesn’t “just work” either. For the end user, the touch screen is unresponsive. For the developer, they are locked into a losing battle. For the network – they need to spend billions upgrading and still get flak for it. The only people the iPhone just works for is Apple and their Shareholders. rojo BOOM! I don’t own a blackberry device but this reply may change my mind. Mason Darren Blackberry is so far behind. All they have left is that corporate executive image they have fostered over the years, and those in need of their specific physical keyboard. Who wants to use or develop for a Blackberry browser? The OS will never catch up to Apple OR Android, all this is just damage control. Blackberry is old. Cl_ads Mason, why don’t you educate yourself and research which company has the largest business market…RIM or Apple? RIM owners aren’t generally the young, insecure types that need to buy the latest phone to be “in” and then to find out the product isn’t worth all the hype, and they are stuck with a poor product..I”m retired from telecommunications, I built the towers and sold the phones, and will take RIM everyday over Apple Mason Darren Then you are the perfect RIM customer…an antique. And sounding quite insecure at that. http://www.jeffgibbard.com/ JGibbard Your generalizations are fairly offensive. The fact that you are claiming that the iPhone is simply for young insecure people who need the latest phone is about as accurate as saying Blackberrys are only for old people that need a physical keyboard because they can’t comprehend a touch screen. The iPhone changed the entire paradigm of telecomm by disrupting the power that carries had in favor of the phone manufacturer. Before the iPhone “App Store” was gibberish. If you are so impressed about RIM’s business numbers in this debate, you are missing the point. Apple is shipping a ton of phones and has momentum. They are the 2nd most valuable company in the world. Their stock price is more than $250/per share higher. Thanks for building the towers. Elemento RIM owners aren’t generally the young, insecure types that need to buy the latest phone to be “in”… Did you guys ever wonder why RIM´s products launching never have the same hype Apple´s stuff do? Why we never see people waiting in line the whole night just to be the first one to buy the new iWhatever??? Easy one! It´s because BB users have to work, we have a life, we have families and “normal people´s” stuff like that! Hahaha! http://twitter.com/jr_plusplus Julian Russell Evidently RIM owners are the older, insecure types who don’t want to use their phone for anything except for e-mail. Chriskhall CI_ads, while, you make an excellent statement, I don’t think that your statement really counters what Mason said…what is it about Blackberry that is inherently better than IPhone and why do so many business users have them? I bought my own 9630 by the way…but I have so little ammunition when my friends pull out their Iphones and they are just so impressive… Catz1215 I agree with CI_ads. BB are not made to target the teen crowd but the business crowd and besides that, at least BB phones have longer battery times than those Android phones and I have both a BB and an Android. I prefer my BB for this bery reason and I can get apps on my BB just like on my Android without draining my battery in one hour. Jonas Right – a poor product with a larger screen, multi-touch, way better performance, 200k+ apps to choose from, a full-fledged modern browser and the best OS of the crop. Using Excel and Powerpoint all day long has really twisted your perception. Joji_vk Cl_ads, I love my Blackberry. But this is the age of Facebook and Twitter with 500million+ in a few years.(Did I say Yahoo is dead!! Or Google move aside). The customers with lot of cash to throw away and time to spend are the kiddos. Not the executives that work for companies that keep cutting costs (I have my same Blackberry for last 3 years). That is where Apple has hit Jackpot. That is why they could ship 14 million in a few years and it will keep rising where as Blackberry is almost at the same level for sometime. I remember reading Jim Balsillie saying that IPhone is just another new player in the crowded market. But now they are reached the same no of shipments as Blackberry. And RIM is slow to innovate. “Serve the masses and you will be with the classes” Vignesh CI_ads, Hi. I love Blackberry and have used all the models that they have ever released (except for the new slide one..!). Presently I use a BB 8520 and an Iphone. We can talk about the market share and how strong RIM is etc, but remember, BBs were in existence long before Iphone came to the market and Iphone marketshare is growing exponentially. RIM has to come up with more innovative solutions and better the browser experience. The quality and userfriendliness on an Iphone is absolutely amazing. Business users are more and more starting to move to Iphone, because once you experience the Iphone, there is really no looking back, be it rendering of images, speed and of course the apps. In my own circle of people, I have seen 4 diehard BB fans moving to Iphone. RIM has to be careful. Hopefully the Os 6 is better and may be more investment will go into enhancing the BB experience. Cheers. BerryMaster Behind? If you like to have devices with locks then go apple… who cares!!!! Guest You are clearly just a fan boy. Techie JP True words of a follower, you people are whats wrong with society in general, never strong enough to think for yourself and but always willing to follow blindly. I will always praise apple for their computers and most of their software, but never for their other products. I despise being locked in or not having full access to the things i buy, and while all manufacturers do it no one does it as severely as apple. Blackberry might be old but it has more experience and is the original smart-phone, if RIM is falling behind its because its giving people what they want and not what they see fit. me break away from the matrix sir… Edgard There are much more that just the web experience. I can work with mi BB but I consider the Iphone just for play music and videos, is really good for that. one ball jay Mason, you’re an idiot. Jenyc2020 Can’t beat blackberry’s real push e-mail.. I’ll take the old monocrome track wheel BB over iphone any day. And yes I had the Iphone for 1 year and was happy to get a simple do it all bb. http://ceejayoz.com/ ceejayoz iPhones have real push e-mail. Cook no. they actually don’t. http://ceejayoz.com/ ceejayoz What does it lack? Guest It doesn’t support IMAP IDLE, so it’s not true Push. http://ceejayoz.com/ ceejayoz I’ll adjust the question. What does it lack from an end-user’s perspective? http://ceejayoz.com/ ceejayoz What does it lack? Torsnow Lol, except you have to pay for a MobileMe account or use your GMail account to actually have access to push email. Neither is a better phone. One is better for a given user, another is better for another user. Why does everyone feel the need to cheer on their product manufacturer as if it was their sports team? Go habs go! http://twitter.com/kpoindexter Kevin Poindexter Jr You obviously don’t know RIMM’s market outside of the USA. Go to any other country and even the Youth of today have blackberry’s. Stop being so narrow minded and look beyond the scope of Apple and what they protray. T1 My son has had 2 iphones in the last year…yes 2. He has now switched to a BB like myself (2yrs running – no problems). The product is solid just like the company. The HYPE over iphone apps and android is just that HYPE. Really, how many dumb apps to you need on your phone…my BB Bold has apps for everything and its friggen solid unlikely the dainty iphones – that onscreen keybd is a joke nut hey if you like that sort of thing BB has the touch phone too. Kudos to Jim for telling it like it is.🙂 Richel Esguerra i strongly agree with you T1, iphone is just a toy for me. No wonder kids and young adolescent liked it so much. Every manufacturer always targets sales, apple will definitely smile cause back on their mind it pleased lot of young generation. If their target is to treat apple as a toy, so be it, it’s their marketing strategy. They should not compete with RIM’s blackberry cause their’s no way to compare with the true essense of smartphones. madcorgi Who wouldn’t want to develop for the Blackberry browser on the new devices? And the Playbook is going to kick but with both HTML5 and Flash support. Apple devices break easily. I have seen too many cracked iPhone screens and am kind of annoyed with Apple’s hurdles for the development community. And another win for Blackberry. I can actually type on my Storm2. Typing on the iPhone is incredibly annoying. Laudyemofio BB is far behind. Very true, but i only partially agree with you. BB needs to quit playing the catchup game and start being innovative. Bust some new moves people…lets achieve some uniqueness. for example BBM is a unique BB tool. Lets find something else for the average user to get excited about. With the OS, the lattest OS. 6 is actually encouraging and i hope RIM doesnt go back to sleep but rather keep pushing to surpass Andriod if possible. Saurabhhindu why we dont have dislike option here!!!!!!!!!!!! Eric M Smith I’m not sure what planet you are on, but it’s Apple that is NOW and will always be behind Blackberry. iPhones are for people who think Ketchup is the only condiment. No, it’s the only one CHILDREN will eat. People who go to work, go to work with Blackberry. Nick I only have one thing to say, You sir are clueless. And no I am not a blackberry fanboy infact I use Android phones which I would glady chuck into the bin along with any apple product, just because of empty promises by Apple and HTC alike. http://blackberrycool.com/ Matt Cameron Good reply Jim.

Ghostscript Wow! Steve Jobs just got slapped! LOL! davidavid Blackberry is a dated, dying platform. I think everyone understands that. Fwerner34 Your statement is borderline absurd. RIMM shipped 11.2 million BlackBerry smartphones during the May quarter. It also added 4.9 million subscribers during the same period, increasing the total subscriber base to 46 million. And the company estimates that it added some 5 million more subscribers in the August interim. So how can you say that “everyone understands” that Blackberry is a “dated, dying platform”? What everyone understands, however, is that you have no idea what you are talking about. Nattyranks All well and good Jim…But can you give us loyal Storm fans something we can be proud of???? Steven_perna Yes…we need a new and improved storm! I will stay with blackberry if you guys can get it right and get it going! Otherwise iphone for verizon here I come!! Laudyemofio Hey…am with u on that one. I think its absurd to say the least that we BB Storm customers hve been left out to dry. We purchased the storm even when it was being bashed from left right forwards and centre. Now u would thing the storm would have been the first to receive an OS.6 update. If RIM doesn’t do something about the Storm, i am definately gonna go Android cos i want nothing else but the Storm 2. I dont want the Torch cos i think the Storm2 with the same OS will be far better. Mitch There is a solution for Storm users. It’s called the iPhone. You should probably have taken a little bit more of all that”bash”-ing of the storm before you purchased. RIM has not been able to put together a solid OS in all of these years, so why does anyone expect that they are going to be able to create a decent touch screen experience? Please at least get a droid. “Loyalty” to a company that refuses to innovate is bad for everybody. Leave biases behind, go into a store (or multiple stores) try out different phones, and buy the one that is actually pleasurable to use. I used several blackberries for years, but the incredibly long full start-up/shutdown times, unusable internet, unintuitive controls, lack of worthwhile third party support, useless desktop client and generally unresponsive OS convinced me to switch. I even chose to leave Verizon. While Verizon definitely had better service and I had to spend 5 extra minutes to set up my email so it would push rather than fetch, I’ve had a tremendously improved experience. My phone just always works, when I want it to and how I want it to. In fact, it’s actually enjoyable just to use. Nothing like this was ever offered by the blackberry. http://caspan.com Caspan I love how people talk about the problems they use to have 3 years ago with phones.. Why don’t you try a Torch before bashing it? RIM is ever changing and to compare 3 years ago RIM to today’s RIM well just shows your knowledge of technology change. It’s like comparing a 4th generation iPhone to a 2nd generation one. They’re way different in reliability and applications. If you have an opinion make it informed or else you sound like the rest of the Kool-aid drinkers Steve Main steve@caspan.com Mitch I had this problem 3 months ago (literally) with my brand new blackberry that had just been replaced. In my 3 years with blackberry devices I had to replace my phones 5 times. Also, before I bought a different phone I tried out the latest blackberries (as of late June 2010), and they were no different. After 3 years of constant frustration with RIM and sub-par user experience I switched after significant research and my own testing. So please do not attempt to tell me that I’m not informed. People who disagree with you aren’t necessarily wrong. So i’m not comparing new iPhones to old blackberries. And even if I were, let’s say I compare the iPhone 4 to the first iteration: the same basic things are there — a great user interface, great web surfing, and it turned on in under 10 minutes. Now might the Blackberry Torch have completely resolved all of these issues one month after they drove me from RIM’s phones? It’s possible, but the bottom line is that my 2009 Blackberry was a much less pleasurable experience than the very first iPhone. Sorry if I didn’t wait another 3 years for Blackberry to get these basic issues in check. So while your argument establishes that the newest blackberry (taking what you say as true) brings it up to par with an iPhone, your point is irrelevant. Especially when I was responding to a RIM user, who like myself, got sick of having deal with a second-rate OS. Blackberry has its merits, but it needs to start innovating rather than having to play catch-up if it wants to be relevant. Also, you’re the one arguing blindly behind one brand, I’m saying there are better options. Enjoy RIM’s Kool-aid. Mitch There is a solution for Storm users. It’s called the iPhone.

Close share panel Apple has announced it is to set up home inside Battersea Power Station, taking over six floors in the central boiler house of the iconic building. It is an impressive structure from the outside, but if Apple wants to keep up with its rivals in terms of style and quirkiness on the inside, the company has its work cut out. Fellow tech giant Google has London offices in Soho. There are many unusual features, including a Routemaster bus in one of the rooms, and a chintzy area called the Granny Flat for workers to kick back and relax.

Software company Citrix has installed "genius benches" at its London headquarters - essentially higher and longer shared desks that come with stools, not chairs.

Impressive drone footage shows the site’s latest progress ahead of its end of year completion deadline. Construction work begun on Apple Campus 2 in 2014, after some delays. The subsequent development of the futuristic headquarters has been regularly showcased in drone videos. READ MORE: Drone gets peek at Apple’s new ‘spaceship’ campus (VIDEO) A newly-released aerial tour of the campus suggests the focus of work had turned to the finishing touches as fewer construction cranes are on site than before. Only a few sections of the “spaceship” remain unroofed as work continues to progress on the 100,000 square foot fitness center, the underground auditorium – which will be used for Apple’s product reveals and the R&D facility. The footage also show the underground tunnel which will be used to connect various parts of the campus and the parking garages which will be able to hold 11,000 vehicles. Meanwhile the installation of solar panels is now 40 percent complete Work has also shifted to landscaping as the first trees are planted. Eighty percent of the site which is a mile in circumference and one-third of a mile wide will be green space planted with fruit trees. The project reportedly costs in the region of $5 billion and is expected to be complete by the end of this year, with its some 13,000 employees supposed to move in at the start of 2017.

Image: Asus The Asus ZenBook UX305CA hails from a successful line of ZenBook Ultrabooks first launched in 2011. The UX305CA can be compared to Apple's MacBook (2016), partly because of its appearance -- the original ZenBooks had distinctive brushed aluminium patterns that aren't on the creamy white UX305CA -- and partly because it has the same Skylark-based Core m3-6Y30 and 8GB of RAM. The two laptops look and perform much alike, despite their noticeably different screen sizes. The ZenBook UX305CA I had on loan from Asus for a few months had a matte IPS screen with a resolution of 3200 x 1800 pixels and accurate color rendering. It beats the MacBook's screen resolution of 2304 x 1440 pixels, though the UX305CA obviously has a bigger screen: 13.3 vs 12 inches. Neither laptop has a touch-sensitive screen, so you have to rely on trackpad gestures. Having now spent several years with touch-screen laptops and tablets, I missed this feature a lot. The ZenBook UX305CA obviously beats Apple's MacBook in the number of ports. Where the MacBook has a single USB type C port, the UX305 has three USB 3.0 ports, a microHDMI port and -- great for photographers -- an SD card slot. Although it doesn't have a full-sized Ethernet port, Asus provides a USB-to-RJ45 cable. The UX305CA also has a higher-resolution 720p webcam than the MacBook's 480p FaceTime camera. The Core m chip design falls between the Atom and mainstream Core chips in terms of performance, but offers better battery life. I found it perfectly adequate for everyday tasks such as email, web browsing, and word processing with Microsoft Office. It also runs Adobe Lightroom, though I wouldn't recommend it for Adobe Creative Suite. In use All-in-all, the ZenBook UX305CA has a lot going for it, starting with the aluminium construction and very good screen. It's very thin, has lots of ports, and is reasonably priced. I thought the cream surface might pick up my inky fingerprints but it still looked like new after the occasional wipe down. But there's always a but, and this case, I have two. First, I didn't much like the keyboard, which isn't backlit and has tiny cursor keys. I admit to a preference for big clicky keys, and I've never found an Ultrabook keyboard I've actually liked. If you're used to flat Chiclet-style keyboards, you may well like it, but I've had better Asus keyboards. (As it happens, the Apple MacBook's keyboard is also worse than the MacBook Air and Pro keyboards. Being ultra-thin has its price.) On the other hand, the UX305CA's trackpad is both big and good, though not quite up to Apple standards. You won't end up packing a mouse. Second, the battery life could be better, I was getting about six hours of web-connected work out of the UX305CA with normal settings (ie not a power saving mode). This is somewhat short of the promised "up to 10 hours". It would be good for a full-spec Core chip, but I'd hoped for a little more from a Core m3 with a 44Whr battery. The otherwise similar MacBook, which only has a 41.4Whr battery, also claims "up to 10 hours of wireless web". It would be interesting to run the two side by side. I suspect that with the same screen brightness and my typical work patterns, the result would be roughly the same. At least modern power adaptors are small and light enough to carry around.... Crapware My UX305CA loaner arrived with quite a lot of bundled software, not all of it useless. The selection included Cyberlink Power Director 12 and Cyberlink Photo Director 5, WPS Office for Asus (otherwise known as Kingsoft Office) and Foxit Phantom PDF, Magix Music Maker Jam, Ice Power's Audio Wizard, WinRAR 5.40, Evernote 5, TeamViewer 10, and McAfee anti-virus software. It also included some Asus utilities such as Asus Smart Gesture, Asus USB Charger Plus, and WinFlash, which is a BIOS update utility. WPS Office starts in premium mode and the word processor was more than good enough to write this review. Cyberlink Photo Director 5 seems reasonable, and offers a paid upgrade to the current version. I didn't run any of the others. Benchmarks As usual, I ran the NovaBench benchmark on the UX305CA, because it's quick, easy, and free. It means you can test your current laptop for comparison purposes. The Core m3-6Y30 was unusual in producing inconsistent results for CPU speed, which presumably depends on its variable clock speed. In six tests, the CPU scores ranged from 285 to 321, but all of them were lower than the 346 scored by the same CPU in a Lenovo Yoga 700. On balance, I'm plumping for a NovaBench score of 562, because the UX305CA managed that in half the tests. This was made up of 180 points for the 8GB memory, 321 for the CPU, 44 for the HD515 graphics and 17 for the storage. This is significantly better than the 408 scored by an Asus T100HA with an Atom x5-Z8500, and significantly worse than the 766 scored by a Dell Latitude E5470 with a Core i5-6300U, both of which I've reviewed here. Conclusions The UX305CA is a good-looking, well-made silent (fanless) and cool-running 13.3-inch portable at a good price. You can get one with the Quad HD screen and 256GB of storage for less than £650 inc VAT, which compares with £1,049 ($1,299) for a similar 12-inch Apple MacBook. And, of course, you could save even more by shopping around for a UX305 with a lower-res screen and 128GB of storage, depending on your needs. The Core m3-6Y30 offers more performance than an Atom chip, and is fine for everyday use word processing and browsing. However, if it's your main machine, you'd be better off with a different model with a Core i5 or i7. There are plenty of those in the ZenBook range.

Usually folks are pretty charged up about a new iPhone, but this year's iPhone 7 release brought a controversy about Apple's decision to kill the headphone jack. I'm sure in a year or two, we'll all scratch our heads and realize it really wasn't that important after all. Apple has a history of deciding when we've had enough of technology like the floppy disk and optical drive. It's usually ahead of the pack on these decisions, and once the offending feature has been cut from one product, expect it to disappear from subsequent product releases. So, yes, the iPhone 7 does not have a headphone jack, but Apple is really trying to cushion the blow by including a set of earpods with a Lightning connector, and it's including a Lightning-to-3.5 mm headphone dongle. They both work well and sound just fine. The Lightning-to-headphone-jack adapter is $9 at the Apple store, and I think I'll be buying a few to keep on my favorite headphones. I'd rather keep them connected to my headphones than try to keep track of a loose dongle. The iPhone 7 and the 7 Plus look just like last year's 6S models, and it shows how smartphone design isn't exactly evolving, mostly because the current designs are just fine. Next year is the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and the rumor is that Apple is holding off on a full-blown redo of the phone's design for the anniversary model. We shall see. So if they don't really look different, what's new in the iPhone 7 models? I've been carrying around a Verizon iPhone 7 for the last week, and I've been impressed. Faster Everyone loves a faster phone, and every iPhone has been faster than the one before it, so the iPhone 7 is twice as fast as the iPhone 6, which is great if you have an iPhone 5 or 6. I carry a 6S, and the 7 certainly felt fast, but once you get to a certain point, speed increases are just not as noticeable. The 7 uses a CPU called the A10 Fusion, which is tuned to provide up to two hours more battery life over last year's models. More battery life is always good. Apple says the 7's graphics performance is three times as fast as the iPhone 6's. Better cameras The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have much better cameras than any previous iPhone, and the difference is startling. The iPhone 7 has a single-lens camera with an aperture of f/1.8, which is wide enough to bring out the best in low light. Photographing a darkened room with the 7 and a 6S shows just how much better the 7's new lens and sensor work together. The 7's lens allows 50 percent more light onto the sensor. The 7 uses a 12-megapixel sensor with optical image stabilization and a new feature, wide color capture, for more accurate colors. The camera's wide lens also helps videos look better. The 7 can shoot 4K video that looks fantastic. The selfie camera captures 7-megapixel images with wide color capture. Two is better than one Apple decided to reward buyers of the iPhone 7 Plus with a two-lens camera that rivals almost every point-and-shoot camera I've used. The wide-angle lens from the iPhone 7 is paired with a telephoto lens. They act as one when you're taking pictures. The iPhone 7 Plus lenses provide users a 2x optical zoom. The phone will automatically switch between the two lenses to capture the best image. The lenses also work together to provide up to a 10x digital zoom. During the phone's introduction, Apple showed off a shallow depth-of-field feature of the 7 Plus that blurs the background of portraits. The feature will be added soon with a software update. Both iPhone 7 models have a new quad-LED True Tone flash to help flash photos look more like natural light. Better display The iPhone 7 models have displays with wide color ranges to deliver more true-to-life colors. The 7 has a 4.7-inch LED with 3D Touch and a resolution of 1334 x 750 pixels, while the 7 Plus has a 5.5-inch 3D Touch display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. Apple says the displays are 25 percent brighter than last year's phones. On the display is the familiar home button with Touch ID sensor, but the home button on the 7 is not a mechanical button. It is a touch button that doesn't physically move, but when you touch it, you'll feel a small vibration that feels like you're pushing a button. Audio Apple beefed up the speaker system on the iPhone 7 models, hoping we'll use them more for playing our music out loud. The sound system has been overhauled to be twice as loud as the 6S'. There are now two speakers -- one in the bottom of the phone near the Lightning port and one on the front where you'd put your ear for a phone call. The music I played through the 7 was loud enough, but such small speakers are not going to knock your socks off. The iPhone does continue to have an outstanding speakerphone. Water resistance Last year several customers made videos showing customers dunking their iPhone 6S phones. The phones on the videos still worked, but I'm sure the moisture sensors were tripped and the warranty voided. This year Apple is touting the water resistance of the iPhone 7 models. The phones are IP67 rated, which means they are dustproof and water-resistant, capable of surviving a dunk of up to 3 feet for up to 30 minutes. So your iPhone 7 and 7 Plus can survive an accidental dip in the pool, but don't take it swimming. LTE improvements Apple has upgraded the cellular radios in the iPhone 7s. They now can transfer data at 450 megabits per second, which is three times as fast as the iPhone 6 and twice as fast as the 6S. They've included support for 25 LTE bands and even opened up the phone app to allow third-party calling apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and others to be answered like a regular phone call. Pricing and storage The iPhone 7 comes in three configurations -- 32-gigabyte for $649, 128GB for $749 and 256GB for $849. The 7 Plus has the same storage options for $769, $869 and $969. The phones come in silver, gold, rose gold and two new black phones -- black (a matte black) and jet black (a shiny black). Space gray has been retired. The iPhone 7 models are available wherever you buy your phones, including all four major carriers and major retailers as well as Apple stores. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models are in short supply. Apple should have better inventory in a few weeks. Your best bet might be to order online from Apple. Conclusions After a year of carrying my iPhone 6S, the iPhone 7 felt like a well-worn shoe. I was comfortable from the beginning. I was completely impressed by the new camera system. From the first photo, I was quite aware of how much better the 7 handled low light. As a former news photographer, I'm thrilled with how Apple is advancing the cameras in the iPhone. I didn't find the lack of a headphone jack to be troublesome, but I can see where some might be upset. Better battery life and water resistance are welcome additions. I'd really like a dual-lens camera. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are great upgrades if you have an iPhone 6 or 5, but I'm an iPhone 6S owner who is going to wait. iPhone 7 Pros: Game-changing camera, more storage, water resistance Cons: That elusive headphone jack\ Bottom line: Best iPhone yet In this Collection...

With ten years of the iPhone closing in, many doubters thought Apple might be getting a little “boring.” While the iPhone 7’s design looks eerily similar to its two predecessors, there are enough changes here that make it the best iPhone to date. When I preordered the iPhone 7 (matte black), I decided to experiment a little by going back to the iPhone 5s from my iPhone 6s. I used it for a couple of days and came to a few conclusions. While I like the one handed use and form factor, the 4-inch screen was too small for my liking. I really missed the 4.7-inch screen real estate used for reading and watching videos so when I got my iPhone 7 a week later, I knew it was the perfect size phone for me. Headphone Jack Photo by Getty Images/Spencer Platt Let’s cut straight to the point, the lack of headphone jack will be a deal breaker for some people. While Apple isn’t the first company to remove the headphone jack from the mobile phone, they are getting pretty much all of the flack for doing so. With the headphone jack gone, Apple was able to move some components around and incorporate new things such as Optical Image Stabilization, stereo speaker, bigger battery, and even a second camera on the iPhone 7 Plus. Apple has removed many things in the past, most notably the optical and floppy drive, FireWire, and ethernet ports, and often to much criticism. But as time often shows, people move on and forget about the things Apple took away from their devices. One of the most common problems iPhone 7 users have is that they can’t listen to music and charge their phone at the same time since the EarPods/adapter utilized the lightning port. To get around this, Belkin has a dongle ($39.99) that will let you do this or use Apple’s Lightning Dock ($49). Not ideal—and it’s still a problem—but there is a way around this. I’ve had this phone for a week now and to be honest, I haven’t missed the headphone all that much at all. Apple did it right by including lightning EarPods and a lightning to 3.5mm adapter for your existing headphones. The only real inconvenience I came across is that while using the lightning EarPods, I couldn’t use them with my MacBook Pro since it didn’t have a lightning port. The only workaround was to carry around 3.5mm EarPods (or your choice of headphones) and use the included adapter. Again—not ideal. But looking ahead a few years, this is something that will go away as more and more products ditch the analogue audio jack. Design A quick glance will tell you that the iPhone 7’s design doesn’t look all that different from the previous two iterations. While the dimensions are the same, your old iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s cases won’t fit because the camera lens are larger so it won’t align with the cutouts on previous cases. The antenna lines have been moved to the top and bottom of the phone so it looks a bit more hidden and streamlined. However, you can barely notice it especially on the matte black and jet black versions. Despite the disappointment that we’ll have to wait until next year to get a true iPhone redesign, it’s hard to fault Apple when its device looks this good and feels this good in the hand. The only real complaint here is with the “Jet Black” version, which has a glossy finish across the case and is a serious fingerprint magnet. As much as we are all excited for what Apple does with the 10th anniversary iPhone next year, you most likely won’t hear complaints from the average consumer, who all love their iPhones anyways. Hardware The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus both have the A10 Fusion chip that, according to speed tests, is faster even than the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Even though the iPhone 6s was fast already, the iPhone 7 is noticeably faster especially when launching apps like Snapchat where you might be trying to capture a moment quickly. The chip has four cores—two for high performance and two for efficiency saving you precious battery life. Speaking of battery life, Apple says the new iPhone 7 has one to two extra hours of battery but in my weeklong testing, it was closer to the one hour mark, which is still pretty crucial. The display shows a wider range of colors to support the upgraded cameras but still has a 1334 × 750 pixel resolution, which is low compared to competitors like the Samsung Galaxy S7 (2560 × 1440 pixels). The wider color gamut looks better and increases the brightness by 25%. The Taptic Engine exudes more haptic feedback throughout iOS, which I like a lot, when doing things like ticking an option on/off, pull down to refresh in some apps, scrolling through items like setting an alarm, etc. Apple is also including the APU for developers to take advantage of the Taptic Engine so they can incorporate taptic feedback in games and other apps. Another new feature of the iPhone 7 are the speakers. The speakers are much louder now with an additional speaker on top, which utilizes the earpiece you use for phone calls. It is two times louder than the ones on the iPhone 6s and like the speakers on the iPad Pro, it senses when the phone is being viewed in landscape mode and adjusts the sound output accordingly. While playing music and podcasts through the speakers, the sound is noticeably louder, but it does not distort it in any way. Home Button Aside from the headphone jack, the new Home button was another talking point on the new iPhones. It is now a solid state button so it is essentially a stationary piece of glass and is no longer mechanical so it doesn’t click like its older counterparts. This is to help improve water resistance because the home button is essentially not a button anymore and is less prone to break down and get flimsy over time. The Taptic Engine vibrates every time you “press” on the button to give you feedback (you can adjust the settings to light, medium and firm). It kind of reminds me of the faux buttons on my old Nexus One screen where the buttons came up on the screen only when needed and it vibrated every time I pushed them. This along with the Raise to Wake feature, I believe Apple will remove the home button all together in the near future. Water Resistance One feature that is much welcomed to the new iPhone is water resistance. Apple touts the new iPhone 7 has a IP67 rating, which means it is dust resistance and will not breakdown to a depth of one meter for more than 30 minutes. So you can say goodbye to the days of putting your soaked iPhone in a bag of rice hoping it will turn on again the next day. While it is water resistant, I would not recommend taking it for a swim even in the shallow end and DO NOT expose it to salt water because it will start to eat away at the components. Also note that Apple will not cover any iPhones that are water damaged even if you have AppleCare and wait up to five hours before charging a wet iPhone. However, you don’t have to worry about taking your phone out in the rain, spilling a little water on it while at a restaurant, or even dropping it in the toilet. For this review, I ran some water over it in a sink and even took it in the shower with me to listen to a podcast and in both instances, it came out fine. Camera Both cameras on the iPhone 7 have been upgraded from the iPhone 6s. The rear camera is now a 12 megapixel camera with a larger f/1.8 aperture letting in more light. The front-facing camera is now a 7-megapixel camera, which is a much needed improvement considering how selfies are a huge thing nowadays. Along with that, it has a six element lens allowing it to capture a wider color range for more vibrant and detailed pictures and the smaller iPhone has optical image stabilization for still pictures and videos whereas it was reserved only for the larger iPhone 6s Plus in the past. The True Tone flash has also been updated to four LEDs resulting in a 50% brighter and farther reaching flash. And yes, if you’ve seen the pictures, the “camera bump” is still there and it’s even bigger than last year’s model but Apple has built it into the bezel so it is more natural looking. When taking pictures especially night shots, more details show up than ever before. Lastly, you also get a bokeh effect, built into the Camera app, as shown above. Just select “Portrait” and you’ll see the camera grab onto a close subjective and blur the background. And if you are lucky enough to get your hands on the iPhone 7 Plus, the dual cameras make it a dream for amateur (and even professional) photographers since it is the camera that people have with them at all times. With the 7 Plus, you get an optical zoom, which means you’ll finally get a zoom that isn’t terribly blurry. But even with just the 7, you’re still getting a significant camera update that pushes the iPhone back into that coveted number one spot for best smartphone camera. The Galaxy Note 7 and Galaxy S7 are still great cameras, but Apple’s newest batches of cameras are hard to beat, especially in lowlight situations. Software The design of the phone might not feel all that different, but iOS 10 makes some substantial changes to how your phone feels and functions. There aren’t many iPhone-specific features, but that doesn’t mean the overall smartphone experience still isn’t one of the very best you can get. There are a ton of new features—and we won’t get into all of them right now—but most of the basic apps got updates, including Maps, Photos, and Apple Music. Control Center also got an update, along with notifications and how you interact with them. Apple still hasn’t completely figured out notifications, but with each update they get better and better. The lock screen is where you’ll notice more significant changes though. iOS now has widgets from third party apps, as well as shortcuts to your most used apps. It’s all done in iOS’s attractive clean style and Apple has done a good job of not letting all the information make your phone look to cluttered. The biggest change though is to iMessage, which has gone from standard text messaging app to a Facebook Messenger competitor. There are all sorts of new ways to communicate, most of which are silly and fun. But helpful features like support for rich links and playable YouTube videos (without leaving the app), actually make iMessage feel like a legitimate messaging app. Configurations Photo by Getty Images/Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno/Stringer The 16GB iPhone is now gone from existence! But I have some bad news for you, 32GB is the new 16GB. I opted for the 32GB version and while i have about 60 songs saved offline on Apple Music, no movies, most of my photos and videos backed up on Google Photos, I was left with about 8GB of free space. I tend to shoot a lot of video and if I wanted to shoot 4K, I wouldn’t have that much space to do so. With people taking more pictures and videos, I can see why even the 32GB model would be a problem with a lot of people. In fact, I am regretting not shelling out an extra $100 for the 128GB version. On a side note, one solution that I have been talking about for a while is that we need a way to clear caches from apps like Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter where pictures and videos may take up more than a gig of space especially if you are following a lot of people and/or using the apps a lot. While the increase in storage doesn’t have an effect for the iPhone 7 (32GB; $649, 128GB; $749, 256GB; $849), there is a $20 increase for each model of the iPhone 7 Plus ($769, $869, $969). Verdict Like Apple says, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are the best iPhones out there right now. I was skeptical about the headphone jack at first and was dissuaded from even pre-ordering at first but I went through with it and am very glad I did so. Aside from the speed and performance, the camera upgrade especially the optical image stabilization was a huge welcome since it was reserved for the Plus models last year. I can see this being a huge hidden factor for the average user because you don’t know how great it is until you re-watch the footage and see how smooth it is. I will gladly give up the headphone jack in exchange for a better camera, battery life, and performance and I’m sure most iPhone 7 users will agree. If the headphone jack is that important to you, then you’re in luck because the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are still great phones. There is a wide range of iPhones out there that will suit everyone’s needs, that’s why Apple released the iPhone SE. There were a group of consumers who still loved the smaller 4-inch screen so instead of forcing them to get larger iPhones, they updated it so those people could enjoy better performance, cameras, etc. If you have a 6s and are on the fence, don’t do it unless you really want the new camera features. If it doesn’t really matter, hold on to it. If you have a 6 or older and don’t care about the headphone jack, then upgrade because you’ll notice the improvements right away. The iPhone 7 probably won’t convince Android users to switch over, but it will surely please the hordes of people who love their iPhones.

A disgruntled customer in France entered an Apple Store in Dijon yesterday and calmly smashed devices in front of Apple staff and customers. At least 10 iPhones were smashed with a boule metal ball (used in a French bowls game), alongside a MacBook Air. French media reports suggest the angry man, who actually calmly smashed devices, was complaining about his consumer rights and a refund. The man appears to have been detained outside the store, and there are no reports of injuries apart from the broken Apple equipment. Hopefully the angry man purchased multiple AppleCare protection plans, otherwise that's going to be a costly bill for thousands of dollars of property damage. iPhone 7 and 7 Plus review Via: 9to5Mac Source: Le Bien Public Next Up In Circuit Breaker Researchers send text message using chemicals This Panasonic megaphone automatically translates commands into multiple languages Amazon is rolling out Alexa-only shopping deals Apple launches repair program for iPhone 6 Plus ‘touch disease’ flaw Google's new Pixel phone case will put the day's news where you can't avoid it Star Wars drones are coming to the US just in time for the holiday toy hunger games Now Trending Microsoft Surface Studio review: a beautiful invader of Apple's base Sand's End Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon suggests having too many Asian tech CEOs undermines ‘civic society’ This Article has a component height of 6.

By Tess Koman Sep 30, 2016 A man was arrested after angrily smashing thousands of dollars' worth of Apple products in a Dijon, France, Apple store, Fortune reports. In a series of videos, he can be heard yelling about a reimbursement he didn’t receive, though it’s unclear why he believes he deserved one. According to France Bleu, the man, who is reportedly 30 years old but has not yet been identified, used a petanque ball (a small steel ball used in the French game of boules) to smash the products — the ball can be seen in his hand as he methodically goes through the store crushing at least 10 screens. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below YouTube “These are my [customer] rights,” he says calmly in French as he begins smashing devices. He tells everyone in the store it’s their right to do the same and gives one person filming a thumbs up. Because Apple didn’t reimburse him (again, it’s unclear what for), “this is what happens.” After what seems like forever, he's greeted by security on the way out of the store. Apple apologized and revoked its latest iOS upgrade as a way of settling the issue, but the man is still reportedly pissed. Kidding — Apple has yet to comment and charges are reportedly being considered. Follow Tess on Twitter.

By Corazon Victorino On 09/30/16 AT 6:01 PM Close As a global company, nothing is stopping Apple from bringing its products to other countries. But as it heads to South Korea to bring to the country its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets, should Samsung really be worried? On Friday, Cult of Mac found out that three South Korean mobile providers have confirmed that they are to start selling the new iPhones this October, specifically starting Oct. 21, in the Galaxy Note 7 maker’s home country.  Local reports from the Asian country state that Apple Korea’s homepage and the three providers are going to release the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus once they get the Cupertino giant’s final approval. This is definitely bad timing for Samsung, since it is still in the throes of its global recall that is said to cost $1 billion as it replaces all 2.5 million units that were shipped since it officially released the Galaxy Note 5 successor, as previously reported by Bloomberg.  Related Stories China Accuses Samsung Of Recall ‘Discrimination’ Samsung Admits It Has ‘Exploding’ Washing Machines Samsung Acquires License For Hydrophobic Smartphone Display Another Galaxy Note 7 Explodes In New Incident Report Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Replacement Still Problematic? Cult of Mac says this is also not looking great for the South Korea giant because the younger generation of smartphone users were found to prefer Apple’s iPhones over Samsung’s handsets based on a recent poll.  Previously, Apple’s iPhone 6 held around 33 percent of the South Korean market share when it was at the peak of its popularity. Currently, Apple’s market share is at around 20 percent. With the arrival of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the figure is expected to go higher, which should make Samsung nervous at this point, according to Patently Apple.  Analysts claim that 2017 isn’t looking that great for Samsung either, since cheap Android smartphones from its competitors are also penetrating its home country. Korea Economic Research Institute senior researcher Chung Hei-sang recently said, "The law to restrict phone subsidies, which makes it difficult for Samsung and LG difficult to cut costs, has opened more door for foreign low-budget phones to enter the local market." To top it all off, there’s this Apple’s plan to put up its first Apple retail store possibly just across the street where Samsung’s headquarters is situated in South Korea’s capital city, Seoul.   Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Screenshots are disabled due to the fact that the screenshot-taking shortcut overlaps functionality used by the Workout app. In watchOS 3, it’s possible to stop and start in-progress workouts by pressing the Digital Crown and Side button simultaneously. It just so happens that this is the exact same gesture used to take Apple Watch screenshots. To enable screenshots on your Apple Watch running watchOS 3, simply do the following: Step 1: Launch the Watch app on your paired iPhone. Step 2: On the My Watch tab go to General and turn on the Enable Screenshots switch. Once enabled, you can now take screenshots by pressing the Digital Crown and Side button at the same time. Your Apple Watch screenshots are saved directly to the iPhone Camera Roll for easy retrieval. Video walkthrough Want more videos? Subscribe to 9to5Mac’s YouTube channel How to make Apple Watch screenshots look better Apple Watch screenshots aren’t the most beautiful looking things in the world by default, but there are ways to make these screenshots look better. LongScreen ($2.99 on App Store) has long been my go-to app of choice for spiffying up iPhone and iPad screenshots, and the same principle applies to Apple Watch screenshots. This app is absolutely fundamental to my workflow, and comes with a sterling recommendation. Seriously, just buy LongScreen and thank me later. Step 1: Launch LongScreen. Step 2: Tap the Filter button in the upper left-hand corner and select your Apple Watch type (38 or 42mm). Step 3: Select one or more Apple Watch screenshots. These screenshots can be grouped vertically or horizontally using the options at the top of the screen. Step 4: Tap the Merge button in the upper right-hand corner Step 5: Tap the magic wand button at the bottom of the screen, and enable the Rounded corner switch. Alternatively, you can select the Space Grey or Silver Apple Watch models for added flair. Step 6: Tap the Share button in the bottom left-hand corner to save or export your screenshot.

Crunch Network Apple is screwing up HomeKit; here’s how they can fix it Posted Sep 30, 2016 by Daniel Conrad 0 SHARES Next Story Nutanix up 131% on first day of trading Daniel Conrad Crunch Network Contributor Daniel is co-founder of Beep Networks, and was an early product manager on Google's Android and Access teams. More posts by this contributor: Three reasons carriers are building new cell networks for the Internet of Things How to join the network The real magic of the Internet of Things happens when devices work together. It will be magic when Siri, on your iPhone, can adjust your thermostat or confirm that you locked the back door; when your door lock can tell your sound system you’re home and you don’t even have to push a button to start the music. That’s not the reality we live in today, because most devices can’t talk to each other. Without a common language, this magic can’t happen. Apple (through HomeKit) and Google (through Works with Nest) have introduced programs to enable this type of communication. As owners of the two dominant mobile phone platforms, they are both well-positioned to set standards for in-home device communication. And yet, Works with Nest adoption is light years ahead of HomeKit. Looking at the numbers: Apple’s website currently boasts HomeKit-compatible devices from 7 manufacturers. The Works with Nest page shows 95. Nest connects to washing machines, pet feeders and baby monitors. HomeKit works with Philips lights and not much else. Apple’s been making devices for a long time. They’re in a lot more homes than Nest, and their retail stores should give them a tremendous advantage in attracting partners. Also, connecting to iPhone should be easy. So why does Nest have an order of magnitude more device partners? Hardware is slow, software is fast The fundamental difference in approach is one of hardware versus software. Apple requires hardware integration. Nest does integrations in the cloud. Our team built one of the first devices that connected to Nest. The integration and certification test process took one engineer a few days to complete. Nearly everything happens in the cloud, not on the user’s local Wi-Fi network. It didn’t hurt that we were well-supported by the team at Nest, or that their documentation is publicly available and excellent. Or that Firebase is awesome. (Google actually acquired Firebase — maybe just to make Works With Nest even better?) Apple does things totally differently. You have to apply for access to the MFi developer program to even look at the documentation for HomeKit hardware integration. Seriously, you have to wait weeks for approval just to read the HomeKit device requirements. Apple requires an authentication chip be added to your hardware that you can only buy from them. Existing products can not be connected to HomeKit without this change to their electrical design. It’s like in a world with email, they’re asking us to use a fax machine. You also have to build your product with one of their approved manufacturers. If your current manufacturer is not on the list, you must move your line to a new factory. You have to test and certify your device in one of Apple’s approved labs. I understand there are only a few of them  —  a friend here in San Francisco had to send his devices to the U.K. for testing. I’ve even heard that Apple reviews your packaging to make sure the colors don’t clash with their branding schemes. I’m honestly choosing not to believe that that’s true —  but maybe it is. Integrations belong in the cloud Most importantly, Apple requires much of the device-to-device integration to happen on the local Wi-Fi network  —  rather than talk to servers, your device talks to an iPhone through the local Wi-Fi network, and the iPhone talks to the other devices. That means that HomeKit logic must be baked into the firmware on the device itself, and any future modifications or extensions of the system mean updating that firmware. This is not how it’s supposed to work in the days of the internet. Devices should be connected to the cloud. In the cloud, servers can talk to each other. We can fix bugs without risky over-the-air firmware updates. To be clear, there is a place for non-cloud connections between devices. We used to ship a music synchronization device, and the low-latency communications we needed required local communication. Nest offers the Weave platform for local communication between devices, too. Bluetooth devices can’t connect to a Wi-Fi access point, so they need to communicate with a phone directly. But there’s no reason to require integration at the device level when you can do it in the cloud. This is nuts It’s strange to me that Apple can get this so wrong. It’s like in a world with email, they’re asking us to use a fax machine. Related Articles Apple works to fit the smart home under a single roof Why Apple wants to be the smart home's nerve center Here's How To Use Siri Commands On iOS Devices With HomeKit Accessories My first thought is that they might want to limit the quantity of devices to improve the average quality. If they make it expensive enough, maybe only the best devices will get through. The Amazon reviews on First Alert’s HomeKit smoke detector suggest otherwise. In today’s day and age it’s often not the rich companies building the best devices. Maybe it’s just that Apple fundamentally still thinks like a hardware company. That is, when they think of integrations, they instinctively begin with lists of hardware requirements. Whatever their goal, the end result is that HomeKit is going to fail unless Apple changes its approach. I hope they do. God knows Nest could use a healthy competitor. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase HomeKit Description HomeKit is a framework in iOS 8 for communicating with and controlling connected accessories in a user’s home.

(Photo: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images) The iPad Air 3 is rumored to launch in the first quarter of 2017. Reports have hinted that the upcoming Apple tablet will be an affordable device with a high-resolution display, updated Bluetooth and Lightning ports. The iPad Mini 5 is also slated to arrive next year. Apple is said to lower the prices of the iPad Air 3 to expand Apple's budget-friendly options, The Reporter Times reported. Rumor has it that the lower price tag is due to the decrease in sales in the table market. Additionally, the iPad Air 3 will reportedly roll out with a price range of $390 to $590. However, it is expected that if the release date is postponed to the end of next year, then the cost of the device may be further reduced. The iPad 3 is rumored to have a 9.7 inch screen with 2,048 x 1,536 screen resolution. The device is slated to be sleeker and more durable than previous installments and will include a fingerprint scanner, Bluetooth 4.2 as well as Lightning ports. The table is also rumored to run on the upgraded A9 chipset that will provide users with faster device performance and power efficiency. The new tablet will include a 4GB RAM with either 64 GB, 128 GB, or 256 GB internal storage. The device will have a 12MP camera which is higher than the iPad Air 2's and the iPad Pro's 8MP snapper. The device is rumored to feature 3D Touch Screen like the iPhone 6S Plus. Likewise, the iPad Mini may also roll out without a 3.5mm headphone jack for that wireless audio experience. The iPad Air 3 and the iPad Mini 5 are the two Apple devices slated for next year. The former is expected to roll out with color option Gold, Silver, Space Gray and possibly Rose Gold, PC Advisor reported. In other news, the iPad Mini 5 had not been revealed in the Apple event last Sept. 7. Rumor has it that the device will have to wait out until the first quarter of 2017 possibly in March. However, it is said that the device will not be introduced as the iPad Mini 5 but a mini version of the iPad Pro to be called an iPad Pro Mini 5.   TagsiPad Air 3, iPad Air 3 news, iPad Air 3 update, iPad Air 3 specs, iPad Air 3 features, iPad Air 3 price, iPad Air 3 release date, iPad Air 3 rumors Related Articles Samsung Galaxy A7 Release Date, News & Update: 1st-Ever Device To Sport 8MP+ Fro ...

One had just started its journey to ubiquity, whereas the other had already been on that road for decades. But, perhaps even under your nose, Apple's phone has all but morphed the form and function of its computers over that same nine years. You might be surprised to see just how much of what's in your iPhone has been brought to the Mac. Today, it'd be impossible to imagine what the Mac would look like without the iPhone, so here's how the Mac and iPhone became best buds over the past nine years. This story starts with a Store Not long after release, the iPhone's popularity absolutely exploded, it became the next major device of Apple's ecosystem for millions since the iPod. Once the App Store launched on iPhone in 2008, that snowball turned into an avalanche. Naturally, Apple realized the insane revenue potential in its creation. Regardless, it took three years for the firm to bring its software-selling strategy to the Mac in early 2011, in the middle of Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard's life span. While the Mac App Store hasn't necessarily panned out in the same, meteoric way the iPhone version has, it clearly inspired Apple to see what else about the iPhone could improve OS X. The literal and figurative Launchpad In the summer of 2011, Apple launched OS X 10.7 Lion, and with it the first spate of iPhone-inspired features that would truly transform how the operating system looks and works in relation to the iPhone. The most notable of which was the Launchpad, a new means of accessing all your installed apps. Either pressing the function key on MacBooks released post-Lion or pinching four fingers together on the touchpad summons a very familiar arrangement of apps for anyone that's used an iPad in landscape mode. From there, simply clicking on any app will launch it, and you can even rearrange your apps here and create folders – just like you can on iOS. While this editor in particular hasn't used the feature much, being a purist, it's easy to see folks coming into the Apple world via the iPhone using the feature heavily. That probably explains why it hasn't gone anywhere in five years. FaceTime forever fuses the iPhone and Mac For years prior to OS X Lion, Mac users communicated with one another both via text and video over a tool known as iChat. Naturally, seeing the vast adoption of FaceTime video chat on the iPhone and iPad, Apple brought the feature to the Mac, so that all three devices could video chat natively together. However, FaceTime didn't outright replace iChat just yet – it wasn't until OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion in the summer of 2012 that the tool was swapped out for an app simply called Messages. Now, users could chat via instant message, video and even with their iPhone-toting friends via iMessage in a single app. This release of OS X also saw a slew of iOS-inspired changes and updates. A Mac version of the iPhone's Notification Center appeared with this upgrade, as did versions of Reminders, Notes and Game Center – all of which started on iPhone and now synced with those versions via your Apple ID. At this point, Apple's Mac interface strategy was clear: give the Mac the same basic functions and tools as the iPhone, but in such a way that's useful to Mac users and connects them back to their smartphones wherever possible. But, that ethos would too evolve in due time. Mavericks begins to morph the UI For a long time, the Mac interface was both adored and abhorred for its skeuomorphic approach to design, i.e. icons and design elements that look like their real-world counterparts. For instance, the Calendar app looked like an actual calendar on your Mac screen, complete with stitching and leather textures. This editor in particular had always been quite fond of it, but it was with 2013's OS X Mavericks that Apple decided it was time to bring the Mac interface's design identity closer to that of its iOS products. The Calendar app lost its stitching and the Notes app lost its paper-like texture – and that's just for starters. Apple's very own, iPhone-born Maps app made it over to the Mac with this release as well as iBooks, with all of the syncing and iOS-style trappings (with widened Mac functionality) that users had come to expect by that point. And today, the two are inseparable Releases following Mavericks, namely OS X 10.10 Yosemite of 2014, saw these design identity tweaks turn into a full-blown overhaul coinciding with a similar shift on iOS. The charming if divisive skeuomorphs were no more, and Apple bolstered that visual continuity with functional continuity in an eponymous suite of tools. Continuity made the union of iPhone and Mac even stronger, allowing users to answer calls coming in from their iPhone on their Mac device, more readily use the iPhone as a Wi-Fi hotspot as well as take content from Apple's iWork apps on iOS and finish working on it in their OS X counterparts. This release also marked the merging of yet another iPhone app with an OS X version in iOS's Photos app replacing the Mac's storied iPhoto app, and marrying the two together with a shared library of photos over iCloud. By the time OS X 10.11 El Capitan arrived just last year in 2015, if you owned both an iPhone and a Mac, you were working in both iOS and OS X simultaneously without even knowing it. And today, with a (truncated) return in name to macOS Sierra, Apple has finally forges the last missing link between the iPhone and the Mac: Siri. But, in the spirit of all of the Mac's iPhone-inspired upgrades, Siri behaves in ways on Mac that it doesn't on iPhone. For instance, Siri on Mac can retrieve your system's files based on natural search queries – it can't do that on iPhone. Another example is its ability to store your results in the Mac's version of the Notification Center for later retrieval or click and drag results into other documents. For Pete's sake, you can now even copy a piece of text or a photo on your iPhone and paste it on a nearby Mac with the Universal Clipboard feature. See what we mean about working on two operating systems without even knowing it? Since the iPhone launched back in 2007, it has influenced the development of the Mac in almost every way – to the point where it's impossible to imagine what the Mac would be like had the iPhone never been released. How else will the iPhone continue to inspire the Mac? That's a question only Apple knows the answer to in truth, but if we could suggest something: blow that Universal Clipboard wide open.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE One of the biggest Turkish film festivals outside Turkey, the Frankfurt Turkish Films Festival, kicks off for the 16th time with its enlarged program Organized for the 16th time in Germany's city of Frankfurt, the Golden Apple Turkish Films Festival kicked off with an opening ceremony last night. The festival, which was supported by Turkey's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Culture and Tourism Ministry, Turkey's Embassy to Frankfurt, Municipality of Frankfurt, Turkish Airlines and the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), attracted nearly 6,000 audiences last year. The 16th edition of the Turkish Films Festival in Frankfurt will continue until Oct. 5. This year, the 16th Frankfurt Turkish Films Festival takes place with its theme "The World of Labor" and will host screenings of roughly 50 feature-length, short and documentary films. One of the many objectives of the festival is to organize panel and Q & A sessions within the frames of the films that are featured in the festival program to bring the locals of the festival into the spotlight with the Turkish filmmakers and create the necessary environment to establish new friendships and exchange cultures, triggering communities to live together peacefully. This year's Golden Apple Frankfurt Turkish Film Festival Honorary Awards will be presented to Güngör Bayrak, Murat Soydan and Talat Bulut. On the other hand, the Audience Award, which is presented to the most watched film of the year, will be granted to "Çinçin Bağları" (Çinçin Vineyard), directed by Emre Budak. Veteran Turkish actor Zeki Alasya, who passed away in 2015, will be commemorated with the Loyalty Award. As part of the 16th Golden Apple Frankfurt Turkish Films Festival, the "Feature Film Competition," "Short Film Competition," "Best Script," "Best Music," "Best Actress," "Best Actor," "Best Director of Cinematography" and "Turkish Films from the View of German Film Makers" competition will be held. The "Short Film Competition" jury is composed of Professor Selma Köksal Çekiç, Arda Erdikmen, Cem Başeskioğlu, Fırat Sayıcı, Gamze İlkılınç and Mehmet Erduğan and the "Feature-length Film Festival," which is chaired by Yüksel Yalova, is composed of Hale Soygazi, İsmail Güneş, Özgür Şeyben, Oya Doğan, Banu Bozdemir and Nurdan Sever. Speaking to the press, Hüseyin Sıtkı, the Festival chair, said the festival only hosted the guests who were related to the featured films during the first years; however, now, the festival organizes screenings in three different categories. In the first category, the festival screens the feature-length, short and documentary films from Turkey. Short films and documentaries by Turkish-decedent German filmmakers such as Fatih Akın and Ayşe Polat are screened in the second category, while films that are registered in the European Films Forum are screened in the third category. Furthermore, five European films focusing on labor are featured in the festival program. As a part of the festival, exhibitions, panel sessions and workshops are to be held. This year, the festival committee also initiated new projects titled "Festival at Schools" and "Festivals at Prisons." Through these projects, the festival films will be screened for high school students and a total of 500 prisoners at the Frankfurt Prison. The 16th Frankfurt Turkish Films Festival has enlarged its area of influence and has begun to screen festival films outside of Frankfurt. "Abluka (Frenzy), "Çırak" (Apprentice), "Kalandar Soğuğu" (Cold of Kalandar), "Kar Korsanları" (Snow Pirates), "Merdiven Baba" (Stair Dad), "Misafir" (Guest), "Saklı" (Hidden), "Sarmaşık" (Ivy), "Toz Bezi" (Dust Cloth) and Yarım (Half) compete for "Best Feature Film," while Abluka," "Kalandar Soğuğu," "Kar Korsanları," "Sarmaşık" and "Yarım" compete for "Best Script." Emin Alper with "Abluka," Emre Konuk with "Çırak," Mustafa Kara with "Kalandar Soğuğu," Faruk Hacıhafızoğlu with "Kar Korsanları" and Tolga Karaçelik with "Sarmaşık" compete for the "Best Director" award. While Nuray Yeşilaraz, Şenay Gürler, Türkü Turan, Nazan Kesal and Asiye Dinçsoy compete for "Best Actress," Mehmet Özgür, Haydar Şişman, İnanç Konukçu, Nadir Sarıbacak and Serhat Yiğit are the nominees for "Best Actor."

In a series of videos posted on YouTube, the unidentified man calmly walks around the store while slamming a pétanque metal ball – used in the French lawn bowling game – into the devices. "Apple is a company that violated European consumers' rights. They refused to reimburse me, I told them: 'Give me my money back'. They said no. So you know what's happening?

visit my web shop » Dappled Apple comments: 35 September 30, 2016 | Filed in: Baking and Cooking, Portland and Oregon Apple picking with Mimi, just the two of us, yesterday. The apples were high in the trees, and small. I love apple trees. The air was cool and dry, the noonday sun dusky and golden. After about an hour she said, "Mom, let's go home," and I had been thinking the exact same thing. The drive through the country was long and sweet. We talked and sang. We're almost never, ever home by 2:00 p.m., but yesterday we were. I peeled and chopped apples while she stirred in the sink and filled it with apple peels and mountains of dish-soap bubbles (a cheap thrill I encourage). Applesauce simmered on the stove. The house smelled like cinnamon. Today I bought an autumn door wreath, little fake red apples on dried grapevine. I knew she'd like it, and she does. It will remind me of yesterday. Xoxoxoxo. Thaaaaaaaank you for all of your great comments on my last post. Because of them I decided to chill psychologically the way I was already, in spite of myself or my to-dos, chilling physically. It's taking longer than I thought it would to find my motivation to do my chores, or much of anything else, but I'm down with it. I am knitting and knitting and knitting and knitting! I can't believe how much I am knitting. Last weekend we went to the Oregon Flock and Fiber Festival with Amelia's birthgrandfather and -grandmother, who is a spinner and knitter. She made me the most gorgeous shawl for Mother's Day, using fiber from last year's festival that she spun and knit in lovely, natural shades. I need to take a photo of it, and luckily it's finally getting chilly enough that I'll be able to wear it soon. We've all gone to the festival together for the last three years, and though I don't often find yarn for myself there (there is more fleece than yarn available to buy, I think) I do come away so inspired. Sometimes I think I just want to do nothing but knit. I've been knitting so much I haven't even taken the time to photograph the things I have knit. This gorgeous, russety weather won't last, so there will be time (though perhaps no gorgeous, russety light). 35 comments bonnie says: September 30, 2016 at 02:13 PM you had me at "russety." happiest autumn to you and yours ~ CJ says: September 30, 2016 at 02:29 PM Yes, the light is gorgeous right now isn't it. The apples look just perfect in it. It's the time of year for knitting I think. I loved reading the comments on your last post too, I found them very reassuring! Wishing you and yours a good weekend Alicia. CJ xx Qalballah says: September 30, 2016 at 02:38 PM Goodness, your baby girl looks like a character straight out of a picture book about autumn here! Lovely light we're getting now. monique says: September 30, 2016 at 03:10 PM She is so magnetic!♥ And your photos are too. rc says: September 30, 2016 at 03:13 PM When did your little baby girl turn in to a big girl! That one photo of her looking back. Whoa! Gorgeous photos, as usual. I didn't comment on the last post but yes, it's ok to take things slow. Enjoy the peace and quiet. There's not a lot of it these days. :D Karen Budnick says: September 30, 2016 at 04:14 PM These lovely, warm Autumn days are getting shorter so enjoy every second. Your photos are lovely, your prose is like a refreshing cup of tea. And now you've made me think about apples. I just heard about making apple butter in a crockpot. I've never even bought a jar of it but I want the house to smell like yours looks Maybe I'll even put it up for Christmas gifts. Another project for the list...mine, not yours! Jane says: September 30, 2016 at 04:21 PM ...those legs...how did they get so long?!?!?! sharon stanley says: September 30, 2016 at 04:27 PM it makes me uber happy to see these pics with their autumn feel and light. it's so encouraging to know it's fall somewhere! our september, much like our august has been hot, humid and unseasonably green. i yearn for the orange, yellow and red of fall. i am amazed at how grown up amelia is since starting her school...she's grown 6 inches at least! so sweet and so fetching in her seasonal clothes. Teresa Kasner says: September 30, 2016 at 05:06 PM I really enjoyed the images in this post.. so Autumnal.. I need to get some photos of the apples on our tree.. pears too. I so wish I'd seen you at the OFFF.. I'd really like to say hello to you in person some day. Although I feel like you're a friend even though we've never been face to face. :-) Now I want to make apple sauce. ((hugs)), Teresa :-) Joy says: September 30, 2016 at 06:22 PM I want to make apple 🍎 crumble now x Linda says: September 30, 2016 at 06:23 PM Big girl legs! My goodness the time passes too fast. Fibre Festivals...so fun and yes, so inspiring. Love those copper kitchen lamps. Love the apple with the little bite too. Thanks for this. Laurie Drew says: September 30, 2016 at 08:31 PM Amelia is looking SO mature! She didn't just grow this summer, she's looking like a young lady. cynthia says: September 30, 2016 at 08:51 PM i love love love that mimi walks so much. as a child in chicago, we walked everywhere. we romped through axehead lake by o'hare and thatcher woods, you know where. :>)) what a brilliant young lady she has become. tomorrow is 01 october. my birth month, as well as meems'. what a perfectly smashing choice for her top at the orchard. i love the expression in 'apples 11'. as always, a beautiful post. thank you, alicia. Pam says: October 01, 2016 at 05:51 AM Despite it being the second month of Spring here in South Australia, we are still experiencing deepest wintry weather. I mention this because I too have had a crazy upsurge in knitting and now wonder how I had let it go to a level of around only one project completed every two years or so. Since May I have knitted my daughter a cardigan, hat and boot toppers and four scarves for me. Now working on another cardigan for my daughter. Have also started a knitting club at the school where I teach and have 'Knit a Row and Go' bags set up in the stateroom where staff are communally knitting on scarves and rug squares to give to charity in break times. Yes, I too could just sit and knit and knit and knit, christie says: October 01, 2016 at 06:04 AM Seeing your blog pop up on my screen always brightens my mornings. Knit, knit, knit... being retired I am lucky enough to have the time and certainly the desire. Downside is that once an avid reader I rarely pick up a book - always go for my needles instead! Your sewing is amazing and you also KNIT, cook and lovingly raise that adorable girl. Good for you! Lynn says: October 01, 2016 at 06:15 AM Oh, how I love your posts! Enjoy your knitting and beautiful girl. Life comes in seasons. I love how you are enjoying each one to the fullest and sharing it with us. You always make me smile and remember when my now 20 somethings were babies and how much fun we had. Thank you for bringing beauty to this crazy world!! Lynne says: October 01, 2016 at 06:37 AM Apple day's delight . . . Love this time of the year . . . If it would only stop rainy . . . Julie says: October 01, 2016 at 06:43 AM I am starting to plan my knitting projects, getting excited as the days get cooler. I love all of the photos you share-thank you for that! And I love that copper lamp your kitchen, have to try and find one for me! Robin says: October 01, 2016 at 06:54 AM Beautiful pictures. Your sweet girl reminds me so much of the illustrations in the Eloise Wilkin illustrated Little Golden Books. So beautiful. Thanks for sharing. Lacy says: October 01, 2016 at 12:17 PM A girl's day out ~ perfect. Yum, applesauce. Did you add cinnamon candies to turn it pink & spicy? ❤️ I thought I heard the sound of knitting needles humming right along. Good for you, this is the best time of year for knitting. I'm knitting right along with you. Seems I just can't knit fast enough in order to finish all the patterns I want to knit. 😍 I so look forward to the Oregon Flock & Fiber every year. We must encourage you to try your hand at spinning. I just know you'd like it. And if you ever do there's a new book on the market that is perfect for the beginner to the expert. https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1612125212/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=JIN2B4LL9TRP&coliid=I3KJ2M09TSBH5R And while I'm here there is also another fun book you might enjoy.📚 https://smile.amazon.com/dp/163217068X/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=JIN2B4LL9TRP&coliid=IJJJZRC4MINL2 Kate says: October 01, 2016 at 01:21 PM Oh, this "russety" weather... makes my world go around. :-) Sometimes you just need to take a break from life & knit. I'd be happy knitting for days... too bad the laundry needs to be washed. :-) Nicki says: October 02, 2016 at 12:15 AM It all looks so warm and cozy. I need to start knitting again. I got cross last year after I knit the same hat 3 times and managed to destroy it each time right at the very end. I wonder why apple picking is not such a big thing in the UK🤔 Denise says: October 02, 2016 at 06:30 AM Fall is just the best, isn't it? It's in the air here, too, though still a little bit warm but the humidity has finally receded. I've been eating lunch outside and reading Harry Potter every day during my lunch hour and it is my slice of heaven. Apple picking with littles is sooooo much fun, I really miss those days, but love reliving the memories here. Keep Fallin'😉 Beautiful post, thank you! P.S. I really must learn to knit, I know I'd love it! Missy says: October 02, 2016 at 08:26 AM Lovely photos. Fall is my favorite season and I miss it so much, living in Puerto Rico. I'm thrilled that I'm hopping on a plane with my kids to visit Grandma and Grandpa in NH this week! Leanne says: October 02, 2016 at 03:43 PM I have been away from my blog for many many months. So glad to keep up with you on instagram :) This will be my first fall/winter in my empty nest...I will be so glad to spend time going back and catching up on things here. Your words always bring me ginormous amounts of peace and calm and love. She is such a sweet pea...loved this age so much!

(Michael Reaves/Getty Images) Print Email Dan Duggan | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com By Dan Duggan | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 30, 2016 at 4:55 PM, updated September 30, 2016 at 5:22 PM comments EAST RUTHERFORD — Eli Apple and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie haven't yet been ruled out for the Giants' game against the Vikings on Monday night. But Giants defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo sounds like he's not expecting to have two of his top cornerbacks for the game. "We'll miss them," Spagnuolo said. "We've got to get somebody else to step up and hopefully they can get healthy quick." Apple (hamstring) and Rodgers-Cromartie (groin) left last Sunday's loss to the Redskins with injuries. They have not participated in practice this week, working on the side with trainers during the brief portions of practice open to the media on Thursday and Friday. Ben McAdoo and Odell Beckham Jr. on emotions If Apple and Rodgers-Cromartie are out, Trevin Wade will likely take over as the starting cornerback opposite Janoris Jenkins and Leon Hall would be the primary slot corner. Running back Rashad Jennings was a limited participant in Friday's practice as he deals with a thumb injury that sidelined him in Week 3. McAdoo said Jennings is progressing, but a decision about the running back's status may not come until game day. Here is Friday's full injury report: GIANTS DID NOT PRACTICE •CB Eli Apple (hamstring): It appears that the Giants will exercise caution with Apple's hamstring injury. •S Nat Berhe (concussion): Berhe is in the concussion protocol after reporting a headache on Wednesday. •RT Marshall Newhouse (calf): Newhouse remains out with a calf injury he suffered in Week 2. Bobby Hart is in line to start again start at right tackle. •CB Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie (groin): It's too early to rule Rodgers-Cromartie out, but it doesn't look like he'll be ready for Monday. •DT Robert Thomas (illness): Thomas remains out with an undisclosed illness, but he has been working on the side with trainers during practice. McAdoo said he hopes Thomas will practice next week. •FS Darian Thompson (foot): Thompson's left foot is still in a walking boot. Thompson remains week-to-week. Adams ready for opportunity LIMITED PRACTICE PARTICIPANT •RB Rashad Jennings (thumb): McAdoo said Jennings is progressing, but there is no definitive word yet if the running back will play on Monday. FULL PRACTICE PARTICIPANT •DE Olivier Vernon (wrist): Vernon said his wrist injury is just a "little nick." He will likely to continue to play with his wrist heavily wrapped. VIKINGS DID NOT PRACTICE •TE David Morgan (knee): Morgan has not practiced this week after injuring his knee on Sunday. •DT Sharrif Floyd (knee): Floyd underwent knee surgery last week. LIMITED PRACTICE PARTICIPANT •WR Stefon Diggs (groin): Diggs was added to the injury report on Friday with a groin injury. •FB Zach Line (knee): Line returned to practice after missing Thursday's session with a knee injury. •G Alex Boone (hip): The team's starting left guard was limited on Friday after missing Thursday's practice with a hip injury. FULL PRACTICE PARTICIPANT •LB Anthony Barr (wrist): The starting strong side linebacker has 11 tackles this season. •RB Jerick McKinnon (toe): With Adrian Peterson out with a knee injury, McKinnon has taken over as the Vikings' lead back. He has 19 carries for 53 yards this season. •CB Xavier Rhodes (knee): Rhodes is the Vikings' top cornerback. •TE MyCole Pruitt (knee): Pruitt returned to practice this week after spraining his MCL in the preseason finale.

The Phoneys app makes it possible to place stickers that look like the received blue (iMessage) and green (SMS) speech bubbles within the Messages app. The idea is to make it look like friends have sent something they haven’t, which could be hilarious and in some circumstances be very, very damaging to enemies. Related: iOS 10 review The 99¢ pack even uses the San Francisco font to make the bubbles look more convincing. It seemed to strike a chord with iPhone-owning pranksters, topping the Top Grossing and Top Paid sections of the Messages App Store. Well, now Apple seems pretty peeved the stickers made it through the app review process and has contacted the developer to make changes or face deletion. Posting on Medium (via BGR), the developer, Adam Howell wrote: “Apple’s lawyers weren’t happy that Phoneys got through the review process. The stickers couldn’t be blue or green, they couldn’t use San Francisco as the typeface, and the app could no longer be marketed as a “prank” app, because Apple doesn’t approve prank apps (even though I myself had never used the word “prank” when marketing Phoneys, others did, and I certainly understood where he was coming from). They were not going to pull the app, Bill made sure to emphasize. They’d give me a week, until next Thursday, to fundamentally change it so that the bubbles looked nothing like iMessage bubbles, instead looking something closer to “comic book cartoon bubbles”. I said okay, thanks a lot Bill, and that was the end of the conversation.” Howell has the choice of making the changes and disappointing customers or not making the changes and seeing the app pulled… and disappointing customers. Right now he hasn’t decided which avenue to take, but his tale of woe is an example of what happens when you turn an app that was working perfectly well for many years into a gimmick, in order to try and compete with Snapchat.

It’s a hard question to answer, one reason Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has gained traction with voters by haranguing free-trade deals with China, Mexico and other nations. When a US factory closes and the jobs move overseas, it’s pretty clear that open borders are harming everybody who just got axed. Free trade is supposed to generate benefits that compensate for such harm, and leave Americans better off overall. But the upsides of trade tend to be intangible, incremental and difficult to pinpoint. Free trade has almost certainly brought enormous benefits to the US economy, however, including the creation of whole new industries that might not exist if the United States had the sort of closed economy Trump seems to prefer. “Manufacturing is not disappearing, but the kinds of things the United States makes are changing,” says trade economist Peter Schott of Yale University. “When a given product goes offshore, the dynamism of the economy lets the United States produce things it may not have otherwise produced.” Schott and other trade experts point to the iPhone as a groundbreaking product that might never have existed under a more closed economic system with the kinds of trade protections Trump favors. By the time Apple (AAPL) launched the iPhone in 2007, there were well-established supply chains in Asia, mostly in China, able to churn out high-quality electronics at a fraction of the cost of producing them in the United States or other developed countries. The key to the iPhone’s profitability Apple already assembled computers and its hit iPod music player in China, so it had detailed knowledge of supply chains there. China also was a member of the World Trade Organization by then, which meant Apple knew it could count on the economics of cheap Chinese production well into the future, instead of worrying that Congress might grow testy over some issue and pass legislation disrupting the trade relationship, which can’t happen under WTO rules. That kind of certainty let Apple CEO Steve Jobs know he could invest billions in the iPhone with minimal risk of disruptive supply shocks. The iPhone went on sale in 2007, priced at $499 for the cheapest model. That was steep for ordinary consumers, yet the iPhone went on to become the most profitable product in Apple’s history. It’s impossible to know if Apple would have made the iPhone if it had no choice but to manufacture it in the US, with American labor and American parts. Undoubtedly, however, that would have shifted the whole economic equation for Apple and made the iPhone less profitable or perhaps unprofitable. It would also have raised the price for consumers. There’s a wide range of estimates for how much it would have cost Apple to build the iPhone in America—from a relatively modest $65 in added cost per phone to a much larger tab that would have exceeded Apple’s annual profit at the time. Some Apple executives have said the company couldn’t have built the iPhone in the United States no matter what the cost, because regulations were too onerous, labor rules too restrictive and engineers too scarce. Chinese suppliers, by contrast, could muster all the workers necessary on short notice and meet a surge in demand with few hiccups. Apple likes to point out that its products are “designed in California,” a sort of reminder that Apple does employ about 75,000 people in the United States, which isn’t shabby. And it claims the “ecosystem” for its products has created an additional 1.4 million jobs. That number may or may not be accurate, but it is self-evident that a whole new industry of app developers, communication services and digital startups has benefited from the runaway success of the iPhone and other mobile devices. US innovation manufactured in China Free trade made that possible, but there’s an important catch: The people benefiting from open barriers aren’t the same people being hurt by them, and we have poor mechanisms at the moment for helping people hurt by free trade get a cut of the prosperity it creates elsewhere in the economy. In theory, workers are supposed to transfer from one industry to another as various types of work get shifted to lower-cost regions. In reality, there are many barriers that prevent that from happening: The employers of the future aren’t always located near the employers of the past, forcing people to move to remain employed. Some people can’t afford to move, because they’re upside down on a mortgage or living costs in a new locale are way too expensive. Even people who can move often lack the skills employers want today. It’s often hard even knowing what skills employers want, given how fast technology changes. Read More A reported 700,000 people work for Apple contractors such as Foxconn, assembling iPhones, iPads and other Apple products in China. That’s roughly 10 times Apple’s US payroll. Those are the kinds of jobs Trump wants to “bring back” to the United States. But as Steve Jobs told President Obama in 2011, “those jobs aren’t coming back.” His reasoning: American consumers won’t pay for the higher cost of US labor, and companies won’t invest in products if costs are too high and the economic viability of the product dubious. Many other innovations of the last 20 years fit the same profile as the iPhone: iRobot’s (IRBT) robotic vacuums, the Roku TV stick, the Amazon (AMZN) Echo “digital assistant,” fitness-tracking gizmos such as FitBit (FIT), GoPro (GPRO) action cameras and so on. All of those devices involve American engineering and business know-how, with the devices themselves manufactured in China or other low-cost places. Trade restrictions raising the cost of foreign imports or forcing the use of American workers could have quashed all of those innovations. As new industries develop, they initially benefit lucky elites who have the right skills and happen to be in the right place at the right time. That may be the phase we’re in right now. But the benefits of technology revolutions typically widen over time. “Students in school who might have been headed to another industry see what’s happening and become available for new things,” says Schott. “A worker who lost an apparel job in North Carolina probably won’t go work for Google. But her kid might.” What’s missing amid this turbulent transition from the industrial economy of the 20th century to the digital one of the 21st is a stronger safety net for lower-skilled workers who are inevitably displaced when companies have wide latitude to pursue efficiency. Bringing back unskilled assembly-line jobs that aren’t so great to start with, as Trump wants to do, isn’t the answer. But it might help to identify the victims of free trade faster, amp up aid programs, consider relocation assistance and enlist companies to do more to support communities where they operate. And encourage those kids to aspire to work at Google someday. Rick Newman’s latest book is Liberty for All: A Manifesto for Reclaiming Financial and Political Freedom.

I noticed this headline in the news this morning: Apple patent details visual-based AR navigation, confirms Flyby Media acquisition. The article tells us that augmented reality can be accomplished by using information from a phone such as image data from a camera, and sensor data from devices such as a gyroscope and an accelerometer, and that information can be augmented by marrying images of reality with computer generated imagery. I checked out the patent referred to in the article, and it had me wondering what role Flyby Media played in Google’s Project Tango, which we are told that they used in the Apple Insider article. The patent linked to in that news story is in Apple’s name, but the inventors are originally from Flyby Media. The patent is: Visual-based inertial navigation Inventors: Alex Flint, Oleg Naroditsky, Christopher P. Broaddus, Andriy Grygorenko, Stergios Roumeliotis, and Oriel Bergig Assigned to: Apple Inc. Regents of the University of Minnesota US Patent 9,424,647 Granted August 23, 2016 Filed: August 12, 2014 Abstract A method includes: receiving sensor measurements from a pre-processing module, in which the sensor measurements include image data and inertial data for a device; transferring, using a processor, information derived from the sensor measurements, from a first set of variables associated with a first window of time to a second set of variables associated with a second window of time, in which the first and second windows consecutively overlap in time; and outputting, to a post-processing module, a state of the device based on the transferred information. An image from the patent shows how indoor mapping might be improved by the collection of information using imagery from Flyby Media: Improved Indoor Mapping The Apple Insider article points to this earlier article from them that describes other acquisitions of companies working in Augmented Reality: Rumor: Apple has ‘hundreds of staff’ working on virtual & augmented reality projects Two of the inventors listed on this patent supposedly now work at Apple, Naroditsky and Grygorenko,and one, Roumeliotis, is a professor at the University of Minnesota. I was curious as to what other patents Flyby Media might have, and the last sentence in the abstract from the first one, about augmented reality games was interesting. Systems and methods for efficient 3D tracking of weakly textured planar surfaces for augmented reality applications Inventors: Christopher Broaddus, Andriy Grygorenko, Netanel Hagbi, and Oriel Y. Bergig; Assignee: Flyby Media, Inc. US Patent 9,147,251 Granted: September 29, 2015 Filed: August 3, 2012 Abstract The present system provides an on the fly simple to complex 6DOF registration approach using the direct method. On the fly means it does not require training time, a user points a phone/camera to a planar surface and can start tracking it instantly. Simple to complex means the system performs registration in multiple levels of complexity from 2DOF to 6DOF. By increasing the complexity model the system enables more surfaces to be tracked and for surfaces that are tracked the system can avoid local minima solution providing a more robust and accurate 6DOF tracking. Even surfaces that are very weak in features can be tracked in 6DOF and virtual content can be registered to them. The system enables playing Augmented Reality games on low-end devices such as mobile phones on almost any surface in the real world. Systems and methods for tracking natural planar shapes for augmented reality applications Inventors: Netanel Hagbi, Oriel Y. Bergig, and Jihad A. Elsana Assigned to: Flyby Media, Inc. US Patent 8,644,551 Granted: February 4, 2014 Filed: October 15, 2010 Abstract The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for tracking planar shapes for augmented-reality (AR) applications. Systems for real-time recognition and camera six degrees of freedom pose-estimation from planar shapes are disclosed. Recognizable shapes can be augmented with 3D content. Recognizable shapes can be in form of a predefined library being updated online using a network. Shapes can be added to the library when the user points to a shape and asks the system to start recognizing it. The systems perform shape recognition by analyzing contour structures and generating projective invariant signatures. Image features are further extracted for pose estimation and tracking. Sample points are matched by evolving an active contour in real time. It’s interesting seeing how Apple is advancing in Augmented Reality Technology by acquisitions of technology and hiring employees from companies such as Flyby Media. Will Apple be focusing upon games such as Pokemon Go, or do they have other ideas in mind, like I alluded to in this post on a new Apple patent on Augmented Reality Displays from them: Might We Soon See Apple Augmented Reality?. We see Apple is working upon building devices that can display augmented reality, and they are acquiring expertise and technology that assists in using augmented reality in applications such as indoor mapping.

Ali says: 08/30/2016 at 3:53 pm I just curious what will Apple do next? It’ll be good if they’re making a game such as pokemon go lol. Transport George says: 08/30/2016 at 3:58 pm Wow! Apple may really have something new up its sleeves. Bill Slawski says: 08/30/2016 at 6:15 pm It’s possible that Google will want to create more than just games; regardless of how popular Pokemon Go has become. Bill Slawski says: 08/30/2016 at 6:25 pm Hi George, It will be interesting seeing what Apple starts producing with this new technology, or whether their new Augmented Reality developers come up with something completely new. vicky says: 08/31/2016 at 7:35 am Hello …… Much thanks to you sharing this , i going to bookmark your blog and i hope more positive updates you will release soon.

The ILDOCK offers a Lightning charging port and analog headphone jack for your iPhone 7 or any Apple device with a Lightning port. Credit: ildockgear More like this Why Apple dropped the headphone jack in the iPhone 7 Deep-dive review: The iPhone 7 Plus is the best iPhone yet What happens when Apple removes headphone jacks and USB ports from our devices Video Mingis on Tech: The iPhone 7, Apple Watch 2 -- and the gadget guy! There were plenty of complaints in the mainstream media and the blogosphere when Apple announced its iPhone 7 ships without an analog headphone jack. The idea of forcing users to toss their older headphones to use Apple's new Lightning port-enabled ear buds or buy its soon-to-be-released $159 wireless AirPods created a visceral reaction in consumer circles. Industry pundits also speculated that third-party adapters allowing analog headphones to connect to the iPhone would soon follow... and so they have. Los Angeles start-up ildockgear has created a Lightning adapter that allows iPhone 7 users to charge their device and listen to music over analog headphones at the same time. The device is about the size of a U.S. quarter. ildockgear The ILDOCK with its headphone jack and Lightning charging port. The company began a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter three days ago for its ILDOCK, and it has already garnered more than $20,000, four times its original goal. In addition to the basic ILDOCK adapter, which contains a 3.5mm headphone jack and a Lightning charging port, the company has also produced an ILDOCK Plus, which adds an SD card slot, a microSD slot and USB ports. Users can connect up to a 128GB flash card with ILDOCK Plus or connect to any size USB drives, the company states in its marketing material. ildockgear The ILDOCK Plus's ports include an SD slot, a microSD slot and a USB port, along with the Lightning and analog headphone jack ports. Early-bird backers can reserve an ILDOCK for a pledge of $5 and currently can get two ILDOCK Plus adapters for $18. (A $15 single ILDOCK Plus offer has already sold out.) The ILDOCK and ILDOCK plus come in four iPhone 7-mimicking colors: Silver, gold, rose gold and "space" gray. ildockgear The ILDOCK's various colors. In addition to compatibility with the headphone jackless iPhone 7, the ILDOCK also works with any iPhone or iPad with a Lightning port. The ILDOCKs are expected to begin shipping in November.

This is going to be BIG... Blog Weekly Newsletter Dinners Meet or Pitch This is going to be BIG... Blog/ Weekly Newsletter/ Dinners/ Meet or Pitch/ This is going to be BIG... Venture Capital, Seed and Pre-Seed Investments, New York, Brooklyn, Cycling, Street Hockey and Softball Blog This is going to be BIG... Blog/ Weekly Newsletter/ Dinners/ Meet or Pitch/ I invest in tech-related seed and pre-seed NYC startups at Brooklyn Bridge Ventures.  Native Brooklynite, 7x triathlete, 4x marathoner, softball player, street hockey goalie.  Check out my This Week in Startups interview or check out my bio here. September 28, 2016 In Hardware, You're Only as Good as Your Next Product: See goTenna September 28, 2016/ Charlie O'Donnell When hardware maker Quirky went out of business, Ben Einstein at Bolt had this to say: "A good company builds one product, learns from its customers, and iterates to make that product exceptional. Each step in the process is designed to refine a product and find the often elusive “product/market fit” that is the basis for all successful startups. Imagine if Apple built the first app-free iPhone and then moved on to the Apple Watch, or GoPro only sold one version of its camera and then decided to launch something totally different." Iterating as a hardware company, of course, isn't the easiest thing in the world.  Design and production cycles are long, and you can't upgrade the physical parts on the fly.  That's why so many companies never make it to a second product.  Take Nest, for example, that wowed the world with its thermostat, but never followed up with anything consumers really felt the same way about.   Often times, the challenge is coming up with a first product that people like that you can deliver in a reasonable amount of time, knowing it won't have everything you could ever hope to build.  The tricky part is doing that while not distracting yourself and diverting too many resources away from a product that more closely reflects your long term, ultimate goal. That's why I'm so excited to see a Brooklyn Bridge Ventures portfolio company, goTenna, launch its new product, goTenna Mesh. goTenna Mesh is the first 100% off-grid, mobile, long-range consumer-ready mesh network device, which will be available internationally. The announcement comes along with the launch of goTenna’s premium service, goTenna Plus, and the release of the goTenna open Software Development Kit (SDK).  goTenna Mesh pairs with any iOS or Android device to allow users to text and share GPS locations, up to several miles away depending on terrain and elevation. This is the first goTenna product that will be available outside the United States and it will be sold in pairs for $179 but is available in limited quantities at promotional pricing (starting at $129) today on a preorder basis before shipment begins later this year.  Check out their video for more info. Unlike traditional networks, a mesh network gets stronger as more people use it.  goTenna Mesh is smaller, sleeker than goTenna’s flagship product, and provides even greater utility thanks to the introduction of mesh networking. By automatically and privately relaying your message through other users if your recipient(s) are not within point-to-point range or are otherwise obstructed, you can effectively double or triple your range and be likelier to get a message through in difficult situations.  goTenna Mesh is anchored by intelligent mesh protocols (named “Aspen Grove”) that deliver a 100% off-grid, entirely mobile, long-range mesh network. Such a technology has never been achieved outside hulking military tactical systems that cost tens of thousands of dollars per unit.  Congrats to the goTenna team on a huge accomplishment for their customers.  This is the product that Daniela and Jorge had in mind when they first started the company--when goTenna was just a box full of wires that sent a text across a table to another box full of wires.  I'm excited to have been their first VC backer. I can't wait to see what's next! ;) September 28, 2016/ Charlie O'Donnell/ Charlie O'Donnell How come VCs are... jerks? This is Not the Trump You are ...

Apple Adds ARM Support to macOS Sierra Kernel LIKE   TWEET   SHARE   PIN   SHARE   POST MAIL MORE Posted September 30, 2016 at 7:45pm by iClarified · 66549 views · Translate Apple has added support for an ARM chip to macOS Sierra 10.12, reports Techtastic. In the Kernel release notes for macOS 10.12, Apple indicates that a new ARM HURRICANE chip family is now supported by the kernel. This is likely a custom ARM chip from Apple as the A7 was dubbed Cyclone, the A8 was Typhoon, and the A9 was Twister. It may even be the A10 Fusion processor found in the iPhone 7. The site notes that Apple may have already been taking steps to prepare for a laptop with an ARM processor. It is striking that developers no longer send the final binaries when submitting an app, but a bit code. This bit code is then used by Apple to convert the application to the specific platform. Which means that Apple can easily make the transition to a different instruction set, for example, switching from x86 to ARM without all apps need to be resubmitted. It is probably also one of the reasons why legacy applications have recently been removed from the App Store. An ARM MacBook has been rumored for quite some time. It's believed that A-series chips would be limited to lower-end devices initially, perhaps a future version of the rumored 12-inch MacBook Air would be a possible candidate. Apple is set to unveil a slew of updates to its Mac lineup next month. Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

After a prank app called Phoneys skyrocketed to the top of the iMessage App Store charts, Apple informed the developer of the app, Adam Howell, that the app will be removed  in a week if he doesn’t implement some design tweaks that would fundamentally alter the appeal and overall utility of the app. For those unfamiliar, Phoneys is a fun iMessage app that let users send stickers designed to look exactly like the blue iMessage bubbles iOS users are accustomed to. The end result is that users can send their friends messages and make it seem as if they were the ones who sent it. DON'T MISS: Yup, now the iPhone 7 is exploding As Sara Perez noted, “And thanks to the new layering feature in the updated version of iMessage, you can place these stickers — which say things like “My political views are totally wrong” or “I have terrible taste in music” — overtop your friend’s message to make it look like they texted these self-deprecating statements to you.” Intrigued, I actually paid for the app earlier this week and, suffice it to say, it’s a whole lot of fun. Now the app doesn’t work exactly as advertised because the font within the iMessage bubble is bigger than it should be. What’s more, the placement of the sticker itself isn’t always aligned correctly. Nonetheless, it still makes for a fun, if not confusing prank to pull on friends. Alas, it turns out that Apple wasn’t on-board with the shenanigans. Detailing Apple’s reaction, Howell recounts (via Medium) a phone conversation he had with Apple. Bill was nice, but to the point. Apple’s lawyers weren’t happy that Phoneys got through the review process. The stickers couldn’t be blue or green, they couldn’t use San Francisco as the typeface, and the app could no longer be marketed as a “prank” app, because Apple doesn’t approve prank apps (even though I myself had never used the word “prank” when marketing Phoneys, others did, and I certainly understood where he was coming from). They were not going to pull the app, Bill made sure to emphasize. They’d give me a week, until next Thursday, to fundamentally change it so that the bubbles looked nothing like iMessage bubbles, instead looking something closer to “comic book cartoon bubbles”. I said okay, thanks a lot Bill, and that was the end of the conversation.  All that said, you might want to grab the app here while it’s hot... and still available.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple’s relied on Intel chips to power its Mac computers since 2005, but that partnership could be coming to an end. A bit of code in macOS Sierra suggests the Cupertino company is gearing up to use its ARM-based processors instead. The macOS kernel, which Dutch site TechTastic took some time to dig through, adds support for a new CPU family called “ARM Hurricane.” Apple’s given its recent ARM-based Ax chips similar codenames (A7 was Cyclone, A8 was Typhoon and A9 was Twister).  Hurricane might be an unannounced sequel, or it might even be the A10 Fusion processor introduced with the iPhone 7. The A10 Fusion chip is Apple’s first model with a quad-core design, packing two cores for high-performance tasks and two energy efficient cores for regular activities. Based on recent benchmarks, the A10 Fusion even rivals the Intel Core M chip used to power the 12-inch MacBook. That means it’s not out of the question that new MacBooks could rely on an A-series chip. There’s one more bit of evidence. TechTastic notes that macOS Sierra also changes the way developers submit third-party Mac apps. Basically, it allows Apple to automatically convert those apps between platforms. That could make it possible to easily switch all apps to work with an ARM-based chip without requiring each developer to resubmit their software. Apple is expected to unveil new MacBooks next month, which could provide the company with a perfect opportunity to announce the big switch. Cupertino hasn’t confirmed plans for another event yet, but we’ll let you know as soon as the invitations go out.

Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Sep 30, 2016 at 1:49PM iPhone 7. Image source: Apple. Geographically speaking, investors are well aware of where Apple, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) priorities lie. Greater China is one of the company's main growth engines at this point, and continues to march toward a day when it overtakes the U.S. business. CEO Tim Cook has predicted this will occur within the next few years, but right now the U.S. is still about $25 billion larger on a trailing-12-month basis. India is the next big country to tackle, while Apple slowly continues to build out its operations in Russia. That covers three of the BRIC countries. But what about the "B"? Brazil is just part of the picture It wasn't until early 2014 that Apple opened its first retail store in Brazil, and there are currently only two stores within the country. Beyond just Brazil, it may surprise you to learn that Apple's business in Canada and South America combined is actually extremely small. Apple reports Americas as a geographical operating segment, while separately disclosing the international mix of sales in its earnings releases. We can use the inverse of this figure to calculate Apple's domestic U.S. revenue, and then compare that to the broader Americas segment. Here's what we get if we back out U.S. revenue from Americas revenue. Data source: SEC filings, author's calculations. Graph by author. Americas ex-U.S. revenue, which would include all of Canada and all of South America, is typically only in the ballpark of $3 billion per quarter, plus or minus a billion or so. (The average since 2014 is $2.8 billion per quarter.) Apple has been doing quite well in emerging markets recently with various initiatives intended to make iPhones more affordable. To be clear, Apple has long faced headwinds in Brazil, mostly in the form of massive import tariffs that make it the most expensive country in the world to buy an iPhone. The whole only-two-stores-in-the-country thing doesn't help, either (even though Apple sells through third-party distributors). The Brazilian real has also been fairly volatile in recent years, making it tricky for Apple to properly price its products as it must navigate currency translation effects (net of hedging). Put another way, Canada and South America represent about 5% of overall revenue. It's true that the BRIC countries have experienced slowing growth and other macroeconomic headwinds recently, but it still feels like Apple could be doing more to expand its business in Canada and South America.

After publishing our second article about the phenomenon, which is being called “touch disease,” my inbox flooded with stories from people who—many out of blind brand loyalty to Apple—have continued replacing their iPhone 6 Pluses with refurbished units that are just as likely to break as their old ones. As we’ve detailed in those stories, “touch disease” is an iPhone 6 Plus flaw related to “bendgate” in which the two tiny “Touch IC” connectors, which translate touchscreen presses into a machine input, become unseated from the phone’s logic board. It can be recognized by flickering gray bars along the top of the phone, and is associated with intermittent or total touchscreen failure. "Apple called me, but when they called my screen was frozen and I could not answer the phone." Replacing the phone’s screen will not fix the problem—the only way to fix it is to have a micro soldering expert replace and resolder the Touch IC chips. Apple does not perform this repair, and does not tell its customers that there are some independent repair professionals who can perform this repair and can prevent it from recurring by installing an extra metal shield that stiffens the logic board. Instead, the company has told its Geniuses that iPhone 6 Plus touchscreen problems are a known issue, but has not publicly acknowledged the issue. A class action lawsuit has been filed in an attempt to force Apple to deal with the problem, or at least admit that the issue exists. Thousands of iPhone 6 Plus owners have joined the suit. Apple PR has ignored four separate requests for comment from Motherboard as well as requests for comment from every other news outlet that has asked about this issue. Several independent iPhone repair companies will fix touch disease for far cheaper than the $329 Apple charges to replace touch disease-afflicted phones with refurbished ones. I cannot vouch for the skills or success rate of any given repair professional, but here is a short list I’ve compiled of companies that do mail-in touch disease repairs: Apple Pie Repair Stop N Fix iPhone Repair iPad Rehab Wires Computing In the last 24 hours, I’ve gotten emails from 27 separate iPhone 6 Plus owners who have encountered this problem and were unaware that Apple internally considers it a known issue. Many of them have been put through lengthy tech support protocols on obviously broken phones only to be told that they would have to pay $329 for a refurbished phone that is still fundamentally flawed. Others have had to put up with months of forcefully bending or twisting the phone in order to get its Touch IC connectors to intermittently work for a few minutes, hours, or days before the problem inevitably resurfaces. In some cases, Apple will replace the phone for free, even out-of-warranty. But Apple store geniuses we spoke to said that such a replacement is up to the whims of the manager on duty at any given time. Here are some customer experiences from the emails I’ve received—in some cases, I asked for additional information about what they had been through. They’ve been lightly edited for length and grammar, and are published in an attempt to show that Apple turning a blind eye to touch disease continues to hurt some of the company’s most loyal customers. Cherish: “I originally purchased the phone new, around April 2015 (via Sprint). I did not pay for extended Apple Care. The problems started on August 16, before I updated to iOS 9.3.4. I assumed that it happened because I hadn't downloaded the update, so I did that. It took a long time because I couldn't hit ‘OK’ or "’Agree’ when the screen was frozen and I'd have to wait for the screen to become responsive so I could advance it or put in my passcode. That update didn't help, so I started deleting apps. I thought maybe the Facebook app was using too much memory. (I have a 128 GB and only use about 40 GB, so even that seemed strange). No luck, so I went to the Apple store. It was about 8:30 PM when I arrived and they were busy. When I told them the problem they assured me it was most likely a software glitch and I could handle it over the phone with a specialist. So they had me fill out the form on one of the Macs and I set up a time for the next day. "Missed a lot of great photos during a friend's wedding weekend because I unfortunately relied on my iPhone to be my camera" Apple called me on August 17, but when they called my screen was frozen and I could not answer the phone. They left a message saying they would call back. I went to my rental car, connected the Bluetooth and used that to answer. I gave them my alternate cell number so that solved the calling issue. I was on the phone with them for an hour after that and they insisted for most of the call that this is a normal occurrence and is often resolved by restoring the OS. Restart. Forced restart. Software update. Backup to computer. Full wipe and restore backup. Everything took longer because I could only advance the screen when it was responsive (getting through the ‘Hello’ and setup easily took 10 minutes each time). At the end of it all, there was no resolution. They told me I would need to take it to the Apple store and probably have the screen replaced for a crazy amount, and even then they weren't sure if that would resolve the issue since the source couldn't be pinpointed. By that Saturday, a few days later, the phone was better. Not 100 percent normal, but not freezing nearly as much and I'd even had a day with no problems. I canceled the appointment thinking all was good. The following week I was traveling again and the problems started the day before I left. With no time to reschedule an appointment I left town and dealt with days of screen freezing and stalling. Missed a lot of great photos during a friend's wedding weekend because I unfortunately relied on my iPhone to be my camera. The past month since then has been almost like a pattern. Three or so days of screen freezing all day long, which usually lasts 5-10 minutes, then the screen works for 1-3 minutes, then it stalls again. Sometimes it delays the touch actions, so when it starts working again all kinds of apps open and things are typed. Sometimes it freezes midway thru typing the password. It can take 3 minutes just to write a one line text. I always hated using Siri but I found that's the only way to send a text when the screen freezes. I have searched online week after week for a solution and the Apple site gives the same ‘restart’ and ‘restore’ suggestions. Your article was the first thing I've noticed that actually made sense in terms of what I was experiencing. I have tried to slightly bend it (*gasp*) a few times and magically that has kicked it back in gear (usually after 4-5 twists and bends), often working for a couple of days before going back into crazy, freeze mode. I try not to do that because it worries me, but it seemed to be the only thing that even sorta worked sometimes. It was disappointing that Apple hasn't done more about this known issue. I got a lot of teasing from my Android friends as they watched me frantically swipe across my screen with no success.” Paul: “I’ve lived with this problem on and off for almost two years now. It started happening almost as soon as I got it. I got a screen change under warranty, and had to get a refurbished phone the day after because the screen change did nothing. A few months later it started showing the signs again, and now I can't use it. As a kicker just a couple weeks ago, the phone stopped connecting to my cellular network and AT&T said it was a phone problem, not carrier. I had to order an iPhone 7 Plus but I feel cheated out of my money as I paid full price for my 6 Plus and could've used it at least another year or even two, if it worked properly.” Katasha: “The top grey bar would almost flicker all the time, and that's when I knew my phone wouldn't respond to my touch. So, after dealing with this for a couple weeks, I ended up at the Apple Store, where I was told yes, it was a problem, but not something that could be fixed, nor was it covered, and I exchanged my phone for $329, to get a new one, because what else was I to do?” One reader, Tracy, sent me a lengthy exchange she had with Apple Support on Twitter after she had already taken the phone to an Apple Store. They made her go through hours of diagnostics before ultimately deciding that yes, her phone had the exact same problem thousands of other phones have had. Andrea: “This exact thing happened to my phone over the summer and I went through over three months of hassle trying to resolve the issue. Never was resolved in a fair way for me. I paid to replace the phone. Apple diagnosed it as a ‘jailbreak’ done by me. I wasn't even familiar with that term let alone know how to ‘do’ it.” Dan: “My phone began to malfunction a little over a year after getting the phone. I've been putting up with the problem for about a year now. When it gets hot, like every time I go outside to my car, the screen freezes and I get ghost touches (it's like someone is opening apps and doing things on my phone), and there's a gray flicker at the top of my screen. To fix the problem, I grab the top and bottom of my phone and give it a little twist one way or the other, and the phone starts functioning normally again. "Next you torque...yes that's right twist your iPhone and it'll work" A month ago I went to an Apple Store. I told the genius that I have this problem with the phone, and he was aware of this problem. He said that they could fix the problem for $350(?) or something like that, but he said that I could just wait to get a new phone because they are coming out soon. I told him that I'm not going to pay that to get the phone fixed. I said that I'm not very happy with Apple and the fact that they have this unbelievable manufacturing problem in their flagship phone. He said that he was disappointed with Apple too about the problem.” Alexander: “I have been experiencing this problem almost one year after the purchase of the iPhone 6 Plus...just long enough after to not be under warranty. How I dealt with the problem is actually quite simple. You place your right thumb at the bottom right corner of the phone with fingers stretched across the back and you place your left thumb at the upper left corner of the phone with the fingers stretched behind. Next you torque...yes that's right twist your iPhone and it'll work. Clearly a flexgate/engineer flaw/defect that Apple should have dealt with.” James: “I just read your article, I have an iPhone 6+ that had that same issue. I took it to ATT and they tried to tell me it got wet but they couldn't see any indication that the water identifiers were tripped. After fighting with them for 45 minutes and showing them my phone is in an otter box they finally warrantied my phone with a refurbished iPhone 6 Plus, even though the one that had an issue was brand new. Now my replacement phone is doing the same thing. After this I will never buy another Apple product, their customer service is very poor. They sell phones at the phone carrier’s office but then you have to take it to Apple for everything else after 30 days. Their wait times are stupid, I had to wait three hours one day at a store just to be told there is nothing they can do without spending $400.” "Thinking of the time that I have spent in the Apple Store, I can't imagine the amount of time I have wasted there" Cameron: “I dealt with this issue a couple of months ago with an iPhone 6 Plus that was six months old. I had taken meticulous care of the phone because I had multiple issues with a previous 6 Plus phone that Apple ultimately replaced. When this issue occurred the phone was out of warranty and Apple gave me the run around about my options. Your article describes most of my experience with Apple. After multiple calls to their support line and trips to the Apple Store, my phone was replaced without having to pay the $329 fee. They informed me that they had made an exception for me and not to expect it in the future. The experience was extremely disappointing.” Christopher: “I bought the 6 Plus with the 128 GB when it first came out. At first it worked great, then the camera had issues. They replaced the phone and I was back a month later. They repaired that phone for the same camera issue and it still continued. Well now I am on my 4th, yes 4th phone, that they replaced, and countless repairs. I agree that the iPhone 6 Plus has some major engineering issues that they won't fix. "I have had five of these phones, three of which had the touch screen issue" The last issue was with the logic board. I had that phone only two weeks before it started that problem. I recently went in because it became so bad I couldn't even make an emergency phone call if I had to. They looked at it and told me it was an issue with the logic board and instantly brought out a new iPhone. I have been so pissed off with this phone and them just repairing it or replacing it with another phone that has issues. I do believe this will be the last Apple product that I will buy. I find it unacceptable that this is the fourth phone with countless repairs. Thinking of the time that I have spent in the Apple Store, because it's a minimum of an hour, I can't imagine the amount of time I have wasted there.” Jen: “This client was two hours late to our meeting because he was stuck at an Apple store because his phone had lines and couldn't be used. They told him it was a disease the screen had and he had to purchase another phone. He purchased the iPhone 7.” Ray: “I have had five of these phones, three of which had the touch screen issue, (one got stolen). I'm currently on my fifth and waiting to upgrade to something that isn't an Apple product, this is over a two year period by the way. I paid for one of these phones out of pocket which was awful, 324 dollars later and I had a phone that shit the bed in three months. This was my most extreme case obviously. The rest of the phones take about six or seven months to break, and every single Apple employee knows about it. They all say it's common with these phones and I always try and ask for a different model. I even asked for an iPhone 5 because I didn't want to deal with this anymore and they wouldn't budge. Five iPhone 6 Pluses later and I've had it with Apple.” Kristin: “My phone has had problems from the start and I really haven't had it that long. The screen just never really worked right, but just last weekend, I couldn't answer an incoming call, I wiped the screen with my shirt sleeve and then restarted it and it seemed ok. I thought about taking it in for repair but realized I couldn't reproduce it in the store since it only happens sporadically. Thank you for your article. It reassured me that I'm not going crazy!” Topics: apple, iphones, iphone 6 plus, Touch Disease, repair, Right to Repair, machines, short circuit Contact the author by email or Twitter.

The #1 Top Paid item in the Messages App Store, Phoneys employs a simple trick to make the illusion work: it provides stickers that look exactly like the blue iMessage bubbles. Phoneys developer Adam Howell says Apple told him it would be pulling the app next Thursday unless it’s fundamentally changed so that the stickers looked nothing like iMessage bubbles. Apple objected that Phoneys uses its trademarked San Francisco typeface and iMessage bubble design without permission. Howell, who works full-time as a remote employee for San Francisco-based Lithium, explains in a blog post on Medium: Apple’s lawyers weren’t happy that Phoneys got through the review process. The stickers couldn’t be blue or green, they couldn’t use San Francisco as the typeface, and the app could no longer be marketed as a “prank” app, because Apple doesn’t approve prank apps (even though I myself had never used the word “prank” when marketing Phoneys, others did, and I certainly understood where he [Apple employee] was coming from). Apple gave him until next Thursday to fundamentally change the app so that the bubbles looked something closer to “comic book cartoon bubbles”. As mentioned, the hilarious app includes dozens of stickers resembling iMessage bubbles, each with a different message written on it. As you know, stickers in iOS 10 Messages can be stamped on top of chat bubbles. Therefore, placing one of the Phoneys stickers over your friend’s message bubble makes it look as if they texted you self-deprecating statements like “I have terrible taste in music”, “You make this parenting thing look easy”, “My political views are totally wrong”, “The sports team I pull for sucks” and so forth. The idea for the app was born out of an experiment, Howell told TechCrunch: I noticed how you could completely cover up texts with stickers. I started joking with a friend that I could maybe make him say anything I wanted. So I made a couple quick stickers locally on my iPhone to test it out, and sure enough it worked. After tweeting out the idea, he received lots of positive feedback and decided to turn the project into a reality in the form of a downloadable sticker pack for iOS 10 Messages. Encouraged by the app’s success and the fact that Apple approved it without objection, he even contemplated releasing another set of prank stickers and creating a brand new dedicated app that would let people write their own “phoney” texts. The 99-cent sticker pack is currently live in the App Store, so download it now if you like before Howell changes it substantially, which would defeat the very purpose of the app, or Apple removes it a week from today.

A kind of warning should have been included in the app description… but not gonna sue the guy 😉 PhoneTechJay You’re right. I mean they should make it known that if you have a different font size it wont look uniform, and the same goes for the other person, if they have a different font size they should know right away.

Tech reviews and broad tech industry media coverage are often about the cutting edge of technology, and as a result can be very critical of anything seen as less than stellar. But the reality is that many ordinary people regularly use technology that could be much more accurately described as “good enough” rather than bleeding-edge. The vast majority of us aren’t using the latest and greatest technology, not least because that often costs more than we’re willing (or able) to spend, and yet we do just fine. This creates an odd disconnect between how real people use technology and how the experts talk about that same technology. EarPods and defaults Every iPhone ever shipped has come with a pair of Apple-provided earbuds in the box, just as iPods did before them. These earbuds have never been at the forefront of headphone technology — they’re small, relatively cheap to manufacture and make no claim to be anything more than they are. But Apple nevertheless made them part of its early ad campaigns for the iPod, and they became a fashion statement of sorts. In a recent survey conducted by Tech.pinions editor Ben Bajarin, more than half of those surveyed said they used the headphones that came in the box. For many people, the basic option is just fine, and they’ll never look beyond it. The fact is, defaults are powerful. Many people use those defaults, especially when they’re good enough. That’s not to say there aren’t better options out there for audiophiles, or those who want noise-canceling or over-ear options, but it is to say that, for many people, the basic option is just fine, and they’ll never look beyond it. This is obviously important in the context of the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack on the new iPhone 7. Apple is banking on the fact the majority of people who buy one of these new phones will use the new Lightning-based EarPods, just as they have always used their 3.5mm predecessors. Those who don’t will use the free adapter with their existing headphones, or start or continue using wireless options. Deciding where good enough is enough It’s notable, however, that Apple chose not to ship Bluetooth earbuds in the box, even though its vision for the future is a wireless one. Why is this? I think there are two reasons. First, as a practical financial matter, “good enough” in a Bluetooth headset costs significantly more than in wired earbuds, and Apple didn’t want to either raise the price or lower the margins on new iPhones to accommodate that increased cost. But I think the other reason is that there is a dividing line between products that can afford to be simply good enough and those that can’t. Apple wants to evangelize wireless technology, and you don’t sell a vision based on “good enough” products. You make the very best to sell the story and then, over time, you supply options which are good enough to meet needs further down market. When the perception of a product affects the perception of your brand, you can’t just do “good enough” (unless that’s the brand identity you’re going for, as with Amazon’s Basics line of electronics). Hence, Apple’s very different focus with its AirPods, which are on par with Apple’s hero products in terms of the positioning, marketing and, yes, pricing. This marks a departure for the Apple brand in the headphone space, although, of course, the acquisition of Beats brought higher-end headphones into the company under a separate brand. That, in turn, signifies something about the broader significance Apple expects the AirPods to take on over time, something others have written about here and elsewhere, and which I’ll likely tackle separately soon. The challenge of premium One of the biggest challenges for consumer electronics brands is targeting the premium segment while also serving lower segments of the market. One of Apple’s strengths is it has never really strayed from its premium positioning, even as it has brought several of its major product lines down in price over time. Conversely, other smartphone vendors looking to target the high end have also served the mid-market, and have struggled to associate their brands with premium positioning. This becomes particularly challenging when the same brands put out “good enough” and premium products in the same product category, like smartphones. Part of Apple’s genius has been carefully separating the categories where it provides premium products from those where it participates at a good-enough level, and not allowing the two to mix or converge. The fact that Motorola and Samsung produce both high-end flagships and very cheap low-end smartphones doesn’t help their attempts to compete with Apple for the premium customer, and Motorola has arguably largely abandoned the very high end in the last year or two. In the car market, this problem is solved with sub-brands (think Lexus versus Toyota, or Cadillac versus Chevy), but we haven’t yet seen that approach play out in the consumer technology market in the same way. Disruption theory and jobs to be done Clayton Christensen’s Disruption Theory comes into play here, too — when companies insist on providing only a premium version of certain products, they risk low-end disruption from competitors catering to the needs of those who feel over-served by the current options. However, despite repeated predictions that the premium smartphone market would eventually be disrupted in this way, it hasn’t happened. Yes, low-end Android smartphones have become increasingly capable and cheap, but that’s disrupted almost entirely other Android smartphone vendors rather than Apple. Products that have strong personal associations — smartphones, cars, clothing and other luxury goods — are stubbornly resistant to low-end disruption. I believe there’s something about products that have strong personal associations — such as smartphones, cars, clothing and other luxury goods — which make them stubbornly resistant to low-end disruption. Our use of these products says something about us, and using cheaper imitators may not convey the message we want. The job to be done of smartphones and other similar products, then, goes beyond their obvious functions, and is another reason why “good enough” isn’t good enough for at least some buyers who can afford to be more discriminating. This continues to be one of many fascinating aspects of the smartphone market that separate it from the rest of the consumer electronics industry and continue to make it such an interesting one to follow.

In consumer technology, the two easiest paths to success are to be either first or best. Take smartwatches, for example: Pebble broke Kickstarter records because it was the first capable wearable in the category. Apple's wearable arrived late, but it's universally considered to be the most powerful smartwatch on the market. Now the Apple Watch has an overwhelming market share, while Pebble does its best to hang on to its early adopters.  The very same thing is happening with virtual reality headsets.  Oculus vs. HTC The Oculus Rift, another Kickstarter darling, is practically a household name, thanks in no small part to Facebook's acquisition of Oculus and the device's long development time. The Rift was the first VR headset to prove that it could be taken seriously, but it's not the best. That title belongs to the HTC Vive.  HTC Vive HTC HTC's Vive virtual reality headset is fast becoming the go-to hardware of choice for anyone who wants to go beyond Google Cardboard and experience the full potential of VR. The differences between the Rift and Vive are bigger than you'd guess by looking at them side-by-side. Display resolution, which is always the first thing users latch on to as a point of comparison, is an identical 1080 x 1200 per eye, with a 90Hz refresh rate.  Where the Vive separates itself is with its room-scale tracking and motion controllers. With the Rift, looking around, standing, and leaning a bit is the extent to which you can feel immersed in the virtual world. It's impressive, but only until you experience the Vive's room-scale VR tracking, which allows you to walk around the virtual world with your own feet. Combined with the Vive's motion controllers, the system is capable of tracking intricate movements, letting you crouch behind cover in a war game, or walk 360-degrees around a virtual sculpture as you chip away bits of digital rock.  Oculus Rift w/ Touch Controllers Oculus Oculus is planning to add room-scale VR support to the Rift by the end of the year, which will require additional movement sensors along with Oculus Touch motion controllers. No firm price or release date for these add-ons has been revealed, but it will likely close the gap between the Rift's $600 cost and the $800 HTC Vive, which already comes with the sensors and controllers needed for the full-room experience.  Oculus' woes Aside from coming up short in capability, Oculus has another problem, and it's one of timing. Developers have been working on Rift VR titles for years, and the more-capable HTC Vive debuted at a time when those developers were just reaching the limits of what the Rift was capable of in terms of tracking and "presence," as they so often like to call it. Many made the switch to the Vive and haven't looked back. In a VRDC poll released last month, more developers said they were working on Vive titles than for any other device.  Earlier this year, in an obvious attempt at holding on to the third-party developers who had been producing Rift experiences for months, Oculus began enforcing its headset-exclusive DRM policy that blocked Rift-enabled games from being played on the HTC Vive. It was a move born out of the simple fact that the Vive could do what the Rift does, and then some.  Developers, eager to make as much money and reach as many customers as possible, were outraged, and for good reason. Many felt that they were being punished for the limitations of the Rift, over which they had no control. The situation became so dire that Oculus grew tired of attempting to block Vive users and disabled the DRM restriction entirely.  SUPERHYPERCUBE will not be supporting Oculus. https://t.co/sqtAzZ8hJZ— Polytron (@Polytron) September 23, 2016 The Oculus Touch accessories should, the company hopes, bring the Rift and Vive back into parity. Unfortunately for Oculus, it may no longer be a matter of hardware capability but of brand loyalty. On top of that, the recent news that Oculus founder Palmer Luckey was secretly funding a pro-Trump online trolling campaign has left many developers with a sour taste about the platform as a whole.  Viveport Today, HTC launched another volley in the direction of Oculus with the launch of Viveport. Viveport, which has been available to developers for several weeks in its beta form, is home to Vive games and experiences that you can't even find on the Steam marketplace, though there is a bit of crossover between the two as well.  For PC gamers, Steam has no real competitor, but Viveport doesn't need to compete with Steam to gain an audience or help the Vive become the most popular VR device on the planet. Games and software can launch first on Viveport and still find their way to Steam at a later date, or vice-versa.  So, why would HTC and Valve want to split the market like this, when their jointly developed headset is clearly positioned to take over? To understand that, just ask yourself what exactly the market for VR really is. The short answer: Nobody really knows yet.  It might feel like we've all been hearing about virtual reality forever, but real, capable VR hardware only arrived on the scene in the past couple of years. The Vive's Amazon launch just happened last week.  HTC Viveport HTC For gamers who want to wield virtual assault rifles and launch lasers from their fingertips, the Steam marketplace is already home. But what about everyone else? When the Nintendo Wii began to gain traction—before exploding into a cultural phenomenon—it quickly became clear that the people lining up at 2 o'clock in the morning to buy it weren't your typical early adopters, and the same could be true once VR inevitably reaches critical mass.  For those non-gamers, putting another barrier between them and VR content is simply bad business. With Viveport, those customers can browse a huge library of content that they know will work with the device that they have, without having to filter out non-VR games or games designed for other hardware. Even its competitors' Oculus store hosts content for both the Rift and the Gear VR headsets, meaning that seeing something cool doesn't automatically mean it's made for you.  Software on Viveport is universally accessible in more than 30 countries. Finding something interesting on Viveport is a matter of a mouse click, and the added bonus of region-free support is icing on the cake.  PlayStation VR (PSVR) PSVR is the ultimate question mark in the virtual reality space. Using the most popular game console on the market—the PlayStation 4—as its base unit, the PSVR has a built-in advantage. It also uses the PlayStation Camera and PS Move motion controllers that many people already own, further lowering the barrier of entry and learning curve.  PlayStation VR System w/ PS4 Console PlayStation In terms of hardware specs, it's comparable with the Rift and Vive, though the display resolution of the PSVR is slightly less than that of its competitors. It's priced lower than the Rift and Vive as well, at $399, but where the PSVR really has the potential to shine is in its software.  PlayStation pulls some serious weight when it comes to developer loyalty, and big names are already lining up to support the PSVR either at launch or shortly thereafter. Batman Arkham VR, Eve: Valkyrie, and Resident Evil 7 will undoubtedly tempt many, many gamers into taking the VR plunge first on PlayStation, though we won't know exactly how many until after the device's Oct. 13 launch.  Just the beginning It's an exciting time to be a virtual reality fan. Whether you're an Oculus Rift fan, an HTC Vive owner, or still waiting for the PlayStation VR to arrive before you make your decision, the competition in the market is pushing the industry forward faster than ever. The next 12 to 24 months will show us just who has the longevity and creativity to draw us out of the real world and into theirs.  Apple View all 1068 stories → Facebook View all 702 stories → Is HTC Vive the virtual reality system for you?

First, a sunglasses-wearing man flew into an iRage inside of an Apple store in Dijon, France, walking around the store and methodically smashing iPhones, iPads and computers. Related: Look Incredibly Cool by Mastering These iOS 10 iMessage Features Right Away The incident was captured on video and shows the man coolly destroying thousands of dollars worth of Apple products with a metal bowling ball until a security guard stopped him. The man was apparently ticked off about being refused a refund and alleged Apple "violates customer rights," according to the BBC. Local media reported the man was arrested and a police investigation is underway. Apple declined to comment. The crazy train doesn't stop there, though. An iPhone 7 video hoax made the rounds this week, claiming customers upset about the absence of a traditional headphone jack in their iPhone 7 can drill into the device to reveal a hidden port. While it's unclear how many people fell for the do-it-yourself prank solution, the video has been viewed more than 13 million times. Some enraged commenters even claimed to have tried the DIY hack and complained when it — unsurprisingly — did not work. It's important to consider the source before doing something radical to a device that has a starting price of $649. The video comes from TechRax, whose other videos include "What Happens If You Microwave an iPhone 7?" and "How to Properly Grind an iPhone 6."

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Notebooks Apple MacBook Pro Rumored For October 24th Launch As More Details Surface By Ramish Zafar Posted 2 months ago 20Shares Share Tweet Submit All done with the launch of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, Apple’s ow focusing aggressively on the MacBook. Reports surrounding the notebook have started to increase as September ends. While we’ve heard some analysts comment that a late September launch might be on the cards, it doesn’t look to be that way. Now, more sources have started to speculate on an October launch for the notebooks. In fact, some have gone as far as to give a precise launch date. Take a look below to find out more. Apple To Launch MacBook Pro In Late October Claim Multiple Sources Apple’s launch of the MacBook has been in the rumor mill for quite a while. The biggest question surrounding this year’s notebook launches from Cupertino is whether we’ll get to see Intel’s Kaby Lake on board. Current word on the street doesn’t make it out to be that way. We’re hearing more about AMD and Polaris’ potential presence on Apple’s product portfolio. Now, multiple sources claim to be in the know-how of the MacBook Pro’s launch date. Both of them believe that the notebook will be launched in late October. It’s believed that Apple’s working on an aggressive schedule. The company’s current focus on macOS 10.12.1 is geared towards catering to hardware upgrades for the lineup. To that end, the MacBook Pro is expected to feature several interesting upgrades this year. Advertisement TheApplePost is also reporting a potential launch date for the MacBook Pro. According to their sources, Apple will launch the notebooks on October 24th. This marks a month until the notebooks are finally unveiled by Cupertino. Furthermore, it’s also believed that Cupertino will seed one more beta version of macOS 10.12.1 to developers and public next week. There’s little information on Cupertino’s plans for the MacBook Air, with some analysts claiming that the gadget will also see an upgrade. The MacBook Pro is expected to feature several upgrades on board. For starters, it’s rumored with an OLED touch bar. This will replace the top function key bar on the notebook, and make for much more interactive methods of input. Secondly, Touch ID is also expected to finally make it on the MacBook Pro. This will also include Apple Pay support as users will get to authenticate their transactions directly from their MacBooks. Thoughts?

Wang Obsession 2016 September 30, 2016 More than just a few eyebrows were raised when Apple Music announced earlier this week that R&B artist Mary J. Blige would interview Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in a half-hour segment on Blige’s new show, The 411. That’s largely because the one-minute teaser released by the streaming service was downright uncomfortable—featuring Blige passionately singing about racism and police brutality to a stilted-looking Clinton sitting two feet away. Like you’ve never seen them before.@MaryJBlige sits down with @HillaryClinton.#The411 Coming September 30th.https://t.co/hbaWqfjJcp pic.twitter.com/P2qpm3h3Pm — Apple Music (@AppleMusic) September 27, 2016 The memes all but wrote themselves. Apple Music released the whole interview Sept. 30—which you can watch here, even without an Apple Music subscription—and the conversation between Blige and Clinton actually offers some unexpected depth. Among the topics discussed are leadership lessons Clinton learned from years of watching her husband serve as president, as well as her frustration with her public image. “I do believe that when you’re in the public eye, whether it’s in entertainment or it’s in politics, you do have the challenge of presenting yourself and having people perceive you as who you think you are,” Clinton said. As for Blige’s seemingly out-of-nowhere a capella stunt? The singer explained that she chose to sing lyrics from Bruce Springsteen’s “American Skin” to the presidential candidate in an effort to make Clinton personally feel the frustration of the US’s black community. It worked. Clinton, grasping hands with Blige at one point, said she is “heartbroken” that “African American parents have to sit their children down and deliver the message that you just sang.” Said Clinton, “I think you should sing in every interview that you do. It’s so emotionally powerful, Mary.” Apple Music will soon release a handful more episodes from Blige’s show, which is hosted exclusively on the streaming service. The singer told journalists that none of the others will feature her singing from her seat. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

The discussions, which are also being held with Alphabet Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., form part of the lender’s efforts to double the number of customers on its mobile-phone platform to 20 million by the end of 2017, Oigara said in an interview at his office in the capital, Nairobi, on Wednesday. The unit, known as KCB Fintech, will officially begin operations in June 2017, he said. The subsidiary will “partner with different players, whether it is M-Pesa, Facebook, Google, Apple and that business will have a new digital-payments platform,” he said. M-Pesa is the mobile-phone payments system pioneered by Vodafone Plc unit Safaricom Ltd., which handled 5.29 trillion shillings ($52 billion) of transactions last year, equivalent to more than 80 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. Banks in East Africa’s biggest economy are scrambling for market share in digital transactions with 25 million mobile-money subscribers spending 312 billion shillings ($3.1 billion) on goods and services in the three months through March, according to data compiled by the Communications Authority of Kenya . Lenders are seeking new sources of revenue after the government capped lending rates, pressuring margins. Double Up KCB is doubling capacity on its mobile-phone systems so it can handle 600 transactions per second by next year, Oigara said. A surge in demand for loans caused the platform to collapse last week. KCB is also in talks with Paypal Holdings Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and Twitter Inc., Chief Digital Officer Edward Ndichu, who will head KCB Fintech, said in an interview. “This is the journey we are going through,” Ndichu said. “We need to benchmark with the needs of the customer.” Shares in KCB Group have fallen 38 percent this year to 27 shillings by close of Thursday trading in Nairobi. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Sep 30, 2016 at 1:49PM iPhone 7. Image source: Apple. Geographically speaking, investors are well aware of where Apple, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) priorities lie. Greater China is one of the company's main growth engines at this point, and continues to march toward a day when it overtakes the U.S. business. CEO Tim Cook has predicted this will occur within the next few years, but right now the U.S. is still about $25 billion larger on a trailing-12-month basis. India is the next big country to tackle, while Apple slowly continues to build out its operations in Russia. That covers three of the BRIC countries. But what about the "B"? Brazil is just part of the picture It wasn't until early 2014 that Apple opened its first retail store in Brazil, and there are currently only two stores within the country. Beyond just Brazil, it may surprise you to learn that Apple's business in Canada and South America combined is actually extremely small. Apple reports Americas as a geographical operating segment, while separately disclosing the international mix of sales in its earnings releases. We can use the inverse of this figure to calculate Apple's domestic U.S. revenue, and then compare that to the broader Americas segment. Here's what we get if we back out U.S. revenue from Americas revenue. Data source: SEC filings, author's calculations. Graph by author. Americas ex-U.S. revenue, which would include all of Canada and all of South America, is typically only in the ballpark of $3 billion per quarter, plus or minus a billion or so. (The average since 2014 is $2.8 billion per quarter.) Apple has been doing quite well in emerging markets recently with various initiatives intended to make iPhones more affordable. To be clear, Apple has long faced headwinds in Brazil, mostly in the form of massive import tariffs that make it the most expensive country in the world to buy an iPhone. The whole only-two-stores-in-the-country thing doesn't help, either (even though Apple sells through third-party distributors). The Brazilian real has also been fairly volatile in recent years, making it tricky for Apple to properly price its products as it must navigate currency translation effects (net of hedging). Put another way, Canada and South America represent about 5% of overall revenue. It's true that the BRIC countries have experienced slowing growth and other macroeconomic headwinds recently, but it still feels like Apple could be doing more to expand its business in Canada and South America.

Ontario’s apple country in the Meaford-Collingwood area offers visitors the Applie Pie Trail. File photo/Postmedia Network Tweet Change text size for the story Print Report an error Planning to head to northern Ontario this fall? If so, you might want to consider checking out the Apple Pie Trail at visit applepietrail.ca. Ontario's apple country in the Meaford-Collingwood area is a special place where the moderating effects of Georgian Bay and the Niagara Escarpment create perfect conditions for growing apples and baking perfect apple pieces. While travelling the quiet country roads of the Blue Mountains you can enjoy the sweet aroma of blossoms in the spring, ripening fruit in the summer, brilliant colours in the fall and crisp sheets of white in the winter. I'm sure Don Thompson and Hector Delanghe will be calling asking for equal billing for the apple orchards in south Chatham-Kent. Meanwhile, the Thornbury-Clarksburg Rotary Club invites you to a "run through apple country'' Oct. 16 starting out at the Beaver Valley Community Centre in Thornbury. There will be a 1 k kids fun run and a 21 k run, 10 k and 5 k run/walk.   Planning for Monster Jam Tickets for Monster Jam, the most adrenaline-charged motorsports experience for families on the planet, are now on sale for the shows scheduled for Feb. 11 and 12 at London's Budweiser Gardens. Monster Jam events are affordably priced for the whole family with seats starting at $20. Approximately 12 feet tall and 12 feet wide, Monster Jam trucks are custom-designed machines that sit atop 66-inch-tall tires and weigh a minimum of 10,000 pounds. Built for short, high-powered bursts of speed, the trucks generate 1,500 to 2,000 horsepower and are capable of speeds of up to 100 mph. The trucks can fly up to 125 to 130 feet in distance and up to 35 feet in the air. Pit parties on Feb. 11 and 12 run from 10:30 a.m. to 12 noon and give fans an opportunity to get up close and personal with the Monster Jam trucks and drivers. Pit party passes are $10. For more information on the Monster Jam shows visit www.MonsterJam.com.   Special chairs celebrate Collingwood trails A total of 24 painted Muskoka chairs that have adorned the Collingwood downtown area for much of the summer and fall will go the highest bidder during a silent auction sale that begins at 10 a.m. and ends at 1 p.m. There is a minimum bid price of $50. The chairs were painted in a recreation theme by local artists and have been the talk of the town for months. Chairs were created by aspiring young artists from Collingwood Collegiate Institute to world-renowned professionals who live in the area. The unique art created on the Muskoka-style chairs in this year's theme was to celebrate 25 years of trails in Collingwood. If you are looking for that special, affordable piece of art that will add uniqueness to your yard or porch then the auction is a must. For more information visit collingwooddowntown.com. The silent auction is all part of the town's "harvest of art'' culminating during the Thanksgiving weekend. From the farmers' market, live entertainment on the street, children's activities and free wagon rides to strolling and shopping the historical downtown, there is something for everyone to experience during the much-anticipated art chair auction.   New scare-zones at Wonderland If you like Halloween you will love the three new scare-zones being featured this fall at Halloween Haunt at Canada's Wonderland north of Toronto. Originally known as "fearfest,'' the special event runs after the park's regular operating hours on Friday, Saturday and Sunday evenings this month up to and including Halloween night. It is Canada's largest haunted theme park featuring over 300 monsters, nine walk-through maze attractions, six uniquely-themed atmospheric scare areas and three live shows. During its operation, the grounds are transformed via decorative props, thematic music and eerie lighting to further create its scary atmosphere. The haunted theme park concept was first introduced in in 2005 and called "fearfest'' while the park was under the ownership of Paramount Parks. With the change in ownership of the park from Paramount to the Cedar Fair Entertainment Company, the "fearfest'' name was dropped and renamed Halloween Haunt. New this year is an updated "Club Blood: Revamp'' and the three new scarezones including Cryohazard, The Plague and Trick or Treat.   What’s ahead • The Petrolia Legion's second annual Ocktoberfest event is slated for Oct. 8 beginning at 2 p.m. • A murder mystery comedy dinner and theatre is scheduled for Oct. 22 at Countryview Golf Course on highway 40 north of Chatham. The event is called "Ghouls Just Wanna Have Fun'' and it calls for audience participation. Proceeds will go to CK Animal Rescue. • The Collingwood Downtown BIA is gearing up for the annual Harvest of Arts Oct. 8-10. Celebrate the bounty of the harvest at the last farmers' market of the season and enjoy music and family activities throughout the downtown area. • The annual Santa Claus parade and tree lighting ceremony in the Town of Wasaga Beach is scheduled for Nov. 26. The public is invited to join in for Christmas music, caroling and a family skate at Oakview Woods outdoor rink from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. • If you are in the market for a unique one-of-a-kind piece of furniture then head to downtown Collingwood on Oct. 11. ••• Readers are invited to submit their questions and suggestions on travel close to home or far away to Travel Writer Bob Boughner at bobgboughner@gmail.com or call 519-355-9672.

Will the refreshed MacBook Pro break free from Intel chips? by Chris Smith 30 September 2016 0 shares Read Comments Apple is reportedly considering ditching Intel processors for the rumoured MacBook Pro refresh, thought to the coming next month. According to reports, the hotly-anticipated machine could feature an AMD Zen APU. According to Italian website bits and chips, Intel’s Kaby Lake and Coffee Lake units are not progressing as fast as hoped, prompting Apple to consider a different solution. The report says, AMD may have been tapped to create a custom SoC design for the new MacBook Pro. It is already thought AMD may leak the Polaris 10 GPU into the new MacBook so AMD could be doubling up here. Recent reports suggest Apple will announce the new MacBook Pro in late October, after it was left out of September’s iPhone 7 announcement. The laptop is rumoured to feature a touch-sensitive OLED panel to replace the current function keys. It is also thought the company could ditch the MagSafe charging solution for USB-C, a la the 12-inch Retina MacBook.

Trending in Apple How Apple’s stock apps will use the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro [Gallery] September 30 AAPL: 113.05 0.87 Apple pulling #1 Top Paid sticker pack over faked iMessage bubbles, clarifies no prank apps allowed Benjamin Mayo - 2 months ago @bzamayo Apps & Updates iOS 10 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit In the first high-profile iMessage App Store rejection we’ve seen, the developer of the Phoneys sticker pack says Apple has reached out with bad news: the company will pull the app in a week if it is not significantly changed. Phoneys (currently) features stickers that look like iMessage bubbles, effectively allowing users to replace messages from their friends with some funny alternative text. The app hit #1 Top Paid in the iMessage App Store. Despite getting approved initially, Apple says that the store does not accept “prank apps” and the current form of the stickers violate Apple trademarks … The developer, Adam Howell, received a phone call from Apple soon after the sticker pack shot to the #1 spot in the iMessage App Store. The Apple representative said that the Phoneys app impinges on Apple trademarks using the San Francisco font-face and the same green and blue bubbles that Messages uses. Apple also said that it could no longer be marketed as a prank app. (Howell says he never referred to it as a prank app but that he can see why media and others thought of it that way). As it stands, the sticker pack will be pulled from the App Store in a week’s time. Apple is giving a week’s notice so that Howell can update the app to comply with their guidelines. Bill was nice, but to the point. Apple’s lawyers weren’t happy that Phoneys got through the review process. The stickers couldn’t be blue or green, they couldn’t use San Francisco as the typeface, and the app could no longer be marketed as a “prank” app, because Apple doesn’t approve prank apps (even though I myself had never used the word “prank” when marketing Phoneys, others did, and I certainly understood where he was coming from). They were not going to pull the app, Bill made sure to emphasize. They’d give me a week, until next Thursday, to fundamentally change it so that the bubbles looked nothing like iMessage bubbles, instead looking something closer to “comic book cartoon bubbles”. I said okay, thanks a lot Bill, and that was the end of the conversation. As the whole point is that the stickers look like iMessage bubbles, Apple’s offer to update the app to feature ‘comic book cartoon bubbles’ isn’t really a solution as it would change the purpose of the application completely. It’s all in the name of the app, it is meant to be amusingly deceptive. It’s called “Phoneys” because it makes it look like the recipient wrote something different. Apple’s requirements to change the iMessage bubbles into comic book callouts will destroy the illusion and the stickers will no longer be confusable with the actual message. Naturally, this is the kind of app that was in a ‘grey area’ from the beginning — Howell even says his wife was surprised that it got approved. It was always toeing the line of what was acceptable but it was approved without dispute by Apple. That’s the real flaw here in the process: Apple originally approved the app as is and only followed up with its intent to remove it after it became popular. The company is being nice about the process, by giving Phoneys time to change rather than pulling immediately without explanation, but the root cause is a problem. App Review is useless if it blindly approves everything until something becomes popular enough to deserve closer attention. Still, this is the first high-profile sticker pack rejection we’ve heard about it. Howell hasn’t decided whether he will comply with Apple’s demands or just remove the app from sale. Right now, it continues to be the #1 Top Paid app in the iMessage store so grab it whilst it is still here … Guides iOS 10 iOS 10 is the latest operating system for Apple's iPhone and iPad, slated to be released to the public in the fall of 2016 View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission has started accepting applications from banks for providing Apple Pay mobile payment services and Taiwan users will be able to apply for using Apply Pay at the end of 2016 at the earliest. In terms of banks, it looks like it’ll rollout to CTBC, Cathay United Commercial, E.SUN Commercial, and Taishin International banks initially. These are the four largest banks in Taiwan. The report says that only credit cards will be supported at launch, with support for debit cards coming at a later date. Apple Pay is currently available in Australia, Canada, Mainland China, France, Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland, the UK and the United States. For those in Japan, a special Japan only model of the iPhone now supports the country’s FeliCa mobile payment system.

Eventually apps caught up, but the iPhone’s operating system itself still didn’t get the much out of the pressure-sensitive input. That has now changed with Apple’s new iOS 10, which makes much better use out of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7’s 3D Touch feature. But these invisible shortcuts can be hard to find without poking at the screen constantly. Here’s a list of some of the more useful and popular tips and tricks. Feel the (Apple) Music Apple Music’s first incarnation was criticized as needlessly complex. Thankfully, a revision in iOS 10 has made it much easier to use. If you have an iPhone 6s or iPhone 7, it gets even simpler through the use of 3D Touch. By pressing down on albums and tracks, a master menu pops up, providing quick access to features like adding tracks to your library or playlists or looking up lyrics. Take Control of the Control Panel Swiping up from the bottom of your iPhone’s home screen brings the Control Panel to the forefront. (It’s the place you go to put your iPhone in airplane mode or turn on the flashlight.) Pressing harder on the Flashlight, Timer, Calculator, and Camera buttons reveal a bunch of options for fine-tuning your phone. For instance, you can set the torch to a dimmer setting, set a one-minute timer without opening the clock app, quickly copy the figure on the calculator, or pull the camera up in video mode without all the extra taps. Give Facebook the Finger Facebook can be a total timesuck when it comes to productivity. You open it to make a quick post, and 25 minutes later you, you realize you’ve just looked through all your ex’s recent vacation photos. By pressing extra hard on the Facebook app icon, 3D Touch can help you avoid the News Feed and simply write a post or upload a photo. Make the Camera a Snap to Use Even though smartphones put cameras in everyone’s hands, it can still be hard to capture the moment. Using 3D Touch on the Camera app icon pulls up a quick action menu that vaults the camera into the selfie, video, slow-motion or plain old photo mode with only one tap. Stop Apps From Being Downloaded We’ve all been there, held hostage by a trickle of Internet bandwidth while a massive app tries to update itself. Previously you had to dive deep into the App Store to put that download on hold. With 3D Touch, pausing a download is as easily as prodding the app icon. And not only can you cut the install short, you can also tell your iPhone to download one particular app first — a lifesaver when you’ve got a screen full of updates hogging all your data. Watch Your Widgets Pushed to the forefront of iOS 10, widgets are small versions of apps made ready for quick viewing. In Apple’s newest operating system, they’re typically found by swiping the home or lock screen to the right — something that confused many iPhone fans used to “swipe to unlock.” But widgets can also be found by using 3D Touch on the icon of many apps. This can be a time saver for those moments when you want a quick peek at information. Try it out by pressing the Weather icon extra hard, and rather than opening the app fully, you’ll see the Weather widget. Be a Major Netflix Player The heart wants what it wants — unless the Netflix algorithm tells you that you want something else. To stay focused while pulling up your latest binge-watching series, push the Netflix app icon a little harder than usual. This will pull up a quick action menu that can catapult you into your list of favorite shows, display trending videos, or let you pick up your most recent program right where you left off. Nix Your Notifications 3D Touch and Apple’s notifications are a potent mix of information. The “peek and pop” capability of the feature lets users quickly dive into alerts that flash on their screen without losing their place in their phone. But you can also use 3D Touch to push all your notifications out of the way – you just need to know what button to press. On the Notification panel (swipe down from the top of the screen), you’ll see an “X” button. When pressed, this button will clear your recent alerts, but when pushed harder, it gives you the option of deleting all the notifications on that panel. It’s a great way to keep your phone tidy. Read More Be a Speed Deleter Many iPhone users know that by holding down the delete button on a paragraph of text, eventually the cursor moves faster as it gobbles up unwanted words. But if you give the backspace key a little bit of pressure, it will delete unwanted text even faster than before. Shoot Through Your Settings The iOS Settings app is packed full of various system preferences — so much so that it’s difficult to find what you need in there. But by using 3D Touch on the Settings icon, users will find the big four — battery, cellular data, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth — all easy to access with a quick action menu available from the home screen. Just press down and tap on the one you want, and presto, you’re in control of some of your iPhone’s most important capabilities.

Hires Former Apple PR Veteran The key hire adds to an impressive (and necessary) recruiting streak as the company prepares for vigorous growth. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Sep 30, 2016 at 12:20PM Image source: The Motley Fool. Ahead of a planned launch of its lower-cost Model 3 late next year and a ramp-up of total vehicle production from about 50,000 units 2015 to 500,000 units in 2018, Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) is attracting notable new talent. And its latest hire from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reinforces the company's ability to attract top-notch professionals. An important hire About a month after Tesla's lead public relations representative Khobi Brooklyn left the company, the young automaker has hired public relations talent from Apple. After working for Apple's public relations team for over eight years, Sarah O'Brien recently updated her job in her LinkedIn profile to Sr. Director of Communications at Tesla, as pointed out on Friday by Electrek. O'Brien's LinkedIn profile shows at least 12 years of public relations experience. At Apple she initially held a position working as PR for the company's music offerings in the tech giant's EMEIA (Europe, Middle East, India, Africa) markets, and she more recently worked on communications for iPhone --up until this month -- according to her LinkedIn profile. O'Brien has stepped into a role with a turbulent history. Brooklyn was head of Tesla's global communications only for several months, following Ricardo Reyes' 18-month stretch as the PR team's lead -- which was actually his second time at Tesla as its head of communications. Reyes had left Tesla in 2012 to work at mobile payments start-up Square. Model X tows a mobile Tesla store -- one of the company's unconventional marketing approaches as it refrains from ad spend and sells its vehicles directly to consumers, bypassing dealers. Image source: Tesla Motors. It's good to see Tesla pulling talent from a company with a long track record of effective public relations. Communications efforts are arguably among Tesla's most important initiatives, as the company doesn't pay for advertising, opting to instead rely on press coverage, word-of-mouth marketing, and unconventional marketing tactics. In addition, Tesla's aggressive push of new technologies like long-range electric vehicles and its driver-assisting Autopilot often leads to abnormal levels of scrutiny in the media. A recruiting spree This hire follows several other important hires for the company. Late last year, Tesla recruited Google's former VP of finance Jason Wheeler as its new chief financial officer, following former Tesla CFO Deepak Ahuja's retirement. Wheeler joined Tesla as the company doubled down its efforts to generate operating cash flow from Model S and Model X ahead of planned big spending for its higher-volume Model 3 production. And Tesla reinforced its finance team even more in September, when it hired solar industry veteran Eric Branderiz to join as the company's corporate controller and chief accounting officer, just ahead of Tesla's attempt to acquire SolarCity. Tesla has also made some notable manufacturing hires recently. In May, it poached Volkswagen's head of manufacturing of its Audi A4, A5, and Q5 vehicles, representing production of about 400,000 vehicles per year. The company followed up this manufacturing hire with the recruitment of Apple's director of reliability engineering, David Erhart. Erhart will reportedly take on the role of senior director of reliability. Of course, Tesla's recent track record of attracting talented executives isn't spotless. Adding to a history of crossing over between Tesla and Apple, Tesla's vice president of vehicle engineering Chris Porritt left Tesla in late 2015 and eventually joined Apple. A growing, talented team of experienced executives doesn't necessarily make Tesla a more attractive investment since it is expected from a company preparing to increase production so rapidly. But it's at least confirming the automaker's ability to attract top talent from market leaders. And Tesla's latest PR hire, in particular, fills an important role for the company at a critical time.

In a surreal turn of events, a livid Apple customer was caught on camera as he began smashing iPhone 7s in an apple store in France. The video, embedded below, shows the Frenchman taking iPhones out of their holders before smashing them with a Petanque ball. Even more bizarrely, the man is wearing a cream glove – presumably to protect his hand – as well as sunglasses, making it seem as though this was a well thought-out attack. Supposedly, the man was angry with the Californian tech giant over the service he received. In a different video he can be heard shouting: "Apple is a company that 'violated' European consumers' rights. They refused to reimburse me, I told them: 'Give me my money back'. They said no. So you know what's happening? This is happening!" A longer video shows the man also destroying a selection of iPods and a MacBook Air, which probably cost the Apple Store thousands of euros in damages: Despite it looking like no steps were taken to restrain the rampaging iHater, videos have now surfaced showing him grappling with the store’s security. He is now reported to be in the custody of the French police. Related: iPhone 8 Watch: iPhone 7 review What do you think of the furious Frenchman? Let us know in the comments.

Angry Apple Customer Goes Bananas in Store, Destroys iPhones with Steel Ball GO Maybe he’s angry because he no longer has a headphone jack? Sep 30, 2016 16:44 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Ever wanted to walk into an Apple store and destroy everything you see with a steel ball? No? This guy did and because we’re always encouraged to make our dreams come true, this is exactly what he did in an Apple Store in France. While details on why exactly he did that are quite vague at this point, it looks like the angry Apple customer decided to take revenge on Apple for its poor customer support by destroying everything in his way in a store in Dijon, France. The videos recorded by someone who caught the entire show, embedded at the end of this article, present the man calmly walking in and checking out some of the devices on display before eventually starting destroying them with what seems to be a steel ball. Police took him into custody, now having to pay thousands of Euros In case you’re wondering who carries a steel ball around, it appears that Petanque players do, as this is a game that involves throwing a super heavy steel ball as close as possible to another smaller ball made from wood. After smashing a few iPhones, iPods, and at least a MacBook Air, the man tries to walk out of the store just as calmly as he stepped in, but this time also trying to win the bonus round and get past security. The same videos show him attempting to run away at least once, although that’s quite impossible after destroying so many expensive products, and reports coming from local media reveal that, eventually, he was taken into custody by the police. Little is known about his motivation for destroying the Apple store, but it appears that he was kind of angry with the way customer support treated him before. Or maybe, just maybe, he was angry with Apple’s decision to remove the headphone jack. Just saying. UPDATE, October 27: The man who destroyed the Apple store received a six-month suspended sentence in jail and is on probation for the next two years. He's also forbidden from entering the mall where it went bananas, and has to pay €17,548 ($19,000) in damages.

It’s quite a spectacular sight given the enormous scale of the flying saucer-shaped structure. Apple Campus 2, as it’s officially called, will become home to more than 12,000 employees when it’s completed some time in early 2017. Duncan’s 4K video, shot using the DJI Inspire 1 Pro, reveals that a lot has changed at the iSpaceship site in the last 30 days as we’re now seeing significant landscaping development and finishing touches on the ring-shaped building itself. The voiceover in the video is an excerpt from Jony Ive’s tribute speech to Steve Jobs at Apple’s October 2011 memorial service held at its Cupertino headquarters. To give you a better feel for the massive scale of the building, here’s ground-level footage of iSpaceship captured by The Loop’s Jim Dalrymple. “This past weekend, I had the chance to swing by the Apple Campus 2 construction site. I took a quick bit of footage from one of the side roads,” Dalrymple wrote. “I think it gives a real sense of just how big the main building really is. The drone flyovers give a sense of relative scale, but up close the building feels massive.” The flyover clip from Matthew Roberts can be seen below.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Steve Jobs Was Ultimate Disruptor Says Sir Richard Branson Posted: Sep 30 2016, 10:39am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Sep 30 2016, 11:58am CDT, in News | Apple   Photo Credit: Getty Images   Branson declares the late Steve Jobs as the ultimate disruptor. Sir Richard Branson is a very busy man. I saw him at Bits & Pretzels startup festival in Munich on Monday. Then he finished the grueling Strive challenge in Italy. Now he prepares for the Virgin Disruptors event taking place on Monday, October 3 in London. How To: Find Nintendo NES Classic In Stock Branson just published a blog post declaring the late Steve Jobs his pick as the ultimate disruptor. "So many people drew courage from Steve and related to his life story: college drop-outs, struggling entrepreneurs, ousted business leaders figuring out how to make a difference in the world, and people fighting debilitating illness. We have all been there in some way and can see a bit of ourselves in his personal and professional successes and struggles," says Branson. Steve Jobs died on October 5th, 2011 after a long battle with cancer. His It will be the fifth anniversary of Steve Jobs' death next week on Wednesday. Under his lead Apple became the huge force in the consumer electronics industry. Apple has set the direction for portable music players, smartphones and tablets. Some believe Apple is not the same anymore since Steve Jobs is not here anymore. He was not a saint. His egocentric and aggressive management style has caused a lot of harm too. Tim Cook's Apple appears to be more calm and structured place to work.  What Apple is missing now is a new product category as the iPhone is slowing down and the Apple Watch is not a strong enough product to keep pushing Apple forward. What would have Steve Jobs come up with? 66-year-old entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson ends his post with "Although he was completely different from me – he used to shout at employees that made mistakes and didn’t delegate much – I admired Steve so much. He was innovative, determined and, above all, passionate. He was, at all times, disruptive. Today, more than ever, you’ve got to do something radically different to make a mark. Under Steve’s guidance, Apple became the world’s most successful change-maker brand." Look out for the upcoming documentary "Don't Look Down" that is like an action movie starring Richard Branson. Don't Look Down tells the story of Branson's attempts to break world records flying in a hot air balloon in the 80s and 90s. Using interviews with Branson, his team, archive and dramatic reconstructions, the film tells a story of courage, determination, despair and triumph. The documentary premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in Spring, but has no release date yet. Watch the trailer below.

Here are a handful to help you get the most of the update. (AP File Photo 2015/Eric Risberg)   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     Apple recently released its new Mac operating system Sierra, which is available to all Mac users as a free download through Apple's Mac App Store. The update notably adds Siri to the Mac and also many of the features from iOS 10, including enriched messages. It's also called macOS, rather than OSX. That's a new name change from Apple, but loyal Mac users will find everything pretty familiar. Sierra is a big update, and there are lots of little things that you may not necessarily find on your own, hiding just below the surface. Here are a handful to help you get the most of the update. • Making Siri work for you on the Mac: One very visible update to the Mac is the inclusion of Siri, Apple's AI assistant, which you can call up by holding down the command and space bars. (You can also customize your keyboard shortcut in the System Preferences's Siri section.) There's not a way to trigger Siri on the Mac by voice alone, which presumably avoids triggering your phone and Mac simultaneously when you "Hey Siri." Siri's great for super-multitasking, since you can ask it for answers without having to leave and open another app. In addition to telling you weather forecasts and looking up information for you, Siri can also conduct sophisticated searches to show you things like, "All the documents I worked on in the past month" or "Emails this week from John Doe." Siri can also find images, which you can then drag and drop into your own files. • Universal Clipboard: If you also have an iPhone or iPad, this feature can solve the ever-annoying question of how to send a file easily between your phone and your computer. Now, you can just select and copy text or images on your phone and paste it on your Mac. (Or vice-versa, if you prefer.) There's almost nothing to set up for this one -- have your updated devices near each other, with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi enabled, and be signed into to your iCloud account on both devices. As features go, it's a pretty useful one, though there's probably little chance you'd find it without knowing it was there. • iCloud Drive: If you want to send files between devices, you can now put things into your iCloud Drive while also putting them on your desktop or documents folder, for really easy access down the line. Head to System Preference>iCloud, and then click on the "options" by iCloud drive. Hit "Desktop & Documents Folders" and your Mac will put everything in both of those folders into the cloud for easy access. (Anything else on this list with a checkmark is also backed up into iCloud.) • Optimized storage: This isn't the world's sexiest tip, but it is a useful one. Apple's added a new storage management tool that will help identify files and other things that you haven't used in a while to see if they can be erased. You can also set your trash to empty automatically every 30 days, which helps you get rid of stuff that you thought you already deleted. You can also move things to iCloud, though you may not want to do that if you don't want to fill up your storage there too quickly. • Apple Pay: Apple makes it dangerously easy to buy things on the Web in macOS Sierra. (Note: not necessarily from a security standpoint, just from an impulse shopping standpoint.) Some websites are now accepting Apple Pay as an available payment method, including Warby Parker, Lululemon and, of course, Apple's own store. Users will need to be using Safari and have either their Apple Watch or iPhone handy to do this. If you do, hit the "Apple Pay" button on the site if it's available, and you'll see the transaction come up on your smaller screen. You can confirm it by tapping on the Watch. On the iPhone, you'll have to use Touch ID to verify the purchase. • Collaborative Notes: Starting in Sierra and iOS 10, you can write notes collaboratively, meaning that you can ask other people to weigh in on the guest list you're compiling or the toast you're writing for the next wedding you're attending. This is the kind of feature that's been around in third-party apps for a long time, but it's nice to have it baked in. To invite others, simply click on the new icon that looks like a person with a plus sign, and invite away. • Picture in Picture: This may not be the most earth-shattering update that ever happened, but it's one that made me smile. Picture in picture lets you keep a video on your screen all the time, through Safari. On certain sites, such as Vimeo, there is an actual picture-in-picture button. On others, such as YouTube, you'll have to do some digging -- right-click on a video twice to get to the menu that lets you choose "Enter Picture in Picture" as an option. Note that this won't work with every video on every site -- in fact, it doesn't work on most sites including ones that would be useful such as Netflix. And while you can play and pause videos, you can't do more than that. Still, it's a nice way to get some background noise at work.

Another iPhone 7 Explodes, Buyers Worried It Could Be a Widespread Issue GO Second iPhone whose battery malfunctioned spotted in China Sep 30, 2016 16:16 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  An iPhone 7 Plus allegedly exploded in the box and still got delivered to the buyer, and now a new report coming from China seems to be pointing to another iPhone with a faulty battery. As is the case with everything Apple, details are super sketchy, so it’s hard to say once again what exactly happened with the iPhone that caused it to end up looking like this. The photos published by MyDrivers, however, clearly show an iPhone 7 with a faulty battery, but at first glance, it looks like the device didn’t actually catch fire, but suffered from a different problem. Most likely, the battery inflated due to external factors, such as a drop or heat, pushing out the screen despite all the glue that Apple has used for waterproofing. Apple completely tight-lipped And just like it was the case with the first iPhone 7 that exploded, Apple hasn’t yet provided a statement or at least a confirmation that it’s investigating the faulty device, but the company is definitely looking into reports, as more buyers are now worried that it could be a widespread issue. Earlier this month, Samsung started a global recall of the Note 7 after it discovered that some units shipped with a faulty battery which could catch fire during charging, so every time someone discovers a device that overheats, it quickly makes the headlines no matter if it’s a malfunctioning product or not. For the moment, however, it’s hard to say if the iPhone 7 is affected by a widespread problem or not, but it’s very clear that no matter the brand, it’s always a good idea to keep an eye on the device at all times, especially when charging. Inflating batteries aren’t quite a new thing for Apple, as similar problems were experienced in the past with older iPhone models that developed small bulges on certain parts of the screen because of the battery slightly inflating due to unknown reasons. We can’t tell for sure if the iPhone 7 is suffering from the same problem as it predecessors, but we should learn more about this in the coming weeks, as more cases are likely to emerge if it’s a widespread issue.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Apple#iPhone 7#iPhone#iPhone explosion subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news More Photos of “Exploded” iPhone 7 Available, Apple Already Investigating Apple User Says iPhone 7 Exploded Just like the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Explosions Boost iPhone 7 Sales, Top Apple Analyst Says No Joke: iPhone 7 Owners Try to Create Headphone Jack by Drilling Hole in Phone Three UK Hacked, Details of 6 Million Customers at Risk Microsoft Replaces Command Prompt with PowerShell in Latest Windows 10 Build Microsoft Can’t Kill Linux Right Now, The Linux Foundation Director Says iPhone 6 and 6 Plus “Touch Disease” Repairs Cost $149, Apple Says Hacker Breaks into Italian Government Website, 45,000 Users Exposed Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) Leaks in Press Render NVIDIA Makes Available New GeForce Graphics Hotfix Driver - Version 375.95 Three UK Hacked, Details of 6 Million Customers at Risk 2 photos    Inflating battery on the iPhone 7 new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Load old comments   The OLED iPhone Coming in 2017 Packs a 5.1 or 5.2-Inch Display more on: OLED panel i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

FOXSPORTS New York Giants Rumors: Not Looking Good For Cornerbacks on Monday Night By Nick Ziegler/FanSided via Empire Writes Back Sep 30, 2016 at 12:15p ET 0 Shares Recent New York Giants rumors have been about the status of their two injured cornerbacks. Will Eli Apple and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie be able to play on Monday night? For most of the week, New York Giants rumors have been about the status of cornerbacks Eli Apple and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. Due to Monday night being a huge game against the Minnesota Vikings, the Giants need to be healthy. Related Story: Will Darkwa shine in increased role? Monday Night Football kicks off two straight weeks on the road for the Giants against the Vikings and Green Bay Packers. Both the Vikings and the Packers are potential playoff teams, and these games will be important tests for the Giants. After losing a tight game to the Washington Redskins, the Giants cannot afford to start a losing streak. This week, all eyes have been on Apple and Rodgers-Cromartie. Apple is dealing with a hamstring injury, and Rodgers-Cromartie has a groin injury. Both of these injuries are never good for football players, and it has kept them out of practice this week. According to Jordan Raanan, it isn’t looking good for either on Monday night. The Vikings aren’t a team that is going to look to throw the ball 50 times. However, they are capable of hurting you through the air. CBs Eli Apple (hamstring) and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie (groin) didn't practice. Worked on side w/trainers. Doesn't look good for Monday. — Jordan Raanan (@JordanRaanan) September 30, 2016 The addition of Sam Bradford has saved the Vikings’ season, as they are 3-0 even with Adrian Peterson being sidelined with a knee injury. Bradford has already developed a good chemistry with wide receiver Stefon Diggs. This season, Diggs has totaled 20 receptions, 325 receiving yards, and one touchdown. Next: Can Perkins fill in for Shane Vereen? Diggs will certainly be the main target of Bradford, and the Giants will likely have to deal with him with a short-handed secondary. Furthermore, missing two key cornerbacks like Apple and Rodger-Cromartie can spell doom for the Giants on Monday night. Finally, the Giants will have to hope that the extra day’s rest can get at least one of them healthy enough to play.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) Share Written by Chase Purdy September 30, 2016 Of the many superfluous uses for the Apple Watch, which has inspired mixed reviews since its debut last year, perhaps none will prove as vexing to its wearers as this one: A highly influential restaurateur has decided to slap the street technology onto his waitstaff to better their service. The innovation by Danny Meyer, who runs the New York City restaurant empire Union Square Hospitality Group, sounds promising: Apple Watch-clad floor managers, waiters, and sommeliers get a stream of alerts when someone orders a bottle of wine, when a VIP guests steps through the front door, if someone waits too long to make a drink order, or if someone orders a bottle of wine. The control center for the watches will be an iPad at the host podium near the front of the house, according to Eater. In theory, real-time alerts would reduce response times and boost attentiveness to customers. But it’s unclear whether waiters would welcome the change. As restaurants scramble to make good service a hallmark attraction, customer expectations have risen. Adding in a hellfire of Apple Watch notifications threatens to add more stress into the mix. The Apple Watch already brings its own dose of anxiety to casual wearers. Of course, pleasing his waitstaff has been critical to the success of Meyer’s business. In a cut-throat industry with high employee turnover, he has showered his staff with benefits, including a plan for paid paternal leave, and an attempt to revamp America’s flawed tipping system. With this idea, Meyer is starting small. He plans to test the technology on his soon-to-be-reopened Union Square Café in downtown New York. If it goes over well, Apple Watches will reign over his other 13 restaurants. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Advertisement Apple Inc. is in negotiations with Sharp Corp. to secure organic LED displays for the iPhone maker’s next-generation of devices, a person familiar with the matter said. Any OLED supply agreement would depend on the Osaka-based company’s output capacity, said the person, who asked not to be identified because talks aren’t public. The discussions stem from Apple’s desire to increase the number of suppliers for OLED screens, according to the person. Earlier Friday, Sharp announced it will invest 57.4 billion yen ($566.99 million) for the development of OLED production facilities, with the goal of starting output by June 2018. The funds will be used for equipment in Sharp’s factories in Mie and Osaka, and to deliver sample products to customers, the company said in a statement. “Apple has unofficially, or as a nod, encouraged Sharp to go into it,” said Amir Anvarzadeh, Singapore-based head of Japanese equity sales at BGC Partners Inc. “Apple’s general strategy is to increase the competition on the supply side, and dilute the risk exposure to one company.” Popular Now These Industries are the Future of Additive Manufacturing Ford Sees Bumps Ahead with Used-Car Glut, Trump Presidency Tesla Seals $2 Billion SolarCity Deal Sharp spokesman Toyodo Uemura declined to comment on specific customers. An Apple spokesperson in Japan didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Sharp’s capital investment in OLED is part of 200 billion yen ($1.98 billion) that the manufacturer had already committed to OLED technology, part of a strategic plan it adopted with new owner  Foxconn Technology Group. Next-generation screens based on OLED, or organic light-emitting diode, technology promise more vivid images and less battery drain. Friday’s announced investment will be for smartphone displays, a representative of Sharp said without identifying specific customers. “This investment is in response to what Apple is doing,” said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute in Tokyo. “Production isn’t likely to begin until the second half of 2018, so the impact to profit won’t be until after that.” Sharp shares rose as much as 2.2% after the announcement, but closed unchanged Friday in Tokyo. The stock has climbed 8% this year, compared with the broader market’s 15% decline. Apple accounts for about 27% of Sharp’s revenue, according to Bloomberg’s supply chain analysis. Earlier this year, the Japanese company agreed to accept a rescue package from Foxconn Technology Group, ending a takeover battle that spanned four years. Last month, the company said its liabilities no longer exceed assets after receiving a 289 billion yen infusion. By Takashi Amano, with assistance from Yuji Nakamura.

In the middle of his frenzy, according to a translation by Mashable, the man is understood to have said: “Apple is a company that ‘violated’ European consumers’ rights. “They refused to reimburse me, I told them: ‘Give me my money back’. They said no. So you know what’s happening? This is happening!”  The customer then proceeded to destroy multiple Apple products on display using a petanque boule. The incident contrasts with the often determined loyalty of Apple’s customer base, some of whom recently camped out in the rain just to purchase the tech giant’s recent iPhone 7.

REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin Sergei Karpukhin/Reuters | Caption How Apple made it easier to hack iTunes backups with iOS 10 Security A Russian cybersecurity firm exploited changes in iPhone and iPad software to expose passwords used to protect encrypted data. Experts say it's a technique that law enforcement could use to break into Apple products. Nathaniel Mott @nathanielmott September 30, 2016 —Apple positioned iOS 10 as a step forward in iPhone security. But soon after the operating system debuted, researchers discovered a flaw that could allow hackers to force their way into the encrypted files created when iOS 10 devices are backed up to a desktop computer via iTunes. These backups can contain information about the apps installed on a device, the messages stored on the device, and potentially any passwords that have been saved to the iOS keychain. Backups are typically used to restore data after a software malfunction; they can also be used to move information to a new device without having to go through a complicated setup process. Elcomsoft, a Russian company that sells digital forensics software to law enforcement agencies and consumers alike, revealed on Sept. 23 that iOS 10 backups are easier to break into than backups made with iOS 9. The company said its software can guess 2,400 passwords per second on iOS 9 backups; it can make six million guesses per second on iOS 10 backups. The problem was caused by a change to the file system used to store these device backups. With iOS 10, Apple stores an easy-to-crack representation of the password used to protect these backups as well as a more secure version. Elcomsoft’s tools focus on the weaker protections to make more password guesses per second and, potentially, gain access to those sensitive files. Follow Passcode! Cybersecurity news and analysis delivered straight to your inbox. "We usually see that new versions of password protection are only being improved, but Apple took a step back with iOS 10," said Elcomsoft chief executive Vladimir Katalov. "Hopefully, it's a simple mistake. Probably when they changed the iTunes file format they left that part of the code in for debugging purposes or whatever and just forgot to remove it from the release version." Apple did not respond to a request for comment. The company did tell Fortune, however, that it plans to fix the problem in an upcoming security update. It's not clear when that update will be released, or whether Apple will be able to secure backups created with the current version of iOS 10. If it doesn't, people could still be vulnerable to this attack even if they update their devices. That could be a problem if Elcomsoft’s tools are improved. Mr. Katalov said that if the company moved its algorithms to a more powerful graphics processing unit, it might be able to make 100 million password guesses per second. This would put even more people at risk of being hacked. The good news is that Elcomsoft's tool requires physical access to the computer on which the backups are stored, which means it can't currently be used to remotely break into this sensitive data. "There is actually almost no risk to most consumers," Katalov says. "I would say that this discovery is probably most interesting not for regular users, but for law enforcement agencies." Andrew Blaich, a security researcher at the mobile security company Lookout, agrees. "For most people this is a low risk," he says. "It's a very interesting find by the researchers, and it's definitely going to be useful for forensic investigators, but once things are fixed you should be able to delete the existing backup and then back everything up again to have a low risk of attack." Despite rallies in support of Apple's stance against the FBI after the agency requested help unlocking the San Bernardino, Calif., shooter's iPhone, most Americans appear to have little problem with law enforcements' use of hacking tools. A recent Pew survey showed that most people seek to protect their privacy against "hackers or criminals" or "people from your past." Relatively few – just 5 percent and 4 percent, respectively – worried about keeping their information safe from "the government" or "law enforcement." Yet Katalov and Mr. Blaich disagree on how consumers should respond to this development. Katalov says that this might push people to use iCloud backups, which can have two-factor authentication enabled and would help defend against exploits like this, while Blaich says it's better to have something as sensitive as a device backup stored locally instead of up in somebody else's cloud. "The best thing to really consider is that if you do have data that you don't want other people to know or see it's probably best not to have it backed up," Blaich says. "People are able to actively choose what they want to back up, and decide if they want to back up messages, photos, etc. I would definitely say to exercise caution if you are concerned about those types of things."

Angry Apple customer smash! A Frenchman this week visited an Apple Store in Dijon, where he calmly walked around the giant tables, removing iDevices from their stands and crushing them with a metal ball. The video below, tweeted on Thursday by @quentin_IOS, begins with a series of loud bangs. As the videographer gets closer to the scene, the bespectacled man can be seen sedately demolishing iPhones, before moving on to a MacBook on a nearby table. Shouting in French, he allegedly claims Cupertino refused to honor the EU requirement for two years of warranty coverage after purchase. (Not because the iPhone 7 doesn't have a headphone jack.) As 9to5Mac points out, a siren can be heard in the background, suggesting staff members activated the fire alarm in an attempt to evacuate customers—most of whom were too intrigued to leave. There are no reports of injuries, apart from the thousands of dollars in broken Apple products. While Apple employees and bystanders look on, a mall security guard enters the store to escort the offender out. In two supporting videos (also below), the man's cool-and-collected attitude fades as he chats with a group of mall cops, one of whom he attempts to choke with his hand before attempting to flee. The unidentified man was arrested and placed in custody; an investigation is ongoing, according to French media reports. //Related Articles Apple Setting Up Shop Across the Pond Apple did not immediately respond to PCMag's request for comment. In 2013, a woman had an epic meltdown at a Los Angeles Apple Store. But she just screamed at an employee; no Apple products were harmed. Apple earlier this month unveiled the iPhone 7, which, as expected, ditches the headphone jack but adds water-resistance to protect against splashes and spills. It also sports a 12-megapixel camera with optical image stabilization and 7-megapixel FaceTime HD shooter. Inside, the iPhone 7 lineup runs Apple's new A10 Fusion chip with 64-bit architecture and an embedded M10 motion coprocessor.

Fri, Sep 30, 2016, 12:30 Updated: Fri, Sep 30, 2016, 12:33 Leila Abboud Puppies do eventually grow up into dogs, who bring happiness and companionship to their owners. The same can’t be said of many acquisitions         SoundCloud is a bit like Twitter, and they’re both a lot like puppies. Adorable disasters that can’t easily be trained not to spoil your rug. Hear me out. Twitter is incomprehensible to many civilians but beloved by a core of obsessive users among celebrities, politicians, journalists and financial traders. Its product is as easy to use as a canoe with a hole in it. Growth has stalled, leaving its shares worth about half their IPO price and prompting it to be put on sale. SoundCloud is privately owned but in a similar boat. In fact, the Berlin-based music and podcast sharing platform is even worse off. It’s unprofitable, probably permanently so, despite a promising start as a home for independent artists and DJs and the recent launch of a paid streaming service. Cloudy Skies I love puppies. And I love SoundCloud and Twitter despite their flaws, lack of business acumen, and strategic pirouettes. For users, they are an antidote to over-corporate, soul-crushing Facebook and Apple. As businesses though they are, well, not great. Spotify ‘in advanced talks’ to buy rival SoundCloud Has Soundcloud Go missed a beat? Bigger Apple Spotify is going head-to-head with deep-pocketed Apple in streaming. So news from the Financial Times on Wednesday that Spotify, the biggest music subscription service, is considering buying SoundCloud initially made my heart leap. Maybe Spotify – growing revenue rapidly but unprofitable given the 75 per cent or so of sales it pays to music labels for licence fees – can save SoundCloud? (By the way, Twitter invested $70 million in SoundCloud’s June funding round that valued it at $700 million.) Yet things are never that simple. Whether this deal happens and whether it’s any good for buyer or seller will depend on how it’s structured, the price and what Spotify does with SoundCloud afterwards. Spotify will no doubt have the stronger hand in negotiations given SoundCloud’s state. The streaming sector is getting more crowded and harder for standalone services competing with the riches of Apple and Amazon. But could Spotify preserve what’s good about SoundCloud, while squeezing out more revenue and profit? Given that Spotify is barrelling towards an IPO, a move for SoundCloud mustn’t derail that mission. ADVERTISEMENT Some free advice to Spotify chief executive Daniel Ek if he goes ahead: keep the two apps separate, so the 200 million or so SoundCloud contributors keep making it special. Do bring some of its content onto Spotify, especially the podcasts and independent artists that bring in revenue with lower licensing fees. And do plug Spotify’s strong ad sales operations into SoundCloud. Don’t, though, overpay in the name of scale, since synergies could prove an illusion. Even without a premium, that $700 million valuation looks rich, seeing as 2014 sales (the last published) were just €17.4 million ($19.5 million). Some free advice to SoundCloud: be careful about accepting a stake in Spotify by way of payment. No one really knows how much that’ll be worth until the market has a chance to vet Spotify’s financials. It raised $1 billion in March via a convertible bond, and is believed to be valued at about $8 billion on paper, but public markets can be less forgiving. The venture capital funds that back SoundCloud are among the savviest in Silicon Valley, including Union Square Ventures, Index Ventures, Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers, so hopefully their desire for an exit won’t cloud their judgment. Puppies do eventually grow up into dogs, who bring happiness and companionship to their owners. The same can’t be said of many acquisitions. – Bloomberg       Topics: Daniel Ek Kleiner Perkins Union Square Ventures Amazon Apple Facebook Index SoundCloud Spotify Twitter Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Financial Services Aviva to become full-fledged subsidiary of UK parent again Work Pre-meetings key to successful meetings on contentious issues English Soccer Liberation!

The payment system allows purchases using NFC (Near Field Communication) technology on smartphones, which can be used for payment in actual stores by holding an iPhone near the reader or within apps. In the fall 2015, Apple’s South Korean competitor - Samsung - also announced the launch of its own NFC payment system called Samsung Pay.

The phone could feature an edge-to-edge OLED display, curved edges, and it might lack a physical home button thanks to Apple's 3D Touch technology and a new TouchID fingerprint scanner embedded under the screen. At least, that’s what many reports are saying about Apple’s 2017 device. But if there’s one thing that appears to be certain about the 2017 iPhones is that at least one version will have an OLED display, likely made by Samsung. The South Korean giant won’t be Apple’s only OLED supplier going forward though, as the company is looking to partner with Foxconn-owned Sharp for OLED smartphone screens beginning in 018. DON’T MISS: Yup, now the iPhone 7 is exploding Sharp on Friday announced that it will invest roughly $566 million (57.4 billion yen) for the development of OLED production facilities, looking to start mass production by June 2018. Bloomberg has learned that Apple is negotiating with Sharp to secure OLED supply for the next-generation of iPhone devices. The agreement would depend on Sharp’s output capacity, one source said. Apple apparently doesn't want to pin its OLED panel needs on just one supplier. A representative of Sharp said that Friday’s announcement investment would be for smartphone displays, but the person did not identify specific customers. Sharp’s new investment is part of the 200 billion yen invested that the company already committed to OLED display production. “Apple has unofficially or as a nod encouraged Sharp to go into it,” BGC Partners Inc.’s Amir Anvarzadeh told Bloomberg. “Apple’s general strategy is to increase the competition on the supply side, and dilute the risk exposure to one company.” “This investment is in response to what Apple is doing,” Ace Research Institute analyst Hideki Yasuda added. “Production isn’t likely to begin until the second half of 2018, so the impact to profit won’t be until after that.” Apple already accounts for 27% of Sharp’s revenue, according to Bloomberg's supply chain analysis.

That’s exactly the conclusion one could reach by looking closely at code strings in the macOS Sierra kernel, discovered by Dutch outlet TechTastic.nl. It’s very peculiar that Apple would add support for ARM technology to macOS Sierra. As you know, all Macs manufactured since 2005 run Intel chips. The Apple appears to be implementing support for ARM chips in the Mac operating system could mean that first ARM-based Macs might appear this year. As TechTastic.nl states, developers no longer submit fully compiled binaries. Instead, intermediary bit code is submitted which Apple uses to compile the binary code for the specific CPU architecture. Should Apple release an ARM-based Mac, developers wouldn’t need to re-submit their existing code nor would they need to add any ARM-specific code in order for their apps to run natively on ARM-based hardware. “It is probably also one of the reasons why legacy applications have recently been removed from the App Store,” speculates the publication. The macOS Sierra kernel indicates support for the ARM Hurricane family. Now, ARM’s existing blueprints make no mention of the Hurricane CPU so this is most likely Apple’s internal code-name for a custom ARM-based CPU architecture. Starting with the A7 chip in the iPhone 5s, Apple stopped implementing ARM’s off-the-shelf CPU parts in favor of 64-bit CPU cores which are compatible with the ARM instruction set but are designed in-house from scratch. With the A7 onward, Apple started naming these custom-built CPUs. The A7 microarchitecture was code-named “Cyclone”, the A8’s CPU is called “Typhoon” and the A9 uses “Twister” CPU. The A10 Fusion is Apple’s first ARM-compatible mobile chip that uses four CPU cores, two for high-performance task and two highly energy-efficient cores for tasks that don’t require the full power. The idea of an ARM-powered Mac dates back to 2012, when Bloomberg reported that Apple was exploring ways to replace Intel processors in Macs with a desktop version of in-house designed A-series chips that power iPhones and iPads. “Apple engineers have grown confident that the chip designs used for its mobile devices will one day be powerful enough to run its desktops and laptops,” said Bloomberg. And in 2014, former head of the Macintosh division Jean-Louis Gassée hinted that the first ARM-based Macs could appear in 2017. “Apple’s drive to own all layers of the stack continues unabated years after Steve’s passing,” he wrote. “As a recent example, Apple created its own Swift programming language that complements its Xcode IDE and Clang/LLVM compiler infrastructure.” All iOS device processors use CPUs based on ARM’s power-sipping technology. Gassée explained: If we follow this line of reasoning, the advantages of ARM-based processors vs. x86 devices become even more compelling: lower cost, better power dissipation, natural integration with the rest of the machine. For years, Intel has argued that its superior semiconductor design and manufacturing technology would eventually overcome the complexity downsides of the x86 architecture. But that “eventually” is getting a bit stale. Other than a few showcase design wins that have never amounted to much in the real world, x86 devices continue to lose to ARM-derived SoC (System On a Chip) designs. Therefore, an ARM-based Mac notebook would theoretically have a much longer battery life than any existing MacBook with an Intel chip. With its own custom-designed Mac processor Apple would no longer be dependent on Intel’s slowing roadmap. More importantly, it would be able to refresh Macs once per year because any future A-series processors for computers would likely be on the same annual release cycle as the iPhone and iPad chips. Does that make any sense to you guys?

Alex Palko ’05 Agneev Mukherjee Thanks for reminding me. Imad Ghandour He didn’t remind you, he corrected you It coincided with the release of OS X Leopard which was in ’05 Martin Can I correct you too, a 10.4 revision was the first OS to power the Intel Mac, so it *preceed* the release of OS X Leopard (which was in 2007). Imad Ghandour Agneev Mukherjee I said ‘think’, I wasn’t sure, so it ain’t a correction. JuHoansi It was a reminder 🙂 Gary Deezy I dislike you already and we haven’t even met. 🙂 Derek Ledbetter And it was at WWDC, not Macworld. aalberti This time is different, no need to a compatibility layer.

It’s ok now? 😉 Agneev Mukherjee Yeah, appreciate your reply. Ara Rezaee I could see this happening for the Macbook, and maybe mbAir David Gillooly They may try out the technology in a MacBook Air first to give it extreme battery life. This would differentiate it from MBPs and MacBooks. Guy This wouldn’t be something Apple would do lightly. This is an “all-in” kind of move for the Mac. It would also explain why the long wait between updates for the entire line. Shameer Mulji doesn’t explain anything at all. Just pure speculation Guy Until it’s actually announced (if ever) of course it’s speculation. The only point was Apple would switch the entire line IF they did this David Wilson Wow there sure is a lot of nitpicking about verb choice in this comment feed … Kira Kinski Moving to ARM will be the beginning of the end of the Mac as we know it. iOS is a joke. It’s power and flexibility pales in comparison to macOS, even though that too has been dumbed down considerably in recent years. OTOH, Apple could add an ARM chip to the motherboard for about nothing and it would be cool having an option to boot up or run multiple architectures natively. One box to rule them all. Of course, Apple could also factor macOS to run on ARM, but that too reduces its utility. It’s still a Wintel world out there, pure and simple. Chris Yes. This would be the end…just like when Apple moved from OS X from PPC to Intel. chamers No, moving to a more standard, open architecture was a beginning. Moving to a closed architecture is the end. Chris Which part of Intel’s architecture is open? Don’t confuse widely used with “open”. TheLouisXXI Intel doesn’t have locked bootloaders for one and most OS’s run on Intel CPU’s and Intel still has the fastest chips to date. Given any ARM CPU or GPU is still at maybe PS2 levels for graphics Reed Harston Sorry, but both your previous comment and this one are widely misinformed. First, the GPUs in modern mobile devices have much better graphics than the PS2. Remember that the PS2 only output 480p and that current phones may have 1080p or 1440p screens, which is about 7 or 12 times as many pixels, respectively, as the PS2 put out. And their graphics are even more fluid and better looking as well. They are MUCH better than a PS2. Besides, even if you feel like ARM GPUs are slow, whoever builds the SoC with an ARM CPU in it can use whichever GPU they wish and there are plenty of other GPU options out there which are better than ARM’s GPUs. Second, what are you even talking about locked bootloaders? How are bootloaders on ARM devices ‘locked’? I have a Raspberry Pi and it has a ARM chip. And it can run Windows, Linus, whatever. So long as it is compiled for ARM. So I have no idea what you are trying to imply. Guy Why are you confusing an operating system with hardware? iOS does exactly what Apple has intended for it to do. macOS on an ARM chip would look and work like…well, macOS. Apple most likely would not add an ARM chip to an Intel-based Mac, what would be the point?They added Windows support because while running on native X86 processors it made no sense to not offer it. However my guess is that fewer and fewer people are doing so these days. I stopped after the last time MS borked my legally acquired Windows 7 Pro after doing something crazy like adding more drives to the Mac Pro it was on. Wasn’t even part of Windows, but added storage for OS X. They did it the first time and after 3 hours, grudgingly gave me a new license key. When they did it again (I had the audacity to swap out my main drive with OS X), I just wiped it and added it to the rest of the computer again. Once Apple hits some magic number with fewer Boot Camp installs, I imagine they could decide that they could do it and impact very few people. Kira Kinski Nah. I know the difference between hardware and software. I also know that iOS is a UI abomination, and that mindset has permeated macOS in recent years. That is my greatest fear of Apple moving solely to ARM. I personally care little for Wintel compatibility, but it is comforting to know it exists and opens the Mac up to far more possibilities since the world is mainly Wintel. Why restrict it to ARM analogous to the PPC days, other than to close the box a little tighter, once again? That being said, Intel does need to do something about its own space. It’s long in the tooth and their mobile efforts have failed to date. And don’t even get me going on Apple hardware today. There’s not a single Mac I care to purchase, for the first time going back to the Apple II. Everybody has their own needs and desires, and many consumers feel different about Apple today than me. I get that. elvisizer Your greatest fear from a proposed cpu architecture change is that UI design in macOS will follow iOS? Those two things have absolutely nothing to do with each other, you know. at all. As you yourself said, the UI design of iOS has migrated into macOS over the last few years, despite macs not using arm cpu’s. prl99 What you seem to not understand is that iOS has nothing to do with macOS when it comes to running a Mac. Just because they use a lot of the same code doesn’t mean macOS will only use the iOS UI. As for Apple’s A-series CPUs, check out their Geekbench scores; 3304 single core, 5339 multi-core. This is for a simple 2+2 core miniature SOC. The 4GHz iMac only has a single core score of 5181. Multi-core scores are faster because the Intel CPUs have more cores. There’s nothing stopping Apple from designing a quad or 8-core A-series CPU, running it a normal speed while adding either an internal multi-core GPU or external graphics card. As for your disfavor with Apple hardware, fine. Why are you even commenting when you don’t care? Imad Ghandour Agreed prl99 Actually, it’s an iOS and Android world along with linux. Wintel is going away even though businesses refuse to accept it. Think about it …. Reed Harston I don’t think Windows is going anywhere soon on the desktop/laptop. They failed to gain any ground on mobile but they still rule the ‘traditional’ computer. That isn’t to say that someday Windows might not exist but that would take a radical change that most people aren’t ready to take yet. Remember that phones and tablets are largely tethered to PCs to offload pictures and so on. As for the Intel half of ‘Wintel’, however, I think that they may go out of style even faster than Windows. ARM chips are becoming very impressive and their architecture has always been much more simple and power efficient, despite Intel’s rather amazing work to improve the efficiency of their incredibly complex x86 CPUs. When Apple (I don’t think it is an ‘if’) moves to ARM then other companies may start taking courage to do the same and Microsoft could easily port Windows to ARM as well. You can already install Windows on a Raspberry Pi actually and that has a ARM processor. And with the push to move Windows apps to the Windows store on Windows 10 like with the App Store in macOS they may easily do the same thing that Apple is currently doing and release their software onto both platforms without any extra work for the developers. JerryO What I would like to see is Apple release Rack based servers again. Competing against HP and Dell for Amazon/Ebay/Goog’s business. Currently, Intel Processors consume way too much power. A large server farm (i.e. GOOG, et. al.) consumes lots of energy – which costs companies $$$. Imagine Apple ARM based servers. Couple this with Cisco, IBM, Deloitte, et. al. support for the Enterprise – Apple can open up one more multi-billion $ business overnight. Rowan09 Test it out on the iPad Pro and iPhones first to see how it performs. Guy Chances are in house they have done so Geoffrey Spencer I hope they keep the Pro series with Intel chips. I use VMWare Fusion (or you can use Parallels) to work on Windows projects. ARM could be used but that would be emulators and that is a no-go for most people like me. Guy IF Apple did this, it would be across the board Reed Harston I agree that it would be across the board but it would also likely be in stages as was the PowerPC -> Intel jump. The Pro was the last to be released because the chips weren’t ready for it yet. The same is likely going to be true if/when they make this jump. Profesional workstations depend just as much on the proper software, if not more, as they do on great hardware. With the right software it is actually possible to edit HD video on the MacBook just as well or faster as on a workstation with the wrong software. Point is, the software for what professionals do is also going to have to be updated to work properly on ARM before the Pro can be updated, and that may take some time. Releasing iMacs and Mac Minis first would give the developers a warning that they need to start getting their software ready for an ARM based Mac workstation. Then when Apple releases the Pro everyone should be a bit more ready. Of course Apple may do something radical and different but that is what I would expect. aalberti I don’t think so, it’s not necessary. For the Apps running on different processors will be transparent with the LLVM stack, so Apple can keep both lines of processors Guy They could but probably wouldn’t. It makes no sense for Apple to keep two separate lines (processor related anyway) of Macs going. The Pro market isn’t big enough on it’s own to make it worthwhile Reed Harston Read my comment below first for my thoughts on releasing the timeline for releasing an ARM based Mac Pro. As far as working on Windows projects I commented above that I wouldn’t be surprised if Microsoft releases a version of Windows that can be installed on ARM as well (they already do actually, it is just a cut down version), so you would still be able to use Windows on your Mac. Just not work on x86 projects for legacy computers. Denver Morgan This could also mean OS X on an iPad like device. lattermanstudio That’s what I was thinking……. an evolution to one OS on all devices…. that way can finally catch up with what’s been happening with Windoze tablets that run standard Windoze apps…. somethings that Apple can’t offer right now due to the processor differences……. they are stuck in a corner and need to take drastic steps to enter the modern world. ……. now…. they may come up with a clever way to dual boot iOS/macOS or create some kind of new Finder that you can choose macOS-mode or iOS-mode depending your needs/liking… Reed Harston Apple not putting macOS on the iPad has nothing to do with the processor differences actually. Recompiling code to run on a different architecture isn’t as simple as flipping a switch but it isn’t that hard either. The bigger problem is making macOS and your favorite software work on a touchscreen. Your idea of having two modes, one for macOS and one for iOS, just exacerbates the problem. There is no easy or pretty way to make one OS work on both platforms. Windows 8 was meant to unite both platforms but instead it was universally hated by all. One OS to rule them all didn’t really work out very well for them. The problem is that mouse and keyboard oriented UIs are bad for touch screens and touch oriented UIs are just funky and out of place when you have a mouse. That is because on touch screens buttons have to be large and easy to press with a big finger, where a mouse pointer is small and much more precise. I can see the hardware converging more and more internally but I personally think the different OSes and UIs are going to remain. I prefer macOS for its power and I prefer iOS for my wife for its simplicity. sassymacgeek People always assume that Apple wants to put ARM into MacBooks which I agree would be great for certain aspects particularly cost and battery life (but perhaps not for cross platform development) but they fail to recognize that Apple could also be planning to have OSX for iPad Pros. It is also a possibility as long as we are guessing. Lit Why would they switch to an underpowered chip? That’s suicide. The only thing I can think of is to increase profit margins, which would be a typical Cook move. Reed Harston Before you go off and say ‘underpowered’ do your homework. The iPhone 7 has higher single and multi core GeekBench scores than the Intel powered MacBook 2016. Of course there is more to usability than benchmark scores, but that is still very telling. And there is the fact that the iPhone 7 has a minuscule battery compared to the MacBook yet it gets much better battery life (yes, the display affects it greatly I know but still you can’t help but be impressed). Of course you could say the MacBook is underpowered as well, but I would argue it is just fine and that other laptops are more powerful than they need to be. At least for the average user anyway. Even power users like me could get by just fine with the MacBook since it has an amazing SSD in it. Point being, using an ARM chip isn’t that farfetched an idea to me at all. mrgerbik there is no comparison when comparing A10 vs an i5 or i7 – its like a sports car vs a family sedan ItzSky_05 If you take the most powerful ARM processor and compare it with the most consumer grade processor, there’s no point of comparison (Apple A10 vs Intel Core i7-6700k or even the Intel Core I7-6700HQ). ARM is still underpowered, but looks like it’s getting stronger every time. For a portable or unpowered device like the Macbook, is a great idea. CaffeinePizza Or since iOS and macOS share the same Darwin kernel….. Reed Harston +1 While I do think that there is something to be said for Apple deciding to got to custom ARM chips in the Macs I agree that at least for the time being you (and the others who commented the same as you) are most likely right. macOS and iOS share a kernel so they may have likely just found a reference to the CPU in the iPhone 7. rockdude094 Maybe its hinting an iPad type device that runs Mac OS Shameer Mulji Good point. Many are assuming that Apple is building an ARM-based Mac but instead they may be working to port macOS to iPad Pro. Imad Ghandour tl;dr; Would be a downside to introduce this: 1-No more windows compatibility 2-Cant game 3-Unless big innovation is done 4-Doubtful …in more detail below I wouldn’t like this because it would render mac’s unable to run windows side by side with the Macintosh operating system, unless Apple finds some kind of workaround with drivers that would make this possible; which is doubtful. Even then, apps that would run on this ‘tweaked’ windows infrastructure, mainly games in this case for me at least, would be virtually ‘unrunnable’ because they are built to either run on AMD and Nvidia GPUs or either on AMD and Intel CPUs. Doubtful that they will support Apple’s ARM architecture since developers still barely support running games on Macs all together; basically there is little reason for them to change their minds as Apple is focused on Enterprise and Creative consumer-base rather than the avid casual gamer user-base instead. This is all true, unless Apple probably produces some rendition of a mac that is a graphics powerhouse that might reignite the idea of possibly gaming on a mac; very possible since this is seen today with the iPhone. However, as I said twice before, I find this very doubtful because, if this was a considered goal we would have seen Apple take a jab at this market earlier; until today only their high end MacBooks have a discrete graphics cards which are situated mainly for video editing rather than gaming all together. Unfortunate really. lattermanstudio i think it the end of an era where most (if not all) Apple computers can also run Windows natively. Back in the day…. Apple switched to Intel for a number of reasons…… PPC chips where having development issues, there was a big demand for Windows apps being able to run on our ofiice Mac…. in the end it was all about $$$ ……. same thing now….. Apple looks kinda weak when you compare it’s “pro” ipad series with and windows tablet that runs native windows apps ON a tablet….. it’s not very elegant in the Apple world…. they need to be able to offer a seamless experience ….. they can’t that unless they change and have ‘one’ OS….. things need to change…… Reed Harston You have good points but I think there are some things to consider. 1. As I have mentioned in other comments, I think that Windows on ARM isn’t too far out. It already exists for Raspberry Pi, which is ARM based. Also, as someone else commented there are likely fewer and fewer people using Windows on their Macs so even if it doesn’t work anymore (though I still believe it will) then it may not be missed very much by the masses. I know I wouldn’t care much. 2. ??? First, Macs aren’t widely regarded as ‘for gaming’ anyway. Second, switching to ARM CPUs doesn’t mean you won’t be able to use an AMD or Nvidia GPU. Two different things altogether. As for games running on ARM, anything from the App Store won’t care what CPU you have since Apple recompiles apps on the fly, so those games won’t even notice any change. As far as Windows gaming goes though you are right. You’ll just have to put together a gaming PC for those games, and even if Apple doesn’t switch from intel to ARM that would probably be best anyway since Macs don’t have great support for all the latest hardware, since you obviously only seem to care about games and nothing else which is not what Macs are made for (which you’ve said yourself). 3. I honestly don’t know what to say to this. Obviously the whole jump to ARM would take some innovation so that is a given. And they are already on the way there actually. All of Apple’s iOS devices run ARM so running macOS on ARM would be a piece of cake (Linux already runs equally well on either x86 or ARM or PowerPC or MIPS or whatever). And Apple has already set up the App Store to accept apps in a state that allows Apple to compile the app for the CPU of the device the app will be installed on, so that means no more work for the developers. 4. Doubtful? Maybe. Possible? Likely. I think it is more a question of ‘when’ then ‘if’ at this point. Having one type of CPU architecture in all their devices would make a lot of things easier for Apple in the long run. Imad Ghandour Just to touch on a point that I believe I didn’t make clear. I don’t use my mac specially to game. I actually bought my mac in order to Video Edit in the fly on Adobe Premiere and FCPX; gaming for me is a compliment to that experience. The reason I believe that people say that Macs aren’t meant for gaming is that 1- There is an abysmal support for games on macOS 2-Most MacBooks don’t come with a discrete graphics card, evens the ones that do, although satisfy photo editing and video editing very well, cannot game which I find weird honestly. I don’t game seriously just a bit of Overwatch and couple of other titles here and there and my mac serves me well. However, most of my games rely on windows (only reason I have the OS installed) and it would be a shame to want to uogeade in the future and lose this privilege. Even games that are cross-platform run better on windows due to their initial aim to use Direct-X as the main API instead of Open-GL or I guess now Metal. So losing the ability to run windows is a letdown. If Apple can facilitate and smooth transition (which would be possible obviously with macOS as you mentioned) for boot camp as well, odds are very low though, that would be great. Don’t get me wrong I do think switching to Apples own designed ARM is a great idea as there own chips have proven to easily outperform intel chips in the past, again just desappointed on compatibility. pjp “…developers no longer submit fully compiled binaries.” “Instead, intermediary bit code is submitted which Apple uses to compile the binary code for the specific CPU architecture. Should Apple release an ARM-based Mac, developers wouldn’t need to re-submit their existing code nor would they need to add any ARM-specific code in order for their apps to run natively on ARM-based hardware.” This isn’t true. Bitcode is for iOS apps, not Mac apps. Reed Harston Correct, but do you think it is much of a stretch for Apple to do the same for Mac apps? It would take practically no extra work for the developers to support this in their apps, if any at all. All Apple would have to do is flip a switch on their end and voila. The Mac app store will behave like the iOS App Store. Will Collier I’ve been expecting this for a while. Makes Apple independent of Intel, and kills Hackintoshes in one swell foop. (I’m opposed, FWIW.) lattermanstudio yup….. would kill the Hackintosh……. not good – but at the same time I can see why it makes sense to them in the long run……… hey…… you can ‘still’ make a Hackintosh and run OSX 10.12 and below…… nothing wrong with that 🙂 lattermanstudio Bye bye to Mac that also run WinDoze but that’s no big loss. We may finally see ipads that run OSX….. that would be great 🙂 Leslie Bee With extra cores (maybe 9) at 3-7nm, ARM could probably replace Intel entirely by around 2020. Apple would love to boost profits, and jettison Intel and eventually all other non-Apple chips in all their products. The future is coming whether we like it or not. Everybody wants to rule the world, especially Apple. Reed Harston I don’t think ARM needs that many more cores in order to replace Intel. ARM chips are generally seen as slower because they are. We only see 1 to 2.5 GHz ARM chips because that is as fast as they can get before melting the phones and tablets they are most used in. Intel chips regularly clock up to 4GHz or more in high end machines. I don’t doubt that ARM chips could reach the same speeds as Intel chips do in a full sized laptop or desktop computers. Then they would be very completive and most likely more power efficient to boot. Of course Apple is looking to improve their bottom line more than anything but I also think that if they do make this move it would simplify a lot of things for them overall. It would mean only one architecture to support on their OS and apps (which would mean more resources for more debugging and better software). And it would also mean that Apple would have more control over the pace of their hardware upgrades as well. I agree, whatever happens is going to happen and there isn’t anything we can do to make Apple change their minds. Frank CHEN That’s why the name “FUSION”. The question is will we have an iOS like macbook or a osX like ipad pro. Shameer Mulji my bet is on the former. Niklaus Mikaelson I guess My iapd pro is getting macos Johny Burns So many amoebas are biting on the TMZ reporters. Typical Kardashian story. ARM tried in the Chromebooks thru the Linux distro flavor, and Intel uses the weakest and cheapest silicon there. Apple has around 10 more years to catch to what Intel has right now. Not to mention HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus, Sams, Huawei, Xiaomi are pissing all over iMacs. Apple got butt hurt when Intel stop providing them with custom made silicon. Dell already got a Kaby Lake chips, and Apple is now on the back of the bus. mrgerbik Comparing current ARM builds to current x86 is like comparing a Nissan Sentra to a McLaren F1. For everyday computing the speed is reasonable enough, but for any serious workloads, x86 is still the champ by far. aalberti LLVM was architecture independent from the start. I supposed intermediate code (bitcode) was the way to go for distribution, with a JIT compiler specific for the installed chip on the computer. They took a long time, but it seems they’re finally headed there. It is certainly doable and even very efficient. Jorge Rivera Yes, it does make sense. Additionally, macOS and iOS may merge and this is why one can find those references in the include files. It is the beginning of implementing a vision for future Apple devices as they become more homogeneous. Jon Allen Time to look at windows again. Apple, its been a good decade. Sentinel64 Well….this line of thought ( Apple going ARM across their entire portfolio ) has a little more credence when you realize that Intel has recently bowed out of the phone and tablet CPU market. For the last 3-4 years Intel has poured BILLIONS of dollars into the mobile space trying to dislodge the stranglehold that ARM has in that market. They quite literally were seeing BILLIONS in losses due to rebates and marketing given to phone manufacturers to entice them to start using Intel CPU’s instead of ARM. This would be Intel’s ATOM line of CPUs. It was a spectacular failure. So this year they announced they are out of the phone and tablet business and are concentrating the ATOM line for 2in1 Hybrids and cheap laptops on the Windows side of things. Read that again…..OUT of the PHONE and TABLET business. Now….where is Apple making the most money from but the PHONE and TABLET business? So…..just like a decade ago when the PowerPC alliance was failing to bring the innovations needed to Apple, not only in the desktop division but particularly in the laptop division forcing Apple rightfully at the time to go Intel, Intel is now stagnating and ARM chips have advanced enough to become viable replacements across the entire Apple portfolio from desktops to mobile. I think 2017 is a good year to see an ARM based Apple Air laptop. 2018 sees an ENTIRE mobile portfolio ( all laptops, phones, tablets and watch ) go ARM and in the 2019-2020 timeframe the first ARM based Apple desktop. Just my humble opinion. iAndroHacker Does it mean that i can dual-boot Android Nougat ARM version? yeah cool right? lol. just saying La Vida Leica …or macOS running on iPad Pros. Frank Moolah This should be no surprise that Apple is trying to be independent from Intel (can’t blame ’em) but banking on ARM at it’s current state would be a crapshoot. Not ready, not even for 2017 Anthony Randazzo or it could be that they are slowing combining the iOS and macOS code base so that there is less to manage, and soon iOS may be running macOS as its core. Another option is a more affordable netbook style Apple Baltazar It could make sense to go with in-house ARMs. Most tasks now are not CPU bound. I’d argue unless you are high-end gaming, science/CAD, content creation, we are getting to the point that for many people their Chomebooks or iPads are able to do everything they want. Hopefully they keep the Pro line and 27″ iMac line with Intel and OS X. I’d disagree that Apple has been held back by Intel’s cpu timeline.

The supply agreement is dependent on the company's output capacity, said a source. Apple is looking to increase the number of suppliers it has for OLED screens. Earlier today Sharp announced it would invest 57.4 billion yen ($556 million) to develop OLED production facilities. Output is set to start in June 2018. “Apple has unofficially or as a nod encouraged Sharp to go into it,” said Amir Anvarzadeh, Singapore-based head of Japanese equity sales at BGC Partners Inc., in a phone interview with Bloomberg. “Apple’s general strategy is to increase the competition on the supply side, and dilute the risk exposure to one company.” Sharp's investment in OLED is part of 200 billion yen already committed to OLED technology as part of a plan implemented by new owner Foxconn. Apple accounts for about 27% of Sharp's revenue.

After Samsung’s fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 found itself on more 'No Flight' lists than ISIS, it appears Apple wants to get in on the act too. One new iPhone 7 Plus buyer (via Reddit) has claimed their handset arrived from Apple looking like it had been delivered via the Earth’s core. In all the years of Apple and Samsung trying to imitate each other’s features, this might be taking it a little too far. A phone that comes exploded right out of the box? Beat that Samsung! You don’t even have to risk setting fire to your car or anything. Related: iPhone 7 review In all seriousness, we don’t expect this to result in another serious issue. It’s highly likely to be a freak occurrence with damage to the Lithium-ion battery caused somewhere between the factory and delivery to the user. Apple has not commented, neither has UPS which handled the last leg of delivery. Apple is working with US network AT&T to arrange a replacement device. Samsung is still attempting to get through to nearly half of Galaxy Note 7 buyers in Europe who, for some reason, have not called in their replacement device yet. What are you waiting for people?

Toggle Navigation A-   A+ Sign in News   Stock Home «Back Apple offers project internships to students for possible jobs at Maps Development Center B Dasarath Reddy | Hyderabad Sep 30, 2016 05:52 PM IST After announcing the launch of Maps Development Center on May 19, Cupertino, California-based technology giant Apple Inc., has recently short-listed 30 engineering students from the city for a 6-month project work before they could be considered for placements some time in April next year. These 30 students-all studying at G Narayanamma Institute of Technology and Science (GNITS) for Women have been divided into six teams to work on six separate projects as a part of Apple's internship programme. While sources say that the company had already recruited a group of 20-25 experts for the leadership positions to guide the multiple teams of techies that would be deployed on various projects involving Apple Maps at the Hyderabad Development Center, this internship programme is the first known move directed at hiring people for the entry level jobs for the Center. Already in high demand among the IT and software companies, the students of GNITS will be the first ones from the city to join the Maps Development Center if they could successfully complete the projects in the next six months. The process adopted by Apple for the selection of future employees to work in its first Development Center outside the company's US headquarters seems nothing similar to the usual campus hiring practice followed by many technology companies. First it had set up a center of excellence(Mac Lab) with 33 high-end Mac Computers at GNITS coinciding with the launch of Maps Development Center. After giving an initial training for few months to students in Apple's operating system among other things at this lab, the company had identified 30 students to engage them on Maps related projects on a 6-month internship programme, all this involving months of training and careful selection of students before undertaking a final hiring process. "Now these projects have become a part of our curriculum as the students will have to accomplish live projects besides writing the regular examinations to successfully complete the course," GNITS principal K Ramesh Reddy told Business Standard. Apple team had short-listed these 30 students through a test conducted on September 6 to a total number of 44 students who were top in academic performance. Such a rigorous process for the selection of entry level jobs was a new experience for the students here. An Apple India spokesperson said hiring was an ongoing process, while he refused to comment on specific details in this regard. When Apple CEO Tim Cook visited Hyderabad to launch this Maps Development facility, the company had announced that it would employ as many as 4,500 people here. This seems a long drawn exercise as the placement offers are not decided by simply conducting the campus interviews as being done by others. After zeroing on GNITS for establishing their first and still the only Mac Lab here, Apple officials told the college management that they had selected their college based on the retention rate of faculty, the teaching and the learning processes and the placements besides the vast presence of greenery in the 14-acre campus. Apple CEO had spent 2 hours at this institute interacting with the students and the faculty after inaugurating the Development Center at Waverock IT park on May 19. The college authorities have now taken the initiative to train 100 more students using Apple's infrastructure to make its students job ready when Apple considers similar internships in the next round.

By Todd Haselton | September 30, 2016 Share Stay Connected with Us! Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple is reportedly in talks with Sharp to provide OLED panels for the rumored iPhone 8 (artist concept pictured above), expected a full year from now. This is the iPhone that many think will mark a big transition from Apple. It may mark the first big change in design since the iPhone 6 made its debut two years ago. Apple is currently trying  to make sure that Sharp can produce enough panels, Bloomberg said. This is in contrast to earlier reports that suggested Samsung will be the sole provider of OLED panels for Apple’s iPhone. One such report suggested Apple had already ordered 100 million OLED displays from Samsung for the iPhone 8. However, given the reported discussions around Sharp’s ability to output enough panels, it’s likely Apple is also trying to diversify its providers, making sure that it will have enough supply to meet demand. Additionally, Apple has been trying to cut down its reliance on Samsung, and Sharp would give it an edge to do so. Bloomberg points to a recent announcement from Sharp that it will invest about a half a billion dollars in new factories to build OLED panels. With Apple as a customer, those plans are far less risky.

(Reuters/Paul Hackett) Share Written by Mike Murphy September 30, 2016 Shine on, you crazy diamond. The Evening Standard, a London paper, reported earlier this week that Apple will be moving British offices to Battersea power station, a derelict coal power station that has been out of service since 1975. It’s a building that has been searching for purpose for decades, and has recently been part of a massive redevelopment plan for south London. The proposed redevelopment. (Battersea Project Land Company) While Apple’s European headquarters will remain in Ireland, where it has roughly 6,000 employees and a rather favorable tax relationship with the government, the company employs roughly 1,500 people across the greater London area, and will bring them all under one roof in the power station. (Apple wasn’t immediately available to comment on its plans, but the company managing the redevelopment of the area has confirmed Apple’s move.) While it won’t quite have the pomp of the massive spaceship-like campus Apple is building for its global headquarters in California, the power station is one of the most imposing and well-known fixtures of the London skyline. It will also be an ironically fitting home for the most valuable company in the world. The power station has appeared in many films and records since it opened in the 1930s, including The Beatles film Help!, and the inner cover of The Who’s Quadrophenia, but is perhaps best known for gracing the cover of Pink Floyd’s 1977 album, Animals. A giant inflatable pig, which may or may not have broken from its tethers, floats above the power station. The image alludes to the allegory-laden content of the record, which, as CityLab points out, was a critique of capitalism during the turbulent punk era of the late 1970s that leans heavily on George Orwell’s Animal Farm. And now a company that sells very expensive pieces of technology (with very good margins) will be the building’s main tenant. In its review of Pink Floyd’s album at the time, Rolling Stone said: “The tension that powers their music is not simply fright at man’s helplessness before technology; it’s the conflict between the modern and the ancient, between technology and tradition.” Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

The rumored discussions reportedly stem from Apple’s desire to secure multiple suppliers for organic LED screens and minimize exposure to any single supplier. “Apple has unofficially or as a nod encouraged Sharp to go into it,” said Amir Anvarzadeh, Singapore-based head of Japanese equity sales at BGC Partners Inc. “Apple’s general strategy is to increase the competition on the supply side, and dilute the risk exposure to one company.” Sharp also announced it will invest 57.4 billion yen, or approximately $566 million, for the development of OLED production facilities in Mie and Osaka to build smartphone displays, with the goal of starting output by June 2018.

The tech giant, which opened Friday's trading at $112.46, already throws off a 2 percent dividend yield. To make another 2 percent on the name, traders could sell the 120-strike call option expiring in January for $2.68. To take a step back, a call represents the right to buy a stock for a given price within a given time period. By selling a call, then, one is granting someone else this right. In this case, one is giving the buyer of this call the right to buy Apple shares for $120 — something they will only reasonably do if Apple shares are trading above that level come January expiration. Normally, selling a call is a risky play. For instance, if Apple shares were to double in price, the seller of this call would still be on the hook to hand over Apple shares for $120 a pop. This means they would see a loss of more than $100, all in the service of trying to make $2.68. But in this case, since one already owns the stock, the gains made on the actual shares would make up for the losses suffered on the call. The only risk, in this case, is that one will not get to participate on the upside if Apple does rise above $120. For Davitt, this is an appealing trade-off. "You take in an extra 2 percent to hold a pretty stable stock," he pointed out Thursday on CNBC's "Trading Nation." Indeed, the options market implies just a 30 percent chance that the stock will be above $120 come January expiration — meaning that 7 out of 10 times, one will reap the rewards of selling the call without missing out on any gains whatsoever. Further, Davitt doesn't think there's a big risk of the shares sliding, given its substantial dividend yield, low valuation, substantial cash hoard, and the stability of its business. For Max Wolff of Manhattan Venture Partners, owning Apple shares through earnings is a good play. "Buy the rumor, sell the fact — that's a consistent way to make money on Apple," he said. Indeed, this could be another benefit of selling the call option on Apple: It instills investing discipline by setting a predetermined level at which to sell. In this case, if the stock indeed rises above $120, one will make $10.79 in less than four months' time, for a sweet 9.6 percent return — thus allowing one to happily forget about Apple and move on to the next trade.

Shares Virtual reality is grabbing the headlines, with Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and Samsung Gear VR headsets already for sale and Sony's PlayStation VR release imminent. But, while Apple thinks virtual reality (VR) has some "interesting applications," Tim Cook seems to believe that augmented reality (AR) will be even bigger. We know that Apple has likely hundreds of people working on VR and AR technologies, but we don't know when or if an Apple AR/VR product will ship – or what it'll be like. But, there are plenty of clues that can help us make some informed predictions. AR vs VR: what's the difference? Virtual reality is when you see an entirely virtual world: everything before your eyes has been computer generated. AR doesn't do that. Instead, it augments the real world – think Pokémon Go, or a heads-up display on a car's windshield. You can be pretty confident an Apple headset won't look like this As Tim Cook says, AR enables you to be "very present" when using the technology. You're not bouncing around your living room with the best part of a motorcycle helmet on your head. We expect Apple to be working on both AR and VR projects. But, we think AR is the one Tim Cook is more excited about. Who's involved? Apple's AR/VR team includes some big names, including computer science professor and immersive 3D interface expert Doug Bowman, former Magic Leap computer vision engineer Zeyu Li and former Oculus research scientist Yury Petrov. Lytro is one of several VR-related firms Apple has hired people from Apple has also acquired multiple AR/VR companies, including real world object-tagging company Flyby Media, facial capture firm Faceshift, augmented reality developers Metaio, 3D sensor firm – and Kinect creator – PrimeSense, computer vision startup Perceptio and facial analysis developer Emotient. In addition, Apple is believed to have hired people from Microsoft's Hololens AR project and from innovative camera firm Lytro. How long has Apple been working on this? Years. Apple filed multiple patents in 2008 for head-mounted displays, some of which resembled Google Glass and others which took the same "phone on your face" approach as Samsung's Gear VR. In 2011, Apple filed a patent for augmented reality map displays, and it has also filed multiple patents involving 3D interfaces and sensors. When can we expect to see some products? Don't hold your breath for exciting new hardware. While Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster says that Apple is working on several "mixed reality" projects, he projects that initially they will be software-driven and on iOS devices. According to Seeking Alpha, Munster predicts that Apple may offer a VR/AR API to hardware developers, much like the Made For iPhone program by 2018 – but a glasses-style "mixed reality" headset is at least five years off. Munster's predictive track record is a bit patchy – he's been banging on about an Apple television set for years, to the point where it's become a running gag among Apple watchers. But, the prospect of an Apple headset taking its time to appear seems reasonable. We've seen the challenges of getting enough power and battery into the Apple Watch; to miniaturize that even further to fit into something like normal glasses or sunglasses won't be easy. Current technology means a VR headset has to be bulky What's Apple up against? There are lots of smart-glass models on the market, but they're limited, bulky and expensive – and mainly for niche markets such as professional cyclists. The closest to an all-purpose headset is probably Vuzix's M100 Smart Glasses, which cost $799 (about £615) and work with both Android and iOS; or their imminent successor, the M300, which began shipping to VIPs this week, as of this writing. But, while both systems are undoubtedly impressive and well suited to their target market of business customers, they're also rather bulky. They're not Oculus-style monsters, but they aren't something you're going to want to wear as you walk down the street, either. What we're likely to see first is Apple AR in software, and the iPhone 7 Plus is a pretty big clue that that's not too far in the future. Its dual cameras aren't just useful for getting creamy bokeh into portraits. More importantly, they're also useful for 3D mapping, whether that's of a space or your face. That opens up a whole world of potential applications from interior design and online retail to funny FaceTime filters. AR needn't be visual. AirPods put Siri in your ears And don't forget, AR isn't necessarily a visual technology. The new Apple AirPods put Siri in your ears, just like in the film Her, and that has potential for adding descriptive information to the world around you. Smartphone screens are our primary way of receiving information because that's how technology has evolved, but the future is much more modular. The phone will still be the engine, but increasingly we'll get our information in multiple ways: a haptic tap here, an auditory signal there, an icon or an alert in our field of view. What would an Apple headset look like? Back in 2007, Apple patented a head-mounted display that would "resemble ski or motorcycle goggles" – but, that was before the iPhone debuted, and mobile tech has improved considerably since. A more recent patent filed in 2015 and granted in 2016 shows a lighter, less goggle-y headset designed to work with an iPhone. Some Apple prototypes resemble Microsoft's Hololens, reports say The Financial Times reports that Apple prototypes have resembled both Oculus Rift headsets and Microsoft Hololens, but that doesn't mean Apple will ship either. It was building VR prototypes at the turn of the century, and those projects were ultimately scrapped most likely. When it comes to a new product line, Apple tends to do three things: it learns from others' mistakes; it waits until it thinks there's a big enough market for the product; and it obsesses over the details that others missed. Remember, Apple didn't invent the MP3 player, the smartphone, the tablet computer or the smartwatch, but it's followed the same pattern with all of those categories. Nothing about that strategy should change with its headset. What will an Apple AR or VR headset look like? The answer's obvious. First, look at what everybody else is doing. Now, think different. So, what about that MacBook Pro 2016 revision? This article is part of TechRadar's Mac Week. This year marks not only the 10th anniversary of Apple's MacBook, but the triumphant return of macOS.

(AAPL) iPhone 7 Breaks Android Wear Smartwatch Connectivity Android Wear smartwatches are currently paperweights for iPhone 7 owners By Brad Moon, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Sep 30, 2016, 9:44 am EST     Popular Posts: The Next Thing Apple Inc.

(AAPL) Angers New MacBook Pro Fans Yet Again Apple Inc. (AAPL) Could Launch Apple Glasses by 2018 View All Posts About one year ago, Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google rolled out a new version of its Android Wear operating system for smartwatches. This release brought iOS compatibility, so iPhone users weren’t stuck with just Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Watch. It turns out the new iPhone 7 doesn’t play nice with these smartwatches. Source: Apple Maybe it’s AAPL’s way of trying to force Moto 360 owners to upgrade to an Apple Watch Series 2? Last fall, a long-rumored project from Google’s Android Wear team launched. The engineers had managed to build a version of Android Wear — the operating system that powered smartwatches like the popular Lenovo Group Limited (ADR) (OTCMKTS:LNVGY) Moto 360 — that was compatible with the iPhone. Android Wear for iOS This was a big deal. And even though the functionality was relatively limited, AAPL couldn’t have been happy about it. The Apple Watch launched earlier that year and immediately dominated smartwatch sales charts. Clearly, iPhone owners had an appetite for smartwatches that wasn’t matched by Android smartphone owners. 10 Growth Stocks That Will Outrun Google At the same time, there were a growing number of smartwatches running Android Wear that could only be used with Android smartphones. Google’s move meant iPhone owners who wanted a smartwatch could opt for the Moto 360 or other options from companies like LG, ASUS and Fossil Group Inc (NASDAQ:FOSL). And some did. Those would be the iPhone 7 owners who are now complaining. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Incompatibility Fast-forward a year. Apple’s iPhone and iPhone 7 Plus are now shipping and the Android Wear forums are suddenly full of complaints. Smartwatches that worked perfectly well with an iPhone 6 or 6s refuse to pair with an iPhone 7, effectively rendering them useless. Android Wear Engineers have now identified smartwatches from a half dozen manufacturers that are affected, including the Moto 360. It’s not iOS 10 that’s causing the problem, since these smartwatches still work fine with older iPhones running iOS 10. That points to a hardware incompatibility, most likely with the iPhone 7’s Bluetooth radio. If that turns out to be the case, any fix may not be simple. To update its operating system or firmware, a smartwatch typically needs to connect to a smartphone. As pointed out by The Verge’s Chris Welch, that means a potential system update from Google couldn’t be downloaded and installed by the affected users since their smartwatch can’t connect to the iPhone 7. That leaves tweaking the Android Wear app for iOS (which Google has done several times without success since the issue first surfaced), or hoping that Apple is able and willing to release an update for the iPhone 7. In the Android Wear forums, Google says it has reported the “serious pairing issue” to Apple. In the meantime, as one forum poster lamented, his Android Wear smartwatch is “an expensive paper weight.” The problem is Apple was never thrilled with Google’s smartwatch move in the first place. Now, with Apple Watch sales down, its big smartwatch market share lead eroding and the new Apple Watch Series 2 just released, AAPL may not be in any hurry to help out Google and its Android Wear smartwatch competition. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. More From InvestorPlace: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Tracks Everyone You Chat With What Is This Apple.

We will dive into it, but take this, Elcomsoft  have discovered that there is a severe security flaw in the iTunes backup protection mechanism, which leaves it prone to password cracking tools. iTunes Backup Flaw iOS forensics company, Elcomsoft, known for developing cracking tools for iOS, suggest that the new password verification mechanism for iOS 10 devices skips certain security checks which leaves hackers for easy login access. (Like 2,500 times easier than the older version, damn!) The tools are made by Elcomsoft itself. With this security flaw, only local backups are affected, not the backup generated on the iCloud. But this flaw will get access to user’s login and password credentials, and all the data saved on the device. Apple have identified the problem and released a statement that (Source) – “We’re aware of an issue that affects the encryption strength for backups of devices on iOS 10 when backing up to iTunes on the Mac or PC. We are addressing this issue in an upcoming security update. This does not affect iCloud backups. We recommend users ensure their Mac or PC are protected with strong passwords and can only be accessed by authorized users. Additional security is also available with FileVault whole disk encryption.” So the new update will be released to fix this issue, but the timeline for release is unknown. In the new iOS 10.0.0.2 update, they have fixed Lightning pods, Siri, Phone Calls, iCloud and Volume keys problems. Wonder why they missed this? Security is one of the fundamental things that Apple is known for. Dropping iPhone 7 Sales Along with iTunes issue, Apple is also facing dropping iPhone 7 sales. A recent announcement that the Apple will not disclose their Launch Sales suggests that there is some backstory. Launch reports are one of the strong point that Apple provides in the supply constrained time, but suddenly halting this is a big decision, putting investors and customers in a blind spot. Iphone 5s and 6s plus which sold over 13 million units during launched weekend, got less traction after the period. This may be the issue, according to an article from Forbes, a report made by GfK dropped Apple sales suggesting low iPhones sales in Europe. Though the report is not published, Bloomberg‘s (original source) report quotes “Numbers on sales or market shares are confidentially provided to our clients and shall not be quoted or released to the public,” GfK said in an e-mailed statement. “We did not publish these figures for external release.” At the time of writing this article, Apple shares had dropped by 1.67%. So maybe Apple is hiding, or maybe not, to keep this away from the investors. Project Titan Interestingly, Motley Fool have got some evidence which can potentially turn this situation completely around. They have disclosed that Apple is working on a secret project called as “Project Titan“, a self-driving Apple Car. This also might explain recent rumor of Apple’s McLaren acquisition as well. Motley Fool article suggests that Apple is procuring 5,000 Acres of land for a testing purpose, hiring engineers from Tesla, Volkswagen, Ford, and Bosch, putting USD 10 billion in R&D, and many other sources. BGR too reports that “Apple is more likely to want the incredible team and technologies developed inside MAT, while McLaren needs MAT to maintain its competitiveness in racing.” So what you think? Should Apple get into Cars? will iPhone 7 sales increase? Let us know "Severe Flaw in ‘iTunes’ Backup, Low iPhones 7 Sales and Apple’s Secret ‘Project Titan’", 5 out of 5 based on 1 ratings.

When Irish voters rejected the Treaty of Lisbon in 2008, the EU forced them to vote again until they delivered the “right” outcome. A year later, when private Irish banks imploded, threatening their (mainly) German private creditors with severe losses, Jean-Claude Trichet, then the European Central Bank’s president, immediately “informed” the Irish government that the ECB would shut down ATMs across the Emerald Isle unless Ireland’s unsuspecting taxpayers made the German banks whole. Ireland acquiesced, its public debt ballooned, emigration returned, and the country remains bruised and despondent. With the EU still refusing meaningful reduction of a debt burden unfairly borne by the younger generation, the Irish remain convinced, correctly, that the EU violated their sovereignty on behalf of foreign bankers. Ireland’s greatest weapon against the ensuing debt deflation was its ability to attract US-based tech giants, by offering them a combination of EU law, a well-trained English-speaking workforce, and a 12.5% corporate tax rate. Though the shell-like subsidiaries of global tech conglomerates have little positive impact on most households’ income, Ireland’s establishment is proud of its links with the likes of Apple. Now, the European Commission is jeopardising the Government’s special relationship with Apple by demanding that it claw back €13 billion in taxes from the company. Is the Commission’s latest intervention another example of EU bullying, in violation of Ireland’s sovereignty? Comparing Trichet’s 2009 intervention and the current standoff over Apple holds important lessons beyond Ireland and, indeed, Europe. In the eurozone’s early years, German financial institutions channelled a torrent of capital into Ireland’s commercial banks, which then lent it to real-estate developers. The ensuing property bubble resulted in white elephants in Dublin’s financial district, row upon row of new blocks of flats in the middle of nowhere, and a mountain of mortgage debt. When the bubble burst after 2008, land prices collapsed, debts went bad, and Ireland’s private banks failed. The ECB, in an affront comparable to British behaviour during the 1845-52 Famine, instructed the Government to invoke “financial stability” to force Ireland’s weakest citizens to repay every euro the defunct private banks owed to German creditors. Financial stability was obviously a smokescreen: taxpayers were forced to repay even the debts of a bank that had already been closed (thus systemically irrelevant). The roots of the Apple deal are older than the ECB. In 1980, a young Steve Jobs visited an Ireland eager to escape underdevelopment. Apple eventually created 6,000 jobs in the country, in exchange for a sweetheart tax deal allowing it to shield its European revenues from taxation by recording them there. To this day, the proceeds of every iPhone sold in Paris or in Stockholm (net of its Chinese assemblers’ production costs) go to Apple’s Irish subsidiary Apple Sales International. As a result of the original Apple-Ireland deal, ASI pays a miniscule tax on these earnings, effectively exempt from the ultra-low 12.5% corporate-tax rate. This arrangement also required the usually vigilant US Internal Revenue Service to play along. ASI’s profits stem from Apple’s intellectual property (IP) rights, which are based on research and development conducted exclusively in the US (most of it underpinned by federal government funding). These profits should, therefore, be taxed in the US. Curiously, the IRS is choosing not to enforce Apple’s obligation to pay tax on its profits from US-sourced IP returns. Instead, Apple charges ASI a symbolic fee for allowing it to profit from Apple’s IP rights, for which it pays a tiny tax to the IRS. Meanwhile, ASI is allowed to keep, in Ireland, profits representing close to two-thirds of the revenue from the sale of every Apple product sold outside the US. As a result, Apple has amassed untaxed cash reserves of up to $230 billion. Unlike in 2009, the Irish Government is protesting the EU authorities’ recent Apple ruling, pointing out that tax policy is in the purview of national governments, not the union. And, in a recent joint letter to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the EU’s other 27 national governments, 185 American CEOs alleged the EU had over-reached yet again, resulting in a “self-inflicted wound” for Ireland’s and Europe’s economy. But they are wrong: Ireland’s sovereignty is not an issue here. Apple would not have based itself in Ireland were it not for the EU’s single market, a commons that requires common rules. One of these rules is that governments cannot offer aid to some companies that is not available to others. Suppose, for example, that the Greek government, seeking to attract 6,000 jobs to its ravaged economy, offered Apple a subsidy of €110,000 per job per year, or €660m. Over two decades, the total subsidy would come to slightly more than €13bn. Were the EU to permit Greece to offer Apple such a deal, the other EU states, including Ireland, would revolt. Suppose further that the Greek government proposed waiving corporate tax for 20 years on all revenue Apple earned in the rest of the EU but booked in Athens — say, €13bn. The European Commission would then have a duty of care to the European commons to demand that Greece immediately recoup that €13bn — exactly as it is telling Ireland to do today. Every time the EU acts as a colonial usurper, as it did in 2009, it undermines the legitimacy of its good and proper actions and strengthens the xenophobic, anti-European “Nationalist International”. Europe’s only beneficiaries, much to the delight of Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, are isolationist Brexiteers, the far-right Alternative for Germany, France’s National Front, and illiberal governments in Poland, Hungary, Croatia, and elsewhere. The lesson to be learned from comparing Trichet’s 2009 intervention with the European Commission’s current stance on Apple is simple: Europeans’ real enemy is free riding by the few on the backs of the many. Without common institutions, Europeans cannot be defended from the exploitation and antisocial practices that big business and its political agents portray as economic common sense. Trichet compromised Ireland’s sovereignty to facilitate German bankers’ free ride on the shoulders of Ireland’s taxpayers. As restitution, the ECB should take on its books part of Ireland’s public debt. But the EU must not allow Ireland to abuse the European commons by offering Apple a deal that no other member state could. The right response to past injustices is to recover sovereignty in a Europe where the powerful — whether German bankers or American smartphone makers — are prevented from preying on the weak.

William Watson This article appeared on The DC Examiner on September 30, 2016. Monday’s presidential debate gave each candidate yet another opportunity to complain that we don’t make enough things in the United States. Donald Trump constantly says we’re getting killed on trade and has singled out iPhones and cars as products that will be made in America after he becomes president. Hillary Clinton has accused Trump of hypocrisy for selling imported clothes and has said “you can’t make America great if you don’t make things in America.” These demands may be good politics but they’re not good economics. The truth is that American manufacturing is thriving, the United States is a great place for companies to invest, and the ability to import from abroad is vital to keeping it that way. When politicians perpetuate and pander to myths about trade, they have to pretend that globalization hasn’t been an incredible force for good in our economy. Trump’s iPhone complaint is an excellent example. No doubt Trump is picking on Apple because the iPhone is a popular consumer product that voters are familiar with. But it’s also a great example of how economic globalization has contributed to the U.S. economy. Although the iPhone is assembled in China, the parts that go into making it are manufactured in countries all around the world. A study of Apple’s supply chains in 2011 showed that final assembly — the activity that’s done in China — of an iPhone or an iPad constitutesabout 2 percent of the device’s value. In other words, assembling iPhones doesn’t create a lot of wealth for China. Apple’s contributions to the U.S. economy, on the other hand, are quite extensive. The company directly employs over 65,000 people in the United States. These jobs are in design, programming, marketing and retail. There are hundreds of thousands more U.S. jobs that rely on the existence of Apple devices running countless apps. When politicians perpetuate and pander to myths about trade, they have to pretend that globalization hasn’t been an incredible force for good in our economy. Trump’s demand that more Americans be employed snapping pieces of plastic together completely misses the point of economic growth. Disrupting Apple’s supply chain to divert some low paying jobs to the United States would harm both consumers and businesses that benefit immensely from Apple’s ability to efficiently produce electronic devices. Trump has also vilified Ford Motor Company for investing in manufacturing in Mexico and called for a 35 percent tariff to be imposed on any Ford imports. Most recently, Trump pounced on the company for announcing it would move all its small car manufacturing activity to Mexico. But as Ford CEO Mark Fields noted in his response to Trump’s criticism, the U.S. factories now making small cars will be retooled and those workers will instead be making higher-value trucks. Investing abroad enables companies to grow, and growing companies invest more at home. It’s not even clear these days which companies should count as domestic auto manufacturers. According to the 2016 Cars.comAmerican-Made Index, the five automobile models with the highest levels of U.S. content are made by Toyota and Honda. Foreign brands employ one-third of all U.S. auto workers, and that’s if you ignore Italian-owned Fiat Chrysler. Foreign investment and increased specialization have led to real growth in the U.S. auto industry even as domestic companies expand their operations around the world. There’s an excellent opportunity here for Clinton to call out Trump’s plans as harmfully simplistic economic nationalism. Instead, the Clinton campaign has decided simply to accuse Trump of hypocrisy. They’ve produced a series of ads highlighting the embarrassing fact that Trump’s own businesses rely on imports. In one advertisement, the Clinton campaign points out that Trump brand shirts, ties and suits are made in Bangladesh, China and Mexico. This fact could be used by Clinton’s team to show how vital imports are to all manner of U.S. businesses, but that’s not where they went with it. “In fact, the real Donald Trump outsourced his products and jobs to 12 different countries,” the ad says, “You can’t make America great again if you don’t make things in America.” The message is that America would be a better place if we manufactured more clothes here. It’s true that the U.S. garment industry is much smaller than it used to be both in terms of output and employment. But that’s actually a sign of our economic success, because making clothes is not a very good job. Garment manufacturing requires lots of workers to make relatively low-value products, and Americans, by and large, enjoy better work opportunities. Trade enables relatively poor Americans to have affordable clothing and desperately poor foreigners to have steady jobs. The Clinton ad uses Trump’s iconic “Make America Great Again” hats as a prop by replacing “America” with the names of countries where Trump’s clothes are made. Making clothes is indeed really great for countries like Bangladesh that are in the early stages of industrialization. But these are not at all the kinds of places the United States should be trying to emulate economically. It’s easy to convince voters that U.S. manufacturing is in decline because Americans don’t make very many cheap consumer products. Instead, we manufacture chemicals, heavy machinery and complex electronics. To make those things, U.S. manufacturers rely extensively on imported materials. Because of proximity to consumers, relatively predictable regulation, strong rule of law, a steady workforce and access to imports, U.S. manufacturing output is greater today than it’s ever been. In calling for more assembly lines and sewing tables, Trump and Clinton are both ignoring the important role globalization has played in America’s economic success. Their protectionist promises will only serve to deny Americans the full benefits of a robust and dynamic 21st century economy.

It may not be the most advanced calendar app out there, but it’s more than enough for most users who aren’t, say, running a small business. Syncs with iCloud. Chess.app (Not Useful): Why is Chess a system application in Mac?

Dictionary.app (Useful): A simple but potentially useful app if you ever need access to a dictionary, thesaurus, or Wikipedia. Provided by the New Oxford American Dictionary and Oxford American Writer’s Thesaurus, respectively. I personally never use it. DVD Player.app (Not Useful): This app may as well be obsolete. Modern Macbooks, iMacs, and other Apple machines don’t come equipped with DVD drives anymore, so DVD Player is only useful if you have something like an external DVD drive. Besides, apps like VLC can handle DVD playback anyway. FaceTime.app (Useful): FaceTime is basically the Apple version of a more streamlined Skype: you can initiate and receive both audio calls and video calls with other FaceTime users. Unfortunately this means you can only use this between Apple devices. If you have friends or family on Windows or Android, you’ll need Skype, Google Hangouts, and so on. Font Book.app (Very Useful): Unlike in Windows or Linux, Mac comes with a built-in font management utility that makes it a breeze to install, preview, and delete font families from your system. I like it because I’m a big font freak Spruce Up Your Website With These 12 Beautiful Google Web Fonts Spruce Up Your Website With These 12 Beautiful Google Web Fonts Over the past decade, I've started a number of personal blogs that I never really followed through with, but some of my fondest memories rest on theme design and font tweaks.

Game Center.app (Not Useful): Game Center is meant to be a central area where you can find games, both single- and multi-player, to play on your own or with friends. It requires your Apple ID as a sign-in. Unfortunately there aren’t many games, and the ones that exist aren’t noteworthy. For Mac App Store games, Apple forces developers to use Game Center for multiplayer — hence why you’re often better off buying elsewhere instead Why You Should Avoid Buying Games From The Mac App Store Why You Should Avoid Buying Games From The Mac App Store The Mac App Store doesn't hold a candle to the same store used by iPhone and iPad users to guzzle apps, games and in-app purchases.

A lot of new musicians use this as a stepping stone to more complex apps like Logic Pro X, and it’s so useful that this app alone is one reason why some Windows users convert to Mac in the first place. iBooks.app (Useful): iBooks is like iTunes for ebooks. It comes with a built-in store where you can purchase thousands of titles (including recent mainstream releases) or you can import your own if you have ebooks on your system. I primary use it as an ebook reader and manager — and I love it because it’s both simple and beautiful. Supports both EPUB and PDF formats. iMovie.app (Useful): A simple and intuitive movie editor that you can pretty much think of as “GarageBand for movies”. You can import raw clips and images, edit them together, and polish off with text, music, and basic post-processing effects. You’d be surprised by how many YouTube videos were made using iMovie! iTunes.app (Useful): Everyone knows about iTunes — even those who have never touched a Mac in their life! Over the years, it has morphed into a kind of all-in-one media manager for music, movies, TV shows, and iOS devices. but I primarily use it for managing and listening to podcasts 15 Top-Notch Podcasts for Programmers & Software Developers 15 Top-Notch Podcasts for Programmers & Software Developers Podcasts are a fantastic way to learn more about programming.

Image Capture.app (Not Useful): If you have a scanner or camera connected to your computer, you can use Image Capture to take images. Some older digital cameras may rely on an app like Image Capture to import directly from the device, but most now have Wi-Fi sharing (or you can just pop the SD card into your reader). Keynote.app (Useful): Keynote is Apple’s answer to Microsoft PowerPoint. With it, you can create all kinds of interesting presentations Create Elegant & Cool Multimedia Presentations Using Apple's Popular Keynote [Mac] Create Elegant & Cool Multimedia Presentations Using Apple's Popular Keynote [Mac] The best demos of Apple's multimedia program, Keynote, are the ones co-produced by the legendary Steve Jobs.

It can import and export to PowerPoint formats, so no need to worry about compatibility. Launchpad.app (Not Useful): Launchpad was added as a way to unify the experience between iOS and Mac, but I’m not sure this was necessary. Its primary function is to help you find and launch apps, but Spotlight can do the same thing (and Spotlight is objectively better in every way, especially because it can find lost files in a heartbeat How to Find Lost Files on Mac OS X How to Find Lost Files on Mac OS X We've all been there: you finish working on a document, save it, close the window, and... where'd it go? Read More ). You can access launchpad by hitting F4, or pinching with four or more fingers on a trackpad. Mail.app (Useful): The default app for handling email accounts and inboxes. It’s actually quite good if you ask me, but I don’t use it because there are a few interface quirks that I don’t like. Instead, I use Postbox as an alternative mail client, 5 Apple Mail Alternatives for Mac OS X 5 Apple Mail Alternatives for Mac OS X Every Mac comes with a free email application, but it's not the be-all and end-all of OS X email solutions.

It’s too bad that Apple chose to name it this way — the app itself is great, but the name is vague especially when looking for Numbers tips online. If you do a lot of spreadsheet work, you’ll use this one a lot. Pages.app (Useful): Here we have Apple’s answer to Microsoft Word and the trend holds true here: simple, straightforward, but nowhere near as feature-rich.

Photo Booth can do that using your Mac’s built-in camera, or an externally-connected camera, in three modes: single photo, four quick photos, or a movie clip. You can also add over 20 different effects if you want to have some fun. Photos.app (Useful): A central library that makes it easy to organize and manage your photos and videos. It won’t take photos or videos (use Photo Booth for that) but it’s great for storing albums and creating “projects” like slideshows, prints, cards, and so on. It can even edit RAW files, but serious photographers should still consider using Lightroom 3 Reasons All Photographers Should be Using Adobe Lightroom 3 Reasons All Photographers Should be Using Adobe Lightroom A lot of people aren't quite sure where Lightroom fits into things.

I'd like to think I have a good reason (I don't). I have worked with / for Apple for over a decade. I believe if you really considering switching to Apple devices now in the late 2016, not knowing what some native applications (doesn't) do is the least of your troubles... This is my take on the list above clearifying some of the reasons: AppStore - source of "iOSque" software. Only rarely can you find something usefull here. Good developers woldn't touch it with a bargepole. Automator - yes, you can stick with bash, that is why you have bought a unix based device in the first place, ain't it? (Alternatively you don't know what UNIX is and than you are a victim). Calculator - useless, but common Calendar - useless, famously unreliable, will not play well even with OS X Server. Chess - I've been using Macs for over a decade, this is the first time I have noticed! Contacts - the iOS have duplicated your contacts? This app has decent chance of fixing it without loosing too much data. Dashboard - useless feature a lot of people are surprised still exists Dictionary - useless DVD player - useless FaceTime - hw specific chat software, like a bread you can only cut with a golden knife, useless Font Book - old as os x itself, usefull for dealing with font issues (if you are the sort of person who has font issues). Game Center - bad joke GarageBand - audio editor for pre-teens iBooks - compared to Calibre useless iMovie - video editor for pre-teens iTunes - a prison for your iPhone ImageCapture - because iPhone will not act as Mass Storage device Keynote - so little features and so much hype, 10 templates chosen with taste Launchpad - "iOSque" program launcher, useless Mail.app - yes, you need to restart this app 7 times a day to make it catch up with your iPhone Maps.app - On desktop? I don't get it! Messages.app - the face time faux-pas all over again, should be noted that it does not play well with OS X server Mission Control - very uneffective task/window switching Notes.app - hw specific note taking app (unlike evernote, simplenote or onenote) Numbers.app - hw specific spreadsheet app - you'll do better with libre office Pages.app - hw specific text editor app - you still haven't installed libre office? PhotoBooth.app - because taking selfies with a phone is so hard Photos.app - the reason one does no longer use local photo managers (unless you are a professional and you are ready to suffer for it) Preview.app - universal file viewer, usefull! QuckTimePlayer.app - some usefull features offset by its inability to play most video / audio formats. Replace with VLC Reminders.app - remind me what reminders are good for? Safari.app - the lest used (and least useful) os specific browser in the world. Stickies.app - really surprised it still exists Time Machine.app - with the arrival of ssds the most reliable method of loosing all your data while having the warm feeling of daily backups. Specially dangerous in combination with the Time Capsule. Ask at your local data recovery provider :D Honorable mentions: Terminal.app - exactly what it says, very usefull HomeBrew/MacPorts - the appstore you were looking for AirPort Utility.app - so you have expected to setup your new apple router with browser? Dream on! Disk Utility.app - the only volume management app I have seen that will not read S.M.A.R.T. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Apple Premium Reseller iStore has tweeted that the iPhone 7 is coming to South Africa on October 14, with the information confirmed on both its website, above, and now Apple’s site too. We heard a week ago that it will be hitting India on October 7. ET News is also reporting that Apple’s new iPhone is expected to be launched in Samsung’s home market of South Korea a week later, on October 21 – though it notes that this is not yet certain. Through discussion that took place [yesterday], Apple Korea and three mobile network providers have decided to release the iPhone 7 on the 21st of October, based on final approval from Apple Headquarters. Apple products are currently sold in South Korea only by third parties, but it appears that Apple has plans to take on Samsung directly on its home turf … It was reported last week that Apple is scouting out locations for its first official Apple Store in the country, with one possible location directly across the street from Samsung’s HQ in Seoul. Korea is traditionally patriotic in its smartphone purchases, with local companies Samsung and LG together accounting for around 80% of all sales. The launch of the iPhone 7 later this month, followed by an Apple Store next year, could help dent that number. Samsung’s problems with its flagship Galaxy Note 7 exploding and having to be recalled should certainly help Apple position the iPhone as an appealing alternative.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Stop Apple Pay from Opening on Your iPhone All the Time If you don’t use Apple Pay, there’s no reason you should have to see it on your iPhone’s lock screen every time you accidentally double-click the Home button. Here’s how to turn that shortcut off, while still allowing access to Apple Pay when you need to. Apple Pay can be handy, especially if you can find merchants that accept it. Aside from being easier to use than digging out your credit or debit card, swiping the card, and then entering a PIN, Apple Pay also offers the advantage of not actually giving your credit card number to merchants. Instead, they get a one-time code that’s authorized for a single charge. To use it, all you have to do is hold your thumb over the Home button and wave the phone at the terminal. But by default, you can also double-click the Home button on the lock screen to show the cards and passes in your wallet. If you use Apple Pay regularly, it can be useful. If you don’t, and you’re sick of it opening up by accident, here’s how to turn that part off. RELATED ARTICLES How to See Which Merchants Accept Apple Pay Google Wallet vs. Apple Pay: What You Need to Know Fire up your settings app and tap “Wallet & Apple Pay.” On the “Wallet & Apple Pay” screen, turn off the “Double-Click Home Button” option. Super simple? Yes. But having Apple Pay come up when you don’t need it can get pretty annoying. And you can still get to your cards and passes easily enough by just unlocking your phone and opening up the Wallet app. JOIN THE DISCUSSION (1 REPLY) Got Feedback?

Frankel September 30 Follow @tcfrankel Congo DongFang Mining/Huayou Cobalt: Huayou Cobalt, parent company of Congo DongFang Mining, admits to having “insufficient awareness of supply chain management.” It says it did not know that buying artisanal cobalt “would increase directly or indirectly child labor and human rights” risks. It has hired an outside company to conduct supply-chain due diligence, with a report on this topic expected later this year. It is also working with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the China Chamber of Commerce of Metals, Minerals and Chemicals Importers and Exporters to develop guidelines for responsible mineral supply chains. The company said that to just avoid artisanal cobalt “is actually an irresponsible business act, which would very possibly aggravate the local poverty in cobalt mining regions and worsen the livelihood of local legal artisanal miners.” Apple: The company said it is committed to working with Huayou to clean up the supply chain and to addressing underlying issues such as extreme poverty. Apple plans to increase scrutiny of how its cobalt is obtained but does not want to find remedies aimed at just “making the supply chain look pretty.” Starting in 2017, Apple will internally treat cobalt as a conflict mineral, requiring all cobalt refiners to agree to outside supply-chain audits and conduct risk assessments. The company also will soon, for the first time, include cobalt in an annual update of due-diligence efforts for its conflict-minerals supply chain. This goes beyond what current OECD guidelines call for. Apple also supports adding cobalt to the U.S. conflict-minerals law, which currently requires American firms to try to verify the source of tin, tungsten, titanium and gold used in their products. LG Chem: The battery maker said that one of its suppliers, L&F Material, stopped using Huayou’s Congo-sourced cobalt in mid-2015. The company also “has strengthened the code of conduct for LG Chem suppliers, especially for tracking down the origin of raw materials.” The company now requires certificates of origin for some cobalt shipments. Today, Huayou supplies cobalt mined in New Caledonia, instead of Congo, for cathodes used by LG Chem. In response to a question expressing analysts’ doubts that the cobalt supply in New Caledonia was sufficient to replace what had been coming from Congo, LG Chem did not answer directly, replying in part that “LG Chem has requested L&F to submit Certificate of Origin on every purchase they have supplied and we are checking the certificates on a routine basis.” Also, the company said, “based on contract terms and conditions between LG Chem and supplier, if a supplier does not show any improvements including submission of certificate etc., LG Chem will plan to cut off transactions with that supplier.” LG: Company said LG Chem, its main battery supplier, “has responded to your questions directly.” Ford: Its battery supplier, LG Chem, “has indicated that the batteries they supply Ford do not have a history of cobalt from the Democratic Republic of Congo.” General Motors: Its battery supplier, LG Chem, “has instituted a process with its tiered cobalt supplier to prevent the use of cobalt from the Democratic Republic of Congo in GM’s battery production.” The GM battery plant in Holland, Mich., is owned by LG Chem, and LG Chem has told GM that the plant does not use products with Congo-sourced cobalt. “We require our suppliers to comply with local and regional environmental laws and regulations and to be fair, humane and lawful employers, and to enforce similar requirements from their sub-suppliers.” Samsung SDI: “Our ongoing investigation has not shown any presence of ‘questionable cobalt’ in our suppliers’ supply chain.” The company said it does use Congo-sourced cobalt and is “aware of DRC sourcing risks, given the political instability and the poverty of DRC. Our investigation is also showing the incapacity of the government and of upstream players to keep an effective chain of custody on cobalt. . . . Samsung SDI does not tolerate any form of child labour or health and safety issues into its supply chain.” Samsung: The company did not address specific questions, instead issuing a statement that noted, in part, “Samsung strives to improve human rights and avoid environmental degradation by establishing responsible and ethical supply chain management and encouraging its suppliers to participate.” BMW: “It is correct that the BMW Group purchases battery cells from its supplier Samsung SDI. . . . Only some of the cobalt for BMW Group battery cells originates from the Democratic Republic of Congo. . . . We have established a process with these companies to ensure that all cobalt supplied by them is free from human rights abuses.” Amazon.com: The company did not respond to specific questions. It issued a statement noting, in part: “We are committed to ensuring the highest standards in all areas of production and manufacturing. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure they meet our standards, and conduct a number of audits every year to ensure our manufacturing partners are in compliance with our policies. “ Pulead: “We have asked our suppliers to adhere to their commitments and certify to us that they will not use child labor in their supply chain and no product that they sell to us is linked to illegal labor practices.” Pulead called this “a very complex issue” that cannot be solved by a simple embargo against artisanal cobalt, as it would hurt Congolese miners. The company supports increased awareness, “as everyone is monitoring everyone else along the supply chain.” Amperex Technology Ltd. (ATL): In response to a request for information about the company’s role in the battery supply chain, a spokesperson for a subsidiary of TDK, the company that also owns ATL, wrote that “TDK and ATL have replied that they would not take this interview as some information may not be disclosed to the publics.” L&F Material: Did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Hunan Shanshan: Did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Apple may finally up its display game with iPhone 8 What's OLED is new? Apple may finally up its display game with iPhone 8 by Chris Smith 30 September 2016 0 shares Read Comments The long-awaited introduction of an OLED Retina Display is one of those iPhone rumours we hear every year, but it never pans out. Well, almost a full calendar year before the company introduces the iPhone 8, reports suggest the advanced display tech could finally replace LCD. That would mean more vivid images and less drain on the iPhone’s battery. It would also bring Apple in-line with Samsung flagship Galaxy phones. Related: iPhone 8 news A Bloomberg report says Apple has encouraged Sharp in its investment of £435m in facilities to create the organic light-emitting diode displays. They’ll be ready by June next year, the report says, which is prime iPhone production time. “Apple has unofficially or as a nod encouraged Sharp to go into it,” said Amir Anvarzadeh of BGC Partners Inc. “Apple’s general strategy is to increase the competition on the supply side, and dilute the risk exposure to one company.” Sharp is now in the hands of Foxconn, the Chinese company that assembles the iPhone for Apple. This could make a display alliance between Sharp and Apple a little more likely. Is it time for the iPhone to adopt OLED? What are you hoping for in the iPhone 8?

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Software macOS 10.12.1 Beta 2 Released – Developers Only (Update: Public Beta Also Available) By Uzair Ghani Posted 2 months ago 20Shares Share Tweet Submit macOS 10.12.1 Beta 2 for compatible Mac computers is now available. The update is available for developers only. Apple releases macOS 10.12.1 Beta 2 for Developers Apple released the first beta of iOS 10.1 just under a week ago. The release was quickly followed up with the availability of macOS 10.12.1 Beta 1. Six days later Apple has seeded macOS 10.12.1 Beta 2 which comes packed with bug fixes and performance related improvements. If you have an Apple Developer Program membership at hand then you can go ahead and grab the new pre-release build immediately. Furthermore, if you have macOS 10.12.1 Beta installed on your Mac right now then you can update directly to the latest build from the Mac App Store. Launch the Mac App Store on your Mac, click on the Updates tab and you’ll see the update pop right up for download. Do keep in mind the update will require you to restart your Mac. Therefore save all your work before going ahead with the installation. The entire update process will take no more than a few minutes given what type of Mac you have. If it’s a computer with a solid state drive then things will breeze through at light speed. If otherwise, then of course you might want to exercise some patience. macOS 10.12.1 Beta is Available for Public Beta Testers as Well You’ll be pleased to learn that macOS 10.12.1 Beta is available to download for Public Beta testers as well through Apple’s Beta Software Program. It’s absolutely free, unlike the Apple Developer Program, which requires you to part with $99 on an annual basis to gain access to pre-release bits of Apple’s software. Advertisement If you’re feeling brave enough to try out macOS 10.12.1 Beta on your Mac right now, then be sure to check out the details here. Furthermore, iOS 10.1 Beta is also available to download for Public Beta testers. And though the update is aimed majorly towards iPhone 7 Plus users, it does pack bug fixes and performance enhancements for everyone else. Wrap Up Developers are requested to update their Macs immediately as the newly released build of macOS 10.12.1 Beta packs in bug fixes and performance enhancements. Lastly, make sure you are running beta software on a computer that is not your daily driver. Despite being stable for use, macOS 10.12.1 in its current form should be treated no more than unfinished software. It can hit a roadblock during usage in the least suspected place. Let us know if you’ve updated to the latest build of macOS 10.12.1 Beta. Update: macOS 10.12.1 Public Beta 2 is now available for download as well.

For users, that means some cutting-edge texting options. The power of the new tools were featured in an advertisement push Apple launched Thursday. After all, it's an important move for a company that is hoping to expand its services business to the size of a Fortune 100 company by next year. In case you don't know how to use it, it all starts with the up arrow on the bottom right of the screen, and a gray arrow on the left. These open up a "drawer" of cool effects. On the right, swiping up and down lets you explore options like new bubble sizes, while a box at the top lets you toggle through full-screen effects or filters. On the left, you have three key icons: the camera, one that syncs with other apps, and one that lets you draw. Then on your regular old keyboard, there's another set of new features, including handwritten notes and "emojification." The up arrow on the right Start by typing your message. On the right, the send arrow turns green or blue when you start to type, depending on whether you are messaging an Android or iPhone user. Note that these options will only work when messaging another iPhone, and you must hold down the arrow (if you just tap it, it will send the message without effects.) Adjust bubble style This feature lets you control the size and style of the way the text bubbles are delivered, to add emphasis to important messages or play down others. To do it: Use the arrow on the bottom right corner of the screen, opening a menu reveals options like "slam," "loud" and "gentle." Select the dot next to the option you want and your text will jump up to that section of the menu. Hold the blue arrow again to send. Invisible ink Invisible ink allows you to have a message with a big reveal — by sending a blank message that can only be read by swiping across the screen. To do it: Type your message or take a picture and hold the send button until the menu comes up. Select the dot next to invisible ink and hold the blue arrow that appears to send. Now the recipient can swipe away the blurriness to reveal a picture. Full-screen messages These full screen messages overlay a grandiose effect on your conversation. It's kind of like a Snapchat filter for your texting conversation. To do it: Type your message and press and hold the blue arrow. At the top of the menu, toggle from "bubble" to "screens." Swipe from left to right to see effects like balloons, confetti, fireworks, lasers and a shooting star. Once you've found the one you want, hold the blue button next to the message again to send it. The sideways arrow on the left On the bottom left of your screen, there is a gray arrow. Tapping it reveals 3 options. Drawings and graphics over images The new messenger drawings overlayed on text or video. To do it: The middle option (a heart with two fingers) opens a touch pad where you can draw in the center. On the left, you can overlay your drawing or writing onto a video and select different colors. On the right, there are some preprogrammed options you can select from a "digital touch" menu. "Sketch" enables handwriting, while the others let you overlay graphics like a heartbeat or fireball on a picture. A simple up/down arrow on the right toggles the drawing pad from full screen to half screen. On the bottom right, you can tap the camera icon to reveal a white button for stills and a red button for videos, and you can write over the image at any point. Then as usual, tap the blue arrow to send! Apps: Apple Music messages, payments and more With iOS 10, you can do a lot with your other apps without even leaving the message ecosystem, a concept that's already wildly popular in countries like China, where WeChat has popularized the idea. To do it: Expand the gray arrow on the left and select the "A" App Store logo. There, you'll have some preloaded options, and you can add more. One option is to send the song you're listening to, which you can do by selecting the Apple Music app within Messenger. That will pull up your recently played songs. Just select the song and tap the blue arrow to send it off. There are a ton of other options for the app menu. You can send payments with Venmo or Square Cash, documents with Evernote, reservations with OpenTable, or flight details with Kayak. Users are also going nuts for Momento, an app that lets users turn their memories into GIFs. Camera Now, when you open your camera within Messenger, you see exactly what's in front of you, and a matrix of your past pictures — a far cry from the days you had to open another app to insert an image. To do it: Just expand the gray arrow and select the camera icon on the bottom far left, and swipe from right to left to see your pictures. Swiping from left to right reveals a short cut to your photo albums. Within the main conversation screen You still have all your normal functionalities within your conversations, like holding a message to delete it and pulling up emojis from your keyboard. But there are some bonus features now, too. Tapbacks It's Apple's take on the Facebook "like." Instead of responding to a message with your own "bubble," you can tap on the message you just received and respond to it. To do it: Tap the bubble of the message you have sent or received, and you'll see a horizontal gray menu of responses appear, like "thumbs up" and "heart." When you've selected one, it appears pinned to the message you selected for both parties, with a different color for what's sent and received. Emojify Words are so 2015. In iOS 10, you can get emoji predictions as you type. To do it: To see it, you can tap the emoji button at the bottom of your keyboard lightly. The "emojify-able" words will be highlighted. To replace one, you tap the highlighted word. Handwritten messages Who says manners are dead? Users get a canvas option on your keyboard for handwritten notes in iOS 10. To do it: Turn you phone horizontally (landscape mode.) Along the bottom, you'll see some prewritten options, or you can use the blank canvas to write your own. If you have terrible handwriting (see mine below) there's an undo option on the top left and a right-facing arrow on the top right if you need more room.

The man, wearing a single cream glove, was seen nonchalantly walking into the shop in France. When police wear body cameras complaints reduce by 93%, shows study However things soon took a turn, and he started picking up iPhones, placing them on the counter and smashing them with a metal pétanque ball, one after the other. After ranting at staff in French, he then turned to the camera and shouts: ‘Apple is a company that violated European consumers’ rights. ‘They refused to reimburse me, I told them “Give me my money back”. They said no. So you know what’s happening? This is happening!’ To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video He rants at staff (Picture: Twitter/@Quentin_IOS) The man later grapples with security (Picture: Twitter/@Quentin_IOS) He is eventually escorted from the store by a security guard who he is later seen grappling with.

Although the specific details on the discounts have not yet become available, it's likely that this initiative is one step closer to tailoring insurance plans to be specific to each customer's individual health. The new partnership between Apple and health insurance provider Aetna was praised by Apple CEO, Tim Cook, when he was said in the Aetna statement, "We are thrilled that Aetna will be helping their members and employees take greater control of their health using Apple Watch. Aetna’s new initiatives will be a powerful force toward creating better customer experiences in health care, and we look forward to working with Aetna to make them successful."

Follow TechnoBuffalo Yikes, one very angry potential Apple customer decided to start walking around an Apple Store in Dijon, France, smashing everything in his path. In the video below, watch as the man walks up to nearly every display iPhone, puts it face up, and then smashes it with an alleged steel ball. 9to5Mac said the customer may have been upset that the Apple Store wasn’t providing warranty coverage for one of his products under a law in the European Union that requires two years of coverage. The event unfolds relatively smoothly, nobody is hurt and the man is allowed to just continue his rampage until he’s removed from the store. iPhones aren’t the only ones damaged, though. At a few points in the video you can see the man smashing MacBooks. I’m not sure what sort of charges he faces. His actions looked childish and proved nothing. Perhaps he’ll learn that as he progresses through the court system.

Resend activation e-mail Law & Disorder / Civilization & Discontents Researchers ask federal court to unseal years of surveillance records Looking just for records that should have been unsealed but remain secret. by Cyrus Farivar - Sep 30, 2016 12:53 pm UTC Login to bookmark 15 The lawyers are petitioning a court housed in the Phillip Burton Federal Building in San Francisco. Bloomberg / Getty Images News Two lawyers and legal researchers based at Stanford University have formally asked a federal court in San Francisco to unseal numerous records of surveillance-related cases, as a way to better understand how authorities seek such powers from judges. This courthouse is responsible for the entire Northern District of California, which includes the region where tech companies such as Twitter, Apple, and Google, are based. According to the petition, Jennifer Granick and Riana Pfefferkorn were partly inspired by a number of high-profile privacy cases that have unfolded in recent years, ranging from Lavabit to Apple’s battle with the Department of Justice. As they wrote in their Wednesday filing: Most surveillance orders are sealed, however. Therefore, the public does not have a strong understanding of what technical assistance courts may order private entities to provide to law enforcement. There are at least 70 cases, many under seal, in which courts have mandated that Apple and Google unlock mobile phones—and potentially many more. The Lavabit district court may not be the only court to have ordered companies to turn over private encryption keys to law enforcement based on novel interpretations of law. Courts today may be granting orders forcing private companies to turn on microphones or cameras in cars, laptops, mobile phones, smart TVs, or other audio- and video-enabled Internet-connected devices in order to conduct wiretapping or visual surveillance. This pervasive sealing cripples public discussion of whether these judicial orders are lawful and appropriate. In their 45-page petition, they specifically say that they don’t need all sealed surveillance records, simply those that should have been unsealed—which, unfortunately, doesn’t always happen automatically. Petitioners seek the unsealing of underlying materials only from cases where there is no longer any need for secrecy, e.g., the criminal investigation has terminated, the surveillance order (including any delayed-notice order) has expired, or charges have been filed. These records are public documents and should be publicly docketed and unsealed unless good cause exists on a case-by-case basis for continued secrecy based on the facts and circumstances of the individual matter. Granick is the director of civil liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society and previously worked at Zwillgen, one of the law firms that represented Apple in the wake of the December 2015 terrorist attack in San Bernadino. Pfefferkorn is the Cryptography Fellow at the same Stanford group. Both women have been outspoken on the issue of expansive government surveillance. The petition has yet to be assigned to a judge, and as such, hearings have not been scheduled. Expand full story Reader comments 15 You must login or create an account to comment.

Originally when Foxconn acquired Sharp, analysts downplayed Foxconn's ability of being an OLED player until at least 2020. But by tag-teaming with Japan Display, the two may be able to enter Apple's OLED supply chain much quicker.   Considering that Apple is likely to only introduce one model of iPhones with the newer OLED displays in 2017, it will take until 2018 or later to ramp up other devices using OLED displays. New Apple patents revealed yesterday show that Apple is continuing to advance OLED in key areas that have historically been a problem for that technology.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

(Chee Yee Teoh / YouTube) Josh Elliott, CTVNews.ca @joshelliott14 Published Friday, September 30, 2016 8:40AM EDT Last Updated Friday, October 28, 2016 6:45AM EDT If you thought there was hope for the future of music, cast it aside now. A mind-blowing (or mind-numbing) new viral video is sweeping across the interwebs this week, captivating millions with its bizarre combination of three invisible objects: a pen, an apple and a pineapple. The video is called "PPAP Pen Pineapple Apple Pen," and some are already calling it the next "Gangnam Style" for its catchy rhythm and quirky singer, a character called Piko-Taro. Created by Japanese comedian and DJ Kosaka Daimaou, the video is massively popular in Asia, and is now taking root in the West. Justin Bieber himself tweeted about it earlier this week, calling it his "favourite video on the internet." One version of the video posted to YouTube has nearly 20 million views. Another has racked up an additional three million. The 51-second "music" video shows Kosaka Daimaou, as his alter-ego Piko-Taro, singing, miming and awkwardly dancing through an electronic-style song about pens, apples and pineapples. Set against a blank white background, the video shows Daimaou wearing a snakeskin-patterned dress shirt and pants, with a leopard-print scarf and a gold chain around his neck. He's also sporting a poorly-attached wig, sunglasses and a pencil-thin (pen-thin?) moustache. The inspired lyrics go something like this: "I have a pen. I have a apple. Uh! Apple pen! I have a pen. I have pineapple. Uh! Pineapple pen!" Jumble those words around and you can come up with the remainder of the song's lyrics. There's not much more to say about it. But click the video below, and you run the risk of saying "pen, apple, pineapple pen" all day.

Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission has started accepting applications from banks for providing Apple Pay mobile payment services and Taiwan users will be able to apply for using Apply Pay at the end of 2016 at the earliest. Four banks are expected to support the service … The report names Taiwan’s CTBC Bank, Cathay United Commercial Bank, E.SUN Commercial Bank and Taishin International Bank – though this may be simply because they are the largest banks on the island. It says that only credit cards will be supported at launch, with debit card support likely following at a later date. Apple Pay is currently available in in Australia, Canada, Mainland China, France, Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland, the UK and the United States. A special version for Japan supporting the country’s FeliCa mobile payment system is on the way. Apple also continues its U.S. rollout, with 26 new banks and credit unions added earlier this month.

Vote now! By Brian Fagioli Published 3 months ago 38 Comments Tweet Regardless of your stance on guns, I think everyone can agree that firearms deserve to be treated with respect. Even staunch 2nd amendment proponents will tell you that the weapons are not toys. Proper training and understanding of their potential danger are key for safety. Understandably, however, some parents don't want their children -- or themselves -- to have guns in their lives at all. Thanks to emoji, guns are sort of unavoidable nowadays. While parents can refuse to buy toy guns for their children, pistol symbols in communications are now a thing. Well, except on iOS 10 beta, that is. Apple has chosen to go against the tech world and Unicode consortium by using a water gun to represent the pistol emoji. Are Tim Cook and company right or wrong in this decision? First, we should consider the ramifications of having characters have different meanings based on operating system. If the water gun emoji makes it to the final version of iOS, it could be a dangerous thing. Consider this -- an Apple user tweets a water gun emoji to Hillary Clinton on Twitter. Harmless right? Well, if Ms. Clinton were to view the tweet on, say, Windows, it could be seen as a threat. The macOS user could end up in a prison cell! Let us also ponder why Apple chose to go with a more toned-down image. With all of the shootings in the media nowadays, it is understandable to not want a pistol symbol in a keyboard at this time. Tim Cook and his company are considered "liberal" by many, and I am sure they have good intentions, but maybe this possible knee-jerk reaction was not well thought out. As you can see below, Apple stands alone. Jeremy Burge, founder of Emojipedia has a simple solution. He has the following message for Apple. Apple: Don't change the pistol emoji. At least not today. Hide it. Unicode does not depreciate emojis, but there is no requirement to show all approved emojis on the keyboard. The pistol emoji could be removed from the iOS emoji keyboard without causing any cross platform compatibility issues. While hiding the emoji makes sense, it does have a negative impact on users, as they will see nothing but an empty box when someone on a different OS uses it. On the other side of the argument, we have Microsoft. The company took the opposite approach with Windows 10 Anniversary Update, by changing its ray-gun emoji into a more realistic pistol. Is the company making a pro-gun statement? Does it support violence? No! While simply bad timing, Microsoft merely chose to abide by the standard set in place by the Unicode consortium. I reached out to Microsoft, and a spokesperson told me the following. “Our intent with every glyph is to align with the global Unicode standard, and the previous design did not map to industry designs or our customers’ expectations of the emoji definition. We will continue to work with the Unicode Consortium to refine and update glyphs that reflects customer needs, feedback and supports a consistent system that works across the digital world”. On the surface, it would appear that Microsoft is on the right side of the argument, as it merely chose to follow standards. With that said, I understand Apple's desire to send the message that it is against violence -- maybe the iPhone maker is right. This is a tough one. What do you think? Please vote in the poll below. Who is right in this emoji argument? Microsoft: You should always follow standards Apple: Gun violence has no place in emojis Unsure: There's no right or wrong here View Results  Loading ...

A disgruntled customer in France entered an Apple Store in Dijon yesterday and calmly smashed devices in front of Apple staff and customers. At least 10 iPhones were smashed with a boule metal ball (used in a French bowls game), alongside a MacBook Air. French media reports suggest the angry man, who actually calmly smashed devices, was complaining about his consumer rights and a refund. The man appears to have been detained outside the store, and there are no reports of injuries apart from the broken Apple equipment. Hopefully the angry man purchased multiple AppleCare protection plans, otherwise that's going to be a costly bill for thousands of dollars of property damage. iPhone 7 and 7 Plus review Via: 9to5Mac Source: Le Bien Public Next Up In Circuit Breaker Researchers send text message using chemicals This Panasonic megaphone automatically translates commands into multiple languages Amazon is rolling out Alexa-only shopping deals Apple launches repair program for iPhone 6 Plus ‘touch disease’ flaw Google's new Pixel phone case will put the day's news where you can't avoid it Star Wars drones are coming to the US just in time for the holiday toy hunger games Now Trending Microsoft Surface Studio review: a beautiful invader of Apple's base Sand's End Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon suggests having too many Asian tech CEOs undermines ‘civic society’ This Article has a component height of 6.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 30 September 2016 | MYT 4:00 PM US health insurer to subsidise Apple Watch buys Getting people fit and fashionable: Aetna is the first major health care company to subsidise a significant portion of the cost of an Apple Watch. — AFP Relaxnews SAN FRANCISCO: A major US health insurance company said it will help buy Apple smartwatches for customers as part of a move to integrate the gadgets into wellness management programmes. Aetna announced that, in the coming open enrollment period, it will make Apple Watch buys an option for large employers and individual customers, becoming the first major health care company to subsidise "a significant portion" of the cost of an Apple Watch. Aetna would let people pay off the balances of Apple Watch buys using monthly payroll deduction plans if they wish. Aetna describes itself as one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits companies, serving an estimated 46.3 million people. Along with the customer programme, Aetna said that it planned to give each of its nearly 50,000 employees an Apple Watch if they take part in a company wellness program incorporating the Internet-connected wrist wear. "We are incredibly excited to use iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch to create simple, intuitive and personalized technology solutions that will transform the health and wellness experience for our members," Aetna chief executive Mark Bertolini said in a release. "This is only the beginning – we look forward to using these tools to improve health outcomes and help more people achieve more healthy days." Apple Watch devices synch wirelessly to iPhones. Aetna said that, with support from Apple, it is planning health initiatives exclusively tied to the California-based companies iOS mobile operating system. Initiatives will include health apps tailored for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, according to the insurance company. "We are thrilled that Aetna will be helping their members and employees take greater control of their health using Apple Watch," Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in the joint release. "Aetna's new initiatives will be a powerful force toward creating better customer experiences in health care." Features in Aetna health apps, planned for release early next year, were to include help understanding illnesses or remembering to take medicines. Apple Wallet digital billfold would be incorporated into Aetna apps, to let people pay medical bills or prescription costs. Apple has built features into Apple Watch, and the operating software for its mobile devices, to make them potentially powerful and personalised tools for individual health as well as broader medical research. Global smartwatch shipments soared eight-fold -- from five million units in 2014 to 40.3 million in 2015, according to estimates by Gartner consultancy. But the pace of growth has since slowed, with 60.4 million watches to be shipped this year and 66.3 million in 2017. Apple released its second generation smartwatch this month, with strong emphasis on supporting healthy lifestyles. —  AFP Relaxnews You May Be Interested US is concerned over Russia blocking access to LinkedIn AOL to cut 500 jobs Grab to compensate for unsuccessful bookings Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official China badminton star Lin Dan apologises for affair with model while wife was pregnant Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Higher risk of fire with home-sharing Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot The Star's executive editor Soo Ewe Jin passes away advertisement Latest News US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Most Viewed in Tech Beware!

Now one of the rumors is that the iPhone 8 is expected to feature OLED displays, and it seems that Sharp is a potential supplier. According to a report from Bloomberg, word on the street is that Apple and Sharp are currently in negotiations for the latter to manufacture OLED panels for 2017’s iPhone. However the report does state whether or not Sharp will be the main supplier. Apple typically goes with more than one supplier when possible, so it is unclear if Sharp will be producing the bulk of the OLED screens, or if Apple could also source from other companies such as Samsung, LG, or Japan Display. Assuming that the rumors are true and Apple does switch to OLED, 2017’s iPhone will mark the first time Apple will use OLED in their iPhones. As it stands, the Apple Watch is the only Apple product to sport an OLED screen, but there are rumors suggesting that an OLED touch panel could find its way into this year’s MacBook Pro refresh. In any case take it with a grain of salt, but if anything it does sound like the iPhone 8 is shaping up to be more exciting, at least design-wise, compared to this year’s iPhone. We’re hearing rumors about a glass chassis and steel edges, and also the physical removal of the home button which will be replaced by a virtual one. Filed in Apple >Cellphones >Rumors.

Stock Bounces Back After China Concerns Wane (AAPL) Walt Disney Co’s Decline Is A Buying Opportunity (DIS) Recent Posts: Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Shares Slump As Sales Miss Estimates (WMT) Here’s Why Target Corporation is Still a Buy (TGT) Walt Disney Co’s Decline Is A Buying Opportunity (DIS) View All Posts Fitbit Inc (FIT) shares tanked on Thursday following a downgrade from analysts at Pacific Crest. Pacific Crest’s checks suggest that the new Charge 2 fitness wearable is off to a slow start, and they still believe that many people who have purchased a Fitbit stop using it within months of buying it. Needless to say, this presents a long-term problem for the fitness maker, although for now, Raymond James Financial, Inc. (RJF) analysts said on Wednesday that the company still owns the segment despite big gains by the Apple Watch. Is FIT Heading to $11? In a report dated September 28, Pacific Crest analyst Brad Erickson said he has downgraded Fitbit to “underweight” and sees downside to $11 per share. The company recently launched its new Charge 2 wearable, but Erickson’s checks with 15 big box retailers in the U.S. suggest that it isn’t going so well. The retailers his team spoke with said the Charge 2 is now in full distribution, but they have found “meaningful” accumulation of inventory in the channels. In fact, the analyst said they’re finding more than two weeks’ worth of inventory on hand. It’s unclear if Best Buy was one of the retailers Erickson spoke with, but you may recall that only a little over a month ago, the big box electronics chain was talking up demand for wearables. 5 Stocks to Sell for October He does expect sell-through to ramp as the holiday shopping season approaches, but run rates for the Charge 2 are lower than where the Blaze and Alta started out earlier this year. He views this as a disappointing start. After analyzing run rates and current inventory levels, he estimates that Fitbit shipped between 600,000 and 800,000 Charge 2 wearables during the third quarter. The analyst believes Fitbit could find growth to be difficult because of its core utility issue. He still believes “a large portion” of those who own one of the company’s devices stop using it within months of receiving it. Of course this is a very basic problem that results in a high churn rate, making it difficult for the company to find growth. Apple Threatens Fitbit Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Aetna Inc (AET) announced this week that they have struck a deal for the insurer to subsidize or purchase some Apple Watches for customers and employees. Of course this is a huge blow to Fitbit, which has been making headway through corporate partnerships. “That Apple can ink an exclusive deal without a truly mass market device is scary,” Erickson wrote in his report. “Imagine what Apple could do when (not if) it comes out with a $150-$200 fitness tracker, which we expect within the next year or two.” Here’s the Good News for Fitbit On Wednesday, Raymond James analyst Tavis McCourt had some positive news for Fitbit in the form of his firm’s recent survey about fitness wearables. He said the company still has a stranglehold on the wearable market in terms of purchasing intent, with 16% of respondents saying they intended to buy one, which is a new record. Also 14% of respondents already have one, which is also the highest reading ever. Last year those figures were 14% and 12%, respectively. However, McCourt also had some troubling findings regarding Apple, which is closing the gap with Fitbit. Just 2% of his survey’s respondents own an Apple Watch, and 9% plan to buy one. The concern here is that he has found a steady increase in purchase intent for the device, although thus far, that intent has not translated into purchases. The analyst expects a “meaningful uptick” in demand for the Apple Watch the year the company gets the wearable “right,” although it would seem that it hasn’t arrived yet. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Tracks Everyone You Chat With Apple did unveil the Series 2 models along with the iPhone 7 lineup, but so far the new iPhone has gotten all the attention (good and bad). Fitbit shares plunged by about 10% to as low as $14.97 during regular trading hours today, while Apple stock slipped by as much as 1.54% to $112.20 on a bearish report from Barclays.

The Osaka-based company would be one of a handful of OLED suppliers for Apple, and the deal is said to originate from the Cupertino company's "desire to increase the number of suppliers for OLED screens" for a number of future devices. The rumor of Apple's negotiations with Sharp followed a report on Friday that said the electronics manufacturer is set to spend $570 million on OLED panel production. Sharp will use the funds to purchase equipment for OLED production in its Osaka and Mie factories, with the ultimate goal to start production "by June 2018." According to some watching the negotiations, Apple is encouraging Sharp to enter the OLED business. “Apple has unofficially or as a nod encouraged Sharp to go into it,” said Amir Anvarzadeh, Singapore-based head of Japanese equity sales at BGC Partners Inc., in a phone interview. “Apple’s general strategy is to increase the competition on the supply side, and dilute the risk exposure to one company.” “This investment is in response to what Apple is doing,” said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute in Tokyo. “Production isn’t likely to begin until the second half of 2018, so the impact to profit won’t be until after that.” Earlier in the year, Sharp was acquired by another Apple supplier, Foxconn, in a $6.2 billion takeover that saved the former company from a string of financial losses and $4.3 billion in debt, which Foxconn was reported as prepared to take on. The investment in OLED screen technology is said to be a "strategic plan" adopted from Foxconn as the two companies follow Apple into the future of iPhone manufacturing. Apple reportedly accounts for 27 percent of Sharp's revenue. Next year's so-called "iPhone 8" is believed to come with an OLED display, along with an all-glass body, edge-to-edge, bezel-free display, and a Home button that's integrated into the screen. Since Sharp's OLED facilities are aiming for a mid-to-late 2018 output, the manufacturer will miss 2017's mega-cycle iPhone launch, however. Currently, the only supplier signed on to create OLED displays for the iPhone 8 is Samsung.

I expect them to finally bump the resolution a little higher as well (more so for the 4.7" since its not even 1080p). OLED is not so hot, has tradeoffs that make it less appealing than even the current LCD and I expect Apple will skip it. mLED is the next step. [doublepost=1475240714][/doublepost] OLED is definitely the superior technology. You have to feel bad for the engineers working on lcd though. They spend so much time and energy perfecting it, and then bloop. It's gone. No, it's really not superior but absolutely not "definitely superior".

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Supplier TSMC Developing Smartphone Chips to Power Next Wave of Innovative Features | Main | Sharp may Tag-Team with Japan Display to Enter Apple's OLED Supply Chain by 2018 » September 30, 2016 Apple's iPhone 7 Likely to Land in South Korea on October 21 as Samsung's Woes Deepen   The Korean tech press is reporting today that Apple Korea and 3 mobile network providers have agreed to sell iPhone 7 series through Apple Korea's homepage and mobile network providers' stores starting on Friday October 21, pending Cupertino's final approval.   With the Korean press being unhappy about how the Galaxy Note 7's battery crisis was handled in the U.S. made it a point to kick the new iPhone by stating that it has few innovations, that the jet black model is easily scratched and that the iPhone hisses when used all day.   At the peak of the iPhone 6 mania in Korea, Apple's iPhone held 33% market share in South Korean. Their market share now stands around 20%. Though according to a Gallup poll this summer, South Korean's in their 20's prefer the iPhone over anything from Samsung whereas those in their 50's prefer Samsung. A trend that has to have Samsung nervous.   And the news isn't getting any better for Samsung in South Korea. Once Apple cracked the ceiling in South Korea, Chinese competitors are now planning to flood the South Korean market with more choice which is going to ding Samsung the most. South Korea was once a safe haven for Samsung where they could count on dominating the market and help boost profits.   It'd being reported today in Korea that "Foreign smartphone-makers are speeding up their expansion in the Korean market long dominated by local brands Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics. A string of foreign smartphone brands Apple, Huawei, Sony and Blackberry have recently unveiled or plan to roll out their new devices here."   Chung Hei-sang, a senior researcher at Korea Economic Research Institute stated that "Korea is a good test-bed for new smartphones because of its fast Internet speed and tech-savvy consumers."   Hei-sang added that "The law to restrict phone subsidies, which makes it difficult for Samsung and LG difficult to cut costs, has opened more door for foreign low-budget phones to enter the local market." In fact to make that point clear, yesterday Huawei unveiled its smartphone H, which costs around 200,000 won – four times cheaper than the Galaxy Note 7 (1 million won) and V20 (900,000 won).   Between the Note 7 recall and now cheap Android competitors rushing into South Korea, 2017 isn't looking very good for Samsung.   And the cherry on top could be Apple opening its first flagship store in South Korea in 2017 if they're able to land a prime location that they're hoping to secure shortly.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Any OLED supply agreement would depend on the Osaka-based company’s output capacity, said the person, who asked not to be identified because talks aren’t public. The discussions stem from Apple’s desire to increase the number of suppliers for OLED screens, according to the person. Earlier on Friday, Sharp announced it will invest 57.4 billion yen ($566 million) for the development of OLED production facilities, with the goal of starting output by June 2018. The funds will be used for equipment in Sharp’s factories in Mie and Osaka, and to deliver sample products to customers, the company said in a statement. “Apple has unofficially or as a nod encouraged Sharp to go into it,” said Amir Anvarzadeh, Singapore-based head of Japanese equity sales at BGC Partners, in a phone interview. “Apple’s general strategy is to increase the competition on the supply side, and dilute the risk exposure to one company.” Sharp spokesman Toyodo Uemura declined to comment on specific customers. An Apple spokesperson in Japan didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Sharp’s capital investment in OLED is part of 200 billion yen that the manufacturer had already committed to OLED technology, part of a strategic plan it adopted with new owner Foxconn Technology Group. Next-generation screens based on OLED, or organic light-emitting diode, technology promise more vivid images and less battery drain. Friday’s announced investment will be for smartphone displays, a representative of Sharp said without identifying specific customers. “This investment is in response to what Apple is doing,” said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute in Tokyo. “Production isn’t likely to begin until the second half of 2018, so the impact to profit won’t be until after that.” Sharp shares rose as much as 2.2 percent after the announcement, but closed unchanged Friday in Tokyo. The stock has climbed 8 percent this year, compared with the broader market’s 15 percent decline. Apple accounts for about 27 percent of Sharp’s revenue, according to Bloomberg’s supply chain analysis. Earlier this year, the Japanese company agreed to accept a rescue package from Foxconn Technology Group, ending a takeover battle that spanned four years. Last month, the company said its liabilities no longer exceed assets after receiving a 289 billion yen infusion. * With assistance from Yuji Nakamura BLOOMBERG Like us on Facebook Connect with us on LinkedIn Hungry for more business news?

According to a new report from the Wall Street Journal, the deal could be finalized in the next two or three months, marking the latest in a string of mergers in the semiconductor industry. NXP was ranked No. 7 in terms of revenue among global semiconductor companies in 2015. The company is known for co-creating the near-field communication (NFC) technology behind wireless payment services like Apple Pay and Android Pay. The company is a leading chip supplier for Apple Apple and Samsung smartphones, and a major supplier of chips for both the auto and IoT industries, especially after its $12 billion acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor late last year. A deal would consolidate the combined company's position as the third largest semiconductor company by revenue, behind Intel and Samsung Electronics. Qualcomm is a major player in the smartphone industry with its popular Snapdragon series of SoCs and wireless modems. But the company’s revenues have been hit by slowing smartphone sales and contracting demand for high end devices, with budget devices from Chinese companies putting profit margins under pressure. The deal should accelerate its diversification to other areas of growth. The Wall Street Journal notes that the acquisition is not yet final and could fall apart. The chip industry has seen an influx in mergers and acquisitions — up to $145 billion in M&A deals last year according to Dealogic. Some of them include Avago Technologies' $37 billion purchase of Broadcom, Intel's $17 billion acquisition of Altera, and WD’s $16 billion acquisition of SanDisk.
