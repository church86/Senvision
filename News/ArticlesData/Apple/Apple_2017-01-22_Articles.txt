Before long, many manufacturers have looked unto Apple as their source of new product features. Now, a new report suggests that the Cupertino-based company is once again aiming to introduce the biggest changes for the upcoming iPhone 8. According to a report from financial analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple might introduce a new technology for the Touch ID feature of the iPhone. In the said report, Kuo detailed that the company aims to improve the fingerprint reading hardware for the much rumored iPhone 8. The improvements will focus on the new technology to be used by Apple in order to incorporate the sensor underneath the phone’s display panel. The report also suggests that Apple is looking into embedding the entire Touch ID sensor underneath the display panel. This, however, will require major design changes on the part of the display makers. Nevertheless, Apple can still push the technology ahead. Especially if it meant that it will bring necessary value to the iPhone 8. iPhone 7 Touch ID (via apple.com) In addition to the improved Touch ID sensor, Apple is also working on facial recognition for the iPhone 8. Although not entirely new, Kuo believes that Apple intends to complement fingerprint scanning with facial recognition on the iPhone 8. Kuo also mentioned that Apple might get rid of the Touch ID sensor in factor of facial recognition. However, this may take some time since development of such will need massive engineering design efforts. Before Apple could potentially replace fingerprint reading with facial recognition, it will need to implement new technologies to make sure that it is fool-proof. For one, the facial recognition feature should be able recognize a photo from a real person. Furthermore, the facial verification database would have to be optimized for faster processing. That being said, it could be that Touch ID will be here to stay, at least for the time being. The iPhone 8, as it stands, will gain new features on release. Whether these rumours hold any grain of truth or not, readers are still advised to take caution. For more updates on the iPhone 8, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

The current version available is iOS 10.2, with 10.3 under developer’s beta. As for the next release, it could be that the iOS 11 will get a September release just like the previously version. However, some rumors have started to circulate regarding upcoming features of the next mobile operating system from Apple. According to recent article from The Verifier, the next iOS release will feature heavily on social media applications like iMessage and Facetime. The report also mentioned that FaceTime will get the much awaited group video call feature. FaceTime Group Video Calls As it stands, the group video call is only available on macOS versions of FaceTime. iOS users have long been waiting for Apple to finally include that group video calls on the mobile platform. However, if the claims turn out to be true, it would seem that mobile users will finally get what they have been asking for. Current iOS 10 User Interface (via apple.com) More iOS improvements Another feature that users expect from iOS 11 is the addition of the “dark mode”. Ever since iOS 9, many users have longed to have the same feature that Android devices have been using for years. However, as the current display for the iPhone remains to be of LCD technology, having the said feature will not bring any energy savings at all. Nevertheless, the rumored switch to OLED display may finally make it possible for Apple to implement such theme. iOS 11 official unveiling Apple normally announces upcoming products during its Worldwide Developers Conference event. This year’s WWDC will be held some time in June. As expected, will focus on products like the iOS and desktop and laptop hardware. There is a very strong chance that Apple will officially announce the iOS 11 during the said event. As far as the report goes, the group video call for FaceTime is currently under development. However, Apple still has the last say on whether the new feature will be included on the iOS 11 release. For more updates in iOS 11, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Mike Elgan (Computerworld (US)) 21 January, 2017 23:00 - - - - print email Comments It's easy to dismiss the speculation that Apple is working on smart glasses. It's hard to picture Apple selling smart glasses. But it's also hard to picture them not doing it. If smart glasses become a popular and mainstream consumer electronics category, Apple will almost be required to enter the market as a fiduciary responsibility to Apple shareholders. Consider the plight of poor Apple. Smartphone margins are shrinking. The tablet market is flabby. Smartwatches aren't panning out as a mainstream platform. Apple TV is still not going to bring in huge profits. So Apple has to adapt and keep up with the evolution of consumer technology to continue to dominate the market as well as secure its growth. Also, the choice of smartphone in the future may be dictated by the use of smart glasses. If mainstream smart glasses require an Android phone, Apple could lose market share. What's certain is that Apple is working on smart glasses. Bloomberg reported in November that Apple was thinking about entering the "digital glasses" market. That report was based on anonymous sources, who said Apple is considering glasses that would go on sale next year and "show images and other information in the wearer’s field of vision, and may use augmented reality." ODG ODG's R-8 smart glasses give you what looks like a 90-inch 3D screen that appears to float 10 feet in front of you. The glasses also have two 1080p cameras. Apple would never make anything like this. The Financial Times reported early last year that Apple was building a large team focused on augmented and virtual reality, and had poached employees from Microsoft and Lytro. Intriguingly, Apple has made some augmented reality-based company acquisitions. Apple bought PrimeSense, which makes the sensor technology in Microsoft's Kinect. They also nabbed augmented reality startups Metaio, Faceshift, Emotient and Flyby. AR-related patents by Apple go back a decade. And tech blogger and evangelist Robert Scoble posted a rumor on Facebook that Apple may be working with Carl Zeiss on smart glasses. (I told you about Carl Zeiss Smart Optics technology in this space a year ago.) All that planning, thinking and spending may pay off for Apple when smart glasses go mainstream. And when I say mainstream, I mean totally mainstream. What if nearly all glasses were smart glasses? The company that makes your glasses is getting 'smart' The signs of the mainstreaming of augmented and mixed reality are everywhere. The biggest one yet happened earlier this week when French lens giant Essilor merged with Italy's eyeglass behemoth Luxottica in a $53 billion deal that will result in the world's largest glasses company, to be called EssilorLuxottica. Wait, Essilor? Luxottica? These aren't exactly well-known companies in tech circles. Let me introduce you. Essilor is the world's largest maker of corrective lenses. The company is strongly focused on research and introduced the world's first branded progressive lenses. You also may have encountered Essilor on its retail sites, FramesDirect.com and EyeBuyDirect.com. Your optometrist definitely has. The company runs the MyOnlineOptical e-commerce site for eyecare professionals. Essilor also unveiled last year a prototype of an augmented reality system for the visually impaired called MyEye, which enables any text to be read, converted to text and then read aloud to the wearer. And you're probably already a big Luxottica customer. The company sells under most of the mainstream brands you're familiar with, including Ray-Ban, Oakley, Vogue Eyewear, Giorgio Armani, Brooks Brothers, Bulgari, Burberry, Chanel, Coach, Dolce & Gabbana, DKNY, Polo Ralph Lauren, Prada, Ralph Lauren, Versace and many others. And you've likely shopped at Luxottica stores, including Sunglass Hut, LensCrafters, Pearle Vision, Sears Optical, Target Optical, Glasses.com and others. So the world's biggest lens company is merging with the world's biggest frame company. Here's the best part: Essilor CEO Hubert Sagnières told the media that the purpose of the merger was innovation in "connected glasses," and the ability to deliver them "extremely fast to consumers through all the stores of the world and all [our] networks," according to the Financial Times. I'll refer you to the list of brands and stores above. That's where the world's largest eyeglasses company plans to deliver smart glasses, and fast. What's wrong with today's smart glasses? While lots of companies explore what's possible with the technology, and what's desirable among consumers, the field is really wide open for Apple and EssilorLuxottica. Consider what's out there. We all know about the splashy, high-end, mixed reality projects, including Microsoft's HoloLens and Magic Leap's big project. And, recently, we learned a lot more from CES. A San Francisco-based company called Osterhaut Design Group (ODG), which already sells successful industrial AR smart glasses, this month unveiled a sub-$1,000 pair for consumers called the R-8. The glasses connect to an Android phone via Bluetooth LE. The company claims that the glasses show two 720p screens that look to the wearer like one 90-inch 3D screen that appears to float 10 feet in front. The glasses also have two 1080p cameras. This is a great example of what's happening in the market generally. Current consumer smart-glasses products are either too high-powered and therefore bulky, too expensive, too ambitious or too narrowly focused -- for example, on sports performance. The Sony SmartEyeGlass, GlassUp UNO and Factory 4.0, Epson Moverio BT-300, Jins Meme, Recon Jet, Optinvent Ora-2 Professional Smart Glass, CastAR, LaForge Shima, Oakley’s Radar Pace and HiAR Glasses all fall into these categories. They're all too much on the face to be worn around all the time. Another emerging category are so-called smart glasses that measure brain waves. Safilo Group, which is the company behind Dior, Fendi and Hugo Boss glasses, is developing ordinary looking glasses that measure brainwaves, then send that data to an app where users can monitor their moods. Finally, of course, there is the already thriving enterprise smart glasses market. Chinese computer and smartphone giant Lenovo launched new smart glasses at CES. The company's Glass C200 product comes with a pocket unit that connects the glasses via high speed LTE mobile wireless. I told you about Osterhaut Design Group's consumer announcement. They also announced an R-9 for enterprises. We've been hearing about Vuzix's M300 Smart Glasses for enterprise for quite a while, but the product should go on sale this month. Why the market is wide open for Apple All the bulky, goofy, expensive smart glasses on the market now may find niches in gaming, drone-control, enterprise and other uses. But they won't go mainstream, and therefore won't change how we use our mobile devices. I wrote in this space about Vue glasses, which use bone-conduction audio and blinking lights to deliver communion with a smartphone and thereby deliver smartness. They offer neither screen nor camera. But they do offer one feature that makes them more mainstream than all the other products I told you about: They can pass for regular glasses. They also demonstrate a core feature of smart glasses that just about everyone overlooks. It turns out that glasses are a perfect place to deliver audio interaction -- a microphone and bone-conduction audio. Because glasses can hold a bigger battery, glasses are better than earbuds for interaction with a virtual assistant, such as Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant or Cortana. They can be worn all day, every day. They keep the ears unobstructed. And the battery can last for days between charges. For that reason alone I believe smart glasses are inevitable. Any subtle integration of a screen -- perchance a camera -- is frosting on the cake, so to speak. The weird thing about wearables is that they're fashion, with all the attributes of customization and personal identity associated with fashion. The tech sector has proved that it's not really up to the challenge of offering compelling fashion designs in wearables. But Luxottica is a fashion company. And, let's face it, Apple is too. Apple demonstrated as much with its Apple Watch, which comes in a dizzying variety of types, faces and bands. I think the world of mainstream smart glasses is coming. These glasses will have to look just like regular prescription glasses and sunglasses. And you'll be able to order them as a check-box item whenever you get your regular glasses. When you think of smart glasses as ugly, bulky and dorky like today's smart glasses, it doesn't seem like Apple would enter the market. But when you realize that tomorrow's smart glasses will look like ordinary glasses, that they'll be mainstream consumer devices, and that they'll be luxury fashion goods, it's clear that Apple will definitely want to get a share of the market. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Now, the chipmaker has responded by saying Apple’s claims are “baseless” and encourages “regulatory attacks.” Here’s Qualcomm’s full statement: “While we are still in the process of reviewing the complaint in detail, it is quite clear that Apple’s claims are baseless. Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing program. Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information. We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits,” said Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel, Qualcomm Incorporated. Up until 2016 with the iPhone 7, Qualcomm was the sole supplier for the LTE chips found in the iPhone. With the latest iPhone, in addition to Qualcomm, Intel began manufacturing LTE chips for the iPhone. Apple says that Qualcomm forced the company to use its chip and pay back a percentage of the phone’s selling price in return to access its patents.

OTOH, after reading both articles, Apple may actually have a point as Qualcomm is well known for attacking anyone and everyone like a patent troll, but in their case they own something like a third to half the patents to most everything electronic you use every day! (And they did develop them.) The most telling example of how extreme it is is that Qualcomm and others’ patents are why the Chinese developed TD-LTE. At the end of the day, though, it’s all about the pot calling the kettle black.

Reuters/Beck Diefenbach The Apple MacBook Pro 2016 created immense buzz before it was released and even after it hit the shelves. While the laptop sports some pretty amazing specs, its battery life and lesser capacity RAM was criticised. Now, the Dell XPS 15 laptop has become quite a rage as it being marketed as the “world's smallest 15.6-inch laptop.” While both laptops are incredible additions and cater to specific consumer needs, it is important to know about the differences in specs and features for a more informed buying decision. Display-wise, the Dell XPS 15 laptop has a 15.6-inch 4K Ultra HD InfinityEdge display with a screen resolution of 3,840 x 2,160 pixels. Many find it slightly better than Apple MacBook Pro 2016’s 15.4-inch Retina Display that comes with a screen resolution of 2,880 x 1,800 pixels. Apple has promoted its display stating that it is 67 percent brighter than previous models and consumes 30 percent less energy. When it comes to processor capacity, Apple scores more though XPS 15’s RAM is better. The MacBook Pro 2016 has been incorporated with a quad-core seventh-gen Intel Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost, which is significantly better than Dell XPS 15’s quad-core i5-7300HQ processor. However, Dell offers an 8GB RAM that is expandable up to 32GB. Fans expected the MacBook Pro 2016 to sport a better RAM than its current 16GB configuration, reviews Tech Times. The high-end Dell XPS 15 model has a 256GB SSD whereas the MacBook Pro 2016 comes with 256GB and 512GB SSD options. The Dell XPS 15 laptop runs on Windows 10 and offers 97 watt-hour battery while the MacBook Pro 2016 runs on macOS Sierra and offers 76 watt-hour battery. Both have a 720p HD camera though the XPS 15 has a widescreen camera. The MacBook Pro 2016 has Bluetooth 4.2 compared to XPS 15’s Bluetooth 4.1. The Dell laptop has a highly responsive keyboard and trackpad whereas the MacBook Pro 2016 has a new Touch Bar. When it comes to price, fans will be surprised by the difference. The Apple MacBook Pro 2016 price starts at US$2,499 (AU$3,300) and the Dell XPS 15 premium variant has a price tag of US$1,599 (AU$2,100). However, everything comes to individual tastes and preferences and what exactly people want their laptop to do.

'Apple is willing to invest in the facility together because they need the (panels) as well,' said Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou.  (Justin Sullivan / Getty Images File Photo)   By Bloomberg Sun., Jan. 22, 2017 Foxconn Technology Group Chairman Terry Gou told reporters in Taipei the company is considering a joint investment with Apple for a display manufacturing facility in the U.S., according to a report by the Nikkei Asian Review. The facility would cost more than $7 billion and may create an eventual 30,000 to 50,000 jobs, the publication cited Gou as saying. The rising demand for larger displays makes domestic U.S. production a better solution than shipping from China and “Apple is willing to invest in the facility together because they need the (panels) as well,” he said. Apple didn’t immediately respond Sunday to a Bloomberg request for comment. Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., is also planning a new moulding facility in the U.S., possibly in Pennsylvania, Nikkei reported. Separately, Smart Technologies, a Foxconn-controlled interactive display company in Canada, may move to the U.S. in light of President Donald Trump’s indication he may seek to alter terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Nikkei reported Gou as saying. Gou said he sees American protectionism as “inevitable” while questioning whether U.S. consumers will be willing to pay much higher prices for equipment of equal quality, according to Nikkei. The publication said Gou spoke to reporters after Foxconn’s holiday party in the Nankang district of Taipei.

US President Donald Trump announced before taking office a $50 billion deal by the two firms which he said would bring 50,000 jobs. Trump was speaking in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York alongside SoftBank's chief executive Masayoshi Son. Foxconn, a major supplier to Apple, had earlier said it was in "preliminary discussions" with US officials about a potential investment but gave no details. "I have discussed with my major clients about going to (the US) and they are also willing to invest, including Apple," Terry Gou told reporters in Taipei after the company's year-end party. The firm is the world's largest contract electronics maker and is best-known for assembling products for international brands such as Apple and Sony. "Pennsylvania is active and I urge other states to act more quickly or I will sign the contract with Pennsylvania," he said, adding that the investment could create 30,000-50,000 jobs. Foxconn is still waiting to see the tax policies of the new US government and what incentives state authorities can offer, such as cheap land and electricity, Gou added. Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai, employs around a million workers at its factories across China and has operations in more than 10 countries. Last year it took over the struggling Japanese electronics maker Sharp after acquiring a 66 percent stake for $3.7 billion in a move Gou described as "really worth it." In the US, it has a plant in Virginia for packaging and engineering which employes over 400 people. It has also announced a $40 million investment in a facility in Pennsylvania to build precision tools and develop a robotics programme. Gou said Foxconn aims to increase investment in China this year to try to boost Sharp's market share in the country, but denied reports that he had been pressured by China over his planned US investment. Almost immediately after he won the November election, Trump angered China by accepting a congratulatory call from Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen. He further upset Beijing when he threatened to get tough with what he sees as unfair Chinese trade practice and suggested that the "One China" policy is negotiable.   Tweet More by AFP RELATED NEWS October 10, 2016, 11:57 am Taiwan president calls on China to engage in talks with Taiwan April 21, 2016 LiLo confirms mulling converting to Islam September 20, 2012 Foxconn plant April 30, 2012 Foxconn workers sing its praises, but profit disappoints MORE IN BUSINESS January 24, 2017, 8:21 pm Oil prices rise as OPEC output cuts drain stocks January 24, 2017 Khurram seeks trade officers’ help to diversify exports January 24, 2017 Italian, Russian diplomats show interest in agri potential of Sindh January 24, 2017 Trump tells manufacturers he will cut taxes Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus TODAY'S POPULAR Most Viewed | Most Commented India was prepared to use hydrogen bomb on Pak nuclear ...

However, some could not help but notice the out-of-place product features of Apple devices all throughout the show. English actor Benedict Cumberbatch plays the titular character in the hit PBS-BBC drama series. Those who have been following the fourth installment noticed how he now uses gadgets by the Cupertino-based company. These are the iPhone 6S Plus and the MacBook Pro. Sherlock Season 4 viewers react CNET pointed out that it is not the first time for Sherlock Holmes to use the two products in the show. However, the placements are reportedly more predominant and striking based on the last couple of episodes. Because of this, both tech and show enthusiasts have been debating if it is appropriate for his character and the story. Some pointed out that Sherlock Holmes is supposed to be the greatest detective of all time. As such, the blatant placements of seemed very inappropriate. Others said that the glaring product features seemingly distracted viewers from the scene. Apple “too hip” for Sherlock? The report pointed out that fans are attracted to Sherlock due to his independent streak. The fictional icon is also known for thinking outside the box. In fact, he is even deemed as anti-social by some people. In spite of all this, the character’s unique personality has endeared fans and solved many mysteries. This has raised the inconsistency in suddenly having him “endorse” such as hip, popular product like an iPhone and Macbook. The said smartphone is currently one of the most recognizable handsets in the market. The pro version of Apple’s famous laptop is also known to be one of the most mainstream computers today. Parodical fan theories Sherlock Holmes was originally created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in the late 1800s. Being a classic title,  it is no surprise why his hardcore fans have been snobbish about the Apple endorsement. It is also understandable why techies find the placements very odd for the show. The CNET report ran through several “fan theories” related to the issue. They jokingly alleged that the private detective probably wants to be “cool” and fit in. Others pointed out that Watson or his brother Mycroft might have a free upgrade on a family carrier plan. What do you think of the Apple placements in Sherlock season 4?

Don’t listen to the hype; Apple is still the most innovative tech company in the world. While it’s true that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus weren’t huge upgrades, a recent Inquisitr article notes that the iPhone 8 may be completely redesigned. Then, there is the issue of the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar series. While Apple would have been better off referring to it as the “2016 MacBook Air with Touch Bar” series, Apple’s new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros are solid performers with beautiful screens and greatly improved keyboards (though not everybody likes the butterfly keys). Apple’s AirPods are a hit. [Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] Then, there are the AirPods, Apple’s latest wireless earbuds, which were delayed by two months. Apple was criticized for saying that they don’t like shipping items until they’re “ready for our customers,” but once Apple shipped them at the end of December, the wait (if you were actually waiting) was worth it. The reason that not everybody was exactly waiting for the AirPods is because several different companies have tried to push usable earbuds to customers and have failed miserably. Leave it to Apple, once again, to swoosh in, take something that other companies have failed at and produce something that’s not only usable but groundbreaking. The AirPods aren’t like any other wireless buds or headsets in that they actually feel like an extension of your ears. Connecting them is incredibly simple (they connect once you take them out of the dental floss-shaped charger box), and after they sit in your ears for a short amount of time, you don’t feel like they are there. And despite fears that they will fall out, it’s almost certain that they won’t. If you are at the gym wearing the buds and forcefully take off your shirt, it’s possible the cloth can hit one of the buds and force it out of your ear. But that’s an example of a very rare occurrence. The best thing about the AirPods isn’t the way they fit or how easy they connect; it’s the sound quality that makes these shine the most. If you are expecting these to sound as good as your $300 – $400 Bose or Sennheiser wireless headphones, you’re missing the point of the AirPods. They are meant to be an affordable wireless solution that makes your life a lot more convenient. The technology isn’t there yet to make earbuds sound as good as wireless headphones with 40mm drivers. The AirPods prove Apple is still relevant. [Image by Daryl Deino] But that doesn’t mean Apple overlooked sound quality. As a matter of fact, as even Pocket Lint notes, the AirPods not only sound better than the regular EarPods that ship with the iPhone, but they sound better than just about any other in-ear buds. There is a noticeable bass presence, but the real star here is the clarity, which compares to that of many wired headphones. The AirPods don’t have noise cancellation yet as that would make the battery life last less than an hour. But if you used headphones with noise cancellation for the past several years, it will feel great to be able to hear an oncoming car while jogging. Sometimes, you don’t want to shun the rest of the world out. You will still use my Bose QC35s when sleeping (best sleep aid ever!) or writing articles at Starbucks, but the AirPods certainly have their purpose. Apple’s new buds represent the first product from Apple in several years that isn’t overpriced. For $159, Apple’s wireless AirPods offer a variety of features that will make your smartphone experience a lot more convenient. Your turn, Samsung.

According to the report, Apple is “mulling” a joint investment with Foxconn for a $7 billion automated display facility in the United States… This isn’t the first we’ve heard about a possible United States expansion for Foxconn and Apple. Last month, it was reported that Foxconn had held discussions about an expansion. It was also reported that Apple itself had asked Foxconn and Pegatron to investigate manufacturing iPhones in the United States. Today’s report, however, details that Apple and Foxconn are considering a $7 billion joint investment in the United States. Specifically, the two parties are mulling a highly automated display facility that would eventually create some 30,000 to 50,000 jobs in the Untied States. Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou told reporters that Apple is interested in the partnership because it needs the panels: “Apple is willing to invest in the facility together because they need the [panels] as well,” Gou told reporters after the company’s annual year-end party in the Nankang district of Taipei. The U.S. production site eventually would create 30,000 to 50,000 jobs, the Taiwanese tycoon said. Gou, however, expressed doubt as to whether or not Americans would be willing to pay more for a U.S.-made product. To help combat the more expensive production in the United States, Gou pleaded with U.S. officials to offer concessions on the price of land and electricity: “In the future they may be paying some $500 more for [U.S.] products, but those do not necessarily work better than a $300 phone,” he said, after urging U.S. authorities to provide concessions on land and electricity to facilitate Foxconn’s manufacturing operations. Last week, we ran a poll asking two questions: “Should Apple manufacture the iPhone in America?” and “Would you pay more for an America-made iPhone?” The majority of readers respond that Apple shouldn’t have to make iPhones in America and that they wouldn’t pay more for an iPhone made in America. Apple itself has yet to comment on the speculation that it is planning an investment in United States manufacturing, but the company is also planning an investment in manufacturing in India.

Any idiot could see it the instant a dashing civil servant casually started making small talk in the queue for coffee from a kiosk in the Palace of Westminster. Anybody except Dr. Carmichael of course… She was far from an idiot but, unlike most of us, the attractive eminent genetic scientist obviously hadn’t watched the innumerable salacious scandals in TV dramas down through the ages from Bouquet Of Barbed Wire to The Affair. New drama: Anybody could tell things were going to end badly for Dr Yvonne Carmichael in Apple Tree Yard - the BBC's adaptation of Louise Doughty’s thriller Inevitably her life – like her emotions and her sense of reason – was soon spiraling out of control.

Share this article Share Mind you to be fair, not even the most experienced viewer could have foreseen the terrible, savage, sting in the tale that eventually befell her. (She was raped, and not by the man she had unwisely, illogically, become involved with.) Just like Bouquet Of Barbed Wire and The Affair (or Mistresses, Homeland, and House Of Games) the sex and the storyline in Apple Tree Yard were totally ridiculous but ridiculously gripping. The four-part adaptation of Louise Doughty’s controversial steamy thriller started with a classic voice-over by Dr. Carmichael (played by the mesmerising Emily Watson ) as she was taken to court, in handcuffs, in the back of a prison van. ‘Before I met you I was a civilised woman,’ she said. ‘Now I don’t even know what ‘civilised’ means.’ Not a good start to be honest…She'd clearly lost all knowledge of dictionaries. Dangerous territory: Just like Bouquet Of Barbed Wire and The Affair (or Mistresses, Homeland, and House Of Games) Apple Tree Yard was totally ridiculous but ridiculously gripping ‘Food, shelter, sex…Once those needs are covered we can pretend we’re in control’ she went on. ‘But really we’re all just animals. Do you know how I know that? Fear – fear for your life. Once you’ve felt that, this so-called civilisation is a dream. You’ve taught me that, my love. Fear makes animals of us all.’ We got the picture... Cut to nine months earlier. Dr Carmichael, an expert on DNA, had just given evidence to a Parliamentary Select Committee about ‘Franken-foods.’ ‘You were very articulate in there,’ purred a suave, suited, civil servant (Ben Chaplin) as they queued for refreshments. ‘First time I’ve known what a genome is !’ Having broken the ice with the old 'genome' line, he lured her into his clutches/web, asking ‘have you seen the chapel in the crypt?’ – a chat-up line we’ve all tried let's face it. It probably helps if you look like Ben Chaplin, who was certainly well-cast if not necessarily totally credible. Stranger: Dr Carmichael (Emily Watson) had just given evidence to a Parliamentary Select Committee when a suave, suited, civil servant (Ben Chaplin) lured her into his clutches Deep in the bowels of a Westminster, the real attraction of this beautiful ‘royal peculiar’ (the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft) was a tiny broom cupboard. Crammed inside she read the plaque commemorating this was the place where the Derby Day suffragette Emily Wilding Davison ‘hid herself illegally during the night of the 1911 census’, allowing her to record her address as being ‘in the House of Commons.’ ‘I knew you’d be interested,’ he said. He was right. But more in him than Emily Wilding Davison… Whether the suffragettes had fought for a woman’s right to have torrid sex up against the wall of a broom cupboard with a man she had only just met standing on a metal bucket was debatable. Whether Dr Carmichael's rationale (or lack of it) for becoming embroiled in the liaison was distinctly dubious too. We were given only cursory insights into her vague dissatisfaction with her notoriously ‘sensible’ life - married to a lecherous lecturer, missing her grown up son, and devoted to her work. Encounter: Deep in the bowels of a Westminster, the real attraction of this beautiful ‘royal peculiar’ (the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft) was an illicit encounter Anyway, when she bumped into ‘Mr X’ again, their affair began – without her ever knowing his name (in the manner of Last Tango In Paris) and always in public: playing ‘footsie’ under the table in bars, having sex in toilets or alleyways (specifically in ‘Apple Tree Yard’). She had started a ‘diary’ on her computer at home, filed on the computer under ‘VAT Query 3’ as a precaution. ‘What we did today is without doubt the most reckless act I have ever committed. I know nothing about you. Well one thing...Sex with you is like being eaten by a wolf. Will you even give me a second thought, or is this just something you do?’ This was one of those questions where if you have to ask deep down you probably know the answer. The signs were all there. After their frenzied passion in the broom cupboard, when she confessed ‘I’ve never done anything like that before’, he did not reply ‘me neither’ but merely grin ‘lucky me !’ He was revealingly too meticulous about how to cover things up, as a ‘spook’ would be: pointing out that she had been carrying her coat not wearing it just before they had sex ‘in case someone noticed’; having cigarettes on him even though he didn’t smoke because it was ‘handy sometimes’; and buying her a mobile for secret texts. Diving in: Their affair began – without her ever knowing his name and always in public: playing ‘footsie’ under the table in bars, having sex in toilets or alleyways ‘Don’t top it up at the same place twice - because it establishes a pattern,’ he recommended, enjoying observing ‘which is the exact opposite of what you do in your job.’ She had told him that the most common misconception about scientists was that ‘we know what we’re doing’ when the truth was ‘I’m just scrabbling about in the dirt’ – with him, more than ever. Even she didn’t know what 98% of the DNA in the human genome was really for. Not that this seemed to be the justification for her kamikaze actions. Their first row had been about genetics, when she realized he was ‘turned on’ by having sex in public places and he confessed she was right. ‘It just does ! It’s probably genetic,’ he made the mistake of suggesting (to a world expert). ‘Christ ! You really think that means something?!’ she spat. ‘That it absolves you of all responsibility - just hard wiring?!’ Trouble ahead: Their first row had been about genetics, when she realized he was ‘turned on’ by having sex in public places and he confessed she was right He had assumed she had been as aroused by the danger of sex in public as he was. ‘No,’ she stated simply. ‘It’s you actually. YOU turn me on.’ This was the moral of the story (or one of them): even with the most intelligent, complicated people this was what sex/desire/an affair comes down to. Anyone who had not read the book probably assumed Dr Carmichael’s undoing would be the affair - that she did not know what she was doing: the way she left her tablet lying around for her husband to find after she had been searching for ‘STD Clinics’ or standing underneath a CCTV camera in Apple Tree Yard, trying to work out if it was real and if their passion/debauchery had been recorded. But after she had inadvertently (drunkenly) let a lascivious, vicious, work colleague see her texting her lover, she paid an even higher, more terrible, price when she was punched in the face and raped in his office. ‘Fear – that’s what makes animals of us all. Before I met you I was civilised. Civilised ! So help me God…’ said her voice-over again, as she stood in the dock. What Dr Carmichael was charged with (and why), or what Apple Tree Yard is trying to say about women, sex, and infidelity with her story and its allusions to genertics and the Suffragettes also remains to be seen.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Will 2017 be the year of the Mac? Anthony Caruana 23 January, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News I’m not one for making predictions. As I’ve said before, trying to guess what Apple will do next is a mug’s game. It rarely follows market trends, preferring to set its own agenda and will release new products when it is good and ready – not when its customers want them. Apple has moved into a reasonably predictable pattern with the release of the iPad and iPhone. Typically, during the first half of the year, a new iPad hits the shelves with updated iPhones coming in the seond half. The iPod touch, iPod nano and iPod shuffle don’t get a lot of attention these days. We may see an update to the iPod touch with a faster processor and some new colours, but I think the days of the iPod are falling away. But the Mac – that’s a different story. The release of the new MacBook Pro in September was not all smooth sailing. The new TouchBar was variously applauded and derided by reviewers and there was great controversy late in the year when Consumer Reports reported some baffling battery life test results (which have since been explained and will be resolved). I suspect the entire Mac product line will be refreshed. The Mac Pro has not seen a single update since its release in 2013. Surely, it will be updated with new processors, better storage and memory options. The MacBook Air is almost a redundant product line in my view. The MacBook fills the needs of those looking for an ultra-thin notebook and the 13in MacBook Pro covers those looking for a more highly specced machine. We’ll get our annual update to macOS later in the year as well. What I’d really like is for Apple to commit to at least annual hardware refreshes for all the Macs. Each year, CPU, memory and storage technology improves. At the moment, Mac users miss all of that and I know it’s sending some Mac users over to the Windows side of the world. So, if anyone at Apple is reading this, how about showing your loyal Mac users the same sort of love you show iPhone and iPad users, who get annual processor and hardware improvements?

China-made smartphonesSamsung’s market share dropped by 14.2 percent in the third quarter of 2016, thecompany’s worst performance to date, which has mainly been attributed to widespreadbattery explosions of Samsung phones over the past year. But there’s no guarantee thebrand will return to the top even if it survives its current crisis. Meanwhile, Samsung’s foreign peer, Apple, has also failed to maintain its earlierperformance. With steadily decreasing sales, China has lost its title as Apple’s secondlargest market. One factor in this decline may be insufficient innovation. Experiencing”iPhone fatigue,” more and more Chinese customers are now moving to domestic brands. Since the first quarter of 2016, shipments of Chinese smartphones for the first timesurpassed the totals of Apple and Samsung. Statistics from global market intelligenceprovider TrendForce showed that production of Chinese smartphones reached 600 millionin 2016, accounting for 45 percent of the global total. In addition to marketing, Chinese brands are also devoting energy to new technologies.For instance, some Chinese phone-makers are already leading in technologies such as 5G,artificial intelligence, virtual reality and 3-D images. With the rise of Chinese brands comes frequent patent litigation between Chineseproducers and their foreign competitors. For this reason, analysts said domestic brandsmust systematically study international patent licensing and build their own patentportfolios as quickly as possible.

January 22 AAPL: 120.00 0.22 Poll: Should the next iPad adopt USB-C connectivity or stick with Lightning? Chance Miller - Jan. 22nd 2017 3:19 pm PT @ChanceHMiller iPad poll View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple is expected to overhaul its iPad lineup in 2017 with new screen sizes and software capabilities, as well as perhaps a new Apple Pencil. One lingering question, however, is what kind of connectivity the new iPads will use. Since Apple put such as focus on the power of USB-C with the 12-inch MacBook and more recently the MacBook Pro, there’s been speculation as to whether or not the iPad (and iPhone) will ever adopt the standard. What do you think? Should the next iPad use Lightning or USB-C connectivity? Take Our Poll Ben Lovejoy previously outlined the possibility of Apple switching to USB-C for its iOS devices, with a third of respondents saying that Apple would make the switch in 2018. For the iPad, however, it makes sense for it to adopt USB-C as Apple continues to market the device as a PC replacement. Switching to USB-C on the iPad would open the device up to a wide-array of accessories, thus making it a more powerful and capable device and strengthen Apple’s argument that it’s a PC replacement. USB-C is also generally more powerful than Lightning. Last year, Apple released a Lightning to USB-C cable targeted at iPad Pro users. When paired with the included 29W power block, 12.9-inch iPad Pro users can take full advantage of that power to charge their device at a much faster rate. In our review, we noted that the USB-C to Lightning cable is what Apple should have included with the iPad Pro in the first place. Specifically for the iPad Pro, a switch to USB-C would keep Apple’s branding and I/O consistent. Bringing USB-C to the iPad Pro would mean that Apple’s two ‘Pro’ products would be fully embracing USB-C and the benefits that go along with it. Switching to USB-C with just the iPad, however, would create some fragmentation between iOS devices. The iPhone would still be using Lightning while the iPad would have USB-C. On the other hand, Apple has repeatedly marketed the iPad as being just as. capable as a PC, so switching to USB-C would make the device the same as the MacBook Pro. Personally, I think the eventual goal should be USB-C across the board for Apple’s devices, but having the iPad adopt it first would ease the transition for iPhone users. What do you think? Should Apple switch to USB-C connectivity with the iPad? Should the iPad only adopt it if the iPhone does as well? Let us know what you think down in the comments.

She was playing a professional, middle-aged, married woman being ravished by a handsome man, who was not her husband, in a broom cupboard. Admittedly, a House of Commons broom cupboard with a history, but a broom cupboard nonetheless. Close encounter: Ben Chaplin and Emily Watson in the new BBC drama Apple Tree Yard  As her character, Yvonne Carmichael, a high-powered geneticist, says to him moments after this somewhat startling event, she has never done anything like this before in her life. Her kaleidoscopic expression registers astonishment that this hidden part of herself has emerged so unexpectedly — perhaps a smidgen of guilt, but mainly joy and possibility. The reason the middle-aged raunch in the four-part thriller is so appealing is because it is real. Emily Watson is an everywoman. She is not Kristin Scott Thomas, but your next-door neighbour. And the flyaway encounters she has are what’s going on — even if older women are keeping quiet about it, not shouting it from the rooftops. The ‘quickies’ in car parks — or broom cupboards — are definitely taking place and not just in the fictional realm of television drama. I know this because I, too, have had exciting, no-strings sex. Not in a broom cupboard, but in an artist’s studio, on the dusty floor among his paint pots. A peacock blue spilt on my tights in the middle of things and I didn’t give a damn.

Share this article Share In fact, my single friends and I are having far more ‘adventures’ now than we ever did in the past. I was 43 when my husband and I separated, and our marriage officially ended three years later. I wouldn’t have chosen divorce but, given that it sadly happened, one of the consolations was being unshackled from the constraints of fidelity and open to new experiences and excitements. I’ve not been ridiculously promiscuous, but have had fun in a way I’d forgotten about; the more so because my liaisons hurt nobody (married men are off-limits) and I have nothing to lose. One friend, also divorced, says she’s had more sex in cars since her decree nisi than she ever did when she was at university and ‘putting it about’ before she met her husband. With marriage and children behind her, she loves the thrill of the illicit and feels she has nothing to lose emotionally. All her ‘emoting’, she explains, happened in her less stable past. Today, she would love to fall in love again, but is happy to enjoy what she calls ‘unfettered arrangements’ until that day arrives. She is relieved by the absence of angst — not complete absence, perhaps, but at least a great reduction of it. If something isn’t working out, it only hurts for a week or two. I think I speak for many women when I say that, in my teens and 20s, my friends and I thought and talked about sex a lot, and did it as much as we could She is wiser and more philosophical than her younger self, when rejection or the ending of things was pain and high drama for a year. That is not to say she no longer feels. She does, but her years have bestowed on her some wonderful perspective. I think I speak for many women when I say that, in my teens and 20s, my friends and I thought and talked about sex a lot, and did it as much as we could. But we didn’t always enjoy it as much as we made out we did. It was often deeply disappointing because, then, it was fraught with anxiety. In my youth, I hid inside long tent dresses and covered my perfect complexion, despite my mother’s protestations, behind thick, orange powder. Today, I run most days, eat healthily on the whole, am 2 st lighter than I’ve ever been and enjoy Charlotte Tilbury’s soft-focus magical make-up. I am inappropriately making up for lost time by wearing mini skirts every day, which, in the past — kayak legs — I never did. I feel 100 times more confident at 52 than I did at 22. The big one for me was feeling fat and less deserving of men’s attention than every other woman on the planet. My worries about my capacious hips, thighs and stomach, often precluded true abandon between the sheets. There was for us, too, always the big worry about getting pregnant. We had the Pill, but mishaps were still common. I know almost no one of my age who didn’t have an abortion in her youth. Miraculously, I dodged the bullet of unwanted pregnancy but, given the risks I took, I was extremely lucky. And sex with a new partner was always — and still is — loaded for the majority of young women: is this the one? Do I want to spend the rest of my life with this person? Have his children? Even if I don’t, should I anyway, in case I don’t find anyone else before it’s too late? These concerns don’t exactly promote the dizziness of abandon in bed. Another friend, in her early 60s, maintains younger men are especially enamoured of her confidence and experience. They tell her older women are more skilled and in control. They know who — and what — they want. Her youthful lovers say their female peers are both neurotic and entitled, which they find off-putting, despite their beautiful legs, flawless complexions and long, flicky hair. But actually, many of us fiftysomethings still look pretty good — far better than our parents’ generation did at our age, aided by modern dentistry, knowledge about diet and exercise, sophisticated beauty products and designer clothes. The perms and heavy tweeds long associated with our age group were never much of an aphrodisiac, and we have willingly sloughed them off in favour of saucier modern fabrics and hairstyles. The menopause, about which we moan and laugh, is no barrier. I have not yet had to face it myself, but only yesterday, I received a text from a hilarious girlfriend, aged 57: ‘There is a good HRT pill that Works Wonders! Am trying to get some on NHS.’ Understandably, sex — or the lack of it — has caused a big divide between us fiftysomething singletons and our married counterparts. While the ones who can are having sex and enjoying it, those who can’t (sexlessly married and faithful) are rueing the day. Several married friends have expressed envy at my ‘freedom’, which, although it came at a huge price and I would rather it hadn’t, does have its hidden charms. Some say that sex with their husbands has become perfunctory or dull, and infrequent. Many of these women — and there are many — whose balding, pot-bellied spouses are no longer able or inclined to perform, speak of the deep loneliness and frustration of having not been made love to for years. One I know says she calls her exercise bike her ‘sex machine’. She and her husband haven’t had sex for a decade, but she misses it massively, and the only way she can achieve a (very approximate) equivalent rush is by cycling furiously until she catches some endorphins. One or two of the wives I know have come to terms with a life without sex, as they don’t wish to leave their marriages and feel they have little choice but to accept the celibate life, but most are raging with unfulfilled desires. In their minds, at least, their sexuality is by no means spent. If the success of E. L. James’s Fifty Shades book series is not testament to this, I don’t know what is. I must be one of the few women who has never read one, and has no intention of doing so, but it is women of a certain age who put them on the bestseller lists. While no one can claim they are literary classics, something between those covers lit a fuse. It is no coincidence that, though the protagonist is young, these S&M fantasies were written by a woman in her 40s and consumed by many readers of her generation and above. The author unleashed a truth: sex is not over for women over 50. Quite the opposite. Recently, I was at a gathering and a man of my age or a couple of years younger, handsome and sparky in conversation, but, I suspect, studiedly unattached, flirted with me in a way that was more thrilling than the effects of any champagne. There was a sophistication and promise about our exchange that I relished. At the end of the evening, we exchanged numbers. I was still sober but, driving home, I played very loud music in my car and worried that, if stopped by police and breathalysed, I’d register as over the limit, such was my teenage-style high. I almost didn’t care if nothing came of it. Who knows what might? It is early days. He or I may contact each other; we may not. The joy was a lot to do with the fact that the opportunity had arisen — indeed, still existed for someone whose prime was 20 years ago. That the potential for broom-cupboard sex was — is — still manifestly real, even for a perimenopausal woman in her 50s.   The Wife - Sarah Vine First, let me make one thing clear: I am not one of those disapproving old mother superior types with a moustache and four-inch bra straps who thinks that sex leads to corruption of body and soul. I am neither too old nor too prudish to have forgotten the thrill of the sexual chase, nor so deprived of it that it has become a distant memory. I may have been married for 15 years, but time has not dimmed the intimacy of my relationship. In fact, our shared experiences have brought us closer in that respect. Broadcaster Mariella Frostrup wants us to read more erotica; Stephen Vizinczey, the author of In Praise Of Older Women, is having a cultural renaissance (Stock image) But the very fact I need to insert that lengthy caveat speaks volumes about the way married women of my age — approaching 50 — are expected to behave in respect of sex. That is to say, it’s not enough to say nothing. In today’s oversharing world, drawing a veil over one’s sexuality is seen as a betrayal of one’s sex. Not only must our bodies remain gym-honed temples to pleasure, but we must keep sex on the brain, too. Broadcaster Mariella Frostrup wants us to read more erotica; Stephen Vizinczey, the author of In Praise Of Older Women (first published in the Sixties), is having a cultural renaissance. Even dear old Auntie is at it, if last night’s steamy new BBC adaptation is anything to go by. But while it’s certainly true that the show sees Emily Watson’s character, a married academic, in an unexpected clinch with a stranger in a House of Commons broom cupboard, the drama itself and the story that unfolds is far more nuanced than the hype would have had us believe. And that, really, goes to the heart of what sex and the married fiftysomething woman is all about. Liberation, empowerment, self-expression: that’s just the gloss. The truth is less straightforward. And, unless we acknowledge that and delve into the biology and psychology of women my age, the danger is that sex becomes as much a tyranny as a pleasure. Three-quarters of married women lose interest in sex after reaching 50. Fact. So this idea that, as Frostrup puts it, ‘many mature women are having the best sex they’ve ever had’ just doesn’t ring true. And because women are self-hypercritical, who do we blame but ourselves? Just as young women agonise about not being thin enough, older women worry about not being sufficiently interested in sex. They see this decline as a reflection of their inadequacies as women, rather than what it is — a combination of biological factors (age and falling sex hormones) and environmental pressure — i.e. having to do bloody everything for everyone. Somehow, it seems, there is always something more urgent on the to-do list. At the end of most days, I feel too exhausted to contemplate anything more than a cup of herbal tea in the bedroom. Sex is important — but it isn’t everything. And, sometimes, it can be nothing at all When, in my column last week, I briefly admitted that, even if I did have a spare hour, I’d rather spend it having a ‘power nap’ than playing the vixen, I was inundated with emails from readers saying: ‘Thank God, I thought I was the only one.’ As several of them pointed out, this was no reflection on their partners. It was just part of what being fiftysomething can feel like for women. The idea that we are replacing our Marks & Spencer full-coverage undies with some overpriced dental floss from Agent Provocateur in anticipation of a thrilling tryst is, to put it mildly, absurd. Fifty is a difficult age for a woman — far more so than for a man. The menopause, which, even now, is rarely spoken of, is, for most of us, a catastrophic physical and mental event. That wonderful, life-giving cocktail of hormones that circulates in the female body (and that we take so much for granted) simply runs dry, with serious repercussions. Not only do we feel tired, irritable, even depressed, we cease to exude those all-important signifiers of youth and fertility. As our biochemistry fades, so do we. Where once we might have turned heads, people look straight through us. Women speak of feeling invisible — an experience brilliantly illustrated in Apple Tree Yard, as Watson’s character tries, without much success, to catch the attention of a young man who is supposed to be serving her in a cafe. Indeed, part of the reason she sleeps with the handsome civil servant who accosts her is that he does her the simple favour of noticing her. Psychologically, it’s a big part of why she does something so very out of the ordinary. For most wives, however, there are no broom-cupboard trysts, simply a growing sense of inadequacy. Unless you experience it, it is hard to explain the feeling of total indifference towards sex that declining levels of oestrogen, progesterone and, crucially, testosterone can bring about. This idea of a mature female sexuality, free from the responsibilities of childbirth, but furnished with confidence and experience, is a fundamentally subversive concept that thrills and alarms in equal measure. Which is why, as much as it may make great TV, it’s not for every woman. Those happy in their marriage may not want to blow up a life together for the sake of a few stray pheromones. Women of my age are strung with responsibilities, from teenage children to work commitments to looking after a house. We are often the centre of so many people’s universes — our children’s, our spouse’s, increasingly, our parents’. We can’t afford to veer off course. Yet we are told we’re missing out if we don’t swing from the chandeliers once a week. Ultimately, sexuality should be down to the individual. If you want to rage against the menopause like Samantha in Sex And The City, that’s your prerogative. Equally, if you want to settle into your dotage with a nice book and a packet of Rich Tea, the world should not make you feel like a sad inadequate. Sex is important — but it isn’t everything. And, sometimes, it can be nothing at all.

Benchmark Awards Reports Blogs Topics CXO Challenge Whitepapers What's On Apple accuses chipmaker of extortion in $1.3bn lawsuit By Staff Writer on Jan 23, 2017 6:57AM Goes head-to-head with Qualcomm in US court. Apple has filed a US$1 billion (A$1.3 billion) lawsuit against supplier Qualcomm, just days after the US government accused the chipmaker of resorting to anti-competitive tactics to maintain a monopoly over key semiconductors in mobile phones. Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung for chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm's US$23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. In the lawsuit, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some US$1 billion in promised rebates. Apple said Qualcomm withheld the rebates because of Apple's discussions with South Korea's antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission. "If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm's release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused," Apple said in its lawsuit. In a statement, Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg called Apple's claims "baseless". "Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information," Rosenberg said in the statement. "We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits.” Qualcomm's stock closed 2.4 percent lower at US$62.88 on the news. Qualcomm has patents for chips which include standard essential patents, a term used to describe technology that is required to be licensed broadly and on "reasonable" terms. In its lawsuit, Apple accused Qualcomm of refusing to license the technology to other manufacturers to prevent them from making the chips. It also accused Qualcomm of selling chips while requiring Apple to pay a separate licensing fee for the same chips, in a "no license, no chip" policy. In addition, Qualcomm pressured network carriers to not sell or support Apple devices made with Intel chipsets Apple said. The KFTC fined Qualcomm US$854 million in December for what it called unfair patent licensing practices. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a US$975 million fine in China, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. Last week, the US Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, saying the company used its dominant position as a supplier of certain phone chips to impose "onerous" supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers. Qualcomm said it would contest the FTC complaint. Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modem chips for Apple’s phones until the release of the iPhone 7 in September. Intel supplied about half of the modem chips for the newest models, said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Intel's shares closed up 1 percent at US$36.94 after the Qualcomm suit was announced. Apple made the move around the same time that Samsung, which had switched to using its own internal chips for its Galaxy S6 phones, returned to Qualcomm for the Galaxy S7. Qualcomm "has been able to manage through [the Apple contract loss] pretty well because they got back Samsung at the same time," Rasgon said. Apple is known for seeking multiple suppliers to keep prices down, said Jim Morrison, vice president of technical intelligence for TechInsights, which tears down devices to analyse their parts. © 2016 Thomson Reuters.

Sherlock viewers are convinced that the show has come to an end Yep, it turns out the Sherlock fandom actually thought that Apple Tree Yard was potentially a surprise fourth episode of Sherlock’s fourth season which concluded last Sunday, and when it became obvious that it was actually an adaptation of a popular book about a middle-aged woman having an affair, well, let’s just say the BBC ended up with some very angry tweets sent their way. ‘Imagine: apple tree yard stops in the middle of the episode, the screen turns black, the Sherlock theme starts playing and episode 4 begins,’ tweeted one fan who remained hopeful ten minutes in the show.

After a panel in which he discussed the representation of the LGBT community in sci-fi TV some fans thought that meant he was hinting that Sherlock and Watson were endgame, but Steven said that he felt that fans were then ‘trivialising it beyond endurance’.

There were 13 Annapolisa Leadership Competition candidates last year. (Light & Lens Photography) Related Stories Queen Annapolisa can now get pregnant — but she can't already have kids Kings County councillor calls for more inclusivity at Apple Blossom Festival A former Kings County councillor who pushed for greater inclusivity from the Apple Blossom Festival is applauding recent changes to who can vie for the crown, but she says more can be done. For decades, a strict set of rules governed the requirements of candidates who aimed to be crowned Queen Annapolisa. The requirements included not having any children, not being married and not co-habitating with anyone. Men weren't able to vie for the crown, either. But those requirements have all been abolished. "I think the decisions made by the board should be celebrated and they should be congratulated for making changes that I know were very difficult," said Emma Van Rooyen, who served on Kings County council between 2012-2015.  Alxys Chamberlain, the festival vice's president, said the changes have been in development for several years. No change to education requirement "Some people are calling them progressive, but we like to think of them as changes that were necessary given in what the shift became," she said. Chamberlain said the festival has moved from a pageant to becoming a leadership competition. Candidates are evaluated on a host of criteria, including their public speaking abilities, personality, intelligence and poise. Should all the prospective candidates be female, the winner will be called Queen Annapolisa, said Chamberlain. If all of the candidates are men, King Annapolisa will be the name, but if there are candidates from both genders, the winner will simply be known as Annapolisa. Two of the main requirements remaining in place are that candidates must be between 18 and 23 by the end of the current festival year, and must possess a high school or equivalent diploma. Alxys Chamberlain said the high school education or equivalency requirement is largely in place because the festival doesn't want prospective candidates to take time away from their studies. (Submitted by Alxys Chamberlain) Van Rooyen would like to see this requirement eliminated. "I do think that there are people in our community who have not completed high school ... [who] are leaders," she said. Chamberlain said the main reason for this requirement is because being involved with the festival takes a lot of time, so prospective candidates shouldn't have to take a break from their studies to participate. This year's festival will be held from May 24 to May 29. As well, Chamberlain said having the minimum education requirement helps level the playing field for competitors. Regal concern "Part of the things you're judged on are submitting a resume, giving a speech, things like that, which are actually components of what you would be doing in high school and ... coming out of high school," she said. One other change Van Rooyen would like to see implemented is changing the title of what the winner is crowned. She'd like to see titles in place that don't have regal connotations because they may have negative meanings for Indigenous people and those oppressed by colonialism. Chamberlain, a former Queen Annapolisa herself in 2015, said there hasn't been any talk of making any other changes to the requirements.

It's howlingly good! CHRISTOPHER STEVENS reviews Apple Tree Yard  By Christopher Stevens for the Daily Mail Published: 17:00 EST, 22 January 2017 | Updated: 20:33 EST, 22 January 2017 e-mail 20 shares 199 View comments Apple Tree Yard  Rating: Never has a TV drama raised so many awkward, sweaty questions… such as, 'Is my wife unfaithful?', 'Has my husband guessed?' and 'Is that George Osborne having a knee-trembler in a Commons broom cupboard?' The black-haired, smooth-voiced devil in the blue tie was not the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, of course. Perish the thought. Ben Chaplin, as the suave civil servant whose penchant for sex in public places fuelled a very saucy start for Apple Tree Yard (BBC 1), simply happens to look and sound rather like the man who scurried out of 11 Downing Street last summer. Never has a TV drama raised so many awkward, sweaty questions… such as, 'Is my wife unfaithful?', writes Christopher Stevens And like Osborne's infamous Project Fear, this psychological thriller is set to get the whole country in a lather over the next few weeks. You've had Brexit – now get ready for Sexit. Emily Watson plays Yvonne, the 50-year-old mother of grown-up children who has a glamorous career as a genetics expert but a cripplingly dull marriage. Her hubbie Gary (Mark Bonnar) could bore, and snore, for Britain. His idea of passion is a peck on the cheek. So Yvonne is ripe for passion, a fact that is tantalisingly obvious to Chaplin's parliamentary predator. After she gives evidence to a Commons select committee, he moves in so fast that we never learn his name: 'Hello my dear, follow me, close that door, grrr-owll,' and the deed is done. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Ooh la la! Millie Mackintosh sets pulses racing as she... Why Alexia is ready to start jammin' with Bob: Actress... Share this article Share 'Sex with you is like being eaten by a wolf,' she gasps. But she's keen to be devoured again, and he can't resist coming back for more. Their first encounter was meant to be 'Wham-Bam-Thank-You-Madam-Speaker' and nothing more. But it soon becomes an all-consuming affair. Watson and Chaplin generate an electric energy. It's easy to believe they want to tear each other's clothes off – especially Yvonne, who has apparently been starved of sex for years. The story builds tension from the start: we see Yvonne in the back of a police van, handcuffed and on her way to trial, before the narrative backtracks to the start of her fling. Emily Watson plays Yvonne (pictured), the 50-year-old mother of grown-up children  By the end of the episode, her life is already in freefall. She's having sex in doorways with the Wolf of Westminster. Her marriage is at breaking point, after her husband lied about his relationship with his much younger research assistant. And then, at an office party, her creepy colleague discovers her affair, corners her, and rapes her. This is gritty stuff. And it came directly after Call The Midwife, in which a pregnant young mother was beaten and burnt with a cigarette on her breasts by her husband. But it isn't the pell-mell plot that will have the whole country talking about this howlingly good drama. It's the moral questions – can you forgive Yvonne for her behaviour? And would you ever be tempted, in her situation, to do the same? The same dilemmas underpinned TV's last great adultery drama, Doctor Foster, which saw Suranne Jones's character resort to any means, legal or not, to exact revenge on her cheating husband. But Apple Tree Yard goes further still. Yvonne doesn't want to punish Gary, even if he is dishonest and dull. She is overcome by lusts she never imagined she could feel. And she discovers she loves it. By the end of the episode, her life is already in freefall. She's having sex in doorways with the Wolf of Westminster The subterfuge, the illicit meetings, the adrenaline, it all turns her on. 'Sex may be an animal pleasure,' she decides, 'but adultery, I am discovering, is a human one.' In other words, betraying her husband might be difficult at first, but it soon becomes addictive. It helps that her lover is so adept at it. He knows just which smartphone to use for secret texts, and how to avoid the peeping eyes of CCTV cameras. In fact, he might not even be a conventional civil servant, but a spy. All this is so plausible that it ought to come with a government warning: 'Don't try this at home.' But of course, you wouldn't dream of it... would you?   Share or comment on this article e-mail 20 shares Most watched News videos How to make a stick drawing magically come to life with water Social experiment to test reaction to Trump supporter in New York City Angry motorists push car after being blocked in on private drive Dog is cut free after being chained up for FIFTEEN years Bear the dog visits the beach for first time after rescue Piers Morgan goes on rant about Ewan McGregor cancelling interview Woman booted off plane after ranting at Trump supporter CCTV captures moment British man is shot dead in car in Pattaya Man tells Polish woman to 'go back to her country' in rant ISIS video 'shows drone dropping bombs on targets near Mosul' Gov.

In particular, the FTC said Qualcomm strong-armed Apple into using its modem chips in iPhones by lowering its patent-licensing fees. But if Apple purchased modem chips from another chip supplier, the FTC said Apple would face large penalties by losing out on Qualcomm’s rebate payments. Jacobson contended the FTC “rushed” its lawsuit filing ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s Inauguration on Friday. “That’s certainly what did happen, and we really weren’t given the chance to have the same kind of back-and-forth that we would have expected to have,” the Qualcomm executive said, adding the lawsuit had no legal backing or economic justification. Qualcomm, for its part, has said it plans on fighting the FTC suit. — JP Mangalindan is a senior correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business.

Up until now however, mobile apps occupied a corner that has largely been under the radar of the “Great Firewall.” Alphabet Inc’s Google Play Store isn’t available in China and Apple Inc.’s App Store has a severely limited selection of apps in China. Outside of a few major domestic players, Chinese mobile app stores haven’t been heavily regulated. Last week, new regulations were passed aimed at reining in the hundreds of unregulated mobile app stores in China. The exact number of app stores are unknown, but marketing firm AppInChina estimates that over 200 exist currently. Most of these stores have little to no established process to vet apps before their release. The announcement was released by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC). Since Jan. 16, mobile app stores must register with the CAC to continue to operate legally. Such registration will make it visible to authorities who owns the app store and how many apps are present, allowing regulators to shut down stores as necessary. Fragmented Market Despite Beijing’s stance on regulating mobile app stores, the environment and fragmentation of the market makes it almost impossible to enforce the new measures. The biggest smartphone platform in China—a country with more than 700 million smartphone users—is Google Android. But Google Play, the default app platform of the operating system, is disabled in China. This gave rise to a proliferation of third-party app stores, the biggest ones are those run by the nation’s large technology companies such as Tencent, Baidu, Xiaomi, and Alibaba. App stores run by these large companies are self-regulated. Content that would be strictly blocked on a Chinese website sometimes could be found inside mobile apps. But hundreds of other smaller third-party app stores have also sprouted, many with low security and vetting standards. Content that would be strictly blocked on a Chinese website can sometimes now be found inside mobile apps downloaded from these platforms. Like many Chinese regulations, the guidelines are vague and open-ended. “It’s almost impossible for the regulators to register and supervise all the millions of apps there one by one,” Zhu Wei of the China University of Political Science and Law told the Wall Street Journal. Hard to Enforce Judging by the CAC’s language, the enforcement, monitoring, and censorship of content within these apps seems to fall on those operating the mobile app stores. The model CAC has adopted is to police the app stores, with the hope that the app stores will police the apps within. But that’s a strategy that has proven faulty. Earlier this month, the New York Times app was taken down by Apple after Chinese government censors demanded Apple remove it. Apple told the Times that its app violated local laws, without elaborating on which laws it violated. This is hardly a surprise, until one realizes that the New York Times’ website has been blocked by China since 2012. This means that while Chinese censors intended to fully block access to New York Times’ content since 2012, Chinese residents were still able to access New York Times content through its mobile app for the last five years. And this example involves Apple and New York Times, two of the most visible targets of Chinese censors. There are millions of Chinese mobile apps across hundreds of app platforms, most of which are small, private, and lack the resources to self-censor all of the apps and their content.  How long will it take to cull all of them?

It also supports a 3.5 mm auxiliary input which is at the back of the unit.  The SoundLink Air Digital Music System from Bose also incorporates digital signal processing, neodymium transducers and acoustic waveguide speaker technology delivering a unique experience to the user.  Airplay, Apple’s unique technology in which Airplay-enabled devices can stream music or audio wirelessly from iOS devices, is effectively used in SoundLink Air Music System avoiding the need for ‘docking’ the iOS device.  Users would require a Wi-Fi router to use this system. Setting up AirPlay is simple for experienced users. For those who are unfamiliar, Bose provides a USB cable which allows the user to connect the system to the computer allowing them to get the instructions online from bose.com/wifi set up for setting up their SoundLink Air Digital Music System.  The music system, which comes in a glossy black finish having a metal grille has an infrared remote as well as a rechargeable battery which is optional allowing you an unplugged experience anywhere.  The SoundLink Air Digital Music System is available from Bose stores across India and online at a price of Rs. 22,388.

We can expect iPhone 8 to be in line this year. Earlier rumors revealed that Apple is testing with ten different prototypes for the iPhone 8. Following this, we have received the latest update from the leaks of the tech giant’s Asian supply chain. iPhone 8 To Come With Edge-to-Edge OLED We are already aware that Apple will be releasing three new flagships this year. Earlier leaks revealed that we would be getting a 5.8 inch edge-to-edge OLED display variant. Also, it appears that the Cupertino Tech Giant will use OLEDs even in the 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch iPhone models planned for the year. However, the sources also said that since the OLED supplier production is tight for now, we cannot expect all the variants to carry an OLED display. ADVERTISEMENT Earlier iPhone 8 Rumors We can also expect Apple to ship the new iPhones with glass bodies mounted on stainless steel frames. Apple is getting back to glass bodies as it facilitates wireless charging features. According to the rumors, we can witness maximum utilization of the front side for the display this time. This is because Apple is planning to integrate the front-facing camera as well as the Virtual Home/Touch ID button into the display. We have been hearing about these exceptional features coming to the new iPhones for the last few months. However, the latest rumor by Timothy Arcuri, an analyst at Cowen and Company will be the most exciting update of the year. Apple Will Ship Facial And Gesture Recognition In iPhone 8 We will be getting integrated facial and gesture recognition features in the OLED display of iPhone 8. According to what Arcuri calls the iPhone X, we will also have a laser and infrared sensors placed near the front camera for this purpose. However, take this piece of excitement with a grain of salt. It is notable that the analysts have mostly been right about the earlier iPhone models. So if we are indeed going to get the facial and gesture recognition feature, we can unlock our iPhone besides the Touch ID and Pin. We already have the facial recognition for the Photos app. Looks like Apple is putting its acquisition of PrimeSense to the best use. Also, we will be able to have better control of the IoT and augmented reality apps. Wraparound Display With On-Screen Touch ID Based on Arcuri’s leaks Apple may also bring us optical-based fingerprint Touch ID by partnering with Synaptic. Apple has also gotten a patent for a capacitive fingerprint sensor. However, we do not know which one Apple will be using for the upcoming iPhone 8. Another rumor from Arcuri says that we will have a dual-edge “wraparound” 5.8-inch display in the iPhone 8. There will be a fixed edge screen and we will have only a 5.1-5.2 inch of active area in the 5.8 inch OLED display. We will be able to see which of the above rumors will come to light and which won’t only after the release of the iPhone 8 slated for September 2017.

Taiwan's Foxconn chief confirms mulling $7bn US investment Money Sunday 22 January 2017 - 4:51pm Logos of Foxconn and Ennoconn are seen during the annual Computex computer exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan on June 1, 2016. Photo: REUTERS/Tyrone Siu/File Photo TAIPEI – The head of Taiwan's tech giant Foxconn confirmed on Sunday he is considering a $7-billion (R95bn) investment to make flat panels in the United States in a joint project with Japan's SoftBank. US President Donald Trump had announced before taking office a $50bn deal with SoftBank which he said would generate 50,000 jobs. Trump was speaking last month alongside SoftBank's chief executive Masayoshi Son, who displayed a document which indicated Softbank and Foxconn would "commit to invest $50bn + $7bn in US, generate 50k + 50k new jobs in US in next four years". Foxconn, a major supplier to Apple, had earlier said it was in "preliminary discussions" with US officials about a potential investment but gave no details. READ: Foxconn invests $8bn in China LCD plant "I have discussed with my major clients about going to (the US) and they are also willing to invest, including Apple," Terry Gou told reporters in Taipei after the company's year-end party. The firm is the world's largest contract electronics maker and is best-known for assembling products for international brands such as Apple and Sony. "Pennsylvania is active and I urge other states to act more quickly or I will sign the contract with Pennsylvania," he said, adding that the investment could create 30,000 to 50,000 jobs. Foxconn is still waiting to see the tax policies of the new US government and what incentives state authorities can offer, such as cheap land and electricity, Gou added. Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai, employs around a million workers at its factories across China and has operations in more than 10 countries. Last year it took over the struggling Japanese electronics maker Sharp after acquiring a 66 percent stake for $3,7bn in a move Gou described as "really worth it". In the US, it has a plant in Virginia for packaging and engineering which employes over 400 people. It has also announced a $40-million investment in a facility in Pennsylvania to build precision tools and develop a robotics programme. Gou said Foxconn aims to increase investment in China this year to try to boost Sharp's market share in the country, but denied reports that he had been pressured by China over his planned US investment. Almost immediately after he won the November election, Trump angered China by accepting a congratulatory call from Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen.

He was 87 years old. He was preceded in death by his wife of 60 years, Joan Christine Delfino, and is survived by his seven children, Michael, Joanie, Annette (Annie), Christopher, Marguerite (Margot), Mary and Edio Jr.; his brother-in-law, John Stich; his sister-in-law, Claire Delfino; 16 grandchildren; and 10 great-grandchildren. Edio was born on Jan. 3, 1930, in St. Helena, Calif. He was the third of four children born to Italian immigrants Frank and Dina Delfino. As a child and young adult he worked with his family on their small vineyard just outside of the town of St. Helena in the Napa Valley. His father worked as a night watchman for the mothball fleet in Vallejo, Calif., and farmed during the day with the help of his sons. He attended St. Helena Elementary School and St. Helena High School. He was a social young man and made many lifelong friends during his youth in the Napa Valley. While he enjoyed all sports, he was limited to playing football during high school due to his responsibilities on the family vineyard. He often told of his friend and working partner, Nick the mule. He and Nick plowed the vineyard all through his school years. He often lamented that Nick passed away when he was a senior in high school, so his younger brother was the first to use a tractor to work the vineyard. After graduating from high school, Edio went to college at California Polytechnic University. For his first three years he attended at the San Dimas Campus. As a senior he transferred to the San Luis Obispo campus. While in college he worked as a campus garbage collector to help make ends meet until he graduated in 1950 with a degree in biological science. During his college years he also spent weekends and vacations with his roommate, Jack Stich, and his family. On these visits he got to know and eventually fell in love with Jack’s sister, Joan. Edio joined the U.S. Air Force upon graduation from college. He and Joan Stich married on May 2, 1953, at Chanute Airforce Base in Rantoul, Ill. Edio completed his tour of active duty later that year, but remained in the Air Force Reserve until 1979, earning the rank of Lt. Col. After his tour of active duty he got a job with the Sonoma County Department of Agriculture and moved with his wife to Santa Rosa, Calif. While living in Santa Rosa the first four of their children were born. In 1960 Edio was appointed County Agriculture Commissioner for El Dorado County and the Delfinos moved to the Sierra Nevada Foothills. At 33 years old, he was the youngest person to attain this appointment. Originally the family lived in Placerville, Calif., moving to the Camino, Calif., area and building a house there in 1962. Their remaining three children were born in the 1960s. Edio came to El Dorado County when it was embroiled in an agricultural disaster. The choice Bartlett pears that were widely grown here at the time were being killed by a terrible bacterial disease known as pear decline. In short, farmers were in danger of losing their livelihoods. Apples were a secondary crop that was successful in the area, so they became the crop to replace the formerly dominant pears. Edio, along with then County Farm Advisor Dick Bethell, and area farmers Gene Bolster and Bob Tuck, put their heads together and after much trial and error decided that ranch marketing was the solution to the county’s agricultural dilemma. Thus Apple Hill was born. The first officially advertised Apple Hill event was “Apple Smorgy Days” and was held at El Dorado Orchards. The apple farmers’ wives produced apple baked goods which were sold to the public on overturned apple bins. The event was a huge success, drawing nearly 5,000 people. This event led to individual farms starting their own bake shops and the rest is history. In 1972 Edio and Joan Delfino opened their own pie shop and apple business with Joan as the chief baker. Their seven children worked alongside them on their well known apple ranch, “Kids Inc.” The common sense, determination and work ethic of Edio along with Bolster, Bethell and Tuck led to the incredible success story known as Apple Hill. Apple Hill has grown from its original 16 ranches to 55 ranches and now includes Christmas tree growers, wineries, vineyards and a spa. Edio served as El Dorado County’s Agriculture Commissioner for 33 years. During that time he also served as County Sealer of Weights and Measures and head of the Animal Control Department. In addition, he was in the Air Force Reserve for 26 years achieving the rank of Lieutenant Colonel and was recalled to active duty during the Cuban Missile Crisis. However, primarily he would describe himself as a farmer and an advocate of agriculture and the rural lifestyle. Both Edio and Joan were 4-H leaders, encouraging their seven children to learn the value of raising their own food and taking care of the land. Edio was a larger than life individual. He wasn’t large in stature, but everyone knew when he walked into a room. He had a booming voice, a commanding presence and a will to make things happen. And when he was involved, they did. He was a visionary who helped save El Dorado County’s agricultural heritage. He has earned his rest. Picture him on a tractor riding into the sunset through his prized vineyard. At heart he was a simple farmer and happiest when doing just that. A funeral mass will be held Friday, Jan. 27, 2017, at 11 a.m., vigil at 10:30 a.m., at St. Patrick Church, 3109 Sacramento Street in Placerville, followed by interment at St. Patrick Cemetery in Placerville. In lieu of flowers, the family request donations be made to Snowline Hospice or the Mother Theresa Maternity Home, P.O. Box 991, Placerville, CA 95667. Online condolences may be posted at chapelofthepinesfunerals.com.

Image: Dustin drankoski/mashable By Brett Williams2017-01-22 15:26:49 UTC When the iPhone 7 killed off the headphone jack, some Apple fans were up in arms. If the rumors about the features of 2017's iPhone X (or whatever Apple winds up calling it) are true, the flagship phone will be losing another long-standard feature: the home button.  Don't be too sad about its passing, though — everyone will likely be too excited about what's replacing it to even notice that it's gone.  SEE ALSO: Apple files $1 billion lawsuit against major iPhone partner MacRumors reports that KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has been a reliable source for iPhone leaks in the past, released a research report today hinting at Apple's plans to remove the device's physical home button in favor of a thumbprint sensor embedded in the screen — the first step toward a new biometric sensor system.  It's not a new rumor — the home button would need to go for the bezel-free, edge-to-edge screen design that has been discussed so much — but today's information gives some more insight into the tech Apple may be developing to replace its current Touch ID system and improve its touchscreen design as it shifts to an OLED display. According to Kuo, Apple's current "under glass" capacitive fingerprint recognition tech won't cut it if the phone has the full-screen, button-free design. Instead, the ID reader will need to shift to an "under panel" setup, which would require optical ID tech. That might get tricky, because the optical sensors will need to be compatible with flexible OLED panels. That means new, custom solutions from the panel makers to make that system work — but Kuo believes Apple has the clout to get the system it needs.   Along with the new optical sensor, Kuo seems to expect that the rumored facial tracking sensors will be included in the device, which could be used to scan users' faces as a means to verify identification. Kuo guesses the fingerprint ID tech will "ultimately be replaced by a facial recognition system" in an effort to make the iPhone's security even more stable. "However, if the technical challenges cannot be overcome, we believe a combination of fingerprint and facial recognition is another possible solution," he writes in the report. Once the tech is developed in future models, he predicts that transactions made on future iPhones will be verified using "a combination of the two steps of bio-recognition." In addition to the home button overhaul, the next iPhone's 3D Touch tech might be getting a makeover. Kuo claims Apple may switch to a new, more sensitive film sensor for its touchscreen from the current FPCB sensor in the iPhone 7. This is another area where Apple will have to work around the new OLED display, so Kuo predicts a metal structural part will be implemented under the film sensor for more support. If this year's iPhone actually arrives with a new display, new sensors and a stronger backbone, the home button's loss will be taken in stride. Just don't mention the headphone jack.

Qualcomm has now issued a press release refuting some of the claims that Apple has made. It says that the Cupertino company has “intentionally mischaracterized” the agreements and negotiations between them. Qualcomm executive VP and general counsel Don Rosenberg said in the press release that while the company is still in the process of reviewing the complaint in detail, “it is quite clear that Apple’s claims are baseless,” adding that “Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing program.” The Qualcomm executive also claimed that Apple has been “actively encouraging” investigations by bodies like the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the Korean Fair Trade Commission “by misrepresenting facts and withholding information.” Rosenberg added that Qualcomm welcomes the opportunity of having these “meritless claims” heard in court where the company will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits.

The tablet niche has been something of a challenge for Apple over the last few years, with the demand for this compact form of computer receding somewhat. Nonetheless, Apple remains the market leader by some distance, with the iPad undoubtedly being an iconic example of consumer electronics technology. Thus, the Californian company is sure to have something exciting in store for its iPad range this year. Image Credit: Apple Inc. iPad Pro 2 When the iPad Pro launched in September 2015, it was the biggest tablet computer that Apple had ever produced. It was extremely enthusiastically received at the time, meaning that Apple was always likely to release several sequels. And we shouldn’t have too long to wait for the iPad Pro 2, as rumors indicate that a March launch for this tablet is possible. This would coincide neatly with software releases from Apple, but there have also been suggestions that the chip manufacturer for the device, TSMC, has experienced lower than expected yields. This could lead to the release slipping into the summer months. Apple has kept rather quiet regarding the pricing of the iPad Pro 2, but we can expect a similar pricing structure to the original iPad Pro. This means that the base model will cost $599, with the 12.9-inch version costing $799. Apple is expected to eliminate the headphone jack from the iPad Pro 2, thus following moves it has already made in the iPhone range. Leaked photographs have already indicated that this is the case, with an apparent image of the iPad Pro 2 from the Chinese supply line appearing online. Elsewhere, Apple is likely to produce a True Tone display for the tablet. True Tone allows a tablet to alter the screen’s color temperature depending on the degree of lighting in a particular location. The smart money is also on a fingerprint scanner being built into the screen. Three different model sizes will be available for iPad consumers, with a new 10.5-inch version strongly rumored. Bigger batteries and improved camera functionality are also likely. iPad Air 3 The iPad Air 3 is anticipated despite rumors that Apple could have killed off the iPad range. The consumer electronics giant has declined to suggest that any of the Pro models are effectively the equivalent to the iPad Air, and this should mean that a new tablet in the $400 price range is released this year. There has been no hurry to release this device due to the slowing of the tablet market, but the iPad Air 3 will ultimately fit into Apple’s needs rather well. It is unlikely that we will see major design changes when the iPad Air 3 is released; Apple is always keen to slim down its hardware releases. Thus, we can expect the iPad Air 3 to be under 6mm in depth, being the slimmest tablet ever released by the corporation. Gold, Silver and Space Grey color options can be anticipated, with the likely introduction of a Rose Gold model to accompany them. Apple Pencil support, an A9X chip, and a four-speaker audio system are among the specs that have been linked with this tablet computer, while the retention of a 9.7-inch display with 2,048 x 1,536 resolution is likely. The apple pPncil stylus has proved particularly popular with Apple fans since its introduction. It is possible that Apple could also tweak the camera in the iPad Air 3, but the corporation must be wary of the importance of distinguishing between this tablet and the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, if indeed two separate models are to be released. This will probably be a slightly lower spec machine than the iPad Pro series, intended to attract the more casual tablet computer user. iPad Mini 5 Alongside the iPad Air and iPad Pro models will be the release of the iPad Mini 5; a very popular and esteemed product range for Apple. There have been rumors that this device could be updated alongside the iPad Pro, which would suggest a March release date. Already reports in China have indicated that updated iPad models will be announced in March alongside the second generation Apple Pencil, which has apparently been leaked from the Asian supply chain. Indeed, there were expectations that the iPad Mini 5 would be announced at Apple events last year, but these passed with no sign of the next generation 7.9-inch tablet computer. But when it does arrive, the pricing is likely to be frozen once more from the last generation model, owing to pressures in the tablet computing market. Again, a slimmer design can be anticipated with the iPad Mini 5, with some reports suggesting that it will be as dainty as just 5mm in depth. Additionally, Apple could embrace the 7000-series aluminum utilized in the Apple Watch range for this tablet computer, in order to make it a particularly durable and lightweight release, and to prevent bending. Some of the more interesting suggestions for this smaller tablets are the introduction of a flexible display, and the Smart Connector being migrated from the iPad Pro. The former technology would enable users to fold up the screen of the iPad and place it in their pocket or bag when not being used. Whether this is really practical for the iPad Mini 5 is debatable, but the patents for this feature are certainly well established. Apple is also expected to increase the battery in the iPad Mini 5, ensuring that this is a convenient tablet to utilize for relatively long periods of time. The Cupertino-based company will also probably scrap the 16GB version of the iPad Mini, instead releasing the Mini 5 in 32GB, 64GB and 128GB versions. Fans of the iPhone range would love to see 3D Touch migrate to the iPad Mini, and this is another possible new function that Apple may toy with.

Rock My Run Are you perhaps interested in fitness? Does your week consist of regular workouts? If so, Rock My Run has been specifically designed for you. This app is manufactured for those who love to listen to music during workouts. Some of the best features about this app is that you can create some unique playlists. For example, you can make playlists which are moulded around a certain tempo or mood. If you wanted to create a fast playlist for running, for example, or an inspiring playlist for hill climbing, Rock My Run is the app for you. All in all, this app will certainly motivate you in the gym or in the great outdoors. ROckmyrun is an amazing free music app for fitness training app. You can hear your favourite music while running, jogging or exercising. You can hear some popular DJ’s with perfect beats for training. It will increase your confidence and enthusiasm and will motivate you to keep going. You just need to choose your favourite genre and then it will stream body driven music. I would really prefer his app as I am personally a sportsperson. ROCK MY RUN Has been rated 4.3 stars which is amazing. Got 1 million+ downloads. Size is quite big. Finally, it’s size is 32 MB. It seems like it requires android version 4.0 or up. Furthermore, it even consumes fewer data. In conclusion, it is one of the best free music apps for android. Gaana This app is one of the most popular music apps for Hindi, Bollywood, Punjabi and other similar types of music. Most popular in India, Gaana also offers free streaming service for popular songs in English, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Kannada, and Malayalam. You can also browse through the charts and select your favourite tracks to listen to or place in your own personalised playlist. There are heaps of playlists on offer, ranging from collections of sad ballads to weekend party hits. Gaana: Music & Radio Ultimately, Gaana brings the best of India to your mobile phone, whilst also delivering some popular hits from the likes of David Guetta, Bruno Mars, and more. There are a recorded 10 million music tracks to choose from, as well as thousands of playlists. At present, Gaana has been downloaded more than 800,000 times according to Google Play. SoundCloud SoundCloud is a unique music programme used by millions of people and musicians for self-production. In other words, with SoundCloud, musicians everywhere are using this free platform to upload their music. Musicians everywhere are joining this free programme, and listeners everywhere likewise are tuning in to hear what common everyday people are producing. Once a music file is uploaded to SoundCloud, people from all over the world can tune in and listen to it for free. With SoundCloud, you can be either a listener or a giver of music, or both. Soundcloud is great music downloader free app. A lot of features. The enormous database of mp3 songs. Download your favourite music tracks or songs quickly from this app. Connect and share with your friend. Entirely ads free. Finally, you can download this Android app from the below link. It is an editor’s choice music downloader free app for Android. Furthermore, it has been downloaded billions of times.

Furthermore, this free mp3 music downloader app was developed in Germany by SoundCloud. Finally, it is a fantastic music downloader free app for Android. I personally have many friends who record and upload their own music onto SoundCloud. The benefits of using SoundCloud is the fact that you can listen to undiscovered talent which the radio cannot deliver. You can listen to friends or upcoming breakthrough artists, before the music companies slap a copyright on the tracks. Of course, you won’t find top 50 artists through SoundCloud. This is why it doesn’t rank as highly on my list. Nonetheless, there is great music out there besides the popstars on the radio. Why not give it a try and perhaps you will find a local musician whose music you could love. Saavn Music & Radio Another Hindi-related app for free music downloads, Saavn is in contention for the best app for Bollywood music. Personally, I believe Gaana is a bit better, but Saavn nonetheless shouldn’t be ignored. Saavn gives pretty much everything that Gaana does, but there are some differences between the two apps. For example, with Saavn, you can also enjoy podcasts and audio programmes. By following your favourite artists, you will be notified when/if there are any updates. Saavn Music & Radio In addition, with Saavn you can listen to your favourite songs offline. Playlists are also in your control to create and then modify. Like Gaana, you still get the array of different music, from English to Bollywood, Hindi to Tamil. Saavn Music & Radio is proving to be quite popular, with around 750,000 downloads recorded on the Google Play site. MP3 Music Download An app as simple and effective as its title suggests, MP3 Music Downloader may not be as popular as the rest of these apps for free music downloads, but it certainly contends well. With this app, you have unlimited access to a bunch of music files, as well as unlimited music downloads. It’s all very simple with this app. Just search for the song, artist or genre you have in mind, let the app work its magic, and then begin your download. Mp3 Music Download You can alternatively just stream the track if you prefer. Ultimately, this app is one of the most basic music-related apps out there on the market. It has been downloaded only 8,356 times at present, but around 50% of users have rated the app a full 5 stars out of 5. Other Great Free Music Download Apps That Almost Made the Cut Shazam I wrestled with myself for quite some time on where to put Shazam on this list. This app fully deserves a top 10 place, and 2 million people on Google Play would probably agree with that. At the present moment, Shazam has been downloaded almost 3 million times. Of these downloaders, around two-thirds of them have given Shazam the full 5 out of 5 rating. Another half a million have given the app a 4 star rating. Shazam has an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Besides these highly impressive statistics, what does Shazam have to say about itself? Apparently, top singers and celebrities like Adele and Demi Lovato are using the app for their own free music downloads. Some of the top features include: access to lyrics, identify music offline, add songs onto Spotify playlists from Shazam, and more. Shazam also uses amazing visual recognition scanning. This means if you see an album cover or poster, for example, which you want to know more about, use Shazam to scan it and the app will collect information about the music artist in question. There are many other little features which make Shazam a great free app to have. I highly recommend giving it a try, despite the fact that it has just slipped outside the top 10. Apple Music From the mega power of Apple Music comes this useful app. There are approximately 30 million Apple tracks available to listen to through this app. However, I must declare early that this app is not completely free. On the other hand, if you subscribe you can use it for free for 3 months. The fact that Apple Music is not free has dropped it out of my personal top 10 apps for free music downloads. If it weren’t for this hick-up, however, Apple Music would have a fair shot at one of the highest positions on the top 10. There are thousands of playlists to go along with the huge library of 30 million Apple songs. You can create your own library of your favourite songs. Apple Music also offers regular recommendations depending on what you listen to. There are also radio stations and other audio programmes to delve within. Basically, if you don’t want to spend a penny, you can only have this app for a limited time. The Apple Music app currently holds an overall rating of 3.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Vevo In recent years, the Vevo corporation have placed their stamp on many of the biggest, most viewed music videos. Vevo is the result of the partnership between two of the giants of music distrubution: Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group. From this we now have Vevo, the now-popular music video hosting service. So, what can their app do for you? This app as you may have already figured is focused solely on music videos. Due to the fact that this app deals with videos only, and not specifically free music download, it has thus crept out of the top 10 spot. With Vevo, you can watch your favourite music videos in HD and create playlists of the videos you like most. You can also favourite artists, and when a new music video is released by your favourited artist you will be notified. However, Vevo is only available in a select number of countries. The Vevo app is available in the following countries: Canada, USA, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Ireland, France, Germany, The Netherlands, UK, Spain, Mexico, Poland, and New Zealand. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.2 out of 5 on Google Play. TuneIn Radio One of the most popular radio apps, TuneIn Radio offers an impressive 10,000 different radio stations for free. As a radio station app, it has thus fallen out of my top 10 apps for free music downloads. In addition to all this great music, you can also tune into the news, sports and weather broadcasts, as well as other radio programmes. With TuneIn Radio you can keep track of college basketball, the NFL, NBA, and the NHL. All of the radio is delivered live from the very sources. Therefore, you won’t be in complete control over what music artist or song you want to listen to. Nonetheless, you can choose a specific radio station out the thousands of quality stations on offer. Basically, TuneIn Radio sources thousands of top quality radio stations into one single app. There is an abundance of stations to choose from. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Tidal This app combines high quality definition, high definition music videos, as well as valued information from music journalists. There are huge amounts of music on offer with Tidal. The app claims to offer over 40 million tracks, as well as more than 130,000 high definition music videos. As for the contributing journalists, you can try out the carefully selected playlists chosen by these musical experts. You can also read the well-crafted articles, recommendations and interviews provided by these music journalists. In addition to all this, there are no ads nor any ‘fuzzy images’. There is also an offline mode, which allows you to listen to your albums and playlists when you are out and about. The Tidal app currently holds an overall rating of 3.6 out of 5 on Google Play based on 38,653 votes. Heart Radio Again another radio app, Heart radio is a popular radio station situated in the UK. The app is plain and simple. This app is the official app of Heart Radio and thus brings the station to your device. With the app, you can also see what songs are playing next, re-listen to songs from the past week, view the top trending videos, get celebrity news, and more. Of course, this app isn’t exactly an app for free music downloads, hence why I haven’t included it in my top 10. It is, however, a good radio station nonetheless. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on Google Play. Qello Concerts This app is quite unique. With Qello Converts, you can stream classic concerts and documentaries. This app is essentially a treasure chest full of old great live concerts which you can replay at any time. Some of the things which this app also provides are: One of more free tracks from each concert, more than 30 channels of continuous concert moments, and special free full-length shows. It may not be an app for free music downloads, but is is however an app for free music concert downloads. In addition, there are a whole bunch of award-winning music documentaries to feast your eyes and ears on. Qello Concerts currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on Google Play based on 23,233 user votes. Pandora Radio Unlike most radio apps, Pandora gives you complete control over what you want to listen to. With Pandora music, you can create individual stations or playlists for your favourite artists. Most Pandora apps allow you to store up to 100 different artist playlists. Once you have an artist playlist, you will be given anything by that artist on demand. Like I said, Pandora lets you create your own unique radio channels. Personally, I am a huge fan of Pandora, and it almost made its way into my top 10 favourite apps for free music downloads. You can upgrade to Pandora Plus, which will cut the ads, allow replays and skips, and offline playing. The Pandora Radio app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play based on an impressive number of 2,651,882 user votes. I highly recommend this app, despite the fact I haven’t included it in my top 10. SongFlip The SongFlip app claims to offer its users the ability to stream millions of free songs online. I am unsure if there is actually millions on offer from SongFlip, but it does nonetheless offer a lot. The SongFlip app is one of the most basic apps for free music downloads. Simply search for your song or artist and begin streaming for free. There is a high chance that SongFlip has the exact song or artist that you have in mind. After all, it does claim to have millions of tracks to give. The SongFlip app currently holds an overall rating of 4.5 out of 5 on Google Play. Radio Player by Audials This app, yet another radio app, offers over 80,000 different radio stations across the USA. Simply search for an artist, a genre, song or album, and Audials will do its best to retrieve a station best suited to your search. In addition, you can record songs playing on any radio. In other words, if you hear a song which you happen to like but you don’t know the name of, you can choose to record the song right there and then. You can also connect your device to another computer belonging to you, thus allowing you to sync the selected music onto your home PC or laptop. The Radio Player by Audials app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play based on 19,49 user votes. Radio Online – PCRADIO You’ve probably assumed by now that there are thousands of radio-related music apps. That assertion would be correct. However, Radio Online – PCRADIO is one of the best free radio apps out there, and the following is why. This app offers hundreds of free radio stations, which is not as many as the thousands offered by the above Radio Player by Audials, or, TuneIn Radio, for example. Nonetheless, Radio Online PCRADIO does have its own perks. With this app, you can use it even if you do have the lowest of internet speeds. Also, all the radio channels are categorised by artist and genre, making your searches easy. Furthermore, Radio Online PCRADIO also offers full discographies on several artists. The Radio Online PCRADIO app currently holds an overall rating of 4.7 out of 5 on Google Play based on 645,547 user votes. Other Great Music Downloader Apps For Free Music Downloads, and Apps Similar To Music Streaming The following apps are other apps for free music downloads. In addition there are some apps which are not quite designed to download free music. Some play music like many of the aforementioned apps and some are more unique in what they offer. SoundHound Picture yourself listening to a song, you don’t know who it’s by, and you have no way of finding out the artist. Well, these days we have SoundHound to do that for us. SoundHound can recognise voice clips, which will then generate heaps of results. You can save all your searches and import your findings into your Spotify account. The app comes with an embedded YouTube player so you can watch the music video of the found song (if there is one). You can also view the lyrics to the found song, or, if you wish, SoundHound will direct you to where you can purchase the track. There is also an abundance of information on numerous music artists to browse through. All this sounds great, but there is one snag. One version of SoundHound on the Google Play website is unfortunately not free ($3.99). On the other hand, there is another SoundHound app which is practically the exact same which is free. At the moment, I am trying to differentiate between the two apps and figure out if there is any difference. However, I can’t see any major differences, or a single difference at all.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Analyst at KGI Securities is back with more Repetitive Rumors and Wild Speculation | Main | Foxconn Reiterates their Plan for a U.S Plant » January 22, 2017 Apple's Full lawsuit against Qualcomm Comes to Light Revealing Secret Licensing Agreements and more   On Friday Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Sues Qualcomm for $1 Billion Claiming Unfair Exclusionary Tactics and Charging Excessive Royalties." Today's report covers Apple's full formal complaint against Qualcomm with all its details filed with the Southern U.S. District Court in San Diego with the Presiding Judge being noted as Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel. Under Apple's factual allegations segment they cover such matters as Qualcomm's Secret Manufacturer License Agreements, Qualcomm Preventing Apple from bringing its concerns to law enforcement and Qualcomm Retaliates By Withholding Nearly $1 Billion From Apple. Our report covers the Nature of the Action, The Factual Allegations of the case and a full copy of the format complaint for the curious, legal students and professionals to review.   Nature of the Action   Apple's formal complaint before the U.S. District Court in San Diego begins with the 'Nature of the Action.' The following is the full section with yellow highlights being added by Patently Apple for emphasis only.   "Law-enforcement agencies around the globe are actively investigating Qualcomm's illegal business practices; in the past two years alone, Qualcomm has been declared a monopolist by three separate governments. Qualcomm pursues its illegal practices through a secret web of agreements designed to obfuscate its conduct. In at least one such agreement, Qualcomm inserted a gag order that prevented an aggrieved party from seeking relief that could curb Qualcomm's illegal conduct, in an effort to keep courts and regulators in the dark and its coerced customers quiet.   Qualcomm was one among many companies that contributed to the development of standards related to how cellular phones connect to voice and data networks. As a contributor, Qualcomm is entitled to a fair royalty based on the value of its particular contribution. Qualcomm is not entitled to collect royalties based on the contribution of others to the standard, or unrelated innovation by companies that utilize the standard—but this is precisely the business model that Qualcomm has established and that it protects through monopoly power and unlawful licenses. In order to purchase Qualcomm chips or obtain access to patents pledged to a cellular standard, Qualcomm demands that third parties pay Qualcomm a royalty much greater than the value of Qualcomm's contribution to the standard—a value based on the entire price of the innovative products that only incidentally incorporate the standard.   What this means in the case of the iPhone® is that when Apple engineers create a revolutionary new security feature such as touch ID, which enables breakthrough technologies like Apple Pay, Qualcomm insists on royalties for these and other innovations it had nothing to do with and royalty payments go up.   When Apple spends billions redefining the concept of a smartphone camera, Qualcomm's royalty payments go up.   Even when Apple sells an iPhone with added memory—256GB instead of 128GB—Qualcomm collects a larger royalty just because of that added memory.   Apple products are among the most innovative in the world, yet because of its monopoly power, its suppression of the disclosure of information to government agencies investigating Qualcomm, and an abusive licensing model, Qualcomm believes it is entitled to collect its "tribute" on every such improvement.   Apple, which has been overcharged billions of dollars on Qualcomm's illegal scheme, brings this action to recover its damages, enjoin Qualcomm from further violations of the law, and request declaratory relief. Among Apple's damages are nearly $1 billion that Qualcomm owes to Apple under an agreement between the two companies. Qualcomm claims that Apple has forfeited those amounts by responding to requests in the course of an investigation by the Korea Fair Trade Commission ("KFTC"), which recently levied the largest fine in its history against Qualcomm. Qualcomm has withheld the required contractual payments from Apple even though the agreement clearly permits Apple to respond to the KFTC's lawful investigation and requests for information. If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm's release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused.   Apple also seeks redress for Qualcomm's abuse of its monopoly power in the technologies used to connect to cellular networks. Constant connectivity over cellular networks has become part of our everyday lives. The iPhone was not the first cellular phone or even the first smartphone, but it revolutionized the industry and is the gold standard by which all other smartphones are judged. To be a cellular phone at all, an iPhone must be able to connect to the wide variety of cellular networks in use around the world.   Having a common set of standards for these cellular networks is beneficial to consumers because it encourages investment in infrastructure and technology. Common standards allow cellular phones to work together and then permit companies like Apple the opportunity to innovate in building great products.   Standardization can be beneficial, but only if those holding intellectual property that is part of the standard make that intellectual property widely available on terms that fairly compensate the holder of the intellectual property while recognizing the monopoly power obtained through standardization. That is why, for patents that companies have declared "essential" to cellular standards, patent law is reinforced by contractual obligations to license such patents on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory ("FRAND" or "RAND") terms. FRAND commitments are the heart of the standard setting process.   Qualcomm broke its promise and has breached its FRAND commitments. Qualcomm illegally double-dips by selling chipsets that allow mobile telephones to connect to cellular networks and then separately licensing (but never to competitors) the purportedly necessary intellectual property. By tying together the markets for chipsets and licenses to technology in cellular standards, Qualcomm illegally enhances and strengthens its monopoly in each market and eliminates competition. Then, Qualcomm leverages its market power to extract exorbitant royalties, later agreeing to reduce those somewhat only in exchange for additional anticompetitive advantages and restrictions on challenging Qualcomm's power, further solidifying its stranglehold on the industry. All of this has been forced on Apple because the iPhone and the iPad® have required Qualcomm chips.   Qualcomm's abusive practices have particularly harmed Apple, the prime innovator in the mobile device industry. In recent licensing discussions with Apple, Qualcomm has asserted that it has a 'good faith belief' that Apple's products—which now use both Qualcomm and Intel chipsets to connect to cellular networks—infringe many Qualcomm patents simply because Qualcomm "holds a great many patents that are essential to cellular standards implemented by Apple products," including the 3G/UMTS and/or 4G/LTE standards.   Qualcomm has recently demonstrated that it will file lawsuits following threats to assert its patents. The asserted patents in this case include patents that are U.S. counterparts of Chinese patents that Qualcomm has asserted in litigation against Meizu Technology Co., Ltd. ("Meizu") and that Qualcomm has declared as essential to the 3G/UMTS and/or 4G/LTE standard. These patents are not, in fact, essential to 3G/UMTS or 4G/LTE and are not infringed by Apple. Moreover, if any of these patents were essential, Qualcomm's licensing demands violate patent law and its FRAND obligations.   For years, Qualcomm has abused its business relationships with Apple and blocked competitors from selling chipsets. Qualcomm's recent effort to cover its tracks—by punishing Apple for providing truthful testimony at the request of government regulators—underscores the lengths to which Qualcomm will go to protect its extortion scheme. Accordingly, Apple seeks this Court's intervention, bringing breach of contract claims, patent claims, and antitrust claims, as the basis for declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and damages.   Factual Allegations: Apple's Revolutionary Products   Apple's formal complaint before the Court presents a segment that is formally titled: 'Factual Allegations – Apple's Revolutionary Products.' The Complaint in-part reads as follows:   "When Apple unveiled the iPhone in 2007, it revolutionized the telecommunications industry and completely redefined what users can do on their mobile phones. The iPhone combined three products—a revolutionary mobile phone, a widescreen iPod® music player, and a breakthrough computer/Internet communications device—into one small and lightweight handheld device with a large, color multi-touch display; a distinctive user interface; and a sophisticated computing platform for mobile apps. Apple patented many of these innovations.   In 2010, Apple created and defined an entirely new category of devices with the revolutionary iPad. The iPad connects users with their apps and content in a much more intimate, intuitive, and fun way. The iPad is an elegantly designed computer tablet with a color multi-touch screen, a user interface akin to the iPhone, and robust functionality that spans both mobile computing and media storage and playback. As a result of its innovative technology and distinctive design, the iPad achieved instant success and continues to hold a considerable share of the U.S. tablet market.   Apple's iPhone and iPad products are the result of Apple's own creative achievement, technical innovation, differentiated technology, and astute business judgment.   Among many other functions, both the iPhone and certain models of the iPad can send and receive, over cellular networks, telephone calls and/or other voice and video communications, text messages, and Internet data. Except when connected to a Wi-Fi network, a mobile wireless device like an iPhone or iPad cannot be used for communication without a baseband processor chipset, a component that, among other functions, acts as a small wireless radio and "plugs in" to a standardized telecommunications network. Such networks are created and maintained by carrier companies, including, for example, AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile.   The baseband processor chipset is just one component out of thousands of components and technologies contained in the Apple iPhone and iPad. Apple, sometimes through third-parties, purchases components and technologies from third-parties, such as Qualcomm.   This segment continues in Apple's full complaint that is provided for our readers further below. The complaint continues to cover subject matters as follows:   Standards and Their Economic Effects The FRAND Bargain ETSI and Qualcomm's Contractual FRAND Obligations Qualcomm's Dominant Market Position and Cellular Standards Qualcomm's Secret Manufacturer License Agreements Qualcomm Gouges Apple Apple and Qualcomm's Licensing Discussions Qualcomm's SEP Licensing Practices Are Not FRAND and Foreclose Competition Competition Agencies Around the World Investigate and Take Action Against Qualcomm Apple Responds to Agency Requests Preventing Apple from bringing its concerns to law enforcement Qualcomm Retaliates By Withholding Nearly $1 Billion From Apple   On page 19 of the complaint under the segment titled "Qualcomm's Secret Manufacturer License Agreements," Apple provides the graphic as shown below which according to Apple, illustrates the "complex web of contracts, some of them secret contracts that underlie Qualcomm's scheme of relentless extortion and govern the two companies' business relationship."   1. Apple v. Qualcomm Lawsuit - Patently Apple by Jack Purcher on Scribd   Qualcomm's Formal Response   Qualcomm's initial response was issued in a press release on Friday as follows:   "While we are still in the process of reviewing the complaint in detail, it is quite clear that Apple's claims are baseless. Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing program. Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm's business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information. We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple's practices and a robust examination of the merits," said Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel, Qualcomm Incorporated.   About Comments: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit comments.

Ireland has issued hundreds more The EU says the Revenue rulings resulted in the US multinational paying a tiny amount of tax. Sun 1:42 PM 19,466 Views 53 Comments Share Tweet Email2 Image: Richard Drew/Press Association Images TWO REVENUE RULINGS are at the heart of the EU’s investigation into Apple’s tax affairs – and it has now emerged that Irish officials issued more than 300 tax rulings to other companies in one three-year period. In late August, the EU said that Ireland gave Apple illegal state aid worth up to €13 billion over a period of more than a decade and ordered the government to recover the funds from the California firm. At the time, the European Commission said that two tax rulings issued by Ireland to Apple “substantially and artificially” lowered the taxes the company paid in the Republic since 1991. The two key Irish companies at the heart of the controversy are Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe. The EU said the rulings allowed Apple to structure its business affairs in a way that resulted in “an effective corporate tax rate that declined from 1% in 2003 to 0.005% in 2014″ on the profits of Apple Sales International. Fora has now learned that Revenue made 335 rulings between 2010 and 2012. It has likely issued many more, however figures for other years are not available as they have not been compiled by Irish officials. Apple CEO Tim Cook Source: AP/Press Association Images The two Apple rulings related to the allocation of profits to Irish branches of non-resident companies, decisions which the EU says allowed the iPhone maker to slash its tax bill from billions in sales from Europe and other territories to virtually nothing. Questions The EU said in its 130-page decision that Revenue issued these specific rulings – relating to the allocation of profits to Irish branches of non-resident companies – in nine cases. However, the news that Revenue has issued at least 335 tax rulings is likely to raise questions as to what other types of tax structures officials agreed with companies and whether they also resulted in single-digit, or lower, tax rates for businesses. Revenue sometimes issues what it calls ‘non-binding opinions’ on how tax law should be applied in specific transactions or situations. These were repeatedly referred to as ‘rulings’ by the EU, although Revenue does not view them as binding decisions. Revenue Offices in Dublin Castle Source: RollingNews.ie If a company with a large or complicated business is using a tax structure outside the norm, the firm may ask Revenue for an opinion that what it is doing is compliant with tax law. Non-binding opinions Revenue said that opinions are only issued “where the matter is complex or where there is genuine uncertainty around the applicable tax rules”. “In providing an opinion, Revenue’s role is to interpret and apply the tax law correctly and consistently so that taxpayers can understand and comply with their obligations under the law,” it said. Revenue said that, while not binding, it will generally follow the structures suggested in a non-binding opinion once it can be shown that “the transaction as implemented did not diverge from that which was outlined in the information provided”. A spokeswoman for Revenue added: “It is open to Revenue officials to review the position when a transaction has been completed and all the facts are known”. The organisation’s guidelines specifically state that opinions “will not be given where the case manager is of the view that the proposed transaction is part of a scheme or arrangement of which one of the purposes of which is the avoidance of tax”. It said that it issued 99 non-binding opinions in 2010, 128 in 2011, and 108 in 2012, a total of 335 for the period. However, Revenue has likely issued many more in both earlier and later years. The organisation said it could not provide information on how many rulings it made in other periods as the statistics had not been assembled. Source: Niall Carson/PA Wire “Statistics are compiled on the basis of business need, in response to demand, or where their provision is in the public interest. Prior to the recent European Commission decision, this data did not meet the above criteria,” a Revenue spokeswoman said. The data for 2010, 2011 and 2012 was compiled specifically for the EU investigation. Revenue said that from 2016 onwards it will be publishing the number of opinions issued every year in its annual report. Alarming It is not known what is contained in these rulings, as a spokeswoman for Revenue said the organisation “does not publish opinions issued to specific taxpayers”. Sinn Féin MEP Matt Carthy said at the time of the publication of the full EU ruling in December, that the revelation that Revenue had issued at least nine more tax rulings was “the most alarming revelation” contained in the 130-page document. “How many of these rulings involve companies with subsidiaries in Bermuda or other tax havens? How many billions in tax in addition to Apple’s €13 billion has been avoided as a result of Revenue’s sweetheart deals?,” he said. Revenue’s rulings were criticised by the EU during its Apple tax investigation, with the EU saying that the organisation’s “profit-allocation ruling practice is too inconsistent”. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager Source: Virginia Mayo/Press Association Images The EU also raised several questions about Revenue’s Apple rulings dating back to 1990, when the tech company was trying to work out the share of its profits that were liable for tax in Ireland. At the time, Apple officials said that Apple Computers Ltd – later renamed Apple Operations Europe – made its money from three sources: technology, marketing and manufacturing. They claimed only the manufacturing element related to the Irish branch. Revenue officials agreed that all profits attributable to the manufacturing activity would be subject to a ceiling of between $30 million $40 million. According to notes from a 1990 meeting with the Irish tax authority, cited by the EU, an Apple adviser “confessed there was no scientific basis for the figure”. “However the figure was of such magnitude that he hoped it would be seen to be a bona-fide proposal,” the notes said.

European regulators hailed the decision as a positive step toward making the ebook market more competitive, and the German antitrust agency Bundeskartellamt said it will drop an investigation into the two companies' sales practices. The agreement ended Jan. 5, according to the European Commission, and Apple is now free to source audiobooks from companies other than Audible, while Audible can offer its books for sale beyond Apple's iBooks store. "The exclusivity agreement affected the sales opportunities of audiobook publishers since apart from Audible there were few alternative purchasers available, especially in the area of digital audiobooks," Bundeskartellamt President Andreas Mundt said in a statement. Neither Audible nor Apple immediately responded to a request for comment. Related Your Apple iBooks Price-Fixing Credit Is on Its Way Your Apple iBooks Price-Fixing Credit Is on Its Way Although the exclusivity agreement applied worldwide and took effect in 2003, it was not until November 2015 that antitrust regulators began investigating it, following a complaint from the German Publishers and Booksellers Association. Audible, which was founded in 1995 and acquired by Amazon in 2008, is one of the largest online audiobook sellers. Its customers downloaded more than two billion hours worth of audiobooks last year, according to the company's website. In September, it added a rotating selection of more than 50 audiobooks to the list of Amazon Prime benefits. Apple's bookselling deals have come under antitrust scrutiny before, including a $400 million settlement with the Department of Justice stemming from a 2012 lawsuit over price-fixing. Consumers who bought ebooks involved in that case received payouts last summer worth up to $6.93 for each book.

Here’s how to downgrade from 10.2.1. Advertisement Apple just released the iOS 10.2.1 update, but you can still downgrade to iOS 10.2 for a limited time. Get on it fast if you want to do this. Unfortunately, there is no way to go back to iOS 10.1.1, which you can jailbreak. Officially Apple does not support a way to downgrade iOS updates, but there is an easy way to do this in iTunes for a short time after Apple releases an update. Apple closed the option to downgrade to iOS 9 long ago, but you can still downgrade to iOS 10.2. In order to downgrade iOS 10.2.1 to iOS 10.2 you will need to download the file and Apple still needs to sign the file. This normally only happens for a week or two after Apple offers a new update. Advertisement How to downgrade from iOS 10.2.1 to iOS 10.2. Advertisement Apple’s upgrade system includes a check to make sure that Apple is still activating, or signing, the software you want to install. If Apple is no longer signing this update you will not be able to install it. How to Downgrade iOS 10.2.1 to iOS 10.2 Here are the steps you need to downgrade from iOS 10.2.1 to iOS 10.2. You cannot downgrade to iOS 9.3 or to iOS 9.2, which is frustrating for some users. You cannot downgrade back to a jailbreak-able version of iOS 10 either. Backup Your iPhone Before you start you should make sure that your iPhone or iPad is backed up to your computer. You can’t restore a iOS 10.2.1 backup to your iPhone after you downgrade to iOS 10.2, but it is important to make sure you have a backup in case something does go wrong. Make sure you have a backup before you start the iOS 10.2 downgrade to iOS 10.1.1. When you downgrade you will need to completely erase your iPhone. If you have a backup from iOS 10 you can restore to that. Advertisement Download the iOS 10.2 Update To do this you will need to plug in to your Mac or PC using a Lightning cable and you will need to make sure that you have the iOS 10.1.1 update file for your device. Here’s where you can download iOS 10.2 ipsw files for any of the iPhone or iPad devices that runs this update. If the row is green and there is a check in the Apple Signing Status, then you know that you can continue. If Apple is no longer signing iOS 10.2 you should stop. Start the iOS 10.2.1 Downgrade to iOS 10.2 Once you have the file downloaded to your computer, and unzipped if needed, you will want to plug in your iPhone to Mac or PC with a Lightning cable. Start the downgrade to go back to iOS 10.2. Advertisement Open iTunes and click on your iPhone or iPad to launch the device summary page in iTunes. Make sure you turn off Find my iPhone before you start. You will need to special click on “Restore iPhone…”. That is a alt/option click on Mac or a Shift click in Windows. Hold the key and then click. This will open up a prompt so that you can search for the iOS 10.2 ipsw file you downloaded.   Complete the iOS 10.2.1 downgrade to iOS 10.2. Advertisement Find the file and click Open to start the downgrade process. You will see a message on the screen that iTunes will erase and restore your iPhone to iOS 10.2 and will verify the restore with Apple. Click Restore to start. When this finishes you will have a blank iPhone on iOS 10.2. You can choose Restore Backup and choose a previous backup from before you installed iOS 10.2.1. Alternately, you can choose to start over from scratch. What’s New in iOS 10.2.1 & iOS 10.2 New iOS 10.2 Emoji   1 / 6 There are over 100 new iOS 10.2 emoji in this free update. You don't need to buy any apps or subscriptions to unlock them. Simply install iOS 10.2 and you will be able to start sending new faces, food, animals, sports and professions. The people you send the new iOS 10.2 emoji to will need iOS 10.2 installed to see them. They may need iOS 10.2 to see some of the redesigned emoji based on our testing during the beta. Some of the new iOS 10.2 emojis include; Clown Emoji Prince Mother Christmas Rolling on the Floor Laughing Lying Face Drooling Emoji Nauseated Face Sneezing Face Shrug Man in a Tux emoji Pregnant woman Face Palm Cal Me Hand Fingers Crossed Emoji Handshake Gorilla Fox Face Deer Rhino Bat Eagle Duck Owl Lizard Croissant Baguette Peanuts Bacon Egg Milk Whisky Emoji Spoon Scooter Canoe First Place Medal Goal Net Fencer Wrestlers Apple also adds in new professions to the emojis including male and female versions of these new options including artists, astronauts, cooks, factory workers, farmers, firefighters, health worker, judges, mechanics, office workers, pilots, teachers and much more.   1 / 6 18 Responses 03/22/2016 Thelma Reply Friends…!m­­­­­­­­­y room­­­­­­­­­ate’s e­­­­­­­­­x-w­­­­­­­­­ife ma­­­­­­­­­kes $83 e­­­­­­­­­very ho­­­­­­­­­ur o­­­­­­­­­n th­­­­­­­­­e inter­­­­­­­­­net .

Apple buys wireless chips from Qualcomm and also pays it licenses to use its wireless patents. Apple is accusing Qualcomm of withholding $1 billion in rebates under a deal they had struck to keep Qualcomm modems in Apple products, including the iPhone and iPad.  Earlier this week, the FTC accused Qualcomm of monopolistic practices, and directly cited its relationship with Apple.  Apple said that Qualcomm charges Apple “at least five times more in” royalty payments than all of Apple’s other patent licensors combined in a statement provided to CNBC:  “For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with. The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations. Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties. Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined. To protect this business scheme Qualcomm has taken increasingly radical steps, most recently withholding nearly $1B in payments from Apple as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them. Apple believes deeply in innovation and we have always been willing to pay fair and reasonable rates for patents we use. We are extremely disappointed in the way Qualcomm is conducting its business with us and unfortunately after years of disagreement over what constitutes a fair and reasonable royalty we have no choice left but to turn to the courts.” Developing…  The post Apple is suing one of its most important suppliers appeared first on Business Insider.

By John Solinap on January 22 2017 07:20 PM Share Tweet Share Share Email Smartphone fans are always looking to find out the latest leaks and rumors about the upcoming devices. Apple fans are surely no different. This is because they are always looking for whatever iPhone 8 rumors that they can get their hands on. The latest rumor though is that there may be fewer iPhone leaks in the future This comes as Apple is reportedly going to build a secret factory in China. Information is very important in the competitive world of consumer electronics. Being able to get an edge over the competition is surely something every tech company strives for. This is the reason why keeping vital information secret is important. Apple Building Secret Factory in China? In its effort to do this, BGR reports that Apple is going to build a secretive factory in Shenzen, China. The report mentions that it is in the new factory that its iPhones will be assembled. This is surely going to help minimize the opportunity for insiders to smuggle information out of the factories. Not only that, the same report mentions that Foxconn, one of Apple’s manufacturing partner for the iPhone, will likewise build a facility right next door. This certainly goes to show just how much effort Apple will exert to protect its trade secrets. This move by Apple will definitely make it very tough for iPhone leaks to be revealed before the company unveils its flagship smartphones. Right now, even months before the iPhone 8 release insiders already have some details about the smartphone. iPhone 8 Rumors: Phone to Have Curved Display and No Physical Home Button It is expected that the iPhone 8 will have a curved display and will no longer have a physical home button. It is also rumored that the iPhone 8 will have improved specs and hardware compared to last year’s smartphone. While iPhone fans can still enjoy leaks about their favorite smartphone, this luxury may no longer be available in the near future. Until then, tech fans will just have to hope that iPhone 8 leaks and rumors continue to surface in the months leading to its release.

Kuo was briefly a Digitimes analyst and one analysis on his predictions record by Philip Elmer-DeWitt, scored his accuracy at about 44%. Yet however you view Kuo's predictions, he continues to barrel ahead with bold predictions and his latest one came to light yesterday. Unfortunately this time around Kou is using a lot of blind speculation.   Apple moving Touch ID to beneath an iDevice display has been long in the making. A 2013 patent filing came to light in 2015 in our patent application report titled "Apple Introduces an Alternative Touch ID Method using Full-Display Fingerprint Sensors."   Another key patent on this came to light last summer stating that "The electronic device may also include a finger biometric sensor carried by the touch display and that includes a finger biometric sensing layer that includes an array of transparent conductive finger biometric sensing pixels capacitively coupled to the at least one transparent conductive layer of the touch display." Other patents on this could found in our archives.   KGI's analyst reports that Apple is likely to shift Touch ID to the display for the anniversary iPhone which has been rumored and speculated long ago. Kuo points to Apple's Touch ID using an optical-type system which Apple first mentioned back in 2015. Apple noted that "Photodiodes can be any type of fingerprint reader such as, but not limited to, optical finger print readers or thermal finger print readers.   Then instead of predicting, Kuo goes patent hunting to talk about Apple Touch ID ultimately moving to advanced facial recognition. Apple a number of patents on this with two in particular that are in-depth (one and two). However, Touch ID is tightly integrated in with Apple Pay that's used on Apple Watch and facial recognition could never replace Touch ID.   It's starting to look like Kuo likes the fame of being a predictor of Apple features and is ramping up his speculation rather than getting insider information which he's relatively good at.   While Patently Apple has faithful covered Apple's IP filings every week of the year for years now, trying to use a crystal ball to forecast when their new inventions will come to market is not reliable, even if your name is Kuo.   Apple's inventions fill us in on areas of technologies that Apple is interested in and at times they provide us with clear trends that are forming. When Apple introduces new features, Patently Apple tries to match them up to patents that were filed to inform you that a patent has been fulfilled. Forecasting time to market, on the other other hand, is simply wild speculation at best.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

Noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has just revealed his latest predictions, and as he has a decent track record in the past, they're worth paying attention to. Ming-Chi Kuo says Apple is looking to improve security on the 2017 iPhones with the introduction of a facial recognition system that will spot who you are and unlock or lock the handset accordingly. It might work alongside rather than replace the Touch ID system that recognizes fingerprints, at least to begin with. The KGI analyst also repeats rumors we've heard before about the iPhone 8 coming with a curved OLED screen. That's going to require some significant manufacturing skill, says Ming-Chi Kuo, but he thinks Apple and its suppliers can pull it off. Three new iPhones this year? According to Ming-Chi Kuo, the curved OLED display will require a reworking of the iPhone's 3D Touch system under the screen, and it should emerge more sensitive and more accurate than ever as a result. Right now most of the leaks and other speculation surrounding the 2017 iPhone range suggests we're going to see small updates in the form of the iPhone 7S and the iPhone 7S Plus, and then a major step forward with the curved, OLED, bezel-free iPhone 8 at the same time - possibly to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the iPhone. Until Tim Cook takes to the stage in September we don't know anything for definite, but we have been busy compiling all of the rumors we've heard so far. By the time the new iPhones arrive we should have a new version of iOS too - and that might come with its own share of surprises. Is the iPhone 8 actually going to be called the iPhone X?

March 25th 2015 2 years ago /video/video.news.com.au/Business/ Just because you’re renting, doesn’t mean you can’t have a ‘smart’ home. Matthew Dunnnews.com.au@mattydunn11 Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend JUST because you are renting or don’t have tens of thousands of dollars to buy the latest of products doesn’t mean you can’t make your home more connected. With the ‘Internet of Things’ becoming more popular, there are a plethora of products on the market you can purchase to bring your home in 2017 without spending a motza. We have compiled a list of cheap and reliable products to make your ‘dumb’ home much smarter. UPDATE YOUR OLD TELEVISION While there are some quality mid-range smart televisions on the market, there might be other things you need to purchase before the luxury of a new TV. Thankfully, its super easy and relatively cheap to bring your old TV into the future. CHROMECAST ULTRA — $94 Chromecast Ultra is a dongle that plugs into your TV’s HDMI port and allows you to stream 4K Ultra HD & HDR picture quality over your Wi-Fi network. Once plugged in, you can cast media from your existing computer, tablet or mobile device through your home Wi-Fi network and onto your TV screen. The device provides fast, reliable performance with minimal buffering and smoother streaming, with the dongle automatically optimising your content for the best picture quality possible. If your Wi-Fi network isn’t sufficient to meet the demands of 4K, Chromecast Ultra comes with a built-in Ethernet adaptor so you can use a wired connection for a smoother experience. If you didn’t care too much about 4K capabilities, you can also buy the Chromecast 2 for just $58. The Chromecast ultra is subtle enough to hide behind your TV.Source:Supplied APPLE TV — $299 The fourth-generation Apple TV has been on the market for a couple of years and has been hugely popular with consumers. While slightly more expensive than the Chromecast Ultra, the Apple TV is a set-top box that plugs into your television via a HDMI cable and works as a media streamer for all of your home entertainment needs. The product has been built around the foundation of giving users thousands of apps to meet all of their streaming, lifestyle and gaming requirements. As it currently stands there are a number of streaming services available for download and these include apps such as iTunes Movies and TV, Apple Music, Netflix and Stan. Included with the product is a small, thin remote control that isn’t overloaded with mystery buttons you are scared to push for fear of changing settings. Additionally, Apple TV has been fitted with Siri, who can recommend movies based on genres, ratings, actors, eras, characters or cast. Other set-top boxes include the $149 Fetch TV Mini or the $109 Telstra TV. Apple TV is simple to set up and very simple to use.Source:Supplied SLEEPING JUST GOT HI-TECH Sure you would expect electronic items to have smarter options, but the fun doesn’t stop there. Thanks to companies using some serious innovation, sleeping just got much more hi-tech than you would have ever expected. SLEEP NUMBER 360 — $4000 + OK, it’s slightly more expensive, but what a time to be alive when your smart bed senses your movements then automatically adjusts firmness, comfort and support to ensure you get a good nights sleep. But what exactly does a smart bed do to live up to this promise? With studies claiming warm feet promote the rapid onset of sleep, the Sleep Number 360 will warm the foot of the bed to ensure you can doze off easier and will then turn off the heat once you are out. Even more impressive is a feature designed specifically for those who snore — the bed has been fitted with sensors to detect when someone is snoring and will automatically raise the upper portion of the mattress to help clear their airways. If two people are sleeping on the bed, it will only lift one half of the mattress, so it doesn’t wake the other person. The bed has also been fitted with SleepIQ technology that correlates with a smartphone app. This feature allows you to adjust to your ideal level of firmness and support, with ResponsiveAir technology learning your needs and adjusting the bed as you sleep. SleepIQ technology will also analyse how your daily life can affect your sleep by connecting to your thermostat and fitness tracker. The bed can even learn your sleep routines and wake you up at your optimum time each morning. Sleep Number 360 smart bed - CES experience2:47 A look at the Sleep Number 360 smart bed. CREDIT: Sleep Number January 18th 2017 7 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ WHAT ABOUT THE KITCHEN? Fridges have come a long way in recent years, with some of the high-end models fitted with personal assistants, internet connected screens and connected shopping apps. While these will set you back a pretty penny, there is a much cheaper solution that offers many of the same features. SMARTER FRIDGECAM — $99 A product known as the Smarter FridgeCam is working to bring “dumb” fridges into the future. The gadget is a small camera that is placed inside a fridge and takes pictures whenever the door is open or shut. The images are sent to the cloud and can be viewed on the user’s smartphone, making it easier when they next hit the shops. The device also uses object recognition technology to understand what is in the fridge and will send push notifications when the user is running low on stock or when their food is about to expire. The app also uses geolocation technology to send notifications when the user is near a shop and needs to pick up items. Furthermore, the app can recommend recipes based on what ingredients are in the fridge. Smarter FridgeCam will be launching in the US early this year for $A205, with more countries to follow later in the year. This little camera and app will stop you buying your fourth bottle of milk.Source:Supplied GENICAN — $124.99 If you are the type of person who wishes it was easier to keep track of the products you need to buy from the grocery store, Genican is the product for you. The small gadget lives on the edge of your bin and comes equipped with a small barcode reader. Then it’s as simple as scanning the barcode of your product when you place the item in the bin and it will be added to a list on the GeniCan app on your smartphone. If you’re dealing with an item without a barcode, there is a relatively easy solution — if you hold the item in front of the GeniCan scanner for a few seconds and it will ask what needs to be added to your list when no barcode is picked up. Small little gadget that lives inside your bin. What a power play.Source:Supplied BACKYARD BLITZ Smart products don’t have to be limited to inside your home, with a number of products on the market designed to make your backyard even better. HUSQVARNA ROBOT MOWER — $1999 + Again, this may not be the cheapest product on the market, but it sure has its benefits. Husqvarna’s robotic lawnmower will automatically keep your lawn looking fresh, working around the clock without your supervision. The product ensures the cuttings are small enough that there is no need to rake the clippings, with the offcuts working as fertiliser for the soil. The Husqvarna Automower will work in any weather and is able to maintain half acre lawns, with the product being very quiet and discreet. The robot mower is capable of operating on rough terrain and will redirect itself when it meets an obstacle. While impressive, news.com.au tested the product and there are some minor issues with functionality. An automated mower will keep you lawn looking fresh without any effort on your part.Source:Supplied LIGHTING SOLUTIONS Just because you can’t rewire your rental property, doesn’t mean you can’t have smart lighting throughout your home. WEMO LED LIGHTING STARTER SET — $69.99 Using your existing home Wi-Fi network and mobile internet, you are able to dim these lights or switch them on/off all from your smart device. Available on iOS and Android devices, the Wemo app have the ability to control each light individually or as a group according to room or area of the house. It has even been made possible to create a custom schedule that works for your household. The smartbulbs have even been designed to protect your house when you are on holiday, with the product using a random algorithm to turn things on and off automatically. The starter set of this product contains two WeMo Smart LED Bulbs and WeMo Link — a device allowing you to connect up to 50 WeMo Smart LED Bulbs. The starter set of this product contains two WeMo Smart LED Bulbs and WeMo Link.Source:Supplied SENGLED PULSE SOLO — $69 With a goal to revolutionise the lighting industry by transforming your house into a connected home, Sengled has created Pulse Solo smart bulb. The product combines the energy efficiency of a dimmable LED light with the high-quality audio of JBL Bluetooth speaker to provide you a home entertainment experience that you can easily control. While the sound quality isn't the best, for a little extra cost you can upgrade to the Pulse set to includes a subwoofer module to bring the bass. Like the above product, there is an app available which allows you to dim the brightness of your light from your smartphone. This can be done while continuing to play music — a feature that could be helpful when preparing for a romantic encounter. Do you have any tips for making your ‘dumb’ home smarter?

Qualcomm Calls Apple’s Allegations in $1 Billion Lawsuit “Baseless” GO The company also responded to FTC charges Jan 22, 2017 09:06 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  A few days ago, the US Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, accusing the chipmaker of violating competition laws and specifically referring to an agreement that the company signed with Apple. It seems that the Cupertino-company also sued the chipmaker. Apple has filed a $1 billion lawsuit against Qualcomm, claiming that the company charged excessive royalties “for technologies they have nothing to do with.” Apple reps stated that Qualcomm charged the company five times more in payments than any other patent licensors. Graphic from Apple's lawsuit against Qualcomm The FTC claimed that Qualcomm prevented Apple from buying processors from competitors and imposed royalty payments to make it highly unprofitable for Apple to contract other companies. Qualcomm suggests that Apple is behind FTC’s charges Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel at Qualcomm Incorporated responded to Apple’s suit: “While we are still in the process of reviewing the complaint in detail, it is quite clear that Apple’s claims are baseless. Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing program. Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information. We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits.” It seems that Qualcomm openly suggests that Apple was behind the FTC charges and that Apple acted similarly in other parts of the world, meaning that the FTC wasn’t the only regulatory agency to accuse Qualcomm of unfair practices in the past few years. Qualcomm was involved in lawsuits in South Korea, China and received complaints from EU regulators. It remains to be seen how this situation unfolds, but it could stretch over a long period of time.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Apple#Qualcomm#Lawsuit#FTC#Royalties subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Qualcomm logo (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Huawei Execs Arrested for Allegedly Leaking Information to LeEco FTC Sues Qualcomm for Allegedly Violating Competition Laws Qualcomm and Meizu Settle Patent Lawsuit, the Chinese Company Can Now Go Global Qualcomm Gets Record Fine for Unfair Practices in South Korea Family Tree Now: How to Remove Your Private Records from Genealogy Site Huawei Watch 2 with Cellular Connectivity Reportedly Coming Next Month Padoka or Oibaf PPA for Ubuntu Gaming?

Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 119.97 -0.11 -0.09% Samsung Electronics Co Ltd SSNLF ▲ 1,400.00 +150.00 +12.00% Yelp Inc YELP ▲ 42.41 +0.88 +2.12% I was already a big fan of the Gear S3 Frontier when it came out late last year, but Samsung’s decision to add robust iOS support to its latest smartwatch has pushed my enthusiasm for the device over the top — and the Apple Watch from my wrist. The Gear S3 comes in two designs, classic and Frontier. The Frontier is one of those chunky watches, like something you might wear while hiking or going for a run. It’s slightly thick for a regular watch, but considering the fact that it can also function as a stand-alone phone, I’m willing to overlook the additional bulk. Besides, that never really bothered me. The watch includes a bevel that can be rotated to interact with apps, a heart rate sensor, two buttons and a round, vibrant touchscreen face. It’s also a clear step up from the Gear S2, Samsung’s 2015 smartwatch, which is an important distinction when you start comparing it to Apple’s approach to the smartwatch. In 2015, the Apple Watch was the clear winner among the slew of smartwatches that hit the market that year. While the Pebble, a strong contender with support across platforms, was a close second, it was also the sort of tech that required an admiration for how and why it was built to truly appreciate it. The Apple Watch, on the other hand, was the most mainstream-ready of all the smartwatches on the market at the time. In my review from 2015, I called that out, along with the Apple Watch’s chief problem. “That’s the good news; the bad news is that the reason it is the easiest to understand and use is because it remains firmly planted inside Apple’s walled garden of content,” I wrote. “There are no other watches that can rely entirely on Apple’s operating system, and to get an app onto the Apple Watch a developer has to go through Apple. Apple sets the limitations of those apps and of how much of the watch’s sensors and other hardware a developer can use.” There were other issues, to be sure. The Apple Watch wasn’t the nicest-looking smartwatch, it wasn’t waterproof and for some reason, it didn’t allow for custom watch faces or for developers to tap into a lot of the basic functionality of the watch. But all of that changed last year with the Apple Watch Series 2. The S2 opened the doors on development. It made the watch waterproof and … well, unfortunately, there isn’t really an and. While it was a step in the right direction, it increasingly felt like too little, too late, as other smartwatches began to hit the market. Then Samsung decided to open the door to its watch working in a real way on the iPhone, and that was that. I went from wearing my Apple Watch every day, to wearing it every week, to now only wearing it when I forget to wear the Frontier. The only thing preventing me from putting the Apple Watch away in my watch case is that Samsung’s own app store is still missing some crucial apps. But first, the good. It’s fat, but it also looks and feels like a watch — not a smartwatch, but a watch. That’s thanks to some nice design elements like the stainless steel body and bezel, and the silicon band. That bezel is also one of my favorite ways to interact with a smartwatch. I appreciate Apple’s smart crown, but the bezel’s larger size makes it a bit easier to use, and it feels more precise. The watch also features a great selection of built-in tech like GPS, an SOS service that can quickly send out a location beacon to pre-selected people, an accelerometer, gyro sensor, barometer, ambient light sensor and a heart rate sensor. It also includes fairly robust IP68, water and dust resistance. Now let’s talk about the battery, one of the major sticking points for any smartwatch owner. Because the Gear S3 can operate as a stand-alone cellphone, or use Bluetooth to connect to your phone or use Wi-Fi to connect to a nearby signal, battery life is sort of all over the place. What I’ve found is that when it’s using just Bluetooth, it lasts about two full days. When it’s being used as a stand-alone phone, it barely lasts eight hours. That’s a wide spread, but it gives you a sense of what to expect from. Typically, I fall in the two-day zone, except when the watch loses connection with my phone. Which brings us to the bad. The Gear S3 is designed to work with Samsung’s phones. That’s how the company made it; it’s probably also why the company made it. So the best use cases are always with those phones. When you use it with an iPhone, well, your experience may vary. The Samsung Gear S3 app for iOS is pretty straightforward. Once you connect your watch to your phone, it tells you the battery life and communicates all sorts of data back and forth. For instance, it can send — with your permission — your health data to the phone, and can send notifications to the watch. Fantastic! Unfortunately, I periodically found the watch disconnecting. I believe this has something to do with the app running in the background on the phone. That works, but if it ever crashes or I close it, the connection is lost. It’s not a huge deal, but it does impact battery life. You can also use the phone to browse the app store for the watch. You can do this with the watch, too, but it’s much easier on the phone. While the store currently has a huge selection of watch faces, including some amazing game-themed ones, it’s a little light, a little spotty on the other stuff. There are a bunch of workout apps and games. My favorite game right now is a fantastic adaptation of Fruit Ninja that uses the touchscreen of the watch for play. But I can’t load up Spotify or Twitter. Yelp is there and so is CNN, but not Apple Pay or Samsung Pay. And it’s unclear if or when any of these will show up. I do find new things popping up occasionally, but mostly it seems to be watch faces. With a bit more support in the apps department, Samsung’s Gear S3 could easily become the best smartwatch on the market. It’s technically already there, if you look just at the watch, but hardware is really only as good as the software it supports. Of course, that said, Android Wear 2.0 is coming, along with new watches, next month. Among the many improvements the OS system is bringing is the ability to download apps directly to a watch, no matter which sort of phone you have it connected to. Samsung better get going if it wants to cement its enviable position.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem.

Everyone has at least heard of Spotify, and millions of people across the globe use it as their go-to software for free music. The best part is, although it is technically a radio-streaming programme, you have complete control over what you want to listen to, unlike actual radio. spotify I personally use Spotify myself, and the reason is due to not just its huge wealth of great music, but because it is also legal and it contributes somewhat financially to the actual music artists. All things considered, this popular radio-streaming giant offers an incredible amount of free music. There are intermittent ads, but this doesn’t detract from Spotify’s quality and wealth of free, great music. Google Play Music This app, designed by Google, is essentially a free radio service.

Furthermore, you can listen to your music offline. Basically, with Napster, you can listen to your favourite playlist when travelling to work, without being interrupted by ads.

Rock My Run Are you perhaps interested in fitness? Does your week consist of regular workouts? If so, Rock My Run has been specifically designed for you. This app is manufactured for those who love to listen to music during workouts. Some of the best features about this app is that you can create some unique playlists. For example, you can make playlists which are moulded around a certain tempo or mood. If you wanted to create a fast playlist for running, for example, or an inspiring playlist for hill climbing, Rock My Run is the app for you. All in all, this app will certainly motivate you in the gym or in the great outdoors. ROckmyrun is an amazing free music app for fitness training app. You can hear your favourite music while running, jogging or exercising. You can hear some popular DJ’s with perfect beats for training. It will increase your confidence and enthusiasm and will motivate you to keep going. You just need to choose your favourite genre and then it will stream body driven music. I would really prefer his app as I am personally a sportsperson. ROCK MY RUN Has been rated 4.3 stars which is amazing. Got 1 million+ downloads. Size is quite big. Finally, it’s size is 32 MB. It seems like it requires android version 4.0 or up. Furthermore, it even consumes fewer data. In conclusion, it is one of the best free music apps for android. Gaana This app is one of the most popular music apps for Hindi, Bollywood, Punjabi and other similar types of music. Most popular in India, Gaana also offers free streaming service for popular songs in English, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Kannada, and Malayalam. You can also browse through the charts and select your favourite tracks to listen to or place in your own personalised playlist. There are heaps of playlists on offer, ranging from collections of sad ballads to weekend party hits. Gaana: Music & Radio Ultimately, Gaana brings the best of India to your mobile phone, whilst also delivering some popular hits from the likes of David Guetta, Bruno Mars, and more. There are a recorded 10 million music tracks to choose from, as well as thousands of playlists. At present, Gaana has been downloaded more than 800,000 times according to Google Play. SoundCloud SoundCloud is a unique music programme used by millions of people and musicians for self-production. In other words, with SoundCloud, musicians everywhere are using this free platform to upload their music. Musicians everywhere are joining this free programme, and listeners everywhere likewise are tuning in to hear what common everyday people are producing. Once a music file is uploaded to SoundCloud, people from all over the world can tune in and listen to it for free. With SoundCloud, you can be either a listener or a giver of music, or both. Soundcloud is great music downloader free app. A lot of features. The enormous database of mp3 songs. Download your favourite music tracks or songs quickly from this app. Connect and share with your friend. Entirely ads free. Finally, you can download this Android app from the below link. It is an editor’s choice music downloader free app for Android. Furthermore, it has been downloaded billions of times. SOUND cloud Since it has been rated four stars, it is an amazing free mp3 download app for android. It seems like it requires Android 4.0 or up. It was last updated in June 2016. Furthermore, this free mp3 music downloader app was developed in Germany by SoundCloud. Finally, it is a fantastic music downloader free app for Android. I personally have many friends who record and upload their own music onto SoundCloud. The benefits of using SoundCloud is the fact that you can listen to undiscovered talent which the radio cannot deliver. You can listen to friends or upcoming breakthrough artists, before the music companies slap a copyright on the tracks. Of course, you won’t find top 50 artists through SoundCloud. This is why it doesn’t rank as highly on my list. Nonetheless, there is great music out there besides the popstars on the radio. Why not give it a try and perhaps you will find a local musician whose music you could love. Saavn Music & Radio Another Hindi-related app for free music downloads, Saavn is in contention for the best app for Bollywood music. Personally, I believe Gaana is a bit better, but Saavn nonetheless shouldn’t be ignored. Saavn gives pretty much everything that Gaana does, but there are some differences between the two apps. For example, with Saavn, you can also enjoy podcasts and audio programmes. By following your favourite artists, you will be notified when/if there are any updates. Saavn Music & Radio In addition, with Saavn you can listen to your favourite songs offline. Playlists are also in your control to create and then modify. Like Gaana, you still get the array of different music, from English to Bollywood, Hindi to Tamil. Saavn Music & Radio is proving to be quite popular, with around 750,000 downloads recorded on the Google Play site. MP3 Music Download An app as simple and effective as its title suggests, MP3 Music Downloader may not be as popular as the rest of these apps for free music downloads, but it certainly contends well. With this app, you have unlimited access to a bunch of music files, as well as unlimited music downloads. It’s all very simple with this app. Just search for the song, artist or genre you have in mind, let the app work its magic, and then begin your download. Mp3 Music Download You can alternatively just stream the track if you prefer. Ultimately, this app is one of the most basic music-related apps out there on the market. It has been downloaded only 8,356 times at present, but around 50% of users have rated the app a full 5 stars out of 5. Other Great Free Music Download Apps That Almost Made the Cut Shazam I wrestled with myself for quite some time on where to put Shazam on this list. This app fully deserves a top 10 place, and 2 million people on Google Play would probably agree with that. At the present moment, Shazam has been downloaded almost 3 million times. Of these downloaders, around two-thirds of them have given Shazam the full 5 out of 5 rating. Another half a million have given the app a 4 star rating. Shazam has an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Besides these highly impressive statistics, what does Shazam have to say about itself? Apparently, top singers and celebrities like Adele and Demi Lovato are using the app for their own free music downloads. Some of the top features include: access to lyrics, identify music offline, add songs onto Spotify playlists from Shazam, and more. Shazam also uses amazing visual recognition scanning. This means if you see an album cover or poster, for example, which you want to know more about, use Shazam to scan it and the app will collect information about the music artist in question. There are many other little features which make Shazam a great free app to have. I highly recommend giving it a try, despite the fact that it has just slipped outside the top 10. Apple Music From the mega power of Apple Music comes this useful app. There are approximately 30 million Apple tracks available to listen to through this app. However, I must declare early that this app is not completely free. On the other hand, if you subscribe you can use it for free for 3 months. The fact that Apple Music is not free has dropped it out of my personal top 10 apps for free music downloads. If it weren’t for this hick-up, however, Apple Music would have a fair shot at one of the highest positions on the top 10. There are thousands of playlists to go along with the huge library of 30 million Apple songs. You can create your own library of your favourite songs. Apple Music also offers regular recommendations depending on what you listen to. There are also radio stations and other audio programmes to delve within. Basically, if you don’t want to spend a penny, you can only have this app for a limited time. The Apple Music app currently holds an overall rating of 3.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Vevo In recent years, the Vevo corporation have placed their stamp on many of the biggest, most viewed music videos. Vevo is the result of the partnership between two of the giants of music distrubution: Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group. From this we now have Vevo, the now-popular music video hosting service. So, what can their app do for you? This app as you may have already figured is focused solely on music videos. Due to the fact that this app deals with videos only, and not specifically free music download, it has thus crept out of the top 10 spot. With Vevo, you can watch your favourite music videos in HD and create playlists of the videos you like most. You can also favourite artists, and when a new music video is released by your favourited artist you will be notified. However, Vevo is only available in a select number of countries. The Vevo app is available in the following countries: Canada, USA, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Ireland, France, Germany, The Netherlands, UK, Spain, Mexico, Poland, and New Zealand. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.2 out of 5 on Google Play. TuneIn Radio One of the most popular radio apps, TuneIn Radio offers an impressive 10,000 different radio stations for free. As a radio station app, it has thus fallen out of my top 10 apps for free music downloads. In addition to all this great music, you can also tune into the news, sports and weather broadcasts, as well as other radio programmes. With TuneIn Radio you can keep track of college basketball, the NFL, NBA, and the NHL. All of the radio is delivered live from the very sources. Therefore, you won’t be in complete control over what music artist or song you want to listen to. Nonetheless, you can choose a specific radio station out the thousands of quality stations on offer. Basically, TuneIn Radio sources thousands of top quality radio stations into one single app. There is an abundance of stations to choose from. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Tidal This app combines high quality definition, high definition music videos, as well as valued information from music journalists. There are huge amounts of music on offer with Tidal. The app claims to offer over 40 million tracks, as well as more than 130,000 high definition music videos. As for the contributing journalists, you can try out the carefully selected playlists chosen by these musical experts. You can also read the well-crafted articles, recommendations and interviews provided by these music journalists. In addition to all this, there are no ads nor any ‘fuzzy images’. There is also an offline mode, which allows you to listen to your albums and playlists when you are out and about. The Tidal app currently holds an overall rating of 3.6 out of 5 on Google Play based on 38,653 votes. Heart Radio Again another radio app, Heart radio is a popular radio station situated in the UK. The app is plain and simple. This app is the official app of Heart Radio and thus brings the station to your device. With the app, you can also see what songs are playing next, re-listen to songs from the past week, view the top trending videos, get celebrity news, and more. Of course, this app isn’t exactly an app for free music downloads, hence why I haven’t included it in my top 10. It is, however, a good radio station nonetheless. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on Google Play. Qello Concerts This app is quite unique. With Qello Converts, you can stream classic concerts and documentaries. This app is essentially a treasure chest full of old great live concerts which you can replay at any time. Some of the things which this app also provides are: One of more free tracks from each concert, more than 30 channels of continuous concert moments, and special free full-length shows. It may not be an app for free music downloads, but is is however an app for free music concert downloads. In addition, there are a whole bunch of award-winning music documentaries to feast your eyes and ears on. Qello Concerts currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on Google Play based on 23,233 user votes. Pandora Radio Unlike most radio apps, Pandora gives you complete control over what you want to listen to. With Pandora music, you can create individual stations or playlists for your favourite artists. Most Pandora apps allow you to store up to 100 different artist playlists. Once you have an artist playlist, you will be given anything by that artist on demand. Like I said, Pandora lets you create your own unique radio channels. Personally, I am a huge fan of Pandora, and it almost made its way into my top 10 favourite apps for free music downloads. You can upgrade to Pandora Plus, which will cut the ads, allow replays and skips, and offline playing. The Pandora Radio app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play based on an impressive number of 2,651,882 user votes. I highly recommend this app, despite the fact I haven’t included it in my top 10. SongFlip The SongFlip app claims to offer its users the ability to stream millions of free songs online. I am unsure if there is actually millions on offer from SongFlip, but it does nonetheless offer a lot. The SongFlip app is one of the most basic apps for free music downloads. Simply search for your song or artist and begin streaming for free. There is a high chance that SongFlip has the exact song or artist that you have in mind. After all, it does claim to have millions of tracks to give. The SongFlip app currently holds an overall rating of 4.5 out of 5 on Google Play. Radio Player by Audials This app, yet another radio app, offers over 80,000 different radio stations across the USA. Simply search for an artist, a genre, song or album, and Audials will do its best to retrieve a station best suited to your search. In addition, you can record songs playing on any radio. In other words, if you hear a song which you happen to like but you don’t know the name of, you can choose to record the song right there and then. You can also connect your device to another computer belonging to you, thus allowing you to sync the selected music onto your home PC or laptop. The Radio Player by Audials app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play based on 19,49 user votes. Radio Online – PCRADIO You’ve probably assumed by now that there are thousands of radio-related music apps. That assertion would be correct. However, Radio Online – PCRADIO is one of the best free radio apps out there, and the following is why. This app offers hundreds of free radio stations, which is not as many as the thousands offered by the above Radio Player by Audials, or, TuneIn Radio, for example. Nonetheless, Radio Online PCRADIO does have its own perks. With this app, you can use it even if you do have the lowest of internet speeds. Also, all the radio channels are categorised by artist and genre, making your searches easy. Furthermore, Radio Online PCRADIO also offers full discographies on several artists. The Radio Online PCRADIO app currently holds an overall rating of 4.7 out of 5 on Google Play based on 645,547 user votes. Other Great Music Downloader Apps For Free Music Downloads, and Apps Similar To Music Streaming The following apps are other apps for free music downloads. In addition there are some apps which are not quite designed to download free music. Some play music like many of the aforementioned apps and some are more unique in what they offer. SoundHound Picture yourself listening to a song, you don’t know who it’s by, and you have no way of finding out the artist. Well, these days we have SoundHound to do that for us. SoundHound can recognise voice clips, which will then generate heaps of results. You can save all your searches and import your findings into your Spotify account. The app comes with an embedded YouTube player so you can watch the music video of the found song (if there is one). You can also view the lyrics to the found song, or, if you wish, SoundHound will direct you to where you can purchase the track. There is also an abundance of information on numerous music artists to browse through. All this sounds great, but there is one snag. One version of SoundHound on the Google Play website is unfortunately not free ($3.99). On the other hand, there is another SoundHound app which is practically the exact same which is free. At the moment, I am trying to differentiate between the two apps and figure out if there is any difference. However, I can’t see any major differences, or a single difference at all. In short, search for the free version of SoundHound. This app currently holds an overall rating of 4.3 out of 5 on the Google Play website based on 623,731 user votes. Deezer – Songs & Music Player Deezer does everything that a good music app should do. One of the best features used on this app is called ‘Flow’..

From page-turners to primetime: The razor-sharp author behind new drama Apple Tree Yard 20 January 2016 This weekend, the BBC launches its lavish four-part TV adaptation of Louise Doughty’s novel Apple Tree Yard. A sharply contemporary psycho-drama, it tells the story of a renowned scientist who risks everything by beginning an affair with a duplicitous stranger and eventually winds up in the dock. Writer and broadcaster BIDISHA appraises Doughty's work. Ben Chaplin and Emily Watson in Apple Tree Yard, BBC One In Louise Doughty’s Apple Tree Yard no relationship or character is quite what they seem. And, from the law courts to Parliament to the great houses of scientific research, the country’s most venerable buildings and institutions conceal conspiracies, secrets and set-ups as shocking as they are sordid. The adaptation puts the acting brilliance of Emily Watson front and centre in a role that mixes avarice and ambition with naivety and self-deception Underneath the apparently modern, glittering surface of sophistication, power and success are some extremely retrograde opinions about how women should behave, which ultimately conspire to bring down the central character. The adaptation puts the acting brilliance of Emily Watson front and centre in a role that mixes avarice and ambition with naivety and self-deception. Watson specialises in playing blazing but breakable women and in Apple Tree Yard her character, scientist Yvonne Carmichael, flashes between personae: brilliant thinker, ambivalent wife, public figure, affectionate mother, loyal friend, scheming lover, seduced victim, persecuted defendant. Apple Tree Yard was Louise Doughty’s seventh novel, published in 2013; it has sold more than a quarter of a million copies in the UK and been translated into 26 languages. The TV adaptation has been written by Amanda Coe and directed by Jessica Hobbs and while it will no doubt enable a huge new primetime audience to appreciate Doughty’s clever plotting and whip-fast storytelling, I hope it compels just as many people to read Apple Tree Yard as a novel and then discover the rest of Doughty’s exceptional body of work. Doughty's eighth and latest book, Black Water, came out last year, but she has been a published novelist since her 1995 debut, Crazy Paving. She has been shortlisted for, and indeed judged, many of the major UK literary prizes. But it was the publication in 2010 of her sixth novel, Whatever You Love, that pulled Doughty sharply into focus as one of our most fearless and observant living novelists. Author Louise Doughty at the Edinburgh International Book Festival in 2004 Emily Watson as Dr Yvonne Carmichael in Apple Tree Yard, BBC One Telling the story of a woman who seeks retribution for her daughter’s accidental death, it combined a brazen honesty about women’s lives and drives with caustic wit, brilliant characterisation, high-focus contemporaneity and lean, addictive storytelling. A story combining a brazen honesty about women’s lives with brilliant characterisation, high-focus contemporaneity and lean, addictive storytelling. Whatever You Love burns with relevance, daring and candour. She starts with the shocking truth about our desires, our ambivalence and our anger, then allows the plot to carry these emotions to dangerous, disturbing (but always horribly plausible) places. If the TV adaptation of Apple Tree Yard preserves Doughty's original narrative voice it will be a sure success. The novel is a pulsing literary work, not a throwaway effort where you sense the author is simply blocking out scenes for some future screen adaptation. There are many brilliant lines, from the witty to the heart-stoppingly blunt: Yvonne wears “the sort of boots a middle-aged woman wears because they make her feel less like a middle-aged woman”; she admits that “no self-employed person gets any work done on a Friday, although we pretend that we do”; she writes in an unsent letter to her lover that “sex with you is like being eaten by a wolf.” In Doughty’s words, seemingly casual details are imbued with complex meaning. As regards Yvonne’s “affair” - as she thinks of it - the truth is that she is the dupe in a game played by a cold predator and it is sordid, even pathetic. “It takes me three days to feel used. Not bad, I think to myself,” deadpans Yvonne. The first transgression happens in a church crypt underneath the Houses of Parliament, a place of “hidden worship” afflicted with an “emptiness”. Emily Watson and Jack Hamilton in Apple Tree Yard Ben Chaplin and Emily Watson in Apple Tree Yard Ben Chaplin and Emily Watson in Apple Tree Yard Tourist-focused Westminster, with its grand buildings dedicated to politics, history, law and science, is in fact pitted with grubby alleyways, cloakrooms, toilets and yards in which Yvonne is set up and humiliated. Yet she is drawn in, partly because “it’s so many years since I’ve had a first encounter.” Her downfall is as breezy as a philanderer’s kiss, as savage as a knife in the back – and as compulsively readable as a great literary page-turner Yvonne is determinedly self-critical, flagellating herself as she realises that her lover is an “operator”, a sociopathic and practiced seducer, a calculating exploiter (and worse) who can ultimately destroy her, expose her and invite the media, the public and the full force of the criminal justice system to punish her as a bad woman. As rendered in Louise Doughty’s prose, this downfall is as breezy as a philanderer’s kiss, as savage as a knife in the back – and as compulsively readable as a great literary page-turner. Apple Tree Yard is published by Faber & Faber. The first episode of the BBC One adaptation is on Sunday 22 January at 9pm, and in the UK you can watch it on BBC iPlayer after transmission.

The serial, which is slipping into the 9pm slot vacated by Sherlock, brings a pretty impressive cast including Emily Watson and Ben Chaplin to the screen in its story of a middle-aged woman whose extra-marital activity leads to all sorts of problems. And yes, it’s sure to attract attention for its explicit sex scenes – but there’s a whole lot more to it than that. Here’s what you can expect from the next big Sunday night drama coming your way… What’s Apple Tree Yard all about? To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Based on the novel by Louise Doughty, Apple Tree Yard tells the story of Yvonne Carmichael, a high-flying geneticist who on the surface seems to have it all: great career, devoted, similarly successful husband, two kids, nice house etc. Until, that is, she embarks on an affair with a handsome stranger, setting off a chain of events which quickly turn violent. And that’s when things start to get even more complicated. We wouldn’t dream of telling you how, exactly – but the fact that the tale is told in flashback, kicking off with Yvonne on trial for an undisclosed charge, tells you that things aren’t exactly going to be plain sailing for her. And the TV version? Emily Watson plays geneticist Yvonne Carmichael, whose life is turned upside down when she has an affair (Picture: BBC) The adaptation sees Oscar-nominated actress Emily Watson as Yvonne, and Ben Chaplin (last seen in 2016’s Snowden) as Mark Costley, the man with whom she becomes passionately involved. Ben Chaplin plays the object of our heroine’s affections (Picture: BBC) You might also recognise Mark Bonnar – who played DCC Mike Dryden in series two of Line Of Duty – as Yvonne’s husband Gary, and Happy Valley’s Susan Lynch as her best friend, the unlucky-in-love Susannah. So is it really that saucy then? OK, so there is some of this…(Picture: BBC) A lot has already been made of the fact that the plot focuses on an affair between two middle-aged characters – and that it’ll serve up a whole load of steamy scenes as the pair get better acquainted. And yes, there is a fair bit of frenzied bonking in the first episode – some of which comes within minutes of the watershed (*clutches pearls*) But if you tune into this expecting it to be all Fifty Shades Of Grey Hair, you’re going to be very disappointed, as this is more of a psychological thriller than a full-on sex-fest. And there’s some seriously dark twists and turns as the action unfolds. So where is Apple Tree Yard exactly? To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video It’s the name of a road, but to tell you more than that would be to give away far too much of the plot. Just watch and you’ll see. When’s it on though? It kicks off on BBC One at 9pm on Sunday night. Love this as much as we do?

According to Mac Rumors, the iPhone 8 may have some pretty advanced security features. “Noted KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo released a research report today in which he outlined further expectations for Apple’s 2017 iPhone, including new biometric identification technology as well as the necessity of a new design to provide better structural support for a flexible OLED display with 3D Touch capability.” As Mac Rumors notes, Kuo believes Apple is developing new Touch ID tech to complement its zero bezel screen. Apple could also completely replace the Touch ID with an advanced facial recognition system. Many of the commenters after the article aren’t impressed. “Facial recognition in a smartphone is a solution looking for a problem. In addition to being much more difficult than fingerprint sensing (beards, glasses, lighting, even the angle at which you hold the phone all can affect recognition accuracy) the payoff just isn’t there, in my opinion,” says Twolf2919. “Folks that put something over the camera opening to prevent unwanted spying through the video camera are gonna have some trouble with the security features,” claims Robert Walter. Forbes recently talked about an iPhone 8 feature that hasn’t been mentioned yet. The iPhone 8 will be Apple’s biggest smartphone upgrade in 10 years.

This means the phones could withstand full submersion in up to 1.5 of water for up to 30 minutes.” However, there is more to look forward to. Even though the iPhone 7 series wasn’t considered an important upgrade from the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, the iPhone 8 series upgrade is going to be huge. According to 9to5Mac, we may see 4.7-inch to 5.8-inch curved OLED displays, an all-glass design with new colors, wireless charging, an embedded (into the screen) home button, and something that has to do with augmented reality. BGR describes how Apple may incorporate augmented reality with their next smartphone in 2017. “The way Apple envisions implementing augmented reality into the iPhone is multi-faceted. For instance, Apple envisions iPhone users being able to point their cameras at any number of objects and have the device itself recognize what’s in frame,” says columnist Yoni Heisler. The article adds that as another example, Apple could build functionality that would allow the iPhone camera to completely manipulate faces. This has caused a lot of excitement in the smartphone world. Many on Twitter are patiently awaiting Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone. These iPhone 8 spec & design rumours getting me all excited ????????????#iphone8 #hurryupSeptember — Emma Carr (@cyberchickgeek) January 19, 2017 My phone is payed off but I want the iPhone 8 — dragon ball z kai (@dbzKaii) January 18, 2017 The year 2017 is going to be a huge one for Apple. In addition to the iPhone 8, Apple is going to upgrade the iPad Pro series. Forbes has the news. Apple will soon upgrade both versions of the iPad Pro. [Image by Eric Risberg/AP Images] “Noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes that Apple has three new iOS-powered tablets lined up for release in 2017; an update to the 12.9 inch iPad Pro, a price-conscious 9.7 inch model, and the previously rumored educational model with a screen of just over ten inches on the diagonal.” There is a lot of debate on whether or not the iPad Pro is still relevant. However, both the 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch versions of the device must be selling well enough in order to warrant a refresh from Apple. Which are you looking more forward to — the iPhone 8 or the updated iPad Pro? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section.

The closure of the Galeries Lafayette shop this month was rumored back in October, and it leaves the Isetan Shinjuku location in Tokyo as the only remaining Apple Watch pop up shop. Apple opened the trio of Apple Watch pop up shops in April 2015 at the luxury retailers as part of the company's initial efforts to position the watch as a fashion item, with gold Apple Watch Edition models selling for as much as $17,000. Apple has since toned down the luxury aspects of Apple Watch marketing, focusing more on health, fitness, and convenience features for the average user. With the launch of Apple Watch Series 2 last September, Apple did away with the luxury gold Edition line, replacing it with new ceramic Edition models topping out at $1,300.

Rating: 10 Votes Veinticinco 2 days ago at 03:28 am It's clear the AW, and in particular the launch series and ridiculous "edition" complete with the nauseating fashion PR puff, "luxury" tag and GL/Selfridges pop-up nonsense, bears all the stiletto marks of a certain ex-Burberry executive in charge of retail. An embarrassing and strategic fail on so many levels, and I'm not in the least surprised at the recent fitness/value repositioning that's taken place. Finally, the emperor's lack of attire has been acknowledged. I only wish that extended into other areas at Apple.

People shopping in the true luxury market tend to purchase things like jewelry and watches that will retain their value. Just because they may have a lot of money doesn't mean they will waste it. The Apple watch doesn't fit that category and no smart watch ever will. Rating: 8 Votes firewire9000 3 days ago at 11:54 pm Can we change the name of this website to MacHaters.com? Thank you.

(AAPL) has filed a $1 billion lawsuit against Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) on Friday, accusing the chipmaker of charging royalties for technologies it has nothing to do with and for not paying about $1 billion in promised rebates. According to Apple, the maker of iPhones, as it innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays and cameras, Qualcomm collects royalties for no reason and thus, it becomes more expensive for Apple to fund these innovations. Apple accused Qualcomm of charging it at least five times in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors that Apple has agreements with combined. Qualcomm is a key supplier of modem chips to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co. (SMSN.L,SSNNF.OB,SSNLF.OB). "To protect this business scheme Qualcomm has taken increasingly radical steps, most recently withholding nearly $1B in payments from Apple as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them," Apple said in a statement. "We are extremely disappointed in the way Qualcomm is conducting its business with us and unfortunately after years of disagreement over what constitutes a fair and reasonable royalty we have no choice left but to turn to the courts," Apple added. Qualcomm responded on Saturday by saying that Apple's claims are "baseless". Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm said, "Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm's business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information." "We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple's practices and a robust examination of the merits," Rosenberg added. Apple's lawsuit comes after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or FTC said earlier this week that it filed a lawsuit, charging Qualcomm with using anticompetitive tactics to maintain its monopoly in the supply of a key semiconductor device used in cell phones and other consumer products. In December 2016, the Korea Fair Trade Commission or KFTC fined Qualcomm about 1.03 trillion South Korean won or about $865 million, saying it found certain of Qualcomm's business practices in violation of Korean competition law. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News The Top Green Companies on Earth Killer Wheels: RTT's Top 10 Vehicles of 2016 5 Numbers To Remember The Legendary Jack Nicklaus 1986 Masters Win Corporate News Texas Instruments Promotes Brian Crutcher To COO - Quick Facts Intuitive Surgical Announces $2.0 Bln Accelerated Share Repurchase - Quick Facts Intuitive Surgical Inc.

Nelson01/27/2016 Zagg’s newest case, the SlimBook for Apple’s iPad Pro ($140, Zagg.com), aims to turn Apple’s biggest tablet into a notebook, replete with keyboard and color-changing, backlit keys. Is it worth the relatively high cost? Find out in our review below. Advertisement The iPad Pro is Apple’s biggest tablet yet, and while it’s not the biggest tablet out there, it holds its own with a 12.9-inch display. It’s actually bigger than some of Apple’s more traditional notebooks, like the 12-inch MacBook with Retina display, 11.6-inch MacBook Air, heck, it’s about as large as the 13.3-inch MacBook Air. I point out all of this to say that the idea of a keyboard case for the iPad Pro is a good one. Smaller keyboards just aren’t good This is in contrast to keyboard solutions offered for smaller iPads like the iPad Air or iPad Mini. An admittedly personal opinion, but I type a lot and have always found those smaller keyboards to be an ultimately unsatisfactory experience – perhaps they’re fine for penning a short note or email, but if you have to do a lot of work, they’re frustrating. When Zagg offered to send me their SlimBook for the iPad Pro, then, I was actually pretty excited to try it out. One of the reasons I’d bought the iPad Pro in the first place was the promise of a lighter, more portable computer that could do light work when I needed, and be the more traditional, consumption-friendly iPad when I didn’t. Advertisement Read: The Best iPad Pro Keyboard Advertisement Let’s talk about the physical design of the SlimBook. Zagg does a pretty good job of packaging, and in the box you’ll find a shallow case for the rear of your iPad Pro, the keyboard base itself, and a micro USB cable for charging the keyboard base. You shouldn’t need to charge it very often, as Zagg is promising two years or more of battery life if you use the keyboard for about an hour a day. I can’t speak to whether that’s accurate, but I pounded away at the keyboard pretty often since it came in a few weeks ago, and I’ve never bothered to plug it in – take from that what you will.Zagg designed the SlimBook without using the new 3-pin Smart Connector found on the left-hand side of the new iPad, so they didn’t bother trying to use the magnets on that side of the tablet, either. Instead, one side of the iPad cover is much thicker than the other; there are two holes here that slot onto tabs sticking out from the keyboard’s hinge. It’s a secure fit, and lets you change the angle of the display simply by pushing back and forth on the iPad Pro, just like you would with a typical laptop. It feels just like a normal laptop The keyboard base looks and feels just like a laptop. The plastics used don’t feel very expensive – they feel more like a cheap laptop – but this isn’t really a ding, as the whole case isn’t very expensive. You get a standard “chiclet” style keyboard, with special iOS buttons: there are special buttons for the home button, a lock button, a button to bring up multitasking, a button to engage Siri, a button to switch keyboards (if you have multiple keyboards installed – if you don’t, this button does nothing), a button to bring up and dismiss the on-screen keyboard, and buttons to control media features like volume and playback.There are also a few buttons that only affect the SlimBook keyboard. You can check the battery life, turn the brightness of the key backlights up and down, cycle between the various colors, and switch connected devices. What that last feature means is that the keyboard supports being paired with up to three different Bluetooth devices at the same time (historically, you’d have to delete a Bluetooth keyboard from a device and repair it with another if you wanted to switch); all you need to do is tap the function (fn) key + 1, 2, or 3 to have the keyboard swap around. The keyboard itself is pretty great – it feels like any other good laptop keyboard. There’s a suitable amount of key travel (how far the key goes down when you press it), and there’s essentially zero flexing with normal typing. The keyboard backlighting is good, especially when viewed from straight above; if you have it a little in front of you, you can see the bright LEDs peeking out from the bottom edge. I know that color-changing keyboard backlights are an everyday thing nowadays, but I still get a big kick out of changing them around from time to time. It’s a fun feature.Like the Microsoft Surface Book, the Zagg Slim Book also supports several “2-in-1” display modes – keyboard mode, like a normal laptop, case mode, which separates the tablet and keyboard, video mode, which turns the display around at an angle, and tablet mode, which is pretty self-explanatory. So – good keyboard, fun backlights, included rear case, multiple connections…this sounds great! What’s the catch? Advertisement There’s definitely a catch, and it’s a big one. Well, it’s a heavy one, anyway. My aching back… Zagg’s SlimBook for iPad Pro is ridiculously heavy. The iPad Pro weighs 711g on its own (officially, it’s 713g, but we’ll go with our scale’s results to compare it to the case), which is as heavy as the original, first-generation iPad. But the SlimBook weighs quite a bit more – 1064g all by itself. That’s actually 16% heavier than the 12-inch MacBook with Retina display, which is frankly shocking – there’s no need for big batteries or electronics in the keyboard case. Taken together, it means you could be hauling around 1776g, or just shy of four pounds. Zagg SlimBook for iPad Pro on left, iPad Pro with Apple Smart Keyboard on right. Whether you should buy the SlimBook comes down to how you will use the keyboard. I’ll say it flat out – if you want a keyboard to take everywhere with you, this is simply not it. Apple’s Smart Keyboard is a much better option, as it doesn’t cost too much more and weighs less than a third of the Zagg (in fairness, since it uses the Smart Connector, it doesn’t need its own battery, and it’s also missing features like a backlit keyboard). If you want something that will live on a desk or table, however, the SlimBook becomes much more attractive. It’s easy to imagine leaving it in one spot at home or work, and slotting the iPad Pro into the hinge whenever you need to sit down and type – when you’re on the go, you can just grab the iPad and head out.Compounding the problem is the way the iPad sits in the keyboard dock. As I mentioned earlier, it relies on tabs that mount into holes in the rear iPad case. On its own, it makes the iPad Pro feel a a fair bit bulkier than I’d like, but it fits so tightly that it’s not something you’ll want to take off every day – I was actually a little worried about damaging the iPad when putting it on and taking it off. That’s not really a complaint, as it means you won’t have to worry about it popping off, but it’s a little too thick for me to want to leave it on all the time, and its use is required if you want to dock the iPad in the keyboard stand. Advertisement If you’re looking for something to use at a desk, the Zagg SlimBook for iPad Pro is actually a pretty pleasant experience, and it comes with three months of free Evernote Premium – a draw for fans of the cloud-based, note-taking service. At $140, it compares favorably to options from Logitech (their CREATE keyboard with Smart Connector is $150) and Apple (the Apple Smart Keyboard is $170) – and it’s worth pointing out that those alternatives are only usable with the iPad Pro, while the Slim Book keyboard can be used with any Bluetooth device. If you’re looking for something to take on the go, however, I’d recommend waiting until version 2: with a little refinement, the SlimBook for iPad Pro could turn into something truly great.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Apple Updates QZSS, Japanese GPS Support, In iPhone 7 And 7 Plus By Ali Salman Jan 18, 2017 10Shares Share Tweet Submit The iPhone 7 and its bigger variant were launched in September of last year, bringing quite a handful of internal variations while keeping the same design element. Now, the company has updated its websites for the two iPhone models in Japan, adding QZSS support (Quasi Zenith Satellite System). QZSS is a Japanese satellite positioning system that aims to improve location based features in the region compared to conventional GPS. Let’s see some more details on the updated addition. Apple Updates Its Website With QZSS Support For iPhone 7/7 Plus Users In Japan At this stage, there’s no news whether the region is already making use of the QZSS support. However, Apple’s website now adds the system to the two, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models along with Apple Watch Series 2. In addition to this, the website also notes that the QZSS system support is limited to iPhone versions sold in Japan. It is also referred to as the ‘Japanese GPS’ by its developer. It basically works alongside the standard GPS system in an attempt to provide accurate and faster positioning abilities. Complements GPS for a satellite positioning service that is more precise and stable… QZSS can be used in an integrated way with GPS, bringing the number of satellites to eight or more (six GPS satellites and three QZS) and making stable, high-precision positioning possible. QZS are compatible with GPS and receivers can be procured at a low cost, so it is expected that position information businesses utilizing geographical and spatial information will be developed. The newly added support for QZSS in iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will allow users in Japan to make use of significantly faster positioning in contrast to the standard GPS. The system is currently operating but an immediate improvement is yet to be seen in user’s  experience of the system. According to the QZSS website, the company plans to launch more satellites next year at which it claims that “three satellites will be visible at all times from locations in the Asia-Oceania regions.” Moreover, a seven satellite operation will be launched later on for “accurate position information even in urban areas and mountainous regions.” Advertisement The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are very capable smartphones of 2016 and still lives up to their name. We will probably hear more on the updated support in the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, so be sure to stay tuned for that. iPhone 6SE Name Once Again Shows on iPhone Packaging – Is Apple Really Sticking to This Name?

Apple has followed in the Federal Trade Commission’s footsteps by suing Qualcomm for $1 billion for “royalties that they had nothing to do with,” according to a report from CNBC. The Cupertino company claims Qualcomm demanded onerous terms for the use of its patented technology and even sought to punish Apple for cooperating in a South Korean regulatory probe that dove into Qualcomm’s licensing practices — practices that are now under the microscope once again. More: Federal Trade Commission hits Qualcomm with a lawsuit over its licensing practices Apple’s documents also mentioned that Qualcomm required Apple pay a percentage of the selling price of the iPhone in return for the use of Qualcomm patents and demanded that Apple use exclusively Qualcomm chips between 2011 and 2016. While Apple did get so-called “quarterly rebates” under the agreement, Qualcomm began withholding those rebates when Apple agreed to work with the Korean Fair Trade Commission. According to the suit, Qualcomm even told Apple that Apple had forfeited almost $1 billion in rebates by working with regulators. “We are extremely disappointed in the way Qualcomm is conducting its business with us and unfortunately after years of disagreement over what constitutes a fair and reasonable royalty we have no choice left but to turn to the courts,” Apple said in a statement. Qualcomm responded to Apple’s lawsuit by calling its claims “baseless.” “While we are still in the process of reviewing the complaint in detail, it is quite clear that Apple’s claims are baseless,” according to Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel at Qualcomm. “Apple has intentionally mis-characterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing program.” Rosenberg said Apple has been “encouraging regulatory attacks” on Qualcomm with meritless claims and by withholding information. The chipset manufacturer is referring to the Korean Fair Trade Commission, which placed a hefty $853 million fine on Qualcomm in December for its alleged anti-competitive practices. Like the FTC lawsuit, Qualcomm said it would fight the fine. It’s possible this could be a long and brutal legal battle, like the one between Apple and Samsung. We’ll keep this article updated with more information as we find out more. Article originally published in January. Updated on 01-22-2017 by Julian Chokkattu: Added Qualcomm’s response.

Primary sources. Global perspective. advertisement Apple files $1 billion suit against Qualcomm over royalty charges Saturday 21 January 2017 at 10:45 AM ET by Steven Wildberger ©  WikiMedia (Tyler Love) [JURIST] Technology giant Apple [corporate website] filed suit [complaint, PDF] against Qualcomm [corporate website] on Friday seeking $1 billion in damages, alleging that the chip manufacturer demanded unfair terms for use of its technology. In a statement [Forbes report], Apple alleged that Qualcomm, despite being only one of many manufacturers involved in the production of Apple's iPhone, insisted on onerous and allegedly illegal prices for technology. Apple's complaint, filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of California [official website], also alleges that Qualcomm took punitive measures against it when Apple cooperated in a South Korean investigation, stating "to protect this business scheme Qualcomm has taken increasingly radical steps, most recently withholding nearly $1B in payments from Apple as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them." The Apple lawsuit also follows closely behind a suit [press release] filed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), based on Qualcomm's status as the main supplier of modem chips that enable phones to connect to cellular networks. As such, the company has collected licensing fees on nearly every cell phone utilized worldwide, which the FTC alleges is the perpetuation of an illegal monopoly. Qualcomm responded to Apple's complaint, stating that "it is quite clear Apple's claims are baseless," and responded [press releases] to the FTC complaint, stating that it is based on bad law and significant "misconceptions." In particular, the FTC alleges [JURIST report] that Qualcomm, a leading supplier of baseband processors, imposed onerous conditions and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers. According to the FTC, Qualcomm requires cellphone manufacturers to agree to license terms which would require paying higher royalty fees to Qualcomm if the manufacturer uses a competitor's device and that the company refuses to provide licenses for competitors. The company has faced several other anti-trust lawsuits over the last decade. In December 2008 the US Court of Appeals affirmed a 2007 ruling in part, and vacated in part, against Qualcomm, finding its patents unenforceable [JURIST report]. The court found that by not disclosing relevant intellectual property rights, Qualcomm was engaging in what is known as "patent hold-up" in an effort to prevent competitors from implementing the technology. Broadcom sued Qualcomm in federal court in 2008 asking the court to declare several Qualcomm patents exhausted and unenforceable. That suit was dismissed [JURIST report] in federal court the following year. Also in 2009, a district court dismissed [JURIST report] a consumer class action lawsuit against Qualcomm which claimed that it used patent licensing to adversely affect competition in the CDMA market.

Babies at 64? Now that's what I call progress  By Rachel Johnson for The Mail on Sunday Published: 20:52 EST, 21 January 2017 | Updated: 20:52 EST, 21 January 2017 e-mail 71 View comments Tonight, the BBC is breaking with all past convention, and even making a little history, with its latest Sunday night drama.  Yes (yes yes), Auntie is showing a woman over 50 called Yvonne having sex (inevitably deemed ‘steamy’) in the nether regions of the Palace of Westminster (up against the wall in the crypt chapel). Emily Watson, 50, the actress who plays Yvonne in Apple Tree Yard, has given many breathy interviews about ‘Sex and the Middle-Aged Woman’ and panting features with variants of the title ‘Sex After 50: It’s Fabulous’ have been spattered across all outlets. The BBC will show a woman over 50 having sex in new show Apple Tree Yard In The Times, ‘Anna’ (a writer of 56 too coy to write under her own name) says the drama ‘appears to be about to let the world know that women of a certain age are not on the sexual slag heap’. Hold the front page! As seen exclusively on screen tonight: women my age are not dead from the waist down! In fact, as ‘Anna’ goes on, the very fact that they are unlikely to produce children from these later-life liaisons means they can have carefree, no-strings rumpy, without any dragging undercurrents about kids and commitment.  Which brings us neatly to the next shocking development of last week. A stunningly attractive and successful acquaintance of mine, Dame Julia Peyton Jones, 64, has brought her own gorgeous daughter, Pia, into the world in sunny California in the Land of the Free, where, as we know, anything is possible. Again, the front pages were cleared in honour of a woman doing something at her advanced age that chaps routinely do until the cows come home, or at least until they’re carried out feet first.

Share this article Share I’m delighted – not just for Julia, but for all of us, because it’s another baby step in the right direction. My beloved only daughter is named Charlotte Millicent, after her distant ancestor Millicent Fawcett and my mother, whose maiden name was Charlotte Fawcett.  Dame Millicent, as you might know, was leader of the National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies, and February next year marks 100 years since her fight to help win women the right to vote succeeded – but only so long as they were aged 30 or older. An equal franchise was another decade in coming. That was nearly a hundred years ago, but the truth remains that in 2017, women are still constrained and defined by their age – and by the age they live in – to a far greater extent than men are. It comes as Dame Julia Peyton Jones aged 64 announced the birth of her daughter, Pia, in California  It may sound a small thing, but newspapers almost always publish women’s ages, but not men’s, within the same piece. A man’s age is not seen as relevant – but a woman’s age is paramount. When it comes to sex and babies, nobody in their right mind would ever bother to register the numberless men who continue to have sex and babies after the age of 50, would they? But there’s no end of hoo-ha when a woman is bold enough to go for a knee-trembler in a drama series – or a baby – in her 50s or 60s, even though science has long enabled us to push nature’s boundaries. Basically, women over 50 are still supposed to be tending to roses and grandchildren. The BBC may be breaking with that convention tonight, but a certain genteel prudery still rules the national airwaves. ‘If Yvonne was a man, I think we would definitely have been allowed to film in the Houses of Parliament, which I think says a lot about gender politics,’ Watson says. (The production had to film the saucy scenes elsewhere.) We don’t need Apple Tree Yard to ‘reveal’ that sexuality and desire, for children and sex, doesn’t die within us as we age. But real change will only come when the living, breathing proof of that desire in women doesn’t make headlines.   Jennifer Lopez had a ‘Sharon Stone’ moment at an awards ceremony last week while clad in a very brief, tight leather skirt – more a belt, really – and gave the audience an eyeful. Jennifer Lopez (pictured) appeared at an awards ceremony in a very tight leather skirt  Upon further investigation, I discovered there is an entire industry online devoted to indecent ‘upskirt’ pictures of the actress.  It made me wonder – does a day go by when Jenny from the Block ever forgets NOT to put on pants?   In Revenge Body, Khloe Kardashian’s new show on E!, tubbies get hot bods, and it’s a journey and everyone cries. I have only one problem with the format. A ‘revenge body’ isn’t getting buff to show your ex what he’s missing.  Khloe Kardashian (pictured) has a new show on E! called Revenge Body  ... but maybe we need a show called Revenge Face?  Surely, it’s when you commit to a normal-sized person and then they double in size – and there’s nothing you can say without sounding vile. Most of us are now obese. I propose, therefore, that wedding vows should include ‘for fatter, for thinner’, alongside ‘in sickness and in health’ as a precaution. PS note to TV execs: why not commission a companion series called Revenge Face? It could showcase people who have ‘work’, suddenly don’t look like themselves at all, and expect loved ones to welcome their new shiny, scary, melted-candle visages.   The two most bizarre TV events of my lifetime: the Moon landings and President Trump’s inauguration – both, of course, US productions.  Well, America may be great again but it’s not a patch on us when it comes to public ceremonial.  As Trump delivered his address, rain made a soggy shredded wheat of his hair, and scores of uniformed servicemen scampered around behind him.  Then a woman wandered down the red and blue carpet behind him with an umbrella. Honestly. Nothing so sloppy would happen at a Wimbledon trophy presentation!  Forget our unmatched state occasions – anything that the All England Lawn Tennis Club does is far crisper, smarter, and more impressive.   Share or comment on this article e-mail Most watched News videos How to make a stick drawing magically come to life with water Social experiment to test reaction to Trump supporter in New York City Angry motorists push car after being blocked in on private drive Dog is cut free after being chained up for FIFTEEN years Bear the dog visits the beach for first time after rescue Piers Morgan goes on rant about Ewan McGregor cancelling interview CCTV captures moment British man is shot dead in car in Pattaya Woman booted off plane after ranting at Trump supporter Man tells Polish woman to 'go back to her country' in rant ISIS video 'shows drone dropping bombs on targets near Mosul' Gov.

PHOTO: REUTERS SEOUL: The world’s biggest smartphone maker Samsung blamed faulty batteries on Monday for the fires that led to last year’s humiliating recall of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 device. Samsung Electronics was forced to discontinue the smartphone, originally intended to compete with Apple’s iPhone, after a chaotic recall that saw replacement devices also catching fire. The debacle cost the South Korean company billions in lost profit and reputational damage, in a torrid period which has also seen it embroiled in the corruption scandal that has resulted in President Park Geun-Hye’s impeachment. Internal and independent investigations “concluded that batteries were found to be the cause of the Note 7 incidents”, Samsung said in a statement. Samsung to disable Note 7 phones via software update “We sincerely apologise for the discomfort and concern we have caused to our customers,” Koh Dong-Jin, the head of its mobile business, told reporters in Seoul. Samsung Electronics is the most prominent unit of the giant Samsung group, South Korea’s largest conglomerate with a revenue equivalent to about a fifth of the country’s GDP. It announced a recall of 2.5 million units of the oversized Galaxy Note 7 in September 2016 after several devices exploded or caught fire, with the company blaming batteries from a supplier, widely believed to be its sister firm Samsung SDI. When replacement phones — with batteries from another firm, largely thought to be Chinese manufacturer ATL — also started to combust, the company eventually decided to kill off the Note 7 for good. As many as 1.9 million of the phones were sold in the United States, where authorities banned the device from use on planes and even from being placed in checked luggage. Aviation authorities around the world issued similar prohibitions. The firm has since embarked on a campaign to restore its battered reputation, issuing repeating apologies and putting full-page advertisements in prominent US newspapers including the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Washington Post admitting that it “fell short” on its promises. After Samsung Note 7, now Galaxy S7 also exploding? The next model in the series, the Galaxy Note 8, had been expected to be unveiled at next month’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, but Koh said it would be delayed to ensure that it had no safety issues. Samsung deployed around 700 researchers and engineers on its investigation, testing more than 200,000 fully-assembled devices and more than 30,000 batteries, it said. It did not identify the battery makers on Monday, but independent investigators UL and Exponent agreed with the findings. Battery A had a design issue that pushed down the right corner of the battery, while Battery B had defective internal welds, said Kevin White, principal scientist at Exponent. But Koh dismissed the possibility of suing the manufacturers. “Whatever parts we use, the overall responsibility falls to us for failing to verify its safety and quality,” he said. “At this point, I don’t think it’s right to seek legal action. Around 1,000 different parts from some 450 suppliers were needed for each Galaxy Note 7. PHOTO COURTESY: SAMSUNG Samsung acknowledged that it provided the specifications for the batteries, adding in its statement: “We have taken several corrective actions to ensure this never happens again. The lessons of the past several months are now deeply reflected in our processes and in our culture.” Samsung might start selling refurbished Galaxy Note 7 devices The fiasco took a major toll on the reputation of the firm, which is set to announce fourth-quarter and full-year results on Tuesday. It has estimated the cost of the recall at $5.3 billion, according to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency. Samsung Electronics shares were up 0.5 percent at 1.87 million won in Seoul on Monday morning after the announcement. The firm has separately been caught up in South Korea’s wide-ranging political corruption scandal, with prosecutors last week seeking the arrest of its vice-chairman Lee Jae-Yong on charges of bribery, embezzlement and perjury. Lee, who became Samsung’s de facto head after his father suffered a heart attack in 2014, is accused of bribing Choi Soon-Sil, Park’s secret confidante at the centre of the scandal, and receiving policy favours from Park in return. Samsung is the single biggest contributor to two non-profit foundations controlled by Choi, but a court rejected the arrest request on grounds of insufficient evidence.

Do you suffer from nomophobia? January 23, 2017 09:53 IST Most people have this permanent nervousness about somebody separating them from their smartphones, says Shyamal Majumdar. Illustration: Uttam Ghosh/Rediff.com Apple may be celebrating 10 years of the launch of iPhone, but a friend who holds a senior position at a multinational company, hasn't quite got into the mood. His ire is directed at smartphones in general. Exasperated at the sight of his teammates frequently staring into their smartphones, even during important meetings, he was forced to find a novel way out. Before the daily morning meetings start, the giant screen behind him shows various slides. One just says, 'We live in the era of smartphones and stupid people'; another shows the visual of a couple on a rollercoaster ride looking intently at their phones; yet another shows two characters in heaven pointing at a few others and saying, 'Most of the new arrivals are incapable of conversation. They just stare at their hands in despair.' The friend says the effect hasn't been encouraging: People get fidgety and some of them take frequent breaks. He wonders what will happen once those billions of embedded cellular modules keep chattering through wearable phones -- in wristwatches, even spectacle frames. He isn't alone. Despite the obvious benefits of smartphones -- after all, they have brought an unprecedented level of convenience to our lives -- they have taken a heavy toll on the work-life balance. In fact, the use of smartphones to stay connected to work 24/7 is so common that it's now considered the new normal. So the phones nestle in pockets and sit by bedside tables. Most busy executives check their smartphones every five to 10 seconds and many feel guilty for depriving their team members of all the interesting things they have to say or text or tweet, without realising that they may have become victims of what clinical psychologists call 'nomophobia' -- a permanent nervousness about somebody separating them from their phones. A senior executive says he looks forward to his long drive from office to home as he can concentrate on working on the route. Even while on holidays, he reckons a few 'firefighting' business calls are unavoidable. There are many like him. They get anxious if there’s no Wi-fi in the hotel or mobile phone signal up the mountain. They fret if their phones get low on power, and secretly worry that things will go wrong at work if they are not there. These are the typical signs of 'always on' stress induced by smartphone addiction. Many of us are checking texts and emails first thing in the morning and last thing at night. A study by the Centre for Creative Leadership found that professionals, managers and executives who carry smartphones for work, report interacting with work 13.5 hours every workday (72 hours a week, including weekend work). The study also found that, on average, they have only about three hours on workdays for 'discretionary' activities such as being with their family, exercising, showering and all those chores at home that someone has to do. 'Startlingly, they don't blame technology for this dilemma that has them scrambling to manage their personal lives.' That's why many people are fatigued and angry about being 'always on' and never done, the line between their personal and professional lives blurred if not eliminated. The most dangerous thing is to fall into a mode of permanent activity and continuously consult one's smartphone to see whether any new mails have come in. Other research on occupational stress has revealed how the smartphone sitting on our nightstand impairs our sleep and makes it impossible to detach from work owing to its invasive, 'always on' nature. Many people, who use their smartphones for work-related communications, tend to have a difficult time psychologically detaching from their jobs. This, in turn, makes them vulnerable to work-related exhaustion, leading to more burned-out employees, who are exhausted and cynical. Thankfully, smart employers are realising that they won't retain their best workers if they treat them like a 24-hour concierge service. The final call to take advantage of the incredible benefits that smartphones bring lies with you, by being disciplined about its usage. So, if you're getting ready to go on a holiday, set up those 'out of office' email alerts and switch off your phone when you go to bed. After all, you are rarely the only who can resolve issues. They can do without a 'smart' call from you.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 23 January 2017 | MYT 11:37 AM Apple files US$1bil lawsuit against chip supplier Qualcomm Big player: Qualcomm supplies modem chips to Apple and Samsung. — Reuters REUTERS: Apple Inc filed a US$1bil (RM4.44bil) lawsuit against supplier Qualcomm Inc, days after the US government accused the chip maker of resorting to anticompetitive tactics to maintain a monopoly over key semiconductors in mobile phones. Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for "modem" chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40% of Qualcomm's US$23.5bil (RM104.3bil) in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. In the lawsuit filed in US District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some US$1bil (RM4.44bil) in promised rebates. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm withheld the rebates because of Apple's discussions with South Korea's antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission. "If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm's release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused," Apple said in its lawsuit. In a statement, Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg called Apple's claims "baseless." "Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information," Rosenberg said in the statement. "We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits.” Qualcomm has patents for chips which include standard essential patents, a term used to describe technology that is required to be licensed broadly and on "reasonable" terms. In its lawsuit, Apple accused Qualcomm of refusing to license the technology to other manufacturers to prevent them from making the chips. It also accused Qualcomm of selling chips while requiring Apple to pay a separate licensing fee for the same chips, in a "no license, no chip" policy. In addition, Qualcomm pressured network carriers to not sell or support Apple devices made with Intel chipsets Apple said. The KFTC fined Qualcomm US$854mil (RM3.7bil) in December for what it called unfair patent licensing practices. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a US$975mil (RM4.3bil) fine in China, while the European Union in Dec 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. On Tuesday, the US Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, saying the San Diego-based company used its dominant position as a supplier of certain phone chips to impose "onerous" supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers. Qualcomm said it would contest the FTC complaint. Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modem chips for Apple’s phones until the release of the iPhone 7 in September. Intel Corp supplied about half of the modem chips for the newest models, said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Intel's shares closed up 1% after the Qualcomm suit was announced. Apple made the move around the same time that Samsung, which had switched to using its own internal chips for its Galaxy S6 phones, returned to Qualcomm for the Galaxy S7. Qualcomm "has been able to manage through (the Apple contract loss) pretty well because they got back Samsung at the same time," Rasgon said. Apple is known for seeking multiple suppliers to keep prices down, said Jim Morrison, vice president of technical intelligence for TechInsights, which tears down devices to analyse their parts. —  Reuters You May Be Interested Yahoo beats Wall Street view, sees Verizon deal closing in second quarter Bring cheer to the underprivileged this festive season Time to say goodbye TM offers free speed upgrade – do you qualify?

I was in Taipei for Computex. I'd just walked into a group press conference ready to take notes and transcribe. I opened up my Macbook Air and ... half the screen was blank. In between interviews, my screen died. So like many people, I waited most of 2016 hoping Apple would announce a serviceable replacement for the Macbook Air. But they never did. So over the last month, I've been using Razer's similarly-priced answer: the latest Razer Blade Stealth laptop. What Is It? Image: Kotaku/Alex Walker Unlike the gaming focused, and vastly more expensive Blade Pro, the Blade Stealth is an ultrabook targeted at students, creative professionals and other industries in the market for a "productivity" device. Starting from $1499.95 for the 128GB model with 16GB DDR4 RAM and a 12.5" 1440p display, the Blade Stealth ranges up to $3000 for the model with a 4K screen and 1TB of storage. You're venturing into Blade Pro territory there, however, so it's really a laptop aimed at those considering a Macbook Air or a Surface Pro. The pitch is that you're paying about the same amount for the Razer Blade Stealth, but you're getting much more modern hardware. The baseline model comes with Intel's latest Kaby Lake processor, the i7-7500U CPU (2.7GHz/3.5GHz) with the integrated HD Graphics 620. There's 2 USB 3.0 ports on the laptop and a Thunderbolt-3 USB-C port, which doubles as the laptop's charging port. Extra benefits include Bluetooth 4.1 support, touch screens on all models, built-in webcam, speakers, a HDMI 2.0a port, a 3.5mm microphone/headphone combo jack, a 64-bit install of Windows 10 and wireless functionality. All models come with a IGZO panel for the screen, although only the 4K Blade Stealth screens will support 100% Adobe RGB (the baseline models are only rated at 70% Adobe RGB, which photographers and editors might want to consider). The whole unit weighs 1.29kg and is 1.31cm x 32.1cm x 20.6cm, which is delightfully small. It's not the smallest ultrabook you can find, particularly given what was shown at CES this year, but it travels easily enough. The 12.5" screen is also just the right size that you can pull the Blade Stealth out on the train or bus and continue working without having to worry too much about the seat in front of you, although it's a fraction too large for those hoping to do a bit of red-eye typing in cattle class. Razer's also bundled in support for their Chroma lighting software so you can get a funky rave going on your keyboard, although more on that later. What's It Good At? Image: Kotaku/Alex Walker Intel's integrated graphics have come a long way. While the HD 620 is no match for some of last year's beefiest titles, like DOOM or Battlefield 1, you can get around 30fps in Overwatch if you play at 720p and turn the resolution scale down a bit. Other games, like Civilization 5 and Stardew Valley, are perfectly playable. And if you dabble in a bit of Dota 2 or League of Legends, you'll be able to get through a match without screaming at the monitor. The gaming power is really just a bonus, though. The Blade Stealth is all about productivity first, with a bit of gaming on the end. And it's a great laptop for typing on, once you become accustomed to the reduced profile of the keys. It's not a mechanical keyboard, but it's comfortable enough after long typing sessions. The Razer Synapse software is more than just lighting profiles though. It's disabled by default, but you can enable Synapse to track how many keys you've pressed, the average keystroke distance, how many macros you use, and it maintains stats for individual games as well. It'll track your mouse movement in game too, which is probably more helpful for the Blade laptops with discrete GPUs than it is the Blade Stealth. And the core aspect of any laptop, especially one with the Macbook Air in its sights, is the quality of the trackpad. It's not as good as Apple's creation - few are - but it's accurate enough, especially after you bump up the default sensitivity by a couple of notches. It's not quite as clever when it comes to detecting your palms, which results in some "Where's Waldo's Mouse Cursor" moments. But as far as a Windows-powered trackpad goes, it's serviceable enough. And the 45W supplied USB-C charger is also reasonably small, which is a hugely helpful considering you'll never want to leave home without it. Oh and while some might argue that laptops are all about the hardware, the Blade Stealth is a real stylish piece of hardware. People don't often buy laptops for the look, but the Blade Stealth is pleasing on the eye, especially when the keyboard and back logo have that soft, green glow. (Or whatever other colour you prefer.) What's It Not Good At? Images: Razer Kaby Lake might be the epitome of Intel's 14nm processors, but if you were hoping for the glory days of 12, 13, 14 hours battery life you're gonna have a bad time. With the Chroma lighting going, the in-built network manager for the Killer wireless card and the automatically enabled Dolby Digital Plus software, the Blade Stealth chews up battery fast. Playing a game or watching a video will drain your battery in a couple of hours. When typing, editing photos and doing my regular day job, the standard battery life was around six hours. The USB-C port can also be used to power Razer's separate graphics dock, the Razer Core. Problem is, the Razer Core isn't available in Australia. And even when it is, you're still paying hundreds of dollars for a basically a dock that houses a GPU, which you have to either purchase or have automatically lying around. (And most people don't have spare GPUs chilling in their closet.) As much as Razer wants to pitch the Blade Stealth as a gaming device, the HD 620 isn't really that practical as an all-round gaming laptop. Games released in the last couple of years will generally hit around the 30fps mark, which isn't the sort of performance you'd want for twitch shooters or games relying on fast reaction times (like a F1 2016). If you stick to indie titles, and older AAA games (think around 2013-2014), you'll be perfectly fine. I praised the trackpad earlier, but something it's not great at is palm recognition. It's all too easy to end up clicking on something accidentally because your hand has brushed over the trackpad mid-sentence. I'd also avoid using the touchscreen if you don't like fingerprints; the glossy surface means you'll be easily reminded of just how greasy your fingers are. Should You Buy It? Image: Razer Before the turn of the year, I strongly considered buying my own Razer Blade Stealth. I wasn't going to pay the several hundred dollars to have the panel on my Macbook Air replaced. I loved that laptop to bits, but Apple hardware costs enough as is the first time around. So I started seriously considering the Razer for two reasons: the Kaby Lake CPU with an integrated GPU, which would be enough for older games like Dungeon of the Endless or Risk of Rain, and the fact that it came in at around the same price point. Getting an i7-7500U with 16GB of RAM for $1500 is a solid deal when you consider the current Dell XPS 13 costs just under $1900, and only has the i5-7200U and 8GB of RAM. The Blade Stealth will also have a faster processor than the XPS 13 2-in-1 model when that becomes available in Australia. The higher end model does outperform the Blade Stealth slightly, as Gizmodo found, but it'll cost you $1614 for a 128GB model with 8GB of RAM. The same version with a 256GB SSD will set you back $1699, and the starting price for an XPS 13 with an i7-7500U is $1954. The extra money isn't really worth it, for me. Not having to deal with the XPS 13's chunky proprietary charger is a plus as well; the Blade Stealth's USB-C charger is relatively small, and it'll only become more versatile in the years to come. It does mean that you can't charge the Blade Stealth and use the USB-C port at the same time, but that issue never cropped up once in my testing. The sticking point for most people will be the battery life. Both the XPS 13 and the Macbook are vastly superior, and it's something you'll need to factor in if you're a regular traveller. But that can be managed by thinking ahead, and you can eek extra juice out of the machine once all the Chroma lighting is disabled. Razer's laptops have always been a joy to use, even if they weren't quite perfect. But the Blade Stealth now has one other notch under its belt: it's reasonably priced, considering the hardware inside and the cost of its competitors. I won't say it's the ultimate ultrabook for gamers who need to work first and play second. But it's satisfying to use, travels well and is neatly designed. That's a good package for $1500, and it's a good looking package at that. Comments labrys @labrys Jan 23, 2017, 3:11pm I've had my eye on the stealth to replace my 2011 MBA when it eventually dies. So this is the perfect review for me. :) Battery life is a bit of an issue but usually my MBA is plugged in so I can probably live with it. I do like Razers pricing structure on this with the only difference between the laptops being the screen and the size of the hard drive. I love my MBA keyboard and trackpad though. The best I have ever used so if Razers aren't in that league it could get annoying quickly. I do love the idea of the Core though. Being able to turn the laptop into a gaming PC by simply plugging it in is fantastic. It means I can get one device to do everything I need. And I have to say I have always had a question mark on Razer's quality. It just always seems to fall a bit short and from reviews on amazon this is the same here which gives me pause in getting one. Reply 0 ted @ted Jan 23, 2017, 7:24pm I was foolish enough to buy a Razer keyboard, mouse, headset and (expensive) mouse pad all in one go a few years back. Never again. Terrible build quality, constant issues with the keyboard especially and Razer support ignored every email I ever sent them. Reply 0 labrys @labrys Jan 24, 2017, 9:09am Yeah I've heard many similar stories. My mate's Razer mouse just died on him and it was only a couple of years old. My Cyber Snipa Striker mouse has lasted me around 7 years with no problems. I don't think the company even exists anymore and the mouse keeps going. My wife bought me a pair of Razer Headphones for Christmas since my Logitech G35s died so I will be interested to see how long these last me. These quality issue stories are what have prevented me getting Razer mice and keyboards in the past. Reply 0 Zombie Process Guest Jan 23, 2017, 10:40pm Funny story - I bought a "New" Razer Blade 2016 while I was attending WWDC in San Francisco last year. I've been an Apple fan since the mid-90s, and even worked for them from 2005-2010. But damn if I was not tired of waiting for something worth while that would replace my 2013 MBP. So I bought the Blade..and I love it. It's not a total MBP replacement, but in some ways it comes close (disregarding battery life, but I have a 12 retina MB for that). And it has no problem playing modern AAA games, which my MBP really won't do. I'm a developer, but increasingly need to work cross platform. The MBP has been good, but the latest versions don't give me enough to warrant the $4000 it would cost. Apple makes great hardware.. or did.. but I wish they'd wake up to the world around them and give us something really compelling. Reply 0 matt1234 @matt1234 Jan 24, 2017, 11:03am Razer laptops are great quality - I've had a Razer blade 14 for about 2 years now and it's left on 24/7. I take it to work and travel both domestic and overseas with it, it is also my only home PC and plugged into my TV for media centre and gaming. I've even upgraded the ssd drive for more storage and installed win 10, I haven't had it stuff up once. The only downsides i will give it is * Noise - when gaming it gets quite noisy, and i mean NOISY (but better that than overheating, and it's quiet during normal use) * Fingerprint magnet Last edited January 24, 2017 11:04 am Reply 0 Matt50 Guest Jan 24, 2017, 12:04pm This looks perfect! for someone who wants 16GB of ram, this looks to work out way cheaper than a mac. just a shame about the battery life. I consider that a critical stat (given it is meant to be a portable computer after all). would be good if they could have a slightly thicker, heavier version with a bigger battery.

Tonight in a live conference, Samsung noted that in their own investigation they found that the cause of the Note7 fires were caused by a short circuit in both batteries. The second investigative body, the UL, concluded in their report that, "In summary, design and manufacture issues with the batteries led to field failures of the Note 7 devices. A third investigative body was Exponent led by Dr. Kevin who noted that "The important take home message was that electronics did not contribute to the failure of either manufacturer's cells."   Our December report provided as much or more of an explanation of the battery problem with the Note7. Considering that only Samsung's Note7 was hit by the battery problem, it seems highly suspect that it was solely the fault of the two different batteries from two different companies and not with a design flaw in the design of the phone.    With that said, the Korea Herald reports tonight: "Samsung's mobile chief and President Koh Dong-jin apologized again and pledged to come up with follow-up measures, including launching a Battery Advisory Group consisting of external experts, to improve battery safety and innovation.   'Today, more than ever, we are committed to earning the trust of our customers through innovation that redefines what is possible in safety, and as a gateway to unlimited possibilities and incredible new experiences,' Koh said in a press conference held at the Seoul headquarters.   Since the phone's global recall issued on Oct. 11, 2016, Samsung has poured all-out efforts to find the exact cause of several fires. About 700 Samsung researchers and engineers replicated the incidents by testing more than 200,000 devices and 30,000 batteries, the company said.   The probe was also joined by several independent expert organizations, including UL, Exponent and TUV Rheinland.   The joint investigation team pinpointed faulty batteries as the cause of the accidents. The Note phone used batteries from two manufacturers -- Korea's Samsung SDI and China's ATL -- that showed different defects.   The graphics below are from the live conference held earlier this evening covering various points made in the Exponent presentation.   Samsung's Mobile Chief DJ Koh Video replay may be available on this site in the future.   During Koh's opening statement he had noted that 96% of all Note7's have been returned to Samsung to date.     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Growth in the quarter ending in December ticked up to 6.8 percent over 2015, supported by government spending and a real estate boom, a gain from the previous quarter’s 6.7 percent, government data showed Friday. Still, for the full year, growth came in at a lackluster 6.7 percent, down from 6.9 percent in 2015 and the weakest since 1990’s 3.9 percent. That temporary upturn is unlikely to last, economists said. Ford Expects $2B Net Income Drop Due to Pension Change DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) – Ford says that a change in the way it values pension obligations will cut its 2016 net income by $2 billion. Ford will record a pretax pension charge of about $3 billion for the year. It says the loss is a special item so it won’t affect adjusted pretax profit. Ford still expects to meet guidance of about $10.2 billion in adjusted pretax profit for last year. Ford Motor Co. reports fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on Thursday. Apple Depicts Qualcomm as a Shady Monopolist in $1b Lawsuit SAN FRANCISCO (AP) – Apple is suing mobile chip maker Qualcomm for $1 billion in a patent fight pitting the iPhone maker against one of its major suppliers. The complaint filed Friday in a San Diego federal court depicts Qualcomm as a monopolist abusing its power in a key segment of the mobile chip market to extort royalties for iPhone innovations that have nothing to do with Qualcomm’s technology. Apple says it has been cooperating with government regulators who have been investigating Qualcomm’s business practices, prompting Qualcomm to retaliate by withholding about $1 billion in scheduled payments. Court: Indian Lending Companies Subject to Federal Probe SAN FRANCISCO (AP) – A federal appeals court says lending companies operated by Native American tribes are subject to investigation by a government regulator. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on Friday rejected a claim by three tribes that their lending companies were protected by tribal sovereignty from investigation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. At issue were for-profit lending companies created by three tribes — the Chippewa Cree, Tunica Biloxi and Otoe Missouria. The Chippewa Cree’s lending company, Plain Green, has been accused of predatory loan practices — a claim that company officials deny. Las Vegas Sands Paying $7M to Settle Corrupt Practices Probe LAS VEGAS (AP) – Las Vegas Sands Corp. will pay almost $7 million to U.S. authorities to end a more than five-year corrupt practices investigation, company and federal officials said Thursday. With the agreement, the company resolved twin probes over more than $60 million paid to an unnamed agent retained in 2006 to acquire a Chinese basketball team, plus other business dealings that include a Beijing real estate deal to promote casinos on the Cotai Strip of Macao. The company wasn’t charged with a crime and did not admit guilt in either case.

The British Accidentally Fired A Ballistic Missile At The U.S. And It's Fine, Everything's Fine Samsung Explains Why The Galaxy Note7 Kept Exploding Campbell Simpson Jan 23, 2017, 11:30am ⋅ Filed to:  Australian Stories feature galaxy note7 note7 samsung samsung galaxy note7 samsung galaxy note7 recall Share Image: Samsung It's time. After more than four months, the world's largest smartphone manufacturer is ready to reveal the exact reason that the Galaxy Note7 — its most advanced smartphone ever, and the year's strongest competitor to Apple's iPhone 7 — was recalled. How To Watch Samsung's Galaxy Note7 Recall Press Conference 11:30AM: Hi everyone! If you're just tuning in, you've got a solid half hour to wait before the actual conference gets underway. The livestream is right here if you want to open it in another tab and watch along. 11:45AM: T-minus 15 minutes, ladies and gentlemen. The stream is up and running — there's even a backup stream in case the original dies. It's pretty clear that Samsung wants this press conference to go off without a hitch. 11:55AM: With five minutes to go, it's worth diving into the numbers just for a bit of context. In the few short weeks between the phone's original launch on August 19 and when sales were halted on September 5, Samsung sold 51,060 Note7s in Australia. Of those 51,060, around 48,500 were returned to the company through the second recall program. That's a recall rate of around 95 per cent, far outstripping the average Aussie recall rate (for any consumer product, from cars to homewares to washing machines) of 56 per cent. The Note7 recall is expected to cost Samsung in the region of $3.4 billion in the six months after it was instituted. There's no value placed on the company's ongoing Galaxy brand performance, though, or the damage that has been done to the goodwill of loyal customers — that'll take years to pan out. 12:00PM: OK, we're off and running. The livestream is up, and we're just running through some housekeeping before the event itself kicks off. 12:02PM: Samsung's DJ Koh, president of the mobile business division, is up on stage to officiate the event. "I deeply apologise to all our customers... and all of our business partners." "We have invested all our efforts and substantial resources over the past several months... in order to fully investigate the issue. We will be sharing the results of our investigation today." Koh is currently giving a brief background of the Note7's lifeline. Two weeks between the phone's initial launch and its first recall. "The device was discontinued globally on October 11th." That's the date of the second and final recall, after phones kept exploding. 96 per cent of about 3 million devices sold and activated have been returned. "We are grateful to Note7 owners... for their help to expedite this process and achieve this exceptional return rate." "We have examined every aspect of the device... including hardware, software, assembly, quality assurance and logistics... were reviewed in detail. To ensure that we encouraged a thorough investigation." 12:07PM: "We built a large scale charge and discharge test facility, where we were able to replicate the incidents from market, and complete a detailed analysis." Samsung also hired "respected industry analysts" to independently verify their results. They'll be speaking in a few minutes. Was fast charging or wireless charging to blame for any of the battery fires? Was it water resistance? Samsung conducted repeated charge and discharge tests with all three of these criteria put to the test — including charging with the back glass battery cover off — in its charge facility. The same is true of Samsung's iris charging tech and the USB Type-C port. Samsung also ran tests on preloaded and downloaded third-party apps, to test whether software was to blame. "None of these tests demonstrated an abnormality or correlation to the reported incidents." Logistics was also put to the test, including tracking the handling of all parts delivered — including the batteries — "in an effort to determine whether there were contributing factors." "Although none of these... presented an abnormality, we have nontheless added additional [steps to improve processes]." 12:11PM: Thousands of complete Note7 devices and batteries were subjected to "repeated charge and discharge tests." Both fully assembled devices and batteries exhibited the same incidence of failure rate of devices in the field. "This indicated that the incidents were caused by the battery cells themselves." Both Battery A from the first recall and Battery B from the second recall had a failure, but different incidents. "Incorrect positioning of the negative electrode tip" was responsible for the failures on Battery A, which caused the initial fires and recall. "Melted copper on negative electrode" on Battery B had caused a short circuit in that area of the battery. An internal short circuit as a result of abnormally high welding bars — from the ultrasonic battery building process — was what caused the second battery's continued issues. Some batteries were also missing insulation tape. 12:15PM: UL is an "independent science and safety organisation", and conducted its own analysis of the Note7 to determine the issue. The same is true of US-based Exponent, which did a "detailed analysis" of hardware and software. The third independent organisation was TUV Rheinland. The first independent business to present its findings is UL's Sajeev Jesudas. "Our mission is to promote safe... living and working environments. We have deep experience with lithium ion batteries." UL's knowledge includes forensic levels of investigation into battery failures. UL tore down and examined 10 damaged Note7 devices with "Company A" batteries, and 110 new Company A batteries, "to identify battery issues." There were signs of internal short circuits on the upper right cells of the batteries. "Multiple contributing factors" were responsible for the Note7's battery failures, says UL. The higher energy density of the Note7's battery — 3500mAh — could have contributed to the severity of each incident. UL's investigation is ongoing into why the deformation of the Note7 batteries from Company A — one of the two major suppliers to Samsung — happened in the first place. Company B, responsible for the replacement batteries, had its batteries and damaged Samsung Note7 devices examined by UL including 10 teardowns and 40 new batteries being disassembled. Multiple short circuits across the battery and missing insulation tape on some cells contributed to those Company B battery failures. The Note7's battery drain from Company B met Samsung's specifications, including maximum temperature, cell voltage and discharge and charge rate. Uneven charge across the battery, internal short circuit, and sharp edges of welding joins within the Company B battery were partly responsible for the "higher possibility of separator puncture" — the kind of thing that short circuits within battery cells. 12:24PM: Higher energy density and thinner cells are, basically, what's to blame for Samsung's Note7 issues. Thinner phones with higher capacity batteries make compromises, and this was one. 12:25PM: Dr Kevin White is now up on stage to give his presentation. He's the Principal Scientist from Exponent in the US. "Two distinctly different failure modes" for each of the Note7's batteries — that's the trend we're seeing in this press conference. "A suite of destructive and non-destructive tests on devices returned from the field... and new devices supplied by Samsung. The proposed root causes are consistent with the... independent and impartial analysis." We're getting an explainer from Exponent on how batteries are assembled, and how interaction of negative and positive electrodes at any point throughout the lithium-ion cell itself. For Company A: "The most likely root cause was determined to unintended damage to the negative electrode windings consistently in the corner of the cell closest to the negative tab." For Company B, the issue was also with the battery, but "a new and distinctly different defect that was not present in the initial investigation." These cells were the ones manufactured after Exponent's initial investigation. Electrode bending — physical damage to the battery — caused damage to the negative electrode and its lithium plating, causing the short circuit. "Remember that all these failures occurred very early in the life of the device." Welding defaults in some incident cells were found to bridge the distance to the negative element, causing short circuits. Dr White: "In some batteries tested, a protective layer [was not installed], likely due to an error in the manufacturing process. In those cases, the incidence of short circuit was higher." "Poor welding causes tall welding defects. Normal swelling forces those welds into the negative electrode. During high states of charge, the heating of the cell causes thermal runaway." And that's the ball game, folks. White is now saying that the battery system, and its electronic safety measures to address issues like short circuits, met or exceeded industry standards, and that Samsung's electronics did not contribute to the failure of either Company A or Company B's battery cells. 12:36PM: Holger Kunz from TUV Rheinland is now on stage to give that company's analysis of the battery issues. TUV's role was to investigate the logistics system — processes of the China and Vietnam battery production lines, and the road transport system from China to Vietnam for those batteries during the devices' final assembly, packaging and distribution. TUV Rheinland's testing and factory assessment ran from November to December, and "showed no detection of relevant weaknesses" in the battery production or transport process. Two pallets of the batteries with instruments measuring acceleration, strain, temperature and humidity were shipped between China and Vietnam, and additional tests for any transport condition — any time, any season of the year — were also run. The batteries passed those tests, suggesting that logistics were not the issue. A total of 650 batteries from the transport and off the production line were tested by TUV Rheinland and passed normal environment and abuse testing. "No specific detection of weakness, concern or obvious danger" from Samsung's processes and workstation in the Vietnam and main Korean assembly line was detected by Samsung, and the tested batteries passed "relevant safety requirements" after road transport. = 12:43PM: Samsung's DJ Koh is back on stage to talk about the company's preventative measures going forward. "Smartphone designs have become more compact, and battery usage has increased." "It was important to support various functionalities, so high battery capacity was among the most important features during product planning." "A higher capacity of 3500mAh [was used in the Note7], in a more compact form than previous Note models. New designs and manufacturing designs and technologies were used." "We are taking responsibility for our failure." Samsung is committed to quality and safety, DJ Koh tells the audience. "Comprehensive preventative measures" have been implemented, says Koh, including internal measures to enhance quality assurance and quality control. "We are building upon our existing quality assurance.. with the addition of teams that are exclusively dedicated to focus on each core component of the device, includign the active re "We have formed a battery advisory group... to ensure we have an objective review of device safety." The advisory group has consulted with Samsung on the Note7, and will continue on future devices. 12:49PM: The group includes professor of chemistry Dr Clare Grey from the University of Cambridge, materials science and engineering professor Dr Gerbrand Ceder from UC Berkeley, and materials science and engineering professor Dr Yi Cui from Stanford, as well as and Dr Toru Amazutsumi, Ph.D from Amaz Techno-Consultant. An 8-point battery safety check will include X-ray and random disassembly at the manufacturers, with additional inspections along the way to assembly. Large-scale charge and discharge testing will be conducted on batteries — including two weeks of continuous use in a "full range of customer scenarios". "We have adopted and provided preventative measures, with improved safety standards for the battery." "A new hardware design means more space around the battery to accommodate a new bracket design to protect against force, even when the device is dropped." We hope this case will serve as an opportunity to improve the safety of lithium ion batteries, not only for us but for the entire industry." Samsung says it is reviewing its plans to share its battery safety procedures with industry standard bodies. "It has been a challenging period for Samsung... and the customers that have trusted us to provide them with safe products." Samsung takes great pride in its ability to listen, learn and improve, it says. "Today, more than ever, we are committed to earning the trust of our customers, through innovation that redefines what is possible in safety." 12:55PM: Samsung's DJ Koh and the independent experts are now taking questions from the audience. 12:57PM: It appears that Samsung has cut the live feed of its press conference at the end of Koh's speech, rather than broadcasting the panel's responses to press questions. Thanks for reading! Now read: Here's a timeline of the short life and long death of the Galaxy Note7, as it happened in the late months of 2016. Samsung's Galaxy Note7 Recall: The Timeline The Samsung Galaxy Note7 was unveiled to the world at an event in New York City on August 3. It went on sale to customers in Australia on August 19. It was praised for its excellent design and futuristic iris scanning biometrics. Sales of the phone were suspended due to battery issues causing devices to overheat and catch fire on September 2, first reported by Gizmodo Australia. That was escalated to a full recall a few days later on September 5. Samsung offered customers the choice of a replacement phone (with a temporary loaner handset in the interim), a refund or exchange to a similar Samsung phone like the S7 Edge, as well as around $250 in incentives which varied depending on the telco or retail store the Note7 was purchased through. Stock of replacement Galaxy Note7s — with the battery issue apparently fixed — arrived in Australia on September 20. Customers who had returned their phone for an exchange were contacted and told they would receive trouble-free units. That stock was distributed to Samsung's customers and carrier partners, until ongoing battery issues and fires with replacement phones forced a second halt of sales and replacements. Samsung Australia repeatedly told customers to switch off both original and replacement Galaxy Note7 phones, and to return them to their place of purchase. he company limited the state of charge of phone batteries to 60 per cent, disabled Gear VR support, and cut it off from Australian mobile networks. Currently, over 95 per cent of Samsung Galaxy Note7s have been returned to Samsung in Australia. Approximately 2500 phones are still at large. This recall rate is far ahead of the average Australian recall return rate, which is around 56 per cent according to a 2013 statement by longtime ACCC chairman Rod Sims. Samsung's 23 January press conference is likely to be the last official conference on the matter, but the issues with the Note7 will continue to affect Samsung's public perception for some time. The impact of the Note7 recall is expected to cost Samsung at least $3.4 billion in the Q4 2016 and Q1 2017 quarters.

I think that this will proof to be a learning experience for most, if not all, designers and manufacturers of similar equipment. Reply 0 ok @ok Jan 23, 2017, 10:30pm Agreed. Reply 0 WaitAMinute Guest Jan 23, 2017, 3:09pm Wasn't Company A Samsung Batteries? I thought I saw somewhere that one of the battery suppliers was a Samsung subsidiary. Reply 0 pepee63 @pepee63 Jan 23, 2017, 5:08pm Yes it was. Company B was a different company. Reply 0 WaitAMinute Guest Jan 23, 2017, 9:36pm So when they keep calling it 'Company A' rather than 'Samsung Batteries' they are being open and honest and taking responsibility. Reply 0 pepee63 @pepee63 Jan 24, 2017, 6:41am They always said the first batch was Samsung batteries. We knew that from the start. Reply 0 WaitAMinute Guest Jan 24, 2017, 8:58am The press conference did not mention this. That would seem to be a deliberate PR strategy to mislead. Note that this article and many other media reports of the press conference have not mentioned that Battery A was a Samsung battery. Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Jan 24, 2017, 9:45am I'm not sure you appreciate how conglomerates and subsidiaries work. The Samsung conglomerate sells electronics, makes clothing, builds ships, sells life insurance, runs an advertising agency and operates a theme park, just to name a few. The only thing Samsung Electronics and Samsung SDI have in common is the name. They have different shares on the stock exchange, different leadership and operations - for all intents and purposes they're separate companies. They have as much in common with each other as Dairy Queen and BNSF Railway do in the US.

You must have the attention span of a goldfish. Reply 1 Campbell Simpson @campbellsimpson AUTHOR Jan 23, 2017, 5:10pm Well heck, pal. Summary: not the phone, but the battery. Two different problems with two different batteries. Batteries were too thin, physical damage + heat = short circuits = thermal runaway = boom. Problem solved for next time with a new hardware design and much better QA for batteries. Reply 1 magani @magani Jan 23, 2017, 11:33pm Also, just possibly having *removable* batteries? Just saying... Reply 0 g-man @g-man Jan 23, 2017, 4:45pm Soo manufacturing defect or poor design? Reply 0 Campbell Simpson @campbellsimpson AUTHOR Jan 23, 2017, 5:11pm Design called for a battery that was too thin for the technology required to create it. Attempting to build those batteries led to manufacturing defects which caused the fires. Reply 0 g-man @g-man Jan 23, 2017, 5:19pm Ahh I see. Maybe a bit of a case of worked fine on the highly calibrated prototyping equipment but not in looser tolerance mass production. Last edited January 23, 2017 5:21 pm Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Jan 23, 2017, 6:58pm The 0.002% failure rate in the wild suggests that it probably would have been difficult to pick up the manufacturing fault in QC. Reply 0 dazzler @dazzler3622 Jan 23, 2017, 10:34pm That's after only a few weeks in the wild though, I'd be interested to know the % of devices which were faulty and would have failed within 1-2 year lifespan if not recalled. If it's over 1% you'd think their QA procedures should've caught it. Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Jan 24, 2017, 6:50am The report seems to indicate a manufacturing defect, not a degradation failure. Time wouldn't matter much if so, and detection would come down to frequency. I mentioned in another article, the typical 'high' standard for manufacturing defects is 25 PPM, and the SDI battery's known failure rate is 20 PPM, so it may not have tripped typical processes, or even been detected at all.. Reply 0 TickTickTick Guest Jan 24, 2017, 8:47am According to ArsTechnica fault in battery B was burr created by poor weld puncturing cell insulation with cyclic cell swelling/contraction from repeat recharge/discharge. This would be a time dependent degradation failure mode. Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Jan 24, 2017, 9:25am The ATL batteries had nothing to do with the initial fault and recall, nor anything to do with Samsung's QC. Reply 0 pepee63 @pepee63 Jan 23, 2017, 5:11pm Good to see it was only the battery. Knowing that, they'll give all the returned stock good batteries, refurbish them and put them out for sale. I'd love a cheap note 7 Reply 0 velt @velt Jan 23, 2017, 6:29pm I doubt it, it was the thinness of the battery that lead to all the manufacturing problems. I don't think they'll risk it again. Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Jan 23, 2017, 7:04pm The investigation into the cause of the Samsung SDI batteries' deformation defects is still underway, according to the article. Koh mentions that a stronger bracket to protect against impact damage is one of the key changes they're introducing so it may not be the thickness of the SDI batteries that was the cause, but rather that they weren't adequately protected within the device. I suppose we'll find out when the UL investigation results are published. Reply 0 pepee63 @pepee63 Jan 24, 2017, 6:40am They'll just add a thinner battery. Why would they throw away perfectly good phones when the only problem was the battery. Doesn't make sense. Reply 0 velt @velt Jan 24, 2017, 12:40pm Because it was the thinness of the battery that was the problem. As Campbell says above: Design called for a battery that was too thin for the technology required to create it. Attempting to build those batteries led to manufacturing defects which caused the fires. You can't fit a better battery into the chasis because it would have to be bigger and wouldn't fit. Reply 0 pepee63 @pepee63 Jan 24, 2017, 2:28pm Sorry you didn't understand me. Maybe if I said smaller. Reply 0 amfomy @amfomy Jan 23, 2017, 10:02pm Too bad the 'Note' branding has been tarnished already. When they did the announcements on the planes, then you know it's reached the masses. I still get exploding jokes with my Note 4 (and admittedly started some, too). Last edited January 23, 2017 10:02 pm Reply 0 Campbell Simpson @campbellsimpson AUTHOR Jan 23, 2017, 10:27pm I flew on a plane back from IFA in Berlin (where I reported the battery fires and imminent recall) filled with about a dozen journos carrying Galaxy Note7s, plugged in and charging. That, these days, is a recipe for disaster. And I dropped and smashed one within about 12 hours of getting it to review, so I'm really actually kinda surprised I didn't win the lottery on this one. Reply 0 ok @ok Jan 23, 2017, 10:45pm It's sad the fault wasn't discovered in time to either; - tweak the Note7's back casing and put a bigger, more traditionally built battery, or - retain the design but fit a smaller battery used in the existing S7 fleet, but under-clock the hardware slightly The latter probably wouldn't been as receptive to customers I guess. Good to see Samsung being transparent with their review process. Last edited January 23, 2017 10:46 pm Reply 0 Potatoes @mendoza Jan 23, 2017, 10:45pm Unfortunately the damage is already done for me. Months and endless fighting with the company to get a refund for a recalled product that had ready been returned. How can I ever trust their products or services again? Last edited January 23, 2017 10:46 pm Reply 0 bringerofmuffins @bringerofmuffins Jan 24, 2017, 8:17am Two questions: 1: Is anybody incorporating fuses (or their electronic equivalents) into phone batteries? It seems like a no-brainer due to the potential for harm and the exposure of external components. 2: I was under the impression that modern batteries incorporate electronics which stop complete discharge. (Thus the capacitor-trick.) Was I wrong? Reply 0 skrybe @skrybe Jan 24, 2017, 10:54am Wouldn't help in this situation. The damage is literally connecting positive and negative together so it'd bypass any of those sort of measures you're talking about. You can't stop that other than making the batteries more robust. Reply 0 fgooed Guest Jan 24, 2017, 1:07pm samsung stuffed up big time but i gotta say their humbleness and willingness to acknowledge and resolve things impresses me.

Jaideep Mehta 2017 will see the gradual influx of 3D printers into manufacturing firms, research labs and the possible odd hospital. Photo: iStock Imagine this: you are travelling for work to London and staying in an apartment rented through Airbnb. As you hail the Uber cab for your business meeting, your phone beeps an urgent message and you swipe your finger on the fingerprint scanner to read the notification. You learn that a critical machine on your shop floor is overheating, and the message tells you that based upon previous experience, it is likely to break down soon. As a precautionary measure, the system has automatically sent a request to the in-house 3D printer to produce the component likely to be impacted. You pull out your Oculus from the briefcase, connect it to the app on the phone and get a visual of the machine and the impacted component. At the click of a button, the system also gives you three scenarios of the impact on the production if the machine goes down. You make the necessary phone calls using the low-cost WhatsApp and speak to the factory manager. Comforted by his response, your mind is clear for your upcoming meeting. What you have just done is leveraging mobile, next-generation security, Internet of Things (IoT), cognitive computing, natural interfaces and analytics technologies to perform a simple but critical management intervention which ensured the smooth running of your business. Welcome to your new world, Ms CEO. A tsunami of new technologies has hit the business ecosystem. The first ripples were felt in the middle of the last decade and were evidenced by the likes of Salesforce.com and that upstart called Amazon Web Services, Inc. What a curious idea it was for an e-commerce company to expose, and rent out, its underlying infrastructure to third parties! IDC predicts a third of all industry leaders will be replaced by 2020. That’s how profound the disruption is. Click here for enlarge On the consumer side, the waves intensified towards the end of the decade as social media took centre stage and e-commerce boomed in every single major economy in the world. As I write this, Facebook has nearly 1.8 billion users and Alibaba has sold $18 billion worth of products in a single day. Consumer services companies, vividly exemplifying the sharing economy, have become household brands: today, more millennials possibly identify with Uber and Airbnb than they do with venerable corporations such as Johnson & Johnson, and GE. The force of the sharing economy is reshaping vast tracts of the consumer ecosystem, effecting the closure of retail giants such as Circuit City and Woolworths, and acquisitions such as that of Starwood Hotels by Marriott. The waves are swamping those without the lifeboat of digital capabilities. The first intense wave of change came with technologies which created what IDC calls the third platform of computing. The four pillars of the third platform, namely social, mobile, analytics and cloud (SMAC), today aggregate to a market exceeding $0.5 trillion. According to IDC research, it’s still expected to grow in excess of 13% in 2016, taking more than 35% of overall technology spending. It accounts for 110% of the industry’s growth: traditional IT spending, while still two thirds of overall spend, is shrinking at greater than 5% a year. The third platform of computing is a profound shift in the computing paradigm. Users have moved from millions to billions, devices from tens to hundreds of millions and there’s enough data generated on Planet Earth to fill up the memory of a stack of Apple iPads all the way to the moon— and back. SMAC technologies have transformed IT fundamentally, and opened up entirely new opportunities for businesses. From smart products to analytics businesses and from real-time system enabled mobile field forces to digital supply chains, businesses across the spectrum have embraced these in different ways to drive economic value. The maturing of the third platform of computing has enabled entirely new technologies, and combinations, to develop and mature. IDC collectively calls them the innovation accelerators, as our research identifies their potential to drive not just technology and process but also complete business disruption. Of these technologies, the following five are likely to take centre stage in India in 2017. Watch out for them. Next gen security If you’re like me and have a continuous wrestling match with your store of forgotten “capital letter-alphanumeric—change-them-every-two-weeks” passwords, then I can give you some comfort. The era of the complicated password will soon pass. Next generation security systems are integrating biometrics (fingerprint, voice, iris recognition) with behavioural analytics (usage location, onsite/on-app behaviour, transaction patterns) to help make bank accounts, health records, government databases and countless other stores of sensitive information ever more secure. Though not visible to most, the security of the networks our data whizzes around on, and of the data centres which power up the modern economy, is also undergoing radical modernization. For example, network security is not just about appliances detecting ‘bad actors’ anymore: it’s moving to a managed services model where the network is monitored for bad actors, real-time responses become a reality and damage control processes kick in instantly in the event of a hack. From Apple’s fingerprint readers to behavioural security platforms being introduced by the likes of Intel Security and Cisco, the industry is racing to help us realize the possibilities these technologies unlock. Expect a new paradigm in security to make life easier, and more secure, for you in 2017 and beyond. Cognitive systems The notion of intelligent machines has fascinated man for decades. It has been the subject of Hollywood movies, science fiction books and doomsday theories. Well, they’ve arrived but not in the way you thought. I must stress that intelligent machines of the current generation do not have native intelligence as humans do. They are getting ‘smarter’ on the back of their ability to process vast quantities of data really fast, and identify patterns and trends to be used. Who knows what the next generation of machines brings, though? A common example is the “May I help you?” assistants, which have appeared on e-commerce websites. Increasingly, you are not interacting with a human but a piece of software if you do ask a question. It has been programmed with learning algorithms, and fed masses of product catalogue and user behaviour data to be able to help you. Intelligent machines are also parsing through all the published legal cases and court decisions in recorded history to help lawyers serve their clients better; and doing exactly the same with doctors trying to figure out what might be wrong with a sick patient. IBM’s Watson platform is perhaps the best known in this space, but it’s not the only one. Google has a different approach with the TensorFlow and Google Cloud Machine Learning combination. The analytics platforms from the likes of SAS are evolving too, as are new-age data storage systems from NetApp, HP Enterprise and their peers. The year 2017 will see consumer services firms in different sectors adopting cognitive technologies more aggressively. Expect the likes of banks, e-commerce companies, telecom service providers and hospitals to deploy them faster than others. From a wider perspective, the full story will unfold in 2018-19. Internet of Things (IoT) The Internet today has enabled interactions and engagement in society in ways which were not imagined even a decade ago. Video calling through the phone at practically zero marginal cost, cloud computing which allows organizations to think at global scale without the need for massive technology investments and a plethora of consumer services at your doorstep are just three manifestations of the amazing power of the Internet. The next wave is now upon us: machines are now interacting with each other and triggering processes without human intervention. In the process, mountains of data are being generated daily, enabling machine learning and cognitive computing. This is IoT. The 2016 IDC IoT survey in India, which covered 470 companies, reveals a great enthusiasm for IoT already. Process manufacturing companies as well as logistics services and trucking firms are leading the way. The Industrial Internet is born. The year 2017 is likely to see the inflection point of IoT adoption in India. Billions of sensors will help monitor oil pipelines remotely, control home air-conditioning systems and track trucks and pallets as they move through our vast countryside. Its potential is staggering, its promise mouth-watering. It can generate crores of rupees worth of efficiencies and productivity gains in the corporate sector; for consumers, it could mean being able to switch on your air conditioner before you reach home; or your coffee machine grinding the beans when the sensors in your bedroom note that you’ve up. 3D printing At a recent conference, Anand Mahindra, chairman of the Mahindra Group, shared that they had put a 3D printer in a school as part of corporate social responsibility and R&D initiatives. The group was keen to see what innovation the children might come up with if they are given the right tools. The results are awaited but early signs are promising. The term 3D printing, in some ways, is a misnomer. They are actually capital goods equipment which operate visually like printers do. In the future, this technology is likely to radically remake manufacturing. Supply chains will be disrupted and the manufacturing process for many products will be democratized, with the possibility of garage-based production and retail store production already being realized. Nike’s Fly Knit shoes are made in-shop after your foot is scanned and the images sent to the 3D printer. Skin grafts have been synthesized in labs; auto parts are being 3D printed. In 2017, we will see the gradual influx of these machines into manufacturing firms, research labs and the possible odd hospital. It will take some time and price cuts before 3D printers go mainstream. But it holds much promise and would be especially useful for far-flung areas of the nation. Natural user interfaces What I wouldn’t give to not have to get up for the remote control, and simply change the channel on the television with a swipe of my hand, or through a conveniently placed gadget that would recognize my voice and change the channel! That’s Natural User Interface (NUI) for you and it’s here to stay. But really, while that TV remote is still important, a lot of what we experience is now being redefined by new forms of cognitive controls. The shift from text to graphics was a major leap, courtesy of Xerox Corpo ration, and popularised by Apple with their hallmark Macintosh OS in 1984. More recently, we’ve witnessed a revolution of sorts in the UI space: touch (smartphones), voice (Siri) and even gesture (Microsoft Kinect, Nintendo Wii). Today consumers want amplified, immersive and authentic experiences from what they consume; NUI enables just that. The human-machine interface is fast changing our experiences, thus heralding an era of multi-touch surfaces, powerful and lightweight mobile devices and now the emerging market of wearable technology. We are entering a fascinating world sans constraints physical and virtual. On the enterprise side, firms today are increasing the connect with their ecosystem of customers, employees, suppliers and partners, moving away from mere CX (customer experience) to authentic experiences. At IDC, we’re seeing this extensively in media and gaming; it is a matter of time before NUI permeates retail, healthcare, fashion and automobile verticals. It is my considered view that when the neural capabilities of touch, voice and gesture and the capable hardware that’s available to process these inputs (at consumer prices to boot) are coupled with the large scale APIs to leverage these NUI opportunities, a new age of platforms which can redesign and revolutionize your experience will dawn. 2017 shall be a year when the increasing clamour for experience by consumers and the omni-experience transformation needs of enterprises shall see a scaling up of investments towards this aim. As this technology transformation evolves, so too will its impact on consumer experience and the digital business ecosystem. In sum, 2017 will see the next technological revolution reshaping Indian society, business and the government landscape. Recent events have already triggered the digitalization of the payments ecosystem at warp speed. The five technologies described above, individually and in combination, will herald the dawn of the next technological age. Jaideep Mehta is managing director, IDC India and South Asia. Five trends that can change the tech world by 2021 Internet-of-things (IoT) software and solutions: IoT will be driving new levels of customer insight and engagement for some by 2021, but technology diversity and the need for organizational changes will still stymie or delay many firms. Intelligent agents: Intelligent agents and related robots will have eliminated a net 6% of jobs by 2021. Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR): By 2021, AR will be commonplace, while VR will remain niche. Artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive technology: Solutions powered by AI/cognitive technology will displace jobs with the biggest impact felt in transportation, logistics, customer service, and consumer services. Hybrid wireless: 5G will be rolling out by 2021, creating a high-bandwidth cellular backbone to support IoT devices. In addition, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi will expand their capabilities to support IoT devices.

It depends, but even a 2-door in terrible condition should fetch about $7 or $8k. What is a 1971 Ford Torino covered in 3D printed crap worth? $5500. This is the first ‘3D printed car’ on an auction block. It looks terrible and saying ‘Klaatu Varada Nikto’ unlocks the doors. Old Apple IIs had a DB19 connector for external floppy drives. Some old macs, pre-PowerPC at least, also had a DB19 connector for external floppy drives. These drives are incompatible with each other for reasons. [Dandu] has a few old macs and one old Apple II 3.5″ external floppy drive. This drive can be hacked so it works with a Mac Classic. The hack is simply disconnecting one of the boards in the drive, and it only reads 400 and 800kB disks, but it does work. The US Army is working on a hoverbike. Actually, it’s not a hoverbike, because it doesn’t have a saddle or a seat, but it could carry 300 pounds at 60 mph. That’s 136,000 grams at 135 meters per second for the rest of the world out there. This ‘hoverbike’ will be used for very quick resupply, and hopefully a futuristic form of jousting. Over the past few months, we’ve seen a few new microcontrollers built around the RISC-V core. The first is the HiFive1, a RISC-V on an Arduino-shaped board. The Open-V is another RISC-V based microcontroller, and now it too supports the Arduino IDE. That may not seem like much, but trust me: setting up the HiFive1 toolchain takes at least half an hour. The NAMM show has been going on for the last few days, which means new electronic musical gear, effects pedals, and drum machines. This is cool, but somewhat outside our editorial prerogative. This isn’t. It’s a recording studio using a Rasberry Pi. Tracktion is working on a high-quality digital audio input and output add-on for the Pi 3. This is really cool, and you only need to look back at MPCs and gigantic Akai samplers from 15 years ago to see why. Hey LA peeps. Sparklecon is next weekend. What’s Sparklecon? The 23B hackerspace pulls out the grill, someone brings a gigantic Tesla coil, we play hammer Jenga, and a bunch of dorks dork around. Go to Sparklecon! Superliminal advertising!

Report comment Reply James Sleeman says: January 22, 2017 at 5:52 pm > Kg is the base unit Strange but true. Reason: simple convenience, in the late 1700s and early 1800s when these things were being decided, having a gram as the standard mass was recognised to be really inconvenient, too difficult when most things dealt with in every day life weigh a lot more than a gram, so it was decided to have the standard mass as 1000 times greater than the gram (which had been decided already), and therefore the gram got “back annotated” if you like to be 1000 times less than THE (as in the physical Kg prototype) Kg.

They did it using feet per second as a system of measurement. Why should I be forced to learn metric, a different, obviously outdated system of measurement? /trollbait Report comment Reply addy771 says: January 22, 2017 at 4:41 pm Hackaday published an article.

No, I’ve no idea either.

Report comment Reply jrfl says: January 22, 2017 at 11:26 pm This car is clearly an empty husk, with just enough mechanical components to allow it to be trailered. The frame was probably rusted completely through and worthless even for doing a restoration. For example there currently is a car on classiccars for $1000 with no bids that is a rolling frame (missing engine/transmission). If you consider that the artist probably didn’t care what car he started with its likely that the frame was a scrap frame that he got for free. Depending on the cost of the time on his 3d printer it is very possible that that artist made a few grand on this piece. The real sucker who bought it!

The interviewer accidentally knocks the cube over. The interviewer quickly picks the cube up and “rights” it while apologizing. The “art critic” insults the interviewer saying something along the lines of “You’re not an artist, you wouldn’t understand real art.” and “that is a piece of art worth more than what you make in a year.” The interviewer apologizes again as the critic re-positions the cube. The camera focuses on the cube as the interviewer comments that it looks like trash. The critic explains that an artist did make it from the junkyard and used a compactor to make the cube but only a true artist would understand the message behind it. Yes… Garbage stuffed into a compactor then sold for what? 100k? That Ford Torino reminds me an awful lot like that cube of garbage.

How COULD she? The ‘she’ being Yvonne Carmichael (Emily Watson), a respected, married scientist whose self-sabotaging decision to become immediately intimately involved with an urbane stranger sends her life into freefall. We have three more episodes to discover how Yvonne ends up where we first find her, in handcuffs, under arrest, in court, on trial, but there are some other more immediate questions to tax us. Namely...  BBC Yvonne's life will clearly come undone once she surrenders to the temptation of Mr X How many previous guests has Mr X invited into his broom cupboard? He seems to know all about the keys, its celebrated history, what noise the cleaning tools make when they’re kicked in the height of passion... Did the broom cupboard encounter really mean as much to mysterious ‘civil servant’ Mr X as it clearly did to Yvonne? Is it possible to turn on the TV for some contemporary drama without catching sight of Scottish actor Mark Bonnar? Already familiar to ‘Unforgotten’ fans, here, he’s on duty as Yvonne’s unsuspecting, but possibly unfaithful, husband Gary… It soon became clear that Gary had his own fan club, with research assistant Rosa even turning up, distraught, on their doorstep. Was he just being a good professor, having “shut down the possibility” of an affair, or has he got his own secrets? How is Mr X so adept in the art of covering his tracks? The phone he’s bought Yvonne is ‘Pay as you go, never from the same place twice’… Why is he carrying cigarettes when he doesn’t smoke? And does he really work for the government as he says? Why doesn’t Yvonne put her secret phone on silent? That beep with every new erotic message is ever so loud. Who’s the mysterious person, phoning their landline at home and then hanging up? Mr X, or perhaps Rosa? Why is Mr X so obsessed with video-cameras in public places? How does he know about that camera facing the wrong way in the alley way? And knows when a camera is working, and when it isn’t? Are these just tools of his trade, or will it be how he and Yvonne get discovered, or is he planning to stitch her up?  Following the shocking conclusion of this first episode, will Yvonne’s secret life work against her when it comes to seeking justice?  And what IS she on trial for? Watch this space. ‘Apple Tree Yard’ continues on BBC One on Sundays. Catch up on BBCiPlayer. Top 10 Favourite TV Drama Moments Top 10 Favourite TV Drama Moments 1 of 10 10.

According to a blog post by internet security firm Malwarebytes, the backdoor program's primary functionality appears to be screen captures and webcam access. However, the spyware is also designed to capture machine uptime, determine and change mouse position, and simulate mouse clicks and key presses. Furthermore, it downloads other scripts designed to map, study and connect with additional devices on the affected machine's local network. Apple has already released an update "that will be automatically downloaded behind the scenes to protect against future infections," Malwarebytes reported.  Researchers became aware of the threat after an IT administrator at an infected biomedical research facility alerted Thomas Reed, Malwarebytes' director of Mac offerings, to unusual outgoing traffic coming from one of the bio lab's computers. Malwarebytes named the malware Quimitchin, while Apple has assigned it the moniker Fruitfly. “The malware was found infecting computers at three different US biomedical research institutions, all at universities,” said Reed (who authored the blog post) in a brief interview. “We're not sure how they got there, but in the first case, there were indications that it had been there since January of 2015.” A forensic analysis suggests the malware may even be older than that, as researchers uncovered clues that Fruitfly has existed since at least October 2014. The malware communicates with a command-and-control server, presumably to send the perpetrators information or images captured from infected machines. “As for what data they were trying to capture, there wasn't really a clear indication of what they were looking for. The malware is a pretty general-purpose backdoor, so there's a lot it could have captured,” Reed continued. Malwarebytes found that Fruitfly is comprised of only two files, one of which contains a perl script featuring very old system calls that predate the macOS (OS X) operating system. One portion of code dates back as far as 1998. Further examination showed that Fruitfly also contains Linux shell code and is almost fully functional on Linux-based systems. “The only reason I can think of that this malware hasn't been spotted before now is that it is being used in very tightly targeted attacks, limiting its exposure,” Reed wrote in his blog. “There have been a number of stories over the past few years about Chinese and Russian hackers targeting and stealing US and European scientific research. Although there is no evidence at this point linking this malware to a specific group, the fact that it's been seen specifically at biomedical research institutions certainly seems like it could be the result of exactly that kind of espionage.” Related Articles Apple prepping Kaby Lake refresh with possible price cuts MWC 2017: What to expect from the world’s biggest smartphone show Peter Thiel: The age of Apple is over Review: Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus Hall of Fame: the Apple iPhone turns 10 Source: Copyright © SC Magazine, UK edition See more about:  apple  |  backdoor program  |  biomedical research institutions  |  fruitfly  |  malwarebytes   Tweet Email this Print this Feedback   More in Security (1 of 10 articles) NEWS GhostAdmin botnet malware discovered << Prev Next >> View all Security articles >> More in Security (2 of 10 articles) NEWS Savvy phishing attack targets Gmail accounts with high success rates << Prev Next >> View all Security articles >> More in Security (3 of 10 articles) NEWS Windows 7 can't keep up with security needs, according to Microsoft << Prev Next >> View all Security articles >> More in Security (4 of 10 articles) NEWS Expect trouble as Shadow Brokers retire, give away hacking tools << Prev Next >> View all Security articles >> More in Security (5 of 10 articles) NEWS Spora ransomware encrypts offline and offers unique payment options << Prev Next >> View all Security articles >> More in Security (6 of 10 articles) NEWS FireEye report: Russian hacking group APT28 and their tradecraft << Prev Next >> View all Security articles >> More in Security (7 of 10 articles) FEATURE 10 ways to harden the security on your Android phone << Prev Next >> View all Security articles >> More in Security (8 of 10 articles) NEWS FBI says Ransomware soon becoming a billion dollar business << Prev Next >> View all Security articles >> More in Security (9 of 10 articles) NEWS Android Marcher malware mimics Super Mario Run << Prev Next >> View all Security articles >> More in Security (10 of 10 articles) NEWS Comodo Antivirus, Firewall and Internet Security 10 released << Prev Next >> View all Security articles >> Most Read Most Discussed Powered by Disqus Latest Comments Powered by Disqus Latest in Security News Fruitfly spyware infests Mac-based biomedical facilities Review Labs Brief: SecuraLive Antivirus Feature 10 ways to harden the security on your Android phone Group Test Group Test: Switch your antivirus Gallery Photos: AusCERT 2012 day one A-list Product Kaspersky Total Security From our Partners     See more offers from the PC & Tech Authority Software Store     Sponsored Links Most popular tech stories 7 accounting packages for Australian small businesses compared: including MYOB, QuickBooks Online, Reckon, Xero 16 top tips for optimising Windows 10 36 top productivity-enhancing mobile apps How long will a UPS keep your computers on if the lights go out?

In her former life, Tiffany worked for many years producing for Fodors.com, EuroRSCG 4D and Atmosphere BBDO. She left the big lights of the Big Apple to take another bite of life. Her new adventures in French culture have been challenging but quite fulfilling. She loves eating out and enjoying the southwest of France with her Toulousain husband and two kids, and today she shares the charms and beauty of this magical city. Thank you for this wonderful guide, Tiffany! — Stephanie Read the full guide after the jump . . . Photos by Tiffany Kim In this dusty rose-colored city canvassed with clay roof-topped homes, beautifully trimmed parks, a river and a canal that runs through it and the occasional accordion music, I have been lucky to live the real southern French experience in Toulouse. Toulouse is called “Le Ville Rose” (the Pink City), named after the pink bricks used in constructing the homes. Like most modern cities in Europe, Toulouse is infused with the old and new. There are chic neighborhoods with stores like Hugo Boss, Blumarine and Longchamp, but nestled between these boutiques is an old patisserie whose owners are from a long lineage of patisserie owners serving the scrumptious sweet tarts of the region. A few years ago I asked my friend, Josh, a true-to-the-core cultured New Yorker to come and visit me in Toulouse, and he laughed and responded, “Uh, to go to Toulouse is to lose.” I laughed it off, but at that time, I really believed he was right. Toulouse does lack the excitement and energy of an amazing city like Paris. But after many years, this city has gone through a slow renaissance of reinventing, readjusting and rediscovering. Toulouse is the home of Airbus and many well-known pharmaceutical companies, and it also has one of Europe’s best rugby teams. The fact is, you do lose, but what you lose are certain mannerisms and needs that don’t seem to matter as much any more. When you start wandering around the city — the fourth largest in France — you see and appreciate the beauty and the special charm it has to offer. Toulouse’s bars, restaurants, hotels and stores are now more appealing for every taste, and it’s constantly changing. Toulouse is a destination for so many Parisians who yearn for a slower paced life, and it is now a destination for many travelers who decide to stay because they recognize the same je ne sais quoi. Through the broad boulevards and the streets just wide enough for one small Fiat, one would find a lot of noteworthy shopping featuring typical French brands that so many Americans covet like Maje, Comptoir des Cotonniers, Zadig et Voltaire, Isabel Marant, American Vintage, Catimini, Vanessa Bruno, Repetto, The Kooples and, of course, Petit Bateau, just to name a few. But the real piece de resistance is the food. Not only does Toulouse have all the typical French cuisine made by Julia Child on TV, but there are also les fromages that smell so bad but make your taste buds rejoice because they are so incredibly creamy. And there’s the Toulousain cuisine, specific to the southwest of France, that’s made of duck, such as the “eat only once a year because it has as many calories as a full-course Thanksgiving dinner” cassoulet, le confit, magret de canard, foie gras and duck sausage. There are meals to be had that make you close your eyes and slap your hand on the table because something amazing is happening in your mouth. It’s a real “Oh my god, Alain Ducasse, you must have a lot of relatives!” Over the top, yes, but there are restaurants that are really that awe inspiring and often quite affordable. Don’t get me wrong — not all the restaurants are that delicious, but every year I feel the restaurants really up their game. In terms of wines, well, how wrong can you go? You can’t defy enjoying all the AMAZING wines from the region, like wines from Cahors and Corbieres. And lastly, a meal is not complete without dessert. Where do I begin? How do I end? There are as many patisseries as there are banks and real estate agencies. Most patisseries are good, but there are others that have made my poor waistline suffer enormously because I couldn’t deprive myself of these sweet little morsels. How dare they tempt me so. Be sure to check out this Google Map of all the below listings! Carmes Carmes is one of my favorite quarters in town. It has everything you need in one little lovely neighborhood mixed with beautiful old homes with gated courtyards. On the main and side roads, there are many wonderful bars, restaurants and shops bustling with people from morning until after dark. Chez Navarre 49 Grande Rue Nazareth, 31000 Toulouse, France Tél: 05 62 26 43 06 One of my favorite eateries is a place that I was introduced to by a former New Yorker with enormous style and a real gourmand who lives around the corner. This restaurant has the exact warmth and feeling you would find in a traditional French home, with a working fireplace and all. It’s a family-style restaurant where you could be sitting with strangers who smile and wish you a bon appétit. You will find the delicious array of traditional French cuisine such as lentils, shredded carrots in vinaigrette and homemade pâté already sitting at the table waiting to be devoured. Every day the main course changes and never fails to warm your stomach. There is a great wine menu and an all-you-can-eat dessert table. Chez Pham 1, rue Mage, 31000 Toulouse, France Tél: 05 62 19 12 36 This restaurant is run by the wife of Chez Navarre with the same family-style theme, but it is only open for lunch and serves Vietnamese canteen-style fare. It is absolutely wonderful food with the atmosphere of an authentic eastern cafeteria. Everyone I have taken there has fallen in love with this place immediately, and why wouldn’t they? Comptoir a la Une 11 place des Carmes  31000 Toulouse Tél: 05 61 52 98 53 This bar is hopping every night, and the vibe is just as fun. But what really keeps them busy is their extraordinary morsels of international fare that they call tapas, which will make your mouth water. They serve their popular melted cheese gnocchi on a platter small enough to make you want more, but the dish is filling enough to make you say, “C’est trop.” The bar is so popular that they opened another about eight minutes away near the Pont Neuf. Hotel Garonne This gem of a hotel with only 14 rooms is hidden on a very narrow and slightly hilly street, but once found you won’t be disappointed. All the rooms are decorated with the modern amenities and comforts, which includes your own nespresso machine for your daily dose of caffeine in just seconds. The staff is friendly, and the hotel is just steps away from the Pont Neuf and all the brasseries and shops. Backstage (Near Carmes) Address: 28 Rue des Marchands, 31000 Toulouse, France Phone:+33 9 53 17 43 64 If you’re ever looking for a vintage or unique piece, this store is a go-to spot. Backstage is a used clothing store with a lot of interesting and beautiful clothes and a collection of trend-setting jewelry. It’s a bit pricey for used clothes and shoes, but they carry a variety of brands that changes quite often, from sought-after Chanel pumps in mint condition to a YSL vest you may have seen in a magazine from the late ’90s. I appreciate a store like this because it reminds me so much of one of my favorite stores, Armacord, that use to reside in the East Village. Backstage doesn’t have a huge inventory, but what it does have is an abundance of style. Centre Ville (from Place de la Bourse to St. Sernin) Les Affreux Jojo (translation: The Unruly Children) There aren’t many independently owned kids’ stores in Toulouse, but thankfully there’s Les Affreux Jojo — hard to pronounce but easy to spend the cash. This kids’ store definitely carries a great collection that’s so fun and cute you’ll wish you could have it for yourself. Sebastian and his wife created two floors of ideas for parents to relive their childhood in every way possible. Downstairs, they have the most irresistible custom-made kid’s playhouse made of wood filled with miniature designer tables, chairs and rugs and all the accoutrements to keep them happy for hours. La Bonbonnière Address: 41 Rue des Tourneurs, 31000 Toulouse, France Tél: 05 61 21 66 04 The bakeries in Toulouse are easily found, but there are patisseries that go beyond the call of duty. In the cold of winter, there will be a line of people waiting to buy a Galette des Rois (seriously, it’s like a big brioche with sugar on top) that starts at 24 euros. I had to try it to see what the fuss was about. Yep, hands down, it was one of the best I’ve tasted. They are also famous for the most delicious, guilt-full macarons. In a variety box containing every type of flavor imaginable, it will make you sing “La Marseillaise.” Chez Fifi (St. Etienne) The chef Philippe Braun and his wife opened Chez Fifi, which is the restaurant of the moment. The chef has an extremely impressive resume, which is why the food is considered the “coup de coeur” of many critics. In this neighborhood filled with chic boutiques and antique galleries and shops, the restaurant fits right in. Église des Jacobins (St. Sernin) Address: Rue Lakanal, Toulouse, 31000 Tél: 05 61 22 21 92 If you’ve spent any time taking an art-in-the-dark class, you will recall one of Toulouse’s most famous medieval churches with soaring, arched apses, gothic pillars shaped like palm trees and beautiful cloisters. While there, don’t miss going inside the Basilique St. Sernin, as it is the largest Romanesque church in Europe and is named a UNESCO historic site. Grand Balcon A five-star hotel worthy of each star earned, the Grand Balcon Hotel is one of the most beautiful hotels in Toulouse. Located right in the center of town, around the corner from Place du Capitole, you are guaranteed to be taken care of while here. Les Fees de la Creation Retro clothing, shoes and jewelry for women and fit for the likes of Zooey Deschanel. There is a collection of independent labels and designs that you know won’t be worn by everyone on the street. Rice and Beans A little shop full of hipster wear for both men and women. The selection of men’s clothing is larger, but the carefully chosen women’s section is worth a browse. A nice collection of leisure styles for the skater/MGMT groupie/alternative/artist wannabes. Sweet Art This has to be my most favorite jewelry store in all of Toulouse. One cannot help but walk into this bright pink pastry-colored corner store filled with handmade jewelry, kitschy wall art and decorative displays so tempting, you always ask the price and it’s either not for sale or already on hold. They have something for every age group and every type of style. Les Chalets/St. Aubin Primarily a quiet residential neighborhood lined with trees that guard the beautiful bourgeoisie homes near the canal. Les Chalets is limited in terms of shops and restaurants, but the few they have are quite impressive. And just minutes away is St. Aubin, with its wonderful Sunday market and petit rues filled with ethnic restaurants, cute bars and shops. L’Atelier de Jean 26, Rue Raymond VI Tél. 05 61 62 75 63 L’Atelier de Jean is a restaurant that I happened to walk into one random day during lunchtime, and I was denied seating because it was completely booked — for the whole week. Reservations are necessary to guarantee seating because the food is definitely worth the wait. The chef comes out on occasion to greet his patrons and to talk about the food or even the weather. The way he prepares each dish is a gastronomic delight, and for lunch it costs only 14 euros. You can’t beat that. Bar la Concorde 16 Rue de La Concorde Tél: 05 61 62 50 52 This 150-year-old establishment still attracts the neighborhood clientele, the hipsters and everyone in between. You go for the ambiance of a grand bar de Toulouse because it has the feel of history, but don’t go there just for a vin chaud during the holidays or a big cafe crème in the morning. Experience the evenings, too, because here you’ll be able to catch a chanteuse belting out Edith Piaf or a trio playing jazz. The staff is friendly and international. Madame Sans Gene There are quite a few talented hairdressers in town with gorgeous salons, but I have yet to find one as different as Madame Sans Gene. This salon is a flashback to the ’50s (a recurring theme here in Toulouse) — from the antique blue hair dryer and the Happy Days set furniture to the beautiful black and white tapestry wallpaper. She has the hair and tattoos to convince you that she is not kidding around with her craft. So if you want the John Waters bouffant teased-out hair or the up do for an occasion, this is the place to have it done. As a matter of fact, she’ll cut your hair in almost any style you want. Gris Chiné (Translation: marled grey) 35 rue de la Concorde Tél: 06 29 80 18 55 This store is a real mix of something old and something new. Owner Stéphanie Galup refurbishes the decorative pieces for the home, and a contributor to the store, Gaëlle Molina, designs the jewelry that is on display. This little store in the heart of Les Chalets gives proof of creativity and an ownership of unique style. St. Cyprien This neighborhood is multicultural, boisterous and brimming with activity and things to do. It is a hotspot for young families, students and the like to hang out or reside. Musée les Abattoirs This is the only contemporary museum in Toulouse. Unfortunately, I think the curator is asleep at the wheel. It saddens me to say it, as I miss going to see modern art, but this museum really lacks originality and inspiration in its exhibits. They recently renovated, so I will continue to keep my fingers crossed. And there is one thing not to be missed near this museum: the carousel. Le Beau Manége dans le jardin Raymond VI Allées Charles de Fitte Tél: 05 62 27 48 48 The most original carousel this side of France, and it’s next to a large park. The carousel animals are not typical, either, as you will find turtles and rhinos alongside the horse. The rides are made of wood, iron, leather, fabric and cane, and the merry-go-round is exceptional for both young and old. Foxy Amidonniers, next to St Cyprien An interesting fact is that French people consider an American burger to be just ground beef with no salt, pepper or onions added. I am trying my best to convince every restaurant owner, butcher and French burger eater that it is not quite so. As a real burger lover, I cannot live on French food alone. Thankfully, a friend told me about this place that I had walked or driven by countless times without knowing the hidden treasure that awaited me. Great burgers, yummy fries, nice staff, funny name — what more could one ask for? You’ll need reservations, due to space; it is completely mandatory. Atelier Deux Mille A small collective contemporary art gallery consisting of four artists who create their silkscreens and engravings for show and sale. Their work is uncluttered and simple yet interesting and worth a second look. Centre Affiche A chapel turned gallery of poster art, graphic art and postcards from French artists. This small treasure of a room (rumored to expand) is a wonderful place to see and then to shop. Off the Beaten Path Albi (45 minutes from Toulouse) A UNESCO city known for its breathtaking gothic cathedral and also as the birthplace of the painter Toulouse-Lautrec. Carcassone (50 minutes from Toulouse) This medieval city known for its stone fortress is a must-see. Not worth going in, but definitely worth a drive by.

I’ve always wanted to go there. Of course who wouldn’t? Reply MB@YarnUiPhoneApp says: March 5, 2013 at 10:31 am The knitter within needs to ask what kind of knitting/yarn shops are nearby. I like to bring home fibery souvenirs. It’s so much fun to bring something home, relive the memories of the visit when I knit something months later with the purchased yarn. So what yarn shops are nearby that I can visit after I’ve overimbibed or overeaten? Haven’t been to France in years, but I wasn’t a knitter when I last visited! Reply Irene says: March 5, 2013 at 11:56 am What a wonderful article ! I am a French graphic designer living in Toulouse and it is so crazy reading about my city on this blog. To answer the previous comment, you can easily find yarn in Toulouse. One shop is very good and well known for it, “La Droguerie” (20, place Roger Salengro). It is a french shop that you can also find in other cities (like Paris, of course). I used to work there and I can assure you that the sales girls are super nice ! You can also go to “Fifi Jolipois” (11, rue Cujas), and to “Phildar” (36, rue Alsace Lorraine). One last thing : I would totally recommend another address, in the city center : “Le Petit Magre”. Awesome little place to eat, with a salad buffet to die for and patisseries that you will never forget. Definitely one of the best restaurant/café in town, and the recipes change regularly so you never get tired of it :) Thank you for this article and bonne continuation ! Reply Tracey says: March 5, 2013 at 12:05 pm Ah Toulouse! Comme tu me manques! I lived in Toulouse from 2008 – 2010 –lived in a fabulous 18th century apartment at Place de la Bourse (ironically, over the American Apparel store!)–so fully lived the vie de centre ville and would like to add a few of my favorites here . . . wish I’d known about some of your suggestions . . . Not to be missed in Centre Ville is Au Pere Louis, at 45 Rue des Tourneurs, the oldest operating wine bar in Toulouse, since 1889. Genial, convivial, delicieuse, etc. A great place to join the bustling lunch crowd and feel part of Toulouse life. Right around the corner on the Rue Peiras is Le Bar Quinquina. My favorite place to get an ‘apero’ (aperitif) in the evening. Best ‘impostation’ and people watching of all the cafes in Toulouse, in my opinion. Also nice at lunchtime to grab a sandwich from the shop catty-corner across the intersection or the pizzeria next door and bring it over to the Quinquina and order a libation–the owners of the Quinquina are totally down with this. The pizzeria will even bring you your pizza at your table at the Q. At Place Capitole there is the very fine Brasserie de l’Opera (www.brasserieopera.com), where I liked to go for a solid Sunday meal. Very white tablecloth and adult. For all your French porcelain needs (!) go to Estampille at 4 Rue d’Astorg–a really great array of porcelain ‘blanks’ that owner Valery, who hails from Limoges, picks up at the factories and presents in his boutique in a very beautiful way. The pieces are technically seconds, but you’d never know it. And thus, reasonably priced. A category of French store that doesn’t exist in the States: the quincaillerie. A sort of catch-all small hardware and household utilitarian items and soaps, etc. The one I loved was the Droguerie Marty Roubichou, in existence depuis 100 years, at 41 Rue de Languedoc—just north of Place des Carmes. Geraldine, the owner, is a sweetie. For entertainment: I SO miss the Cinema Utopia, around the corner from Galeries Lafayette in Centre Ville, but also in Tournefeuille (suburb of Toulouse close to Airbus). Fantastic programming of art films (think Angelika or Laemmle) and d’essai and charming old-style viewing rooms with very comfy velvet seats. The Cinemateque, just south of St. Sernin on the Rue du Taure is also exceptional. And easy to access. And speaking of St. Sernin–OH HOW I MISS THE SATURDAY MORNING FLEA MARKET with the vendors surrounding the church. Honestly, flea markets of Paris, pff. EVERY Saturday morning, and you never know what you’ll find. Many many wondrous treasures for 1 or 2 Euros. If you happen to be in town on the first weekend of the month, there’s a great (less ad hoc than St. Sernin, vendors more organized, more professional antiquarians) market that takes place all weekend long along the Allees. I do know they’re doing some construction along that rue, installing a tram or a new metro line, so don’t know if this is happening at the moment or if they’ve moved it to somewhere else for the time being–definitely worth finding out. For MB, the knitter: try Le Petit Comptoir at 8 Rue Jules Chalande in Centre Ville or Bobines et Franfreluches at 16 Place Oliviers in St. Cyprien. And speaking of St. Cyprien—the African grocery stores are good sources for interesting ingredients which fall outside the canon of French cooking. Okra! Black beans! Cumin! Et voila’! Allez! Reply Karen judge says: March 5, 2013 at 1:25 pm Sounds like a dream come true….maybe this summer?? Thank you! Reply Charisma says: March 5, 2013 at 2:00 pm Excellent recommendations! I’d also add the Château d’Eau for contemporary photography exhibits. Reply Polly Rowan says: March 6, 2013 at 3:23 am I went to Toulouse in August and fell in love with it!

You’re very lucky to live there. Reply kim says: March 6, 2013 at 10:29 am I read this wonderful post and didn’t realize that Tiffany is the sister of my friend Christine – how fun! Reply Sandra says: March 6, 2013 at 6:07 pm Arrived in Toulouse from Sydney, woke early – jetlag, yep, it’s a long way from Oz. The hotel had a guide to Toulouse book with a great fresh broad bean cassoulet recipe from Brasserie de l’Opera. Broad beans in season! When my travelling companions were awake we hit the SO FABULOUS central market and bought the ingredients. The stallholders realised soon what we planned to cook, offered suggestions and handed us from one stall to another for the Toulousain specialities we needed, so jolly! Lovely day in the city, then off to our rented house near Cahors and a great dinner the next evening. Loved Toulouse, and have visited a few more times. Reply Picpoul says: March 7, 2013 at 4:37 am I’ve lived here for 7 years, I have to vote for the marvellous food market at Victor Hugo. Sure there’s a very good one also at Carmes. Victor Hugo has great food, great characters, bars all around and within, and a unique strip of lunchtime restaurants on the 1st floor: 1 for fish, one for duck, one for beef, one for Spanish etc etc. Get there early – like 12:15 or be prepared to wait. Last Sunday a male-voice choir spent an hour wandering through. 6 mornings a week, except for Monday. Reply madame sans gêne says: March 8, 2013 at 5:07 pm ohhh thanx a lot for paper! come to visit me again! Reply Marie says: March 9, 2013 at 8:40 pm Ooo France has long been on my list of places to visit — I was in Paris oh so briefly a few years ago, just enough time really to visit the Louvre before I had to head onward. The town looks like it has so much charm and this has inspired me to put Europe back on my “to get to soon” list — I’ve mostly been staying in Central America lately. Thanks for the beautiful guide to your city Tiffany! Reply Anne says: March 28, 2013 at 1:01 pm We’re going to be in Toulouse mid-May 2013 and really look forward to exploring venues listed here. Thanks to all who provided personal experiences. Reply Tyler says: June 2, 2013 at 5:17 am To Tracy’s comment about the first weekend of the mont antiques flea market …. The market has moved just around the Grand Rond to Francois Verdier. It stretches all the way from the Grand Rond to the War Memorial at Rue de Metz now. Fun place to wander through!

Post an ad Android creator nears comeback with 'essential' phone By: Bloomberg News January 22, 2017 Updated: January 22, 2017 at 3:06 pm 0 Just over two years after leaving Google, Andy Rubin is preparing to take on the smartphone industry he helped create. Rubin, creator of the Android operating system, is planning to marry his background in software with artificial intelligence in a risky business: consumer hardware. Armed with about a 40-person team, filled with recruits from Apple and Google, Rubin is preparing to announce a new company called Essential and serve as its CEO, according to people familiar with the matter.

Digit says trust me A platform company designed to tie multiple devices together, Essential is working on a suite of consumer hardware products, including ones for the mobile and smart home markets, one of the people said. The centerpiece of the system is a high-end smartphone with a large edge-to-edge screen that lacks a surrounding bezel. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in early January, Rubin discussed the smartphone with mobile carrier executives, including some from Sprint Corp., people familiar with the talks said. Rubin registered Essential Products Inc. with California regulators in November 2015. In late 2016, the company registered "Essential" with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, listing smartphones, tablets, accessories and "computer operating software for mobile phones" among its goods and services. It's unclear if the devices will run on software based on Android. While still in the prototyping stage, Rubin's phone is aimed at the top of the market where Apple's iPhone and Alphabet Inc.'s new Pixel reside. It's expected to include high-end materials and the ability to gain new hardware features over time, the people said. Representatives for Rubin and Sprint declined to comment. Rubin sold Android to Google in 2005. He spent eight years at its helm at Google, turning the operating system from a tiny project into the globe's most dominant software for running mobile devices. In 2013, he stepped down from Android to form Google's robotics unit before leaving altogether in 2014. Rubin's next venture was a startup incubator called Playground Global, which backs artificial intelligence, robotics, and augmented reality projects. Rubin is convinced AI is the next big change to ripple through the technology industry. "New computing platforms happen every 10 to 12 years," he said at the Bloomberg Technology Conference in June. "What's the next platform?... It's about data and people training AI systems to learn." Playground Global, which occupies a sprawling warehouse in Silicon Valley, has raised at least $300 million from big investors including Hewlett-Packard, Google, and Apple supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. The latter, known as Foxconn, is in talks to manufacture Rubin's new smartphone, according to people familiar with the matter. Rubin is aiming to put the phone on sale around the middle of 2017 for a price similar to an iPhone 7 ($649).

The suit, filed Friday in federal district court in the Southern District of California, claims that Qualcomm leveraged its monopoly position as a manufacturer of baseband chips, a critical component used in cellphones, to seek "onerous, unreasonable and costly" terms for patents, and that Qualcomm blocked Apple's ability to choose another supplier for chipsets. The complaint seeks $1 billion in rebate payments that Apple says Qualcomm has withheld as retribution for Apple's participation in an investigation by South Korea's antitrust regulator. The Korean agency last month an nounced a roughly $853 million fine on Qualcomm for alleged anticompetitive patent-licensing practices -- a decision Qualcomm disputed and vowed to fight. San Diego-based Qualcomm long has been a dominant supplier of chips that let handsets and cellular networks communicate, and has developed a trove of patents around that technology that account for most of its pretax profit. Its licensing practices have rankled competitors and customers for years, analysts say, though the discord was generally kept behind doors. Apple said in a statement that it sued Qualcomm "after years of disagreement over what constitutes a fair and reasonable royalty." The Apple suit comes three days after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued Qualcomm alleging it engaged in unlawful tactics to maintain a monopoly on a type of chip used in cellphones. That suit highlighted Qualcomm's dealings with Apple. Devices sold by Apple and rival phone maker Samsung Electronics Co. account for nearly half of Qualcomm's revenue, which totaled $23.5 billion in the latest fiscal year. Qualcomm didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. It said earlier this week that it would fight the FTC's suit, which it said is based on inaccurate information and was rushed out ahead of the change in presidential administrations. Qualcomm said it has never withheld or threatened to withhold its chips to gain unfair licensing terms, and that its longstanding licensing model benefits the industry and is the most efficient approach for everyone involved. Patrick Moorhead, president of market-research firm Moor Insights & Strategy, said the legal dispute with Apple will help determine what is fair pricing for patents that Qualcomm invested heavily to develop. "There's nothing clear cut about this case," he said. The iPhone has been enormously profitable for Apple, bringing in $136.7 billion in revenue in Apple's latest fiscal year, and, according to according to investment bank CLSA, accounting for three-fourths of Apple's $84 billion in estimated total gross profit. Apple is on track to have sold more than $980 billion of iPhones in the decade since it went on sale in June 2007, said Horace Dediu, founder of market research firm Asymco. In its complaint, Apple says that Qualcomm requires manufacturers to agree to license its patents to get Qualcomm chips. By making its chip supply contingent on paying patent licenses, Qualcomm was able to secure royalty terms that manufacturers "would not otherwise accept," the suit says. For Apple, those terms gave Qualcomm as much 5% of the average price of an iPhone, which sells for anywhere from $400 to nearly $1,000. Qualcomm's cut stayed the same even as Apple added elements that increased the iPhone's value, such as sophisticated cameras and displays. For example, Apple charges about $549 for an iPhone 6s with a 4.7-inch display and $649 for a iPhone 6s Plus with a 5.5-inch display. Though much of the higher price is associated with the larger display -- not Qualcomm's chip -- Qualcomm would collect the same royalty percentage and therefore a larger dollar amount, according to terms outlined in the suit. Apple says Qualcomm also required it to exclusively use its chips in iPhones from at least 2011 to 2016 -- a claim also contained in the FTC complaint. Apple received what it called quarterly rebates under the agreement, but its suit says Qualcomm began withholding those last year after Apple met with Korean regulators. The suit claims Qualcomm told Apple it had forfeited the nearly $1 billion in rebates by responding to the Korea Fair Trade Commission. Apple says Qualcomm's practices deterred Apple from switching to chips made by competitors like Intel Corp. That changed last year when it introduced Intel chips into a portion of its iPhone 7. --Ted Greenwald contributed to this article.

Apple said in a statement that it sued Qualcomm "after years of disagreement over what constitutes a fair and reasonable royalty." Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg called Apple's claims "baseless." In a statement, he said, Apple "mischaracterized" agreements and negotiations and failed to acknowledge "the enormity and value of the technology" Qualcomm invented. "We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discover of Apple's practices," Mr. Rosenberg said.

These are some of the misconceptions that men have about the body of women! Read on. By: Syeda Farah Noor Updated: Wednesday, January 4, 2017, 12:02 [IST] Subscribe to Boldsky Most men have misconceptions about the female body and these misconceptions date back for as long as one can even remember! This is because nobody paid attention during Biology classes, the female body is still a mystery to almost all. We are here to clear some of the misconceptions and myths related to female bodies that most of us are not aware of! So, check out some of these interesting misconceptions that need to be cleared and we're sure after this, most men would not have the kind of doubts they had earlier.  Myth#1: ‘Women Don’t Have An Adam’s Apple’! Fact: Wrong! Most women don't have an Adam's apple that shows. It is more prominent in men because men have a high level of testosterone and the angle of the cartilage which differs for both the sexes! Myth#2: ‘Squirting Is Like Peeing’ Fact: No, it is not! Squirting happens when a woman achieves an orgasm and the liquid literally squirts out with a bit of force. But it is not the same as in case of peeing. Myth#3: ‘Women Have Smaller Bladders Than Men’ Fact: No, size does not matter! Women pee more often than men because their bladder is positioned in a lower position and it has less space to expand as compared to a man's bladder. Hence, this makes people wonder if they have a smaller bladder! Myth#4: ‘Only Women Experience Menopause’ Fact: False! Men also undergo menopause and it is called "andropause ". In this condition, men have a decreased level of testosterones in their body. Myth #5: ‘Period Blood Is Like Excreta’ Fact: It makes no sense at all, as it is not a fact! Period blood has nothing but blood and tissues from the uterus wall. Whoever thinks that period blood is like excreta needs to get his facts right! Myth #6: ‘Urethra And Vagina Are The Same’ Fact: They are not the same! Let's get the facts right here! The urethra is what a woman uses to pee and the vagina is for sexual intercourse. We hope it has cleared the doubt now!     Read in Kannada: ಗಂಡು-ಹೆಣ್ಣುಗಳ ಶರೀರದ ಭಿನ್ನತೆ, ತಪ್ಪುಕಲ್ಪನೆ ಏತಕ್ಕೆ..?

This can be said as along with Vodafone, Nokia has recently also teamed up with Idea Cellular to offer an integrated billing solution for its music service, Nokia Music Store, in India. Idea subscribers using Finnish cellphone maker's music service on their Nokia handsets will be able to renew subscriptions through their respective accounts to continue downloading songs and albums from the Nokia Music Store. Renewal subscriptions for the Nokia Music Store are available for three durations viz., 7 days for Rs 50; 30 days for Rs. 99; and 90 days for Rs. 250. Taxes and data charges are separate as applicable. With this integration, Idea Cellular consumers can pay for the renewal as part of their monthly phone bills or have the amount debited from their prepaid balance.  Further, users can also log in to www.oxicash.in or get in touch with one of the nearest stores for availing the desired voucher.  Nokia Music Store India has around 45 lakh songs spanning across 26 music genres. One of the unique attractions of this service is that all the songs stored in the service are DRM free. It means users can feel free to share, transfer or set any of the songs as a ringtone absolutely free. The service also offers exclusive access to high quality regional Indian music tracks and even international tracks for a limited number of minutes.  These Nokia Music subscription vouchers are provided by carrier networks including Idea Cellular and Vodafone pre-paid and post-paid connections. Free service will be provided to users for 3 months, 6 months and 12 months for its Nokia range of devices depending up on the type of device being used. Nokia 500 would be getting free subscription for 6 months where as the Asha range of devices will get free subscription for three months. The official site of Nokia indicates services can vary depending on whether users are on 2G or 3G and the network conditions.

Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies TV Politics Business Super Bowl Ads     IOS 11 Will Feature Overdue Group FaceTime Calling Feature Posted: Jan 22 2017, 10:37am CST | by Ahmed Humayun, in Rumors | Apple     A technology blog from Israel has given out a rather skeptical rumor that the iOS 11 might actually bring a long a much sought FaceTime feature. It claims that Apple is introducing group video for FaceTime in its latest version of the iOS. In the report it is mentioned that many people who are familiar with the iOS development have given out the rumors. Don't Miss: NES Classic Alternatives are Cheaper Interestingly the software has been partly developed in Israel However no such news has been verified or even heard anywhere else. The technology blog also claims that Apple is going to update Messages on iOS so to enable a FaceTime call in which up to 5 members can participate. FaceTime is currently operational between two users and it has been this way since its launch in 2010. We did however see the famous show ‘Modern Family’ show group FaceTime calling back in 2015. Other major video calling services such as Google hangout and Skype already have the option of group video calling. The Google video calling app Duo is pretty interesting too. It allows user to user calling just like we have FaceTime in its current condition. Apple will most probably reveal the iOS 11 and other major software updates at the WWDC which usually takes place in June. Group FaceTime calling was not in the scene before this rumor. However we will know soon whether the overdue feature has been included in the iOS 11 or not.

Share this article Share Mel carried her two-toned large in her hand as she hide her facial features under an oversized pair of tortoise shades, while her raven-coloured locks where styled off her face. Her casually clad appearance comes after it was claimed she resolved the nine-year feud with her mother Andrea, dad Martin and sister Danielle - and has invited them to spend time at her family home in Los Angeles next month. Back on track: Mel has reportedly resolved the nine-year feud with her mother Andrea, dad Martin and sister Danielle - and has invited them to spend time at her  LA home next month According to The Sun, the I Want You Back hitmaker decided to reach out to her relatives as she realised that 'life was too short' to maintain their argument - and that the group are now on good terms once again.   Back in 2008, Andrea was cut off from the Broadway star and her daughters - who live in Los Angeles - due to her disapproval of Mel's then-new husband Stephen Belafonte. However the paper now reports that the family have finally resolved their issues after almost ten years of disagreement, leaving all four of them and Mel's children 'thrilled'. An inside source said: 'Mel is finally back in touch with her family and everyone is thrilled. Reunion: Mel, who famously cut her mother Andrea (above) out of her life in 2008, is said to be 'thrilled' by the reunion, after realising that 'life was too short' to maintain the argument 'It took for Mel to realise that life was too short to keep this going. She's really pleased she took the step of finally reaching out to them.' Not wasting any time to get things back on track, the insider continued that Andrea has even spent working days with her daughter, and are set to reunite at Mel's LA home with Stephen this coming year. They added: 'Mel even had her mum on the set of Lip Sync Battle recently and for Phoenix's 18th birthday party in Los Angeles next month the family are invited over and are absolutely thrilled.' Holiday time: Getting things back on track, the insider continued that the whole family are set to reunite at Mel's LA home with Stephen (L) this coming year Prior to the argument they had been close enough to never go for more than four days without speaking on the phone, but Andrea revealed in a past interview that if she ever called the family, the phone number would have changed. She made no secret of her feelings about Belafonte at the time of the argument, who became Mel's husband in 2007 after a secret Las Vegas wedding. It was their vow renewal ceremony in Egypt that led to the family feud reaching its peak, where Mel also fell out with her sister Danielle, and her father Martin. Not a fan: The star's family reportedly fell out after they expressed their dislike of her husband Stephen, who she wed in Las Vegas in 2007 It was rumoured that her husband banned Mel's relatives from getting in contact at this event. This resulted in the family never meeting her youngest daughter Madison, born in 2011 - a far cry from when Andrea has been allowed to cut the umbilical cord at the birth of Mel's second child Angel, in 2006. Andrea even revealed in an interview with The Sun that she only learned of the pregnancy and birth via the internet. 'I only found out she was pregnant because of Twitter and I found out on Twitter that she'd had the baby too,' she said. Difficult: The fallout meant the family never met her youngest daughter Madison, born in 2011 - with Andrea discovering her grandchild's birth on Twitter She had continued on how devastating the rift had been for her family: 'Half of my family is missing to me. Every day I pine for Mel, Phoenix and Angel.' At the end of 2014, when Mel was hospitalised on the final weekend of The X Factor, Andrea went on a Twitter rant accusing film producer Belafonte of being physically violent towards the singer. She fiercely wrote on the social media site: 'Little good news 4 me lost half a stone in 1 week+ will never suffer a vile abusive 3am call from stephan Belafonti again!!' [sic]  Stephen has since issued forthright denials to any suggestion he has hit his wife - Mel vehemently denies the allegations too, and the couple have been putting on a united front ever since.  United front: When Mel was hospitalised in 2014, Andrea went on a Twitter rant accusing Belafonte of being physically violent towards the singer - a claim which both he and Mel have vehemently denied since Mel's sister Danielle waded into the furore at the time, too, sharing her concerns about her sibling.  She launched a Twitter tirade calling for Stephen, Mel's fellow X Factor judge Simon Cowell and even her PR firm, to get in touch with the family about her condition, as they were not told any information when Mel was rushed to hospital.   She launched into numerous tweets revealing her worry and fears over Mel's condition, writing: 'This is ridiculous and cruel !!! Evil ! How can NO one tell me and my family where my sister is and what is going on????? 'Just a simple call to say she gonna be ok is all it takes!!!!' (sic)  However, Andrea appeared to offer an olive branch to her daughter on her 40th birthday in 2015, as she posted an array of nostalgic snaps to her Twitter. Posting a fun shot of a much-younger Mel doing the splits, she wrote: '@officialmelB 40 today hope ur birthday is as special as u r 2 me, luv and miss u FOREVER X.'   Teaming up: Mel's sister Danielle (L) also waded into the furore at the time - but their differences are now thought to have been resolved  Read more: News, sport, celebrities and gossip | The Sun Spice Girl Mel B buries hatchet over hubby and makes emotional reunion with mum after decade of silence Share or comment on this article e-mail Most watched News videos How to make a stick drawing magically come to life with water Social experiment to test reaction to Trump supporter in New York City Angry motorists push car after being blocked in on private drive Dog is cut free after being chained up for FIFTEEN years Bear the dog visits the beach for first time after rescue Piers Morgan goes on rant about Ewan McGregor cancelling interview CCTV captures moment British man is shot dead in car in Pattaya Woman booted off plane after ranting at Trump supporter Man tells Polish woman to 'go back to her country' in rant ISIS video 'shows drone dropping bombs on targets near Mosul' Gov.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Apple considering facial, 2-step recognition as Touch ID replacement Adam Westlake - Jan 22, 2017 2 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit The latest report from Ming-Chi Kuo, the KGI Securities analyst with one of the best track records when it comes to Apple‘s future hardware plans, was released yesterday, and it includes several expectations of what’s to come with the 2017 iPhone. The most notable change is an overhaul of the smartphone’s Touch ID fingerprint reader, replacing it with new biometric identification technology, and in turn reducing the need for bezels in the device’s design. In order for Apple to introduce a phone with nearly no bezels, it needs to replace the current Touch ID sensor, which is found under the iPhone’s Home button, with a new optical sensor that can go under the screen. It’s suggested that they might even pair this with a sensor for facial recognition, in turn making a more secure authentication. Kuo notes this could eventually pave the way towards Apple’s use of facial recognition by itself, with no need for a Touch ID sensor. Here’s how the analyst summed it up: “Judging by the bio-recognition patents that Apple has applied for, we believe it is leaning toward facial recognition technology rather than iris recognition. However, we note that the technical challenges of facial recognition include: (1) algorithms; (2) hardware design; and (3) the build-out of a database for verification and authentication, which could be time consuming. As such, before Apple can fully replace the fingerprint system with facial recognition, a combination of the two steps of bio-recognition could be a valid solution for enhancing transactions security.” While we’ve been hearing for years about Apple adopting a bezel-less design for the iPhone, Kuo admits that development on the new under-screen optical sensor is still in the early stages. This means there’s still a very good chance this tech won’t be ready in time for this year’s iPhone model.

US President Donald Trump had announced before taking office a $50 billion deal with SoftBank which he said would generate 50,000 jobs. Trump was speaking last month alongside SoftBank's chief executive Masayoshi Son, who displayed a document which indicated Softbank and Foxconn would "commit to invest $50bn + $7bn in US, generate 50k + 50k new jobs in US in next four years". Journalists (in foreground) watch a large video screen showing Terry Gou, founder of Foxconn parent Hon Hai group, during a shareholders conference at the company's headquarters in Tucheng in New Taipei City on June 22, 2016 ©SAM YEH (AFP/File) Foxconn, a major supplier to Apple, had earlier said it was in "preliminary discussions" with US officials about a potential investment but gave no details. "I have discussed with my major clients about going to (the US) and they are also willing to invest, including Apple," Terry Gou told reporters in Taipei after the company's year-end party. The firm is the world's largest contract electronics maker and is best-known for assembling products for international brands such as Apple and Sony. "Pennsylvania is active and I urge other states to act more quickly or I will sign the contract with Pennsylvania," he said, adding that the investment could create 30,000-50,000 jobs. Foxconn is still waiting to see the tax policies of the new US government and what incentives state authorities can offer, such as cheap land and electricity, Gou added. Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai, employs around a million workers at its factories across China and has operations in more than 10 countries. Last year it took over the struggling Japanese electronics maker Sharp after acquiring a 66 percent stake for $3.7 billion in a move Gou described as "really worth it." In the US, it has a plant in Virginia for packaging and engineering which employes over 400 people. It has also announced a $40 million investment in a facility in Pennsylvania to build precision tools and develop a robotics programme. Gou said Foxconn aims to increase investment in China this year to try to boost Sharp's market share in the country, but denied reports that he had been pressured by China over his planned US investment. Almost immediately after he won the November election, Trump angered China by accepting a congratulatory call from Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen. He further upset Beijing when he threatened to get tough with what he sees as unfair Chinese trade practice and suggested that the "One China" policy is negotiable.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Mon, Jan 23, 2017 - Page 16　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Wistron predicts continued growth FOLLOW THE LEADER:A push by the new US administration to move manufacturing to the US could see Wistron invest there if the market goes that way, Simon Lin said By Lauly Li  /  Staff reporter Wistron Corp (緯創), one of Apple Inc’s iPhone assemblers, expects business growth to continue this year, after posting a record revenue for last year, company chairman Simon Lin (林憲銘) said. “This year’s business will be driven by demand for smartphones, Internet of Things [IoT] devices, servers and desktops,” Lin told reporters on the sidelines of the company’s annual banquet for employees on Friday at the Taipei Nangang Exhibition Center. Wistron expects capacity expansion to meet client demand after the board approved a combined investment of US$208.67 million to expand production capacity at its plant in Kunshan, China, which analysts say is to support capacity expansion for 5.5-inch iPhones. “We expect Wistron to become the key assembler of 5.5-inch iPhones in the second half of 2017 and into 2018,” Credit Suisse Group AG’s Taiwan equity research division wrote in a client note on Monday last week. Wistron’s iPhone production could reach 16.5 million units this year, up from 8 million last year, Credit Suisse said. Under an unspecified client’s request, the board in November last year approved a capital injection of US$33.5 million to convert its after-sales service center in Bengaluru, India, into a plant. Bloomberg News on Friday last week reported that Apple plans to partner with Wistron to assemble iPhones at the Indian plant. However, Lin declined to confirm if the plant is to focus on Apple’s iPhone business, saying that Wistron has a “wide range” of clients for the Indian market. “The plant in India can assemble smartphones or notebooks. It depends on the clients’ requests,” Lin said. The Indian plant is scheduled to become operational in next quarter, Wistron said. Apart from smartphones, Wistron also manufactures laptops, tablets, flat TVs, LCD monitors and data-center servers for clients. While the PC industry is shrinking, Wistron’s notebook computer shipments, accounting for 40 percent of the firm’s total revenue, are forecast to stay flat from last year’s 19.4 million units, Lin said. When asked if Wistron has plans to increase its investments in the US to meet US President Donald Trump’s call to move manufacturing jobs to the US, Lin said Wistron would do what benefits its clients. “I don’t think the policy will happen in a short period of time, but surely we can do that if that is the industry trend,” Lin said. Wistron reported accumulative sales of NT$659.41 billion (US$20.91 billion) last year, up 5.8 percent from NT$623.27 billion in 2015 and marking the highest level in the company’s history. The “smart” devices segment, which contributed more than 20 percent of its total revenue, was the main growth driver last year, the firm said. Credit Suisse expects Wistron to generate sales of NT$803.3 billion this year, up 22 percent year-on-year and 8 percent higher than the market consensus forecast. Wistron’s net profit reached NT$1.51 billion in the first three quarters of last year, which grew mildly by 1.34 percent from NT$1.45 billion in the same period a year earlier. The company is scheduled to release its earnings result for last quarter next month. This story has been viewed 2690 times. Comments will be moderated.

US President Donald Trump had announced before taking office a US$50 billion deal with SoftBank which he said would generate 50,000 jobs. Trump was speaking last month alongside SoftBank’s chief executive Masayoshi Son, who displayed a document which indicated Softbank and Foxconn would “commit to invest US$50bn + US$7bn in US, generate 50k + 50k new jobs in US in next four years.” Foxconn, a major supplier to Apple, had earlier said it was in “preliminary discussions” with US officials about a potential investment but gave no details. “I have discussed with my major clients about going to (the US) and they are also willing to invest, including Apple,” Terry Gou told reporters in Taipei after the company’s year-end party. The firm is the world’s largest contract electronics maker and is best-known for assembling products for international brands such as Apple and Sony. “Pennsylvania is active and I urge other states to act more quickly or I will sign the contract with Pennsylvania,” he said, adding that the investment could create 30,000-50,000 jobs. Foxconn is still waiting to see the tax policies of the new US government and what incentives state authorities can offer, such as cheap land and electricity. Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai, employs around a million workers at its factories across China and has operations in more than 10 countries. Last year it took over the struggling Japanese electronics maker Sharp after acquiring a 66 percent stake for US$3.7 billion in a move Gou described as “really worth it.” In the US, it has a plant in Virginia for packaging and engineering which employes over 400 people. It has also announced a US$40 million investment in a facility in Pennsylvania to build precision tools and develop a robotics program. Gou said Foxconn aims to increase investment in China this year to try to boost Sharp’s market share in the country.

We May Be 1 Step Closer to Having a Ron Weasley Emoji January 22, 2017 by Terry Carter 214 Shares A redheaded emoji may soon be a real thing if this latest rumor from Emojipedia is true. According to the report, Apple will be hosting a meeting next week to discuss ideas on how to incorporate redheads into its beloved Unicode emoji lineup. If the ideas submitted are approved, you can expect to see redhead emoji options available on your Apple devices as early as 2018. See what options have already been suggested for the ginger-haired emoji below. One option includes creating a new pale-skin emoji with red hair. Another option would feature red hair as an option for all emoji, regardless of skin color. Redheads may make up a small percentage of the total population — somewhere around two percent — but the lack of a copper-haired emoji option has been a sore spot, even prompting a petition in 2015. Whichever option the mysterious Apple emoji subcommittee chooses, it's safe to say redheads everywhere will be rejoicing about this news!

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple's Full lawsuit against Qualcomm Comes to Light Revealing Secret Licensing Agreements and more | Main | Samsung and Experts Point to a Short Circuit in the Batteries as the Fault of the Note7 Fires » January 22, 2017 Foxconn Reiterates their Plan for a U.S Plant   On January 13 Patently Apple posted a report titled "Foxconn Plan Close to Completion for a Massive U.S. Plant in the U.S. to Make LCD Displays and More." a Sharp executive stating that Hon Hai Precision Industry (Foxconn) and its Japanese subsidiary Sharp have begun studying the possibility of building a liquid crystal display panel plant in the U.S. The plan is "on the table," the executive said. "We will make a decision carefully." The report had estimated that the plant would cost as much as US $8.7 Billion.   In Reuters today they decided to twist the facts, as mainstream media continues their fake news barrage against President Trump. According to Reuters, "The plans come after U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to put "America First" in his inauguration speech on Friday, prompting Gou to warn about the rise of protectionism and a trend for politics to underpin economic development."   That's a strange twist of facts by Reuters. Softbank and Foxconn have been enthusiastic about expanding business opportunities in the United States under a Donald Trump administration as was witnessed on December 6, 2016 or a month and a half before his inauguration speech on Friday. Foxconn's name didn't accidentally fall onto the presentation sheet presented to Trump and seen by the entire world as noted below.   On December 7 we did a follow up story where we noted that Gou had said that it was in preliminary discussions to expand its operations in the United States. So between our December 6 and 7 reports along with our most recent January 13 report, we see that Reuters fudged the timing of the plant revelation and conditions which is a little disappointing.    After the Reuters twist of facts, they went on to state that Gou said that Foxconn, had been considering such a move for years but the issue came up when Foxconn business partner Masayoshi Son, head of Japan's SoftBank Group talked to Gou before a December meeting Son had with Trump.   As a result of the meeting, Son pledged a $50 billion of investment in the United States and inadvertently disclosed information showing Foxconn's logo and an unspecified additional $7 billion investment. At the time, Foxconn issued a brief statement saying it was in preliminary discussions to expand its U.S. operations, without elaborating.   Gou said he told Son that the United States has no panel-making industry but it is the second-largest market for televisions. An investment for a display plant would exceed $7 billion and could create about 30,000-50,000 jobs, Gou told Son.   Reuters lastly noted that "Foxconn has existing cooperation and operations in Pennsylvania, which is a state Foxconn would prioritize, depending on land, water, power, infrastructure and other investment conditions."   Update 6:53 PST: A new Nikkei report tonight adds a little more to today's story by adding that "Key iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry is mulling a joint investment with Apple topping $7 billion for a highly automated display facility in the U.S., Chairman Terry Gou said Sunday.   "Apple is willing to invest in the facility together because they need the [panels] as well," Gou told reporters after the company's annual year-end party in the Nankang district of Taipei. The U.S. production site eventually would create 30,000 to 50,000 jobs, the Taiwanese tycoon said."     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Sometimes right, sometimes wrong KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (via 9to5Mac) has predicted Apple will add upgraded sensors, including several new biometrics technologies, to its iPhone range. Specifically, Kuo predicts Apple will add the facial recognition tech alongside a new optical fingerprint sensor which will take the place of the current Touch ID capacitive fingerprint sensor, though the report does not reference the iPhone 8 directly. Related: MWC 2017 This will allow the company to integrate the sensor into the display, which leaves Apple free to increase the size of the screen and reduce the size of the bezels – a design feature which is heavily rumoured to appear on the iPhone 8. The new KGI report states the ‘under glass’ design of current fingerprint scanners aren't compatible with the kind of full-face display thought to be included on the iPhone 8. This new optical sensor will apparently be an ‘under panel’ system, which won't use the capacitive tech provided by AuthenTec, which Apple purchased in 2013. However, KGI says the optical replacement is still in the early development stages, which casts doubt over its debut on the iPhone 8 – expected to arrive later this year. Related: iPhone 8 - What we know That said, nearly every rumour we've heard has suggested Apple is planning to do away with the home button on its next handset, which seems to imply the company will indeed debut a new fingerprint scanning technology on the iPhone 8. And when it comes to the facial recognition, KGI echoes Arcuri's prediction of full-face recognition technology, and further states that it expects Apple to work towards using this type of scanning tech as the only way for users to unlock their phones, though a timeline is unclear. Again, the report doesn't say outright that any of these predicted new features will debut on the iPhone 8, and the information contained in the report is just that: a series of predictions.

The Nest Learning Thermostat retails for around $250 from most retailers. The Ecobee thermostat integrates with Amazon's Alexa home assistant and Apple's Siri.   By Jesse Darland CTW Features So-called smart thermostats are becoming more and more common. While there is no consensus on what exactly makes a thermostat "smart," homeowners should look for two key features. First, smart thermostats contain programming capabilities that go above and beyond the simple time-and-temp programming features found in the programmable thermostats of yore. Second, smart thermostats should be able to connect to your home's Wi-Fi. Why is Wi-Fi important? Having a connected device means you can control your home's temperature using a smartphone app or using a virtual assistant like Apple's Siri of Amazon's Alexis. This is a definite plus when your thermostat is on a different floor or on the far side of your home, or if you're traveling and remember that you forgot to adjust the temperature before leaving. "I love Wi-Fi thermostats," Steve Lauten, president of Total Air & Heat Company in Plano, Texas, says. "Basically a Wi-Fi thermostat gives you the ability to change the temperature in your house anywhere in the world. More advanced ones will even show you how much energy you're using, and can be set to go into energy-saving mode in periods of peak demand." A recent article on The Wirecutter, a website that tests and recommends the latest gadgets, took a look at the top smart thermostats on the market today. Their top pick was the Nest Learning Thermostat, on the market for about $250 from most retailers. As the original smart thermostat, Nest's offering has the advantage of being on the market the longest. The Wirecutter's reviewers note that it had the easiest, sleekest user interface, and that its "learning capabilities make the Nest the smartest smart thermostat around." The Nest will learn your home HVAC habits and even has sensors to see if you or your family is at home. Over a period of a few weeks, it will gradually create its own schedule of heating or cooling for maximum comfort. Coming in second place is the Ecobee3. One advantage of the Ecobee is that it comes with extra sensors, which can be placed in hot or cold spots in your home. This is especially helpful if you have a large home or a weak HVAC system. The Ecobee also integrates with Amazon's Alexa home assistant and Apple's Siri. As a budget pick, The Wirecutter recommends the Emerson Sensi thermostat. It doesn't have as many frills as the others, but it can run on AA batteries, unlike the Nest or Ecobee. (More on that in a moment.) And for those on a tight budget, the Sensi costs about half as much as the other picks. "Homeowners certainly need to keep in mind what type of system they have," Lauten says. "How you wire the thermostat is different depending if you're all electric or have a gas system. I'd recommend taking a picture of the wiring before starting, so that you make sure to wire it up the same way." Manufacturers include installation instructions for DIYers to consult. "Of course, we do get service calls because people install them wrong," Lauten says. He recommends that homeowners unsure about how to properly install their new smart thermostat contact a reputable HVAC contractor. Both Nest and Ecobee recommend that your home have what's called a C-wire -- a dedicated electric line that supplies enough juice to support the thermostats' power-hungry Wi-Fi functions. Depending on the age of your system, you might also need to have a contractor install the appropriate wiring. Most HVAC manufacturers offer their own Wi-Fi thermostats that are specifically paired with their equipment. These make sense if you're having a complete system installed, according to Francis Dietz, vice president of public affairs at the Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute. Dietz adds that even if homeowners aren't ready to invest in a smart thermostat, even a programmable thermostat offers some benefits. "These models can save homeowners money because they automatically adjust the temperature based on a homeowner's input depending on when the home will be occupied," he says, "eliminating the possibility of forgetting to set it properly. These devices also will remember the daytime or nighttime temperatures from season to season, so the homeowner does not have to."

Amazon moves up four spots to round out the top five. Netflix and Facebook join the top 10 for the first time, moving up 15 and 19 spots respectively. This year's list is a global group: 34 companies on the list are from the US, 10 are from Europe, and six from Asia. This regional mix represents a significant shift toward North American companies, which capture 68 per cent of the top 50, up from 44 per cent in 2013. BCG has surveyed more than 1,500 senior innovation executives—across a wide range of countries and industries— 11 times since 2004 to cast light on the state of innovation in business. In its new report, The Most Innovative Companies 2016: Getting Past “Not Invented Here,” the firm reveals the 50 companies that global innovation executives ranked as the most innovative and explores the increasing imperative for companies to bring in innovations from outside. “Given faster-changing markets—and the fact that even in more traditional sectors technology is becoming a key differentiator—a not-invented-here mindset can be fatal,” said BCG partner and report coauthor Andrew Taylor. “Today’s most successful innovators strike a strategic balance between internal and external innovation. They are smart and efficient at scanning for external ideas—and deft at bringing them inside.” The research finds a gap between the strongest innovators and their weaker peers in the pursuit of external ideas. Strong innovators take a more analytical approach, with 65 per cent reporting they find new ideas through social network and big data mining (compared with just 14 per cent for weak innovators). Strong innovators are also flexible in how they bring in innovations. For example, 66 per cent say that they find new ideas through external partnerships often or very often (versus just 22 per cent for weak innovators). According to BCG partner and report coauthor Michael Ringel: “We see innovators increasingly embracing advanced analytics to spot key technologies to license and targets for acquisition and partnership—allowing them to shorten development cycles and outrun competitors.” Companies seeking to tap the benefits of external innovation use a range of techniques, both structural and cultural, to bring outside ideas inside. “Leading innovators combat the not-invented-here mindset through structure and culture,” said BCG partner and report coauthor Hadi Zablit. “They complement traditional vehicles like joint ventures with newer approaches like corporate venture capital and incubators—and through incentives and leadership they foster a more outward-looking culture.” The data supports this point of view. For example, among strong innovators, 62 per cent use incubators (versus only 13 per cent of weak). And 80 per cent of strong innovators report their organization is open and collaborative (versus 22 per cent of weak). The report also features in-depth stories of companies that are rising to the external innovation challenge: • How Under Armour, a new entrant on the list, at number 22, has leveraged a mix of internal and external innovation to generate a 42.5 per cent total shareholder return from 2011 through 2015. • How Johnson & Johnson, number 29 on the list, structures itself to recognize and reward innovation no matter where it originates. • How Brooks Automation used innovation analytics to identify a major adjacent market opportunity that now represents 20 per cent of the company’s revenue and offers significant room to grow. - TradeArabia News Service Tags: Companies | innovative | List | BCG | More Miscellaneous Stories Abu Dhabi Crown Prince in India on 3-day visit Dial-A-Battery celebrates 5 years with additional services Abu Dhabi to host 2019 Special Olympics Abu Dhabi conference to tackle Mena food issues Dubai's Moral Machine throws up some surprises at Davos Two terror suspects killed in Jeddah anti-terror raids MEA to spearhead $2.2trn packaged food industry growth Masdar partners with Thales for hybrid airship Ramada Ajman to improve food waste management UAE releases report with 112 predictions at Davos UAE video surveillance market to hit $200m by 2021 Bahrain Award for Entrepreneurship enters quarter finals stage Clifford Chance ME team puts focus on Africa projects Dubai Culture appoints CEO of happiness Expo 2020 Dubai rolls out $100m scheme for creative projects Qatar cabinet approves new regulation on residency law Alison Nelson’s Chocolate Bar opens in Bahrain Seafood Market to celebrate 24 years of success New Belgium visa centre opens in Abu Dhabi Ebrahim K Kanoo sponsors Japan National Day reception Mena food output focus for Abu Dhabi summit New street food market to open in Dubai HMD Global launches first Nokia smartphone Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

While tech titans such as Google, Uber, and Apple along with almost every auto maker on the planet have poured resources into the development of autonomous vehicle technology, online retail giant Amazon has been relatively quiet on that front. But a recently approved patent shows the Seattle-based company could be ready to make a big move in the autonomous vehicle space. The patent doesn't suggest that Amazon plans to sell self-driving cars through Prime. (Imagine having a new car delivered to your door autonomously.) Nor will it enter the ride-sharing market to compete against Uber, or produce technology that goes into self-driving cars, like Google's latest autonomous vehicle pivot. Instead the patent, titled "Lane Assignments for Autonomous Vehicles," reveals a bigger-picture play that fits with Amazon's business strategy to deliver goods more efficiently. In particular, it provides a way to communicate with self-driving vehicles so they can adjust to changes in traffic flow when navigating what's known as reversible lanes that switch direction depending on the volume of the traffic flow and are often used to manage vehicle travel in and out of urban areas. The patent, which was originally filed in November 2015 but granted earlier this week, notes that autonomous vehicles "may not have information about reversible lanes when approaching a portion of a roadway" that uses them. And it provides a glimpse of why Amazon would want to control traffic patterns as they relate to self-driving cars. Anticipating Reversible Lanes There's the obvious safety benefit of having self-driving cars—or in Amazon's case, autonomous delivery trucks and vans—not driving the wrong way in traffic and causing a head-on collision. But not being able to anticipate reversible lanes also means delivery trucks can't optimize their routes in advance, which means they'll spend more time in traffic, something Amazon wants to avoid. Related Driverless Cars: When the Internet Takes the Wheel Driverless Cars: When the Internet Takes the Wheel The patent doesn't reveal much about Amazon's own plans to develop self-driving vehicles. But it's not a stretch to imagine that autonomous vehicles could be an essential part of the Amazon Logistics division, which it launched in 2012 to take more direct control of its delivery network. And self-driving delivery trucks and vans would be a natural extension to Amazon's purchase of robotics firm Kiva Systems in 2012, which helped it automate its distribution centers. Another interesting twist is that the division of Amazon leading its autonomous-vehicle research is its drone project, Prime Air. And one of the inventors listed on the patent, Jim Curlander, is a technical adviser at Prime Air. It's easy to put the pieces together based on the recent Amazon patent and see it as a way for self-driving trucks to move goods more efficiently to consumers—and eventually eliminate delivery drivers. But I believe there's something larger at play here. When Amazon has entered markets such as streaming content or cloud services, the online retail giant has made a significant impact. With this patent, Amazon is not only extending its influence to self-driving technology and to the delivery business, but how traffic moves in and out of cities—and to the control of self-driving cars.

( AAPL ) has filed a $1 billion lawsuit against Qualcomm Inc. ( QCOM ) on Friday, accusing the chipmaker of charging royalties for technologies it has nothing to do with and for not paying about $1 billion in promised rebates. According to Apple, the maker of iPhones, as it innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays and cameras, Qualcomm collects royalties for no reason and thus, it becomes more expensive for Apple to fund these innovations. Apple accused Qualcomm of charging it at least five times in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors that Apple has agreements with combined. Qualcomm is a key supplier of modem chips to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co. (SMSN.L, SSNNF.OB, SSNLF.OB). "We are extremely disappointed in the way Qualcomm is conducting its business with us and unfortunately after years of disagreement over what constitutes a fair and reasonable royalty we have no choice left but to turn to the courts," Apple added. Qualcomm responded on Saturday by saying that Apple's claims are "baseless". Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm said, "Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm's business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information." "We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple's practices and a robust examination of the merits," Rosenberg added. Apple's lawsuit comes after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or FTC said earlier this week that it filed a lawsuit, charging Qualcomm with using anticompetitive tactics to maintain its monopoly in the supply of a key semiconductor device used in cell phones and other consumer products. In December 2016, the Korea Fair Trade Commission or KFTC fined Qualcomm about 1.03 trillion South Korean won or about $865 million, saying it found certain of Qualcomm's business practices in violation of Korean competition law.

MenuClose Articles ADVERTISE Twitter Articles ADVERTISE Twitter Brexit leads to higher prices for iOS apps January 22, 2017- Staff The pound’s falling value following last June’s referendum to leave the European Union means users of Apple’s iPad and iPhone are set to pay a lot more for their mobile fun. App developers contacted by the US-based tech giant have been told that it’s raising prices and that, as a result of the change, an app which previously costed 79p will now cost 99p. The new prices numerically match those charged in the US version of the Appstore, meaning that a 99 cent app in the US will now cost 99p here in the UK. Apple says prices are also going up in India and Turkey so that the cost of a $0.99 app will become 80 rupees in India, representing a 33% rise from the previous price, while in n Turkey it will change from 2.69 to 3.49 lira, an increase of 30%. In a statement, Apple said: “Price tiers on the App Store are set internationally on the basis of several factors, including currency exchange rates, business practices, taxes, and the cost of doing business. “These factors vary from region to region and over time.” The price rise will also affect in-app purchases, although not subscription charges, and follows the firm’s recent hiking of prices for its computer range. Since the launch of the iPhone, mobile apps have soared in popularity with users downloading a growing range of games, utilities and apps giving access to services such as BBC iPlayer, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. More than two million apps are available, either paid-for, free such as Euro Palace online casino or free but offering in-app purchases. This week’s pricing announcement comes just days after Apple announced it had enjoyed “its busiest single day ever on New Year’s Day” this year and claimed developers had enjoyed “a year of unprecedented earnings”. According to the firm, developers earned over $20 billion in 2016, up over 40 per cent from 2015. In total developers have earned over $60 billion since the App Store launched in 2008. Apple says Nintendo’s Super Mario Run made history by scoring more than 40 million downloads in the four days after its release. The game was the most downloaded app globally on Christmas Day and New Year’s Day. It was also among last year’s top 10 most downloaded apps worldwide, with Pokémon Go taking the top spot. Independent developers also enjoyed successes with apps such as Prisma, Reigns, Procreate, Lumino City, Sweat With Kayla and djay Pro while other players enjoyed playing progressive jackpots at Euro Palace. “2016 was a record-shattering year for the App Store, generating $20 billion for developers, and 2017 is off to a great start with Jan. 1 as the single biggest day ever on the App Store,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “We want to thank our entire developer community for the many innovative apps they have created — which together with our products — help to truly enrich people’s lives.” Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Related SPONSORED VIDEO Recent FROM : streamedTV Amazon announces launch date for new Kevin Bacon series, I Love Dick Netflix announces House of Cards return date Amazon secures global SVOD rights to BBC’s Good Omens adaptation Jerry Seinfeld and Netflix sign exclusive deal RECENT ADDITIONS Frank Warren announces details of first fights to be shown on BT Sport January 23, 2017 By Staff Star Wars Episode VIII title confirmed January 23, 2017 By Staff Life on the Line – John Travolta’s best action roles January 23, 2017 By Martin Hoscik Boo!

Imagine seniors walking around with stylish ear devices that amplify and clarify sound and connect wirelessly to smart phones, tablets, televisions and digital assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa or Apple’s Siri. That day is coming, sooner than you may think. Technology is already moving in this direction, and consumer marketers such as Samsung, Bose Corp., and Panasonic Corp. are reportedly readying new products of this kind. They’ll be sold over the counter, to customers who will test their own hearing with cell phone apps or online programs and adjust sound parameters themselves. The devices “will be widely used by older people,” just as earbuds are used by younger people today, predicted Richard Einhorn, a well-known composer who serves on the board of the Hearing Loss Association of America, a consumer group. Recognizing market forces, the Food and Drug Administration is mobilizing. In December, Dr. Robert Califf, the FDA’s commissioner, said the agency planned to take “steps necessary to propose to modify our regulations to create a category of (over-the-counter) hearing aids.” On Jan. 4, the Federal Trade Commission announced plans for a major meeting on hearing health care in April. That agency played an important role in ensuring that consumers get copies of eyeglass prescriptions so they could shop around for good deals. For the most part, that doesn’t happen with hearing aids today. Whether agency priorities will change under the new Trump administration isn’t certain. But technology is developing rapidly under any circumstances. Older adults with mild to moderate hearing loss, including aging baby boomers, are expected to be a prime market for a new generation of products marrying hearing aid and consumer electronics hearable technologies. More than 40 percent of people over the age of 60 have some degree of hearing loss, mostly mild to moderate; that rises to 80 percent of people older than 80. Yet only 20 percent of those with some degree of impairment use hearing aids because of their high cost (an average $4,700 per pair), the lack of insurance coverage (traditional Medicare doesn’t pay for hearing aids), stigma, denial and difficulty navigating the hearing health system. Hoping to expand access, the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology came out in favor of low-cost, over-the-counter hearing devices in October 2015. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine seconded that recommendation in a major report on hearing health care published in June. Both organizations cite a growing body of research linked hearing loss to cognitive decline, depression, the onset of dementia, falls, poor physical functioning and social isolation. The longer people delay seeking help, research suggests, the more at risk they become. Several recent developments are of note as consumer electronics companies, hearing aid manufacturers, audiologists, physicians, consumer advocates and regulators prepare for a surge of new hearing devices and changes in the hearing health care system: REMOVING BARRIERS For 40 years, the FDA has required that adults be examined by a doctor before purchasing a hearing aid or sign a waiver noting that they didn’t want to take this step. Last month, the agency eliminated that requirement for people over the age of 18. The National Academies of Sciences’ expert panel on hearing health had noted that the rule “provides no clinically meaningful benefit” and could discourage people from seeking care. Instead of seeing a physician, adults signed the waiver 60 to 95 percent of the time. Still, limits on access to hearing aids exist: All states restrict distribution of these devices to certified audiologists, physicians and device specialists. And some states still require medical evaluations. PROPOSED LEGISLATION Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said last month that they would soon introduce new legislation endorsing over-the-counter hearing aids, sold without those restrictions. The goal is to increase competition, lower costs and expand access to devices for people with mild to moderate hearing loss, Grassley said in a statement. Currently, six companies control nearly 98 percent of the hearing aid market in the U.S., contributing to high prices. Nearly two-thirds of people with severe hearing loss — many of them elderly — report being unable to afford the devices. The cost is generally “bundled” with professional fees for evaluation, fitting and follow-up care. Organizations representing hearing professionals are deeply divided. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, an organization representing audiologists and speech-language pathologists, doesn’t believe consumers can adequately self-diagnose hearing problems and opposes over-the-counter devices. The American Academy of Audiology, which represents more than 12,000 audiologists, believes professionals should evaluate hearing loss but is taking a “wait and see stance” until the FDA proposes a regulatory framework, its president, Ian Windmill, said. Another audiologist group, the Academy of Doctors of Audiology, believes the benefits of expanded access to hearing devices outweigh the risks and supports over-the-counter products. The senators plan to introduce their legislation, which asks the FDA to issue regulations ensuring the safety and effectiveness of these devices, in this new congressional session. “Administrations shift and legal challenges occur,” Grassley said, adding that getting the law on the books would ensure needed “certainty going forward.” CREATING STANDARDS One area of considerable confusion is the distinction between hearing aids and personal sound amplification products, known as PSAPs. This is a wide category of products, ranging from cheap devices that help amplify sound to sophisticated devices that resemble hearing aids in all but their name. In some cases, companies are marketing the exact same device as a hearing aid and a PSAP, sold at different prices. In 2009, the FDA drew a distinction between PSAPs and hearing aids based on their “intended use.” PSAPs were considered unregulated consumer electronics products for people with normal hearing who wanted to hear more sharply — for instance, during bird watching. Hearing aids were regulated and considered medical devices meant for people with hearing impairment. But technological advances have brought the two categories closer. And it’s well understood that people with hearing loss are using PSAPs as a cheaper alternative to hearing aids. Going forward, Stephanie Czuhajewski, executive director of the Academy of Doctors of Audiology, believes higher-end PSAPs will become over-the-counter hearing aids. In the meantime, the Consumer Technology Association has prepared standards for PSAPs meant to make it easier for consumers to understand what they’re buying. The standards, which address issues such as maximum output, peak output and sound distortion, and are under review at the American National Standards Institute and could be published as early as next month. “The intent is to provide a ‘Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval’ for PSAPs,” said Mead Killion, an audiologist who founded Etymotic Research Inc., an Illinois company that manufactures hearing devices. Currently, there is no easy, standardized way to compare these devices.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish iPhone 8 Could Feature New Touch ID Technology By Tyler Lee on 01/22/2017 01:47 PST Recently a report from analyst Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company revealed that he expects 2017’s iPhone 8 to feature a wraparound display and new sensors. One of those new sensors would be Touch ID where due to the wraparound display, a new version of Touch ID will be required. Turns out he’s not alone in his predictions because according to a new report from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, it seems that he shares a similar belief as well. According to Kuo, he believes that Apple is expected to feature a new Touch ID sensor in the iPhone 8. He states that the new Touch ID system is expected to find its way under the panel of the display, which seems to be in line with earlier rumors that Apple could be ditching the home button. He also suggests that Apple could be moving from a capacitive sensor to that of an optical sensor, but he says that because of the difficulty of manufacturing the technology, it might not necessarily debut with the iPhone 8, but it’s a feature we can expect in future iOS devices anyway. However it seems that fingerprint security won’t be the only form of security Apple could employ. Kuo states that facial recognition could be a possibility where it will try to recognize the user’s entire face rather than just the iris, and that eventually Apple could ditch Touch ID for facial recognition instead. Take it all with a grain of salt for now, but Kuo’s predictions have been pretty spot on all these years, so there could be some truth to his clams. Filed in Apple >Cellphones >Rumors.

TomTom acquires Autonomos to beef up in self-driving technology Posted Jan 18, 2017 by Ingrid Lunden (@ingridlunden) 0 SHARES Next Story Flipkart backs parenting network TinyStep with $2 million investment Navigation and mapping company TomTom — which provides data to companies like Uber and Apple as well as for its own GPS systems — has made an acquisition to add more autonomous driving technology to its platform. It has acquired Autonomos, a Berlin startup that has worked in R&D consultancy for various self-driving projects out of Germany. Financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed. Autonomos was founded in 2012 by a group of computer science and artificial intelligence academics who had worked on driving projects at the Free University of Berlin. That has included building vehicles for the DARPA Grand Challenge competitions. TomTom said the Autonomos team will work on map-based products for autonomous driving applications, including its HD map, RoadDNA localisation technology, as well as its navigation, traffic and other cloud services. “We are proud to have been selected by the world leader in map making for bringing autonomous driving together to the next level,” says Tinosch Ganjineh, CEO and co-founder of Autonomos. “TomTom’s technology combined with our intelligent driving know-how are a perfect match to make the dream of self-driving cars become a reality” The company was largely bootstrapped, with a small investments from an angel, Alfred Möckel from Alubi capital GmbH, and the Investitionsbank Berlins Profit financing program for young companies. “We have always worked with pioneer customers from different sectors and grew from project to project,” Patrick Vogel, its CFO, told TechCrunch. “Basically we have been bootstrapping until yesterday and focused on testing the feasibility of different approaches while building a talented team of 32 people. We came to the conclusion, that for the next big steps the TomTom technology platform offers the perfect match to follow up on our ideas. We expect that we can help to further improve their products already in development and we will help to develop completely new, additional components for the autonomous driving market.” He added that it will likely be run as a separate R&D unit in the TomTom Automotive & Licensing business and remain in Berlin. “We will continue to get our technology in the market through cooperating with selected OEMs and tier 1s. We do not intend to get into car manufacturing or our own mobility services,” he said. Right now is an interesting moment in the car industry, with all automakers building up their expertise in self-driving technology and working on their own models for how to implement this idea. Alongside them, larger tech companies like Google and Apple, as well as outsized transportation startup Uber, are also building their own technology for the space. But in many cases, given the complexity of the task in front of them, they are working with a host of partners as well, and that is where TomTom comes into the picture. It must also build up expertise in this area, or risk becoming dated in what it can provide to its customers. “This is an important development for TomTom as it will help us to continue to strengthen our capabilities for the future of driving and expand our knowledge and expertise,” says Harold Goddijn, CEO and co-founder of TomTom, in a statement. “With this deal we are further positioning ourselves as one of the leaders in autonomous driving.” The group’s expertise includes developing a full demonstration-level autonomous driving software stack, 3D sensor technology, and digital image processing. Looking at their past and current projects, their work has pushed some of the more tricky and challenging use cases of where self-driving cars might go. They include building a car that has driven around traffic in Berlin and operated as a taxi, a car that was controlled with your brain, a car controlled by your eye, one that was controlled by your iPhone. Two of these cases are particularly interesting, considering TomTom’s work with Uber and Apple. But there is also TomTom’s own business development to consider, too. The company has been working on incorporating its GPS technology — the basis of its own mapping devices — to self-driving cars. Part of this has included charting 200,000 kilometers of roads in the U.S., France and Germany with highly automated driving (HAD) maps. HAD maps are a 3D mapping technology that is used by automated driving vehicles to drive from point A to point B, used often in complement with other sensors to see what is around and in front of the car.

Antwort schreiben Die Moralapostel sind wieder unterwegs von Walter Goetze 22.01.2017 1 Antwort Ich fonde es so langsam zum Kotzen, wenn all und jedes auf die Goldwaage gelegt wird von sogenannten Moralaposteln! Unsere Welt wird an denen noch zugrunde gehen. Was ist da bosonderes dran? Früher sagte man Neger, na und. Das bezeichnete die Hautfarbe, nichts anderes. Und wie sieht es aus mit dem Wort Rothaut? Auch rassistisch? Oder die Gelben aus dem Land der aufgehenden Sonne? Müssen wir jetzt Worte verändern? Wie wollen wir Gelbfieber nennen? Vorschläge bitte! Antwort schreiben Nun, ... von Marie Straut 22.01.2017 .... Erklärungen helfen nicht weiter beim "Pack". Aber so wollen die Bürger, die sich wie Sie äußern, ja nicht genannt werden. Andere Vorschläge? Wen interessiert es, von Tiberius Keltenberg 22.01.2017 Frau Schotte darf natürlich ihrem persönlichen Rassismus frönen. In Belgien gibt es schließlich auch die Meinungsfreiheit. Wenn man als öffentliche Person, zu einem Thema Stellung bezieht, dann sollte man diese auch konsequent vertreten. Als Belgiens Schönheitskönigin, sollte man ein Mindestmaß an Vorbildlichkeit zeigen, muss man aber nicht. Das späte bedauern und herumheulen machen es nur noch erbärmlicher! Jeder Mensch hat Vorurteile aber auch Ideale, denen man möglicherweise nicht immer gerecht werden kann. Wenn Sie ihre wahrgenommene Realität mit Rassismus erklären will, bitte sehr! Ich bin ihr sicher nicht böse! Neme soucie pas! Antwort schreiben Krankes Europa von Andreas Gross 22.01.2017 Und wo ist das Problem? Doch wohl eher in den vielen Verbrechen die unsere von den Politikern so geliebten Fachkräfte begehen, den immensen Sozialleistungen die diese beziehen und dem Terror den sie bringen. Aber stimmt das ist ja alles nichts gegen einen Fan Kommentar auf einer Webseite. Antwort schreiben Immer diese Aufreger von Friedrich Müller 22.01.2017 “Mein Vater arbeitet oft in Afrika. Wie kann ich da rassistisch sein?" Unter Entwicklungshelfern kursiert der Spruch: "Als Idealist raus, als Rassist wieder heim". Afrika ist ein grosser und schöner Kontinent. Ich empfehle eine längere Auslandstätigkeit in Afrika im Bereich Management, sehr interessant, sehr bereichernd. Wir sprechen uns dann. Antwort schreiben Oh mein Gott von Volker Degener 22.01.2017 Und worum geht es dabei? Nur um das böse Wort "Neger", das vor 20 Jahren noch jeder sagen durfte ohne als Rassist abgestempelt zu werden? Das diese Bezeichnung für Schwarze (darf man das noch benutzen?) uralt ist und erst in unserer Zeit durch Leute zum Unwort deklariert wurde, interessiert ja nicht. Ebenso wenig wie der Grund, warum der Nutzer auf diesen Mann hinwies und die junge Frau ablehnend reagierte. Die selbst ernannten Moralisten sollten sich mal überlegen ob man in einer Welt leben möchte, wo Kriege, Gewalt und Morde allgegenwärtig sind, und wir uns über "böse" Begriffe das Maul zerreißen und Menschen an den Pranger stellen, die überhaupt nichts gemacht haben. Antwort schreiben Drei Zeilen von Christof Kochanowski 22.01.2017 und ein Zeichen sollen gleich einen Menschen als Rassisten darstellen? In welchen Zeiten leben wir eigentlich, wo jedes Wort und jedes Zeichen auf die Goldwaage gelegt wird? Anscheinend haben viele Moralapostel nichts anderes zu tun, als den ganzen Tag zu denunzieren. Gott war das Leben früher schön.

Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for "modem" chips that help phones connect to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm's $23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. In the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for its chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates for chip purchases. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm withheld the rebates because of Apple's discussions with South Korea's antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission. "If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm's release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused," Apple said in its lawsuit. Qualcomm did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Apple lawsuit. The KFTC fined Qualcomm Inc 1.03 trillion won ($854 million) in December for what it called unfair practices in patent licensing, a decision the U.S. chipmaker said it will challenge in court. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China following a 14-month probe, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. In Washington on Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, saying the San Diego-based company used its dominant position as a supplier of certain phone chips to impose "onerous" supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers like Apple and to weaken competitors. Qualcomm said on Tuesday it would contest the FTC complaint. Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modem chips for Apple’s phones until the release of the iPhone 7 in September. Intel Corp supplied about half of the modem chips for the newest models, said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Apple made the move around the same time that Samsung, which had switched to using its own internal chips for its Galaxy S6 phones, returned to Qualcomm for the Galaxy S7. Qualcomm "has been able to manage through (the Apple contract loss) pretty well because they got back Samsung at the same time," Rasgon said. Apple is known for seeking multiple suppliers to keep prices down, said Jim Morrison, vice president of technical intelligence for TechInsights, which tears down devices to analyze their parts. "It promotes competition in the supply chain because everybody wants to be the dominant supplier to Apple," Morrison said.

Madrigal Jul 17, 2013 Technology Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size You may not know this, but Chuck E. Cheese's -- yes, the pizza place -- has its origins as firmly planted in the soil of Silicon Valley as Apple, HP, or Intel. In fact, it sprang from Nolan Bushnell's Atari like Athena to the videogame company's Zeus. Which is to say two things: one, if you grew up in the 1980s, the same guy -- Bushnell -- is basically responsible for a good portion of your childhood longings; and two, WHAT! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! THAT'S CRAZY. This connection got me thinking wild thoughts. I got very excited about the hypothetical secret history of Chuck E. Cheese's. Perhaps Bushnell used an early computer to calculate precisely how to burrow Chuck E. Cheese's brand into the very soul of every 7-year-old in America! And did he imagine that the animatronic rat mascot and his friends were going to be the leading edge of a personality-infused robotic future? (iChuckECheese!) I had to talk to Bushnell. Desperately. Finally someone would understand his vision for the animatronic revolution. Luckily, a colleague put us in touch, and we spoke yesterday. And he revealed the hilarious origins of Chuck E. Cheese's, the Silicon Valley pizza joint startup. I'm just going to walk us through what he said, interjecting where appropriate. "It was my pet project. I started it inside Atari. My objective was to vertically integrate the market. We were selling coin-operated games at about $1,500 or $2,000 a pop. In their life, they'd make $15 to 20k. It didn't take rocket science to say I'm on the wrong side of the equation," he told me. "I didn't want to compete with the people I was selling to, but the game operating business is all about securing locations. So the way to not compete with them was to secure my own locations. The original genesis was to create a big arcade with food as a support structure, almost as an ancillary service." Why pizza? Good question. "I chose pizza because of the wait time and the build schedule: very few components and not too many ways to screw it up. If the dough is good, the cheese is good, and the sauce is good, the pizza is good. I didn't have any preconceived idea that I knew how to run a restaurant, but I knew simple was better." Who describes food in terms of a "build schedule"? I told you Chuck E. Cheese's was a Silicon Valley startup. Bushnell wanted the minimal viable restaurant platform on which to offer his game services. But why did he need all the entertainment stuff? "The reason for doing the animals, believe it or not, was not for the kids. It was meant to be a head fake for the parents. Kids are really smart at knowing how to play their parents. and the kids knew that if they said, 'I want to go to Chuck E. Cheese and play the games' the parents would just see themselves spending money. But if they said, 'I want to go see Chuck E. Cheese entertainment -- and it's free,' they'd be good to go," Bushnell said. "The other thing was that we wanted the parents to have something to amuse themselves while the kids were in the game room. If you listened to the dialogue, it was fun, edgy stuff, kinda like Toy Story, written as much for the parents as the kids." Fair enough.  But why choose giant singing robotic animals for your entertainment?  It seemed crazy to me, even as a kid. Turns out it was, roughly, chance. Several things Bushnell happened to see hybridized in his imagination into a monstrous and wonderful new pizza joint chimera.  "The synthesis came along because there was a pizza parlor called Pizza and Pipes. It basically resurrected a Wurlitzer theater organ and the place was packed when they had an organist that actually played on the thing. And I thought, there is a demand for some kind of entertainment to go along with the pizza. But I'm not going to have something that heeds a player and I'm not going to do something that requires finding and restoring an antique. And some time as I was doing this, I went to Disneyland and went to the Tiki Room. It was Disney's animatronics. I said, 'That's pretty simple. I bet I can get my engineers to knock that out.'" The synthesis, then, is entertainment pizza theater minus the humans. How about that for "labor efficiency"? Assuming animatronic control, the real problem, Bushnell imagined, was getting characters that looked good. But that worked out happily. "As the project got close to being green-lighted, I happened to be at a trade show in Orlando. The IAAPA. The International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions. There was a group there selling walkaround costumes." What's a walkaround costume? It's the kind of enormous wearable costume that sports mascots and Sesame Street characters get into. Here are some from a recent IAAPA expo. Just your standard human-sized furry costumes (flickr/davecobb). "The operating name for the project, the codename, was Coyote Pizza," he said. "And I saw this Coyote costume. I went over, gave them my credit card, and had them ship it to the restaurant. I knew my guys could make him talk. I didn't know if they could make anything that looked like a coyote. Now I had my coyote." OR SO HE THOUGHT. DUN DUN DUN. "I went to where they were working and said, 'How's the coyote coming?' And they said, 'What coyote? You sent us a rat costume. I said, 'I'll just change the name to Rick Rat's Pizza.'" YES, Chuck E. Cheese, the most-famous rodent in American childhood branding not in the Mickey Mouse clan, was supposed to be a coyote. And then, the first choice for Chuck E. Cheese's name was Rick Rat's Pizza. Luckily, Bushnell's marketing angels convinced him Rick Rat's Pizza (!) wasn't such a good name for an establishment that had to go before a health inspector. "My marketing department just had a shitfit: 'You can't call a restaurant a rat place! People think rats are dirty. It's not going to work,'" he said. "But what if he is a rat but you don't call him a rat, I suggested. 'You name it,' I told them. 'I don't give a shit what it is. But it has to be happy.' A week later, they said, we got the name. And not only is it happy, it's triple happy: Chuck E. Cheese, you can't say each one of those without smiling." No, seriously, isn't that the best possible way that Chuck E. Cheese could have been dreamed up by a marketing department? And it's triple happy. Take that, character from Mad Men! Listening to all this, I had a terrifying thought: the creation of Chuck E. Cheese's was completely contingent. The pizza time theater may never have been founded. All historical narratives are a lie, basically. And furthermore, given that Chuck E. Cheese's was a necessary component of childhood, in the many alternate universes in which Chuck E. Cheese's never came into being (remaining Coyote Pizza or Rick Rat's Pizza), could childhood even exist? Or perhaps at least the structural features of Chuck E. Cheese were more likely than Bushnell's telling reveals. Our resident Chuck E. Cheese expert, Georgia Tech professor and Atlantic Tech contributor Ian Bogost, argued in a 2007 paper that Cheese's is a logical recombination of Bushnell's prior interests and market forces. As tavern culture gave way to the video arcade of the late 1970s and early 1980s, secondary pursuits like ordering food gave way to the primary pursuit of additional gameplay. Arcades had more in common with casinos than taverns, and Bushnell, ever the entrepreneur, recognized this as a market opportunity: he would create an arcade space with the additional social and gastronomical goals of a tavern. While still at Atari, he founded Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theaters, a place for kids and families to eat pizza and play games. Here Bushnell combined all of his prior influences. Chuck E. Cheese's was an arcade: its games encouraged continued play and cross-cabinet play. It was a restaurant: food and drink drew players to the locale and kept them there longer. And it was a midway: players collected tickets from games of skill and chance like skeeball in the hopes of exchanging them for prizes. Phew. History is saved! In any case, who dreamed up the all the little skits that the characters had to do? "Mike Hatcher. He was a really good programmer, a puppeteer, and a screenwriter. He wrote and designed the authoring system that programmed the units," Bushnell said. "He'd sit back with the impresario and program the movements one at a time, basically to coordinate with a tape." The San Jose Mercury News ran a short story about Hatcher in 1979 that revealed the following facts: 1. It took him three hours of programming for every one minute of animation. 2. There were often 200 movements going on at once during the shows. 3. Poor Hatcher had to work the graveyard shift. But how'd the characters actually move? Did they have motors? "No, they were all pneumatic," Bushnell explained. "Factories are run on pneumatic. The [components] are cheap and they never wear out. They just run and run and run. It's probably the most robust motion technology in the world." Yes, pneumatic as in pneumatic tubes! And how'd they build the animatrons? "You start with the armature and then you dress it. Pretty much they were the same inside. There were two different jaws, if you're a dog versus Mr. Bunch. If you were a snout animal, you had a different jaw. We also had one for beaks." I wanted to know, though: did Bushnell take the animatronic bits seriously? Like, did he see them having their own trajectory, one with lots of potential? "We saw them as being our advertisement and our freebie," he said. "We tried to assume that if people came back every month, they'd want to see something different. So we tried to change the skit every month." That's not to say that they didn't work hard at improving the acts. "We went through a phase where we would have separate rooms with lounge acts. The cabaret, for example. We had an Elvis impersonator. We had a Dolly Dimples, which was a piano torch singer," he said. "They had personalities and you know, Chuck E. Cheese was a wise guy, kind of abusing the other people. The hound dog was stupid as shit, so it was a great thing for Chuck E. to be describing something really slowly and dumbed down. Mr. Munch who loved to eat everything. He was kind of our Cookie Monster, and we took the Cookie Monster and turned him into a garbage can with a vacuum to suck stuff out of your hand." But did he truly see it as interactive entertainment or just some hokie crap? Despite his answer below, I'm not sure I truly know how he feels about his creations. "I saw it absolutely as interactive entertainment. Understand the timeline. I started Chuck E. just before I sold Atari to Warner and Warner didn't want to have anything to do with it. They said 'Sell it,' and I said, 'I'll buy it,' and they sold it to me. I was still CEO of Atari and building the restaurants on the side. I had a president of the restaurants and he got the technology and the licensing. Then restaurants started just coining money and then after the sale, [Warner's people got] tired of me and I was tired of them, so it was very easy for me to spend full time working on Chuck E. Cheese. We built it up to about 250 restaurants before I sold out." It got a messy towards the end of Bushnell's involvement with Chuck E. Cheese in the mid-1980s. I don't want to get into the details, which are dizzyingly complex and contested, but suffice to say: the chain's fortunes went up and down, and there was a splinter chain, an IPO and a bankruptcy. It's complicated. In the end, Bushnell says that he cleared maybe $35 million from his pizza entrepreneurship. "$35 million isn't bad," I offered. "It wasn't bad, but it wasn't $200 million," he replied. But hadn't he helped animatronics escape the truly strange confines of the amusement park? Wasn't that something? "If you really try to stack up the entertainment that was delivered by our animals: It was not great. You know? It was amusing to a captive audience, and you can kind of pull it off in 15-20 minute increments at Disneyland, but ..." You take that back, Bushnell! Chuck E. Cheese's was a work of genius! Perhaps, I ventured, it was time for an animatronic renaissance. I told him about Skylanders, the newish billion dollar franchise for Activision that roughly merges real world toys with digital characters. And then there is the company Anki, a robotics and gaming company that wants to bring physical characters to life. "We're giving physical characters the ability to know where they're located in an environment and what's around them and to be able to come to life and execute a person, intention, a personality," Anki's CEO told me. Weren't all these things pointers to a revival of the vision, or at least some derivative of this strange merging of software and physical characters? Maybe Teddy Ruxpin and his ilk were just false starts and now the real animatronic revolution could begin! "I don't think I'd back that venture," he said. But. But.

Twitter Email Most Popular Presented by Lucas Jackson / Reuters 'All of This Space Was Full': A Photographic Fact Check Alan Taylor White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer’s assertion that the National Mall was "full when the president took the Oath of Office" is demonstrably false. On January 21, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer issued a statement criticizing journalists for their coverage of President Trump's inauguration. Some media outlets, Spicer claimed, were using photographs of the event in misleading and deceptive ways. To back this claim up, Spicer made a number of assertions that turned out to be false. He offered incorrect D.C. Metro-ridership numbers, and said that white ground coverings had never been used on the Mall during Inauguration before, when they had been employed in 2013. Two days later, during his first press conference, Spicer blamed the bad Metro numbers on an "outside agency" and stated that his claim about the "largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period," was meant to include all viewership, in person and online, rather than referring to the in-person crowd specifically. Continue Reading Carlos Barria / Reuters How Ultrasound Became Political Moira Weigel The technology has been used to create sped-up videos that falsely depict a response to stimulus. One of the first measures that Republicans in the 115th Congress proposed was the “Heartbeat Protection Act.” On January 11, a group led by Steve King of Iowa introduced a bill that would require doctors nationwide to “check for a fetal heartbeat” before performing an abortion, and prohibit them from completing the procedure if they found one. In December, Republicans in the Ohio state legislature put forth a similar measure. Governor John Kasich vetoed it, observing that such a law would almost certainly be struck down as unconstitutional, but approved a 20-week abortion ban. Opponents of the heartbeat bills have pointed out that they would eliminate abortion rights almost entirely—making the procedure illegal around four weeks after fertilization, before many women realize that they are pregnant. These measures raise even more elementary questions: What is a fetal heartbeat? And why does it matter? Continue Reading Jonathan Ernst / Reuters Is Trump's Presidency Off to a Successful Start? David A. Graham Overshadowed by headlines about chaos and infighting, the new administration is notching a string of early victories. From some angles, the Trump presidency is off to a rocky start. There were the somewhat disappointing crowds at the inauguration, and then the needless lies about them, presented as “alternative facts.” There’s the controversy over Trump’s remarks to the CIA, and precisely who in the crowd cheered his visit. On Monday, the president repeated a dumb and unnecessary lie about illegal ballots having cost him the popular vote during a meeting with members of Congress. The Washington Post reports in detail on White House infighting and an attempted reboot—just four days into the administration. ABC’s The Note frowns, “He can’t help himself, and he isn’t helping himself.” But what if the Trump presidency is actually off to a surprisingly effective start? For months, Trump has shown a perverse ability to overshadow his own message with chaos and disorder, and the first five days of his administration fit right into that pattern. Continue Reading Carlos Barria / Reuters Professionalism, Propaganda, and the Press Adam Serwer The Trump administration seems wedded to a political strategy of lying to the public, challenging the media to adjust. Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s senior counselor, called Press Secretary Sean Spicer’s first official press conference a “tour de force.” That’s not strange, because Trump advisers’ main rhetorical approach is to reflect their boss’ penchant for exaggeration. What’s strange is that much of the media seemed to agree. Two days earlier, reporters from mainstream outlets had panned a bizarre appearance by Spicer in which, flanked by photographs of the inauguration, he loudly berated the media, saying that the press had “engaged in deliberately false reporting” for failing to note that “this was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration––period––both in person and around the globe.” Spicer also berated a reporter for erroneously reporting that Trump had removed a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. from the White House, even though the reporter had apologized on social media, an apology Spicer accepted. Continue Reading Evan Vucci / AP Trump’s Dakota Access Pipeline Memo: What We Know Right Now Robinson Meyer The White House didn’t release the text of the executive order at first. Updated on January 24 at 2:45 p.m. On Tuesday afternoon, President Donald Trump signed a memorandum ordering the Secretary of the Army to expedite approval of the Dakota Access Pipeline, a 1,100-mile pipeline linking the North Dakota oil fields to a river terminal in Illinois. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied final approval to the project late last year, after months of protests from the local Standing Rock Sioux tribe and from Native people nationwide. The text of Trump’s executive memorandum has now been made public. It can be found on Document Cloud. He also issued an executive order expediting the environmental-review and approval process as required by the National Environmental Policy Act.

In 2006, Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate, near Aberdeen, Scotland, aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estate’s owner, Tom Griffin, sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock & Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator, reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But, as Michael D’Antonio writes in his recent biography of Trump, Never Enough, Griffin’s most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. “It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump,” Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

After harshly condemning the media over the weekend for its coverage of President Donald Trump’s inauguration, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer struck a less combative tone during a press conference on Monday. But he nevertheless continued to argue that the media is trying to undermine the president, and stood by a debunked statement that the inauguration drew the “largest audience” of all time. “I believe we have to be honest with the American people,” Spicer said at the briefing, responding to a reporter’s question about his commitment to truth-telling. He added: “I’m going to come out here and tell you the facts as I know them, and if we make a mistake I’ll do our best to correct it.” Later, however, he lamented that there is a “constant theme to undercut the enormous support” he said Trump has. “There’s an overall frustration when you turn on the television over and over again and get told that there’s this narrative.” Continue Reading J. Scott Applewhite / AP The Republican Health Plan That Doesn't Repeal Obamacare Russell Berman As the party struggles to agree on a replacement, a group of GOP senators unveil a bill that would give states the option to keep it. The vast majority of Republicans in Congress haven’t budged from their longstanding vow to completely repeal the Affordable Care Act. But as the party struggles to write a replacement, a few GOP lawmakers are declaring their support for keeping the law on the books in some form indefinitely. A group of senators on Monday unveiled legislation that would give states the option of preserving Obamacare, securing federal support for a more conservative health-insurance system, or opting out of any assistance from Washington. Offered as a middle ground in the partisan health-care fight, the proposal breaks with years of Republican orthodoxy on the 2010 law, which party leaders have pledged to rip out “root and branch.” Continue Reading Kevin Lamarque / Reuters How Trump's Speech to the CIA Endangered America Conor Friedersdorf The president repeated his belief that the U.S. should have taken Iraq’s oil, ominously adding that the CIA may “have another chance.” Every American, regardless of who they voted for in the election, should be furious with President Donald Trump for what he told the CIA during a recent meeting at its headquarters. I do not mean his digressions about the size of the crowd at his inauguration and the number of times he has appeared on the cover of Time magazine, although it does not inspire confidence to see the president waste fleeting time with national-security employees on his vanity rather than our security. It’s his comments on Iraq that ought to make Americans apoplectic, for in the space of seconds, Trump managed to utter words that are 1) morally repugnant, 2) certain to be exploited as a recruiting tool by America’s terrorist enemies, and 3) likely to help foreign adversaries diminish America’s reputation and power. For the sake of an indisciplined, self-indulgent riff, Trump made Americans less safe.

Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for “modem” chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 per cent of Qualcomm’s $23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. In the lawsuit filed in US District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm withheld the rebates because of Apple’s discussions with South Korea’s antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission. “If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm’s release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused,” Apple said in its lawsuit. In a statement, Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg called Apple’s claims “baseless.” “Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information,” Rosenberg said. Qualcomm’s stock closed 2.4 per cent lower at $62.88 on the news.

Terry Gou, chairman of Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, warned that uncertainties for this year make it tough to have a very clear analysis and outlook, but he said it was clear politics would underpin economic development. His remarks came after US President Donald Trump pledged to put ‘America First’ in his inauguration speech Friday, reinforcing concerns of a US protectionist agenda that has cast a cloud over the outlook on global trade. “The rise of protectionism is unavoidable,” Gou said. “Secondly, the trend of politics serving the economy is clearly defined.” Gou, who did not directly refer to Trump, gave his remarks in a speech to an audience of employees and senior company executives at an annual company event today. Taiwan’s tech-dominated manufacturers are nervous about potential US trade policies because Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on imports from some countries, notably China. Foxconn is one of the biggest employers in China where it operates factories that churn out most of Apple’s iconic iPhones.

[Photo/Xinhua] Apple Inc filed a $1 billion lawsuit against supplier Qualcomm Inc on Friday, days after the US government filed a lawsuit that accused the chip maker of resorting to anticompetitive tactics to maintain a monopoly over key semiconductors in mobile phones. Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for "modem" chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm's $23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. In the lawsuit filed in US District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm withheld the rebates because of Apple's discussions with South Korea's antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission. "If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm's release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused," Apple said in its lawsuit. Qualcomm did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Qualcomm has patents for chips which include standard essential patents, a term used to describe technology that is required to be licensed broadly and on "reasonable" terms. In its lawsuit, Apple accused Qualcomm of refusing to license the technology to other manufacturers to prevent them from making the chips. It also accused Qualcomm of selling chips while requiring Apple to pay a separate licensing fee for the same chips, in a "no license, no chip" policy. In addition, Qualcomm pressured network carriers to not sell or support Apple devices made with Intel chipsets Apple said. The KFTC fined Qualcomm $854 million in December for what it called unfair patent licensing practices. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. On Tuesday, the US Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, saying the San Diego-based company used its dominant position as a supplier of certain phone chips to impose "onerous" supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers. Qualcomm said it would contest the FTC complaint. Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modem chips for Apple's phones until the release of the iPhone 7 in September. Intel Corp supplied about half of the modem chips for the newest models, said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Apple made the move around the same time that Samsung, which had switched to using its own internal chips for its Galaxy S6 phones, returned to Qualcomm for the Galaxy S7. Qualcomm "has been able to manage through (the Apple contract loss) pretty well because they got back Samsung at the same time," Rasgon said. Apple is known for seeking multiple suppliers to keep prices down, said Jim Morrison, vice-president of technical intelligence for TechInsights, which tears down devices to analyze their parts.

ENTERTAINMENT 'La La Land' ties Oscars record with 14 nominations BUSINESS Technology Apple sues Qualcomm for $1 billion, depicting it as a shady monopolist Qualcomm Gregory Bull / Associated Press Qualcomm is the target of a lawsuit filed by Apple. Qualcomm is the target of a lawsuit filed by Apple. (Gregory Bull / Associated Press) Associated Press Apple Inc. is suing mobile chip maker Qualcomm Inc. for $1 billion in a patent fight pitting the iPhone maker against one of its major suppliers. The complaint filed Friday in a San Diego federal court depicts Qualcomm as a monopolist abusing its power in a key segment of the mobile chip market to extort royalties for iPhone innovations that have nothing to do with Qualcomm's technology. Apple says it has been cooperating with government regulators who have been investigating Qualcomm's business practices, prompting Qualcomm to retaliate by withholding about $1 billion in scheduled payments. In an email, Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg called Apple’s allegations “baseless.” Qualcomm has said in the past that its 3G and 4G cellular patents are essential to what makes smartphones truly mobile, with the ability to link to the Internet from almost anywhere. The royalties it has been charging for these key technologies for more than two decades are not unreasonable, the San Diego company contends. Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple launched its legal attack three days after the Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit alleging that Qualcomm has been imposing unfair licensing terms on manufacturers.  The FTC alleged that Qualcomm used its dominant market share in wireless chips to get excessive royalties on key, standard essential patents, which are supposed to be made available at reasonable rates under law. The U.S. agency also accused Qualcomm of giving Apple rebates in exchange for being the exclusive supplier of cellular modems in iPhones from 2011 through 2015 — hurting competitors. And the FTC lawsuit came a month after a South Korean regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission, fined Qualcomm $865 million over patent royalties. The company vowed to fight in South Korea’s courts. Qualcomm has vigorously denied claims made by the FTC and the South Korean regulator, saying they are based on a flawed legal theory and inaccurate information about the mobile industry. The company also faces investigations in Europe, Japan and Taiwan.

WSJ's Lee Hawkins explains. January 21st 2017 4 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ Aussie consumers turned to other Android phones in the wake of the exploding Samsung Note 7 fiasco. Picture: Ahn Young-joon Nick Whighamnews.com.au@NWWHIGHAM SAMSUNG has officially revealed faulty batteries caused its flagship Galaxy Note 7 phones to catch fire and has announced steps to avoid repeat incidents in the future. The announcement came more than three months after Samsung scrapped the short-lived competitor of Apple’s iPhones, wiping $US5.3 billion off its operating profit in one of the biggest tech failures in history. Investigations by the company and independent organisations found the batteries were the sole cause of the Note 7 fires, Samsung mobile chief Koh Dong-jin told reporters during a briefing in Seoul on Monday. The major headache for Samsung provided a big opportunity for its competitors to gain an edge in the increasingly competitive smartphone wars. Consumer confidence was always going to be rattled by Samsung’s exploding phones debacle, so which companies actually gained from Samsung’s loss? Surprisingly Samsung’s biggest rival, Apple, did not benefit from the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco in Australia as Aussie consumers sought other Android smartphone brands in the wake of the global recall. That’s according to figures released by consumer website Finder.com.au which measured “brand intent” among Aussie consumers comparing smartphones and mobile plans on the market. “We measured brand intent via our mobile phone plan engine, which is a page consumers visit to either switch phones and/or plans,” Finder.com.au’s technology commentator Angus Kidman told news.com.au. “Our data shows Aussies’ first handset preference, reflecting brand intent. This data does not indicate purchases or sign-ups.” This photo taken on September 13, 2016 shows a blown-up Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphone in Gwangju, 270km south of Seoul.Source:AFP The 2016 smartphone brand analysis was based on the comparisons of 56,000 Australian consumers who visited the website, he said. From August to September (when the first incidents of the Note 7 catching fire occurred), brand intent for Samsung dropped by almost a third. It moved from 32 per cent of mobile comparisons involving Samsung devices to 23 per cent. It steadily decreased over the rest of the year, finishing at a low of 19 per cent brand intent in the month of December, the company said. That interest shifted from Samsung phones to other Android devices with Google being one of the big winners with the release of its first smartphone. Google brand intent almost doubled among Australian consumers, growing by 86 per cent, according to the analysis. Interest in Huawei doubled, increasing by 101 per cent while Oppo saw an increase in searches by 53 per cent. Apple remained the first smartphone preference for Australians with brand intent sitting at an average of 62 per cent, followed by Samsung at a 25 per cent average in 2016 and all other manufacturers at 13 per cent. However Apple brand intent among Australians remained relatively steady over the year. This graph shows the proportion of handset searchers on Finder.com.au. A clear decline for Samsung is evident from August.Source:Supplied Most Android phones are cheaper than Apple’s iPhone, which is probably why Apple failed to gain a major boost from the Samsung fallout. Mr Kidman also believes Australian consumers are creatures of habit, preferring to stick with a familiar operating system. “For many, choosing a new phone is swayed by the operating system. We’re creatures of habit and like the comfort of knowing our way around our phones. A new OS means figuring out how to do the simplest of tasks like changing your ringtone,” he said. There was also many consumers who reported being underwhelmed by the latest Apple iPhone. “There weren’t many major design changes in the iPhone 7 compared to previous generations, and one of the most notable was also highly controversial: eliminating the headphone socket,” Mr Kidman said. “For someone switching from Android, that could feel like a deal-breaker, especially when there is such a wide range of Android devices to choose from.” -With AAP Jump back to top Right now in technology 705Readers Dakota Access pipeline, Keystone XL pipeline revived by Dona... 624Readers Hear here: Apple just solved biggest flaw with AirPods 196Readers Beware the Slenderman documentary delves into deadly interne... 206Readers Windows 98 laptop: Man buys retro computer online, gets bril... 116Readers Oppo R9S in Australia: Never pay full price for a smartphone...

Maybe not‚ says FMF  Samsung Electronics was forced to discontinue the smartphone, originally intended to compete with Apple’s iPhone, after a chaotic recall that saw replacement devices also catching fire. The debacle cost the South Korean company billions in lost profit and reputational damage, in a torrid period which has also seen it embroiled in the corruption scandal that has resulted in President Park Geun-Hye’s impeachment. Internal and independent investigations “concluded that batteries were found to be the cause of the Note 7 incidents“, Samsung said in a statement. “We sincerely apologise for the discomfort and concern we have caused to our customers,” Koh Dong-Jin, the head of its mobile business, told reporters in Seoul. Samsung Electronics is the most prominent unit of the giant Samsung group, South Korea’s largest conglomerate with a revenue equivalent to about a fifth of the country’s GDP. It announced a recall of 2.5 million units of the oversized Galaxy Note 7 in September 2016 after several devices exploded or caught fire, with the company blaming batteries from a supplier, widely believed to be its sister firm Samsung SDI. When replacement phones — with batteries from another firm, largely thought to be Chinese manufacturer ATL — also started to combust, the company eventually decided to kill off the Note 7 for good. As many as 1.9 million of the phones were sold in the United States, where authorities banned the device from use on planes and even from being placed in checked luggage. Aviation authorities around the world issued similar prohibitions. The firm has since embarked on a campaign to restore its battered reputation, issuing repeating apologies and putting full-page advertisements in prominent US newspapers including the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Washington Post admitting that it “fell short” on its promises. The next model in the series, the Galaxy Note 8, had been expected to be unveiled at next month’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, but Koh said it would be delayed to ensure that it had no safety issues. Samsung deployed around 700 researchers and engineers on its investigation, testing more than 200,000 fully-assembled devices and more than 30,000 batteries, it said. It did not identify the battery makers on Monday, but independent investigators UL and Exponent agreed with the findings. Battery A had a design issue that pushed down the right corner of the battery, while Battery B had defective internal welds, said Kevin White, principal scientist at Exponent. But Koh dismissed the possibility of suing the manufacturers. “Whatever parts we use, the overall responsibility falls to us for failing to verify its safety and quality,” he said. “At this point, I don’t think it’s right to seek legal action. Around 1,000 different parts from some 450 suppliers were needed for each Galaxy Note 7. Samsung acknowledged that it provided the specifications for the batteries, adding in its statement: “We have taken several corrective actions to ensure this never happens again. The lessons of the past several months are now deeply reflected in our processes and in our culture.” The fiasco took a major toll on the reputation of the firm, which is set to announce fourth-quarter and full-year results on Tuesday. It has estimated the cost of the recall at $5.3 billion, according to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency. Samsung Electronics shares were up 0.5% at 1.87 million won in Seoul on Monday morning after the announcement. The firm has separately been caught up in South Korea’s wide-ranging political corruption scandal, with prosecutors last week seeking the arrest of its vice-chairman Lee Jae-Yong on charges of bribery, embezzlement and perjury. Lee, who became Samsung’s de facto head after his father suffered a heart attack in 2014, is accused of bribing Choi Soon-Sil, Park’s secret confidante at the centre of the scandal, and receiving policy favours from Park in return. Samsung is the single biggest contributor to two non-profit foundations controlled by Choi, but a court rejected the arrest request on grounds of insufficient evidence.

Lee, who became Samsung's de facto head after his father suffered a heart attack in 2014, is accused of bribing Choi Soon-Sil, Park's secret confidante at the centre of the scandal, and receiving policy favours from Park in return. Samsung is the single biggest contributor to two non-profit foundations controlled by Choi, but a court rejected the arrest request on grounds of insufficient evidence. advertisement In the headlines 36 government officials shared Shs6 billion oil bonus - MPs List tabled before parliamentary probe committee is dominated by officials from the Justice Col Kaka now new ISO boss Around 2014, he led Kalangala Fisheries Organisation (KAFO), a volunteer organisation fighting National Kayihura revokes Lwakataka gun licence   National Museveni warns wetland encroachers   National Schools set high S1 cut-off points   National Court rejects petition against MP Sekikubo   Advertisement National Chief Justice hits back at Kadaga over ‘stupid’ court order remarks National Makerere calls Mubs for crisis meet over graduation list National M23 men back at Bihanga barracks, army say Full Woman Moving on after losing hands and an eye to domestic violence Reviews & Profiles Arapapa on the path to new markets Advertisement Latest News National Police face 50,000 personnel shortage   National Three children dead, five bedridden as Bilharzia hits Mayuge   National FDC vets EALA candidates as party waits for House rules   National Herbalist accused of mutilating toddler   National FDC seeks to replace Muntu   National Danish man jailed 12 years for narcotics   National Byanyima again snubs police summons   Advertisement From The East African Comment What do we pay the new County officials?   Comment Waiting for Trump to be impeached or for the world to end   Comment Tin roofs and medical insurance: Rwanda’s small miracles   Opinion and Editorial ‘Not Another Silly Alliance!’   Comment Killing a snake or beating up a journalist?   Comment The army: Uganda’s abiding national obsession   News Museveni names new internal spymaster   Advertisement Web Mail e-Paper 93.3 KFM Business Directory Sqoop Dembefm NTV Uganda Africa Review The East African Daily Nation The Citizen Business Daily About us Contact us Advertise with Us Terms of Use Nation Media Group

What does it really mean? (Laughs) Calculation? It is not a calculation but a philosophy that depicts our way of life. 1+1=11. It is not Mathematics, instead, I call it Motomatics. People often get confused and ask me the meaning of this simple equation. It means, ‘Never give up’… It’s about going the extra-mile to make extraordinary moments out of ordinary situations and making the impossible, POSSIBLE. What have been the greatest challenges of your project in 2016? 2016 started for us on a very high and positive note. We sold our dream of the tallest residential building and Africa’s first fully automated building – LorenzoBySujimoto, to Nigerians and the world. Investors were thrilled by our ROI offering. The competition marveled at the audacity of our strides. As the list of our investors and friends has grown, so have our critics. Between January and December 2016, I had personally spoken to 1,850 investors & off-takers. 1,841 of them said ‘NO’. But, that didn’t discourage the entrepreneurship in me or make me lose focus on the Lorenzo dream. The dividend of reputation is a different type of currency. Something that’s been very clear is that, our investors and most importantly our off-takers would never lose their money, even, when it is clear that we are losing. I can tell you categorically that when one of our investors had an emergency need for his money, we had to refund about a hundred million naira. Money could be lost and easily regained. With Reputation, that is not so easy. Around April 2016, two of our major investors looked at the project, looked at the company, its leadership, identified the risk and mitigated it successfully. But when they looked at the economic situation, most importantly some government policies, they backed out immediately. One said Suji, if your project were in Togo, we would invest in it. I remember another saying, Suji, RISK we can mitigate, but UNCERTAINTY we can’t. In the last 365 days, my BP has risen from 110 to 150. There is no day that I wake up in the morning that I do not think about my company, my project and our dear country. At some point, I considered giving it all up. The biggest pain was when I had to let go of some of my best hands. To date, I call them and make myself available to help, whenever the need arises. But some things have kept me going; my mother, my brother Kanmi and my staff; their resolute hope, their unrelenting faith in the vision, and ultimately my faith, in the potential of this Country, we all call home. Tell us about LorenzoBySujimoto project. The Lorenzo is going to be the tallest residential building in Lagos, and the first fully automated building in Africa. It’s a lifestyle, where every square meter is an experience. Each apartment comes with two Armani or Pedini Kitchens, 2.6m doors, 4m floors to ceiling, virtual golf bar, two swimming pools (one of which is located on the 17th floor), tennis court, basketball, and 24-hour concierge service. The smallest apartment is 200m2. The Lorenzo can be likened to The Dorchester Hotel, even though it is an apartment property. We have studied the competitors in all other projects, and we have identified more than 11 different facilities and features that the Lorenzo has, which others do not. It is the only project today in Nigeria that’s promising investors 100% Returns on Investment. Nothing like this has been done anywhere else in Africa. Right now, we are finalising the financial aspect, which we are hoping to conclude before the end of next month. Hopefully, we’ll move to site by the end of April . In this recession, what makes you think people would want to take such kind of investment commitment? VALUE, ICONIC QUALITY REAL-ESTATE and RETURNS ON INVESTMENT. People are very optimistic about the project, and our existing Clients and prospects can’t wait for us to break ground. There’s nothing like Nigerians are broke, and can’t afford property worth a million USD. Yes, right now Nigerians are cautious and have created very effective spending policies. Nonetheless, most successful entrepreneurs know that even in crisis lies opportunity, a winning mindset requires long term vision, something which is rare to come by but necessary especially in times like this. People are still enquiring daily about the Lorenzo as well as our other projects. Just last month, I facilitated sales of two properties in Banana Island. Both of them amounted to about 8 Million USD. So yes, smart investors know that a recession is the best time to put money in real estate. There are rumours that you are cancelling the Lorenzo project. How true is that? That is impossible. The Lorenzo might have stalled, but make no mistake to think that we might jump ship, I am not Jonah. When we started, we knew things were going to be bad, but no economic Einstein could have predicted that the dollar would go from 180 to 500. That’s a 300% rise. But, that’s not enough to deter us form achieving this dream. One of our biggest strengths is the trust, which the Clients bestow on us. Cancelling this project would be direct evidence that we do not believe in the promise of true change that we made to the Nigerian people who are tired of inferior/substandard properties. The LorenzoBySujimoto project will stand. However, in order to ensure the project stands, we have reassessed our plans, reviewed all our decisions, and realised that one of our major setbacks in the grand scheme of things is the land location. We had to let go of the property and are now in talks with several landlords whom we want to do JVs with. What felt like an incarceration for us actually turned out to be a liberation. We will be moving to a larger space, with longer lease title. Is it not our elders who say ‘Many roads lead to the market?’ ’ Most importantly, note that the LorenzobySujimoto project will still be on Bourdillon road, just not at No16. What is the benefit of doing a Joint Venture as compared to owning the land in this situation? Some may say it is cheaper to own the land. But within this context, the advantage of a JV is most importantly, absolute transparency. The title document and all other documents would not be in my hand or the hands of the Landowner, but with a reputable Trustee. Also, bringing partners on board would reduce the weight of the project, as both parties would have shared responsibilities, which would mean efficiency during execution. I see this as a very positive and progressive step, given the current situation. Many people started their projects already. Why is yours stalling? The fact that someone started before you doesn’t mean they would do better than you, if that was the case, Nokia and Blackberry should have more ratings than Apple. Most projects, especially on Bourdillon all started their projects design way before us. Some of them started two years before us. But, that’s not an excuse. For us at Sujimoto, there are 3 fundamental principles of business. Number one is, the Customer is King. We envision and deliver exceptional products, striving for continuous and dedicated customer service. Secondly, our Employees. It is very critical to be encompassed by the right group of people who are hungry and passionate about our vision. Number Three is Competition. I can’t fight my Competitors. I learn from them. Our major intention when it comes to competitors is to study them and find ways of doing better than what they did, become the BEST, and never to compromise on quality. I am sure you have heard this saying, “It takes 6 days to assemble a Toyota, but 6 months to create a Rolls Royce.” In view of the current economic situation in the country, how have investors been responding to you? Over the last 7 months, I have spoken with more than 40 foreign investors. Every single one of them was skeptical about Nigeria; not the economy per se, but the inconsistency of government policies. We have finally seen a private investor from the Middle East who is willing to inject about 32 Million USD into the project at 4.2%. This for us is great news. Once this takes effect, we will stop selling, until the 26-story structure is standing. This is good for our early investors, because by the time we start selling back, the prices would have increased by 50%. It’s important to also note that we have finalised a building Joint Construction Agreement with one of the best Luxury builders in Spain/Qatar. Why did we not hire a local contractor or give the construction to a local company? Well, most of our subcontractors, almost 85% would be Nigerians, indigenous companies. However, we must not hide from the fact that Lorenzo is an extreme high-end luxury project with facilities and functionalities which make it similar to a 5star hotel (mind you, it’s not a hotel). We needed a company with advanced experience in building hotels, and we are glad we have this Company on board. What’s your experience with our Local banks? I don’t usually like to comment but, let me say that there are some few progressive leaders in the banking industry who believe in buffetism. That is, seeing the intrinsic value in human capital. But many have argued that this is not a great time to invest, especially in terms of luxury investments. For us at Sujimoto, our first intention is to create a platform that will give investors the best returns on their investments. In this economy, where money is scarce and obtaining funds is comparable to fighting war, we have nevertheless, been able to raise more than 1billion Naira. This is testimony of the trust that society has placed upon us. NOW is the best time to invest in value, in something substantial not in common, cheap crap. Crap becomes difficult to sell because everyone has it, but true luxury is rare yet easy to sell. Furthermore, there’s no better time to buy or build than now. Construction is cheaper than ever and the price of materials has not risen excessively. We are receiving discounts from several contractors and by the time we finalise our construction towards the end of 2019, we are optimistic that our country’s economic situation would have improved. Moreover, I must not forget to mention that this is also an effective way to hedge your naira against the dollar. What’s your opinion about other projects in Ikoyi, Bourdillon, VI, and Waterfronts etc.? I see lots of nice projects coming up, and if I were an investor who wanted a basic property with a diversified portfolio, I would buy some of them. But, permit me to say that they come nowhere close to the Lorenzo; LorenzoBySujimoto is like a Rolls Royce. But then, most of these ‘nice projects’ end up becoming empty apartments within Ikoyi. How viable do you think the luxury real estate market really is? Create sugar and ants will come. What’s the Sugar here? Integrity, Diligence, Innovation, putting customers first, and going the extra-mile.  Like I said before, one can sell luxury and one can sell a crap. By all means luxury is easier to sell, because it communicates long-term value and offers multiple returns on investment. There may be empty apartments. But, I tell you categorically, the luxury apartments, which offer true value for money, are not empty. Are Tango Towers, Ultimate towers and No. 2 Thompson empty? That tells you that value doesn’t sit on the shelf. It sells itself. What do you think about Nigeria and its potential? The best way to answer this question is to take a look at the United Arab Emirate, which was a land of sand and dust, but through vision and great leadership was transformed into a magnificent jungle of marble and towers, where the sky was not the limit. Nigeria on the other hand, is a land rich in natural resources and manpower, but wallowing in poverty and depravity. Someone once said; “An army of sheep, led by a lion, can defeat an army of lions led by a sheep. The difference is quality of leadership. I am very patriotic and I am a nationalist. I still have hope in the promises of Awolowo, the industrialisation offered by Azikwe and exceptional leadership of Tafawa Balewa. I have strong belief in the potential of this country, and I will be here to experience its dividends. So, what is your recipe for doing business successfully in Nigeria? I won’t lie doing business in Nigeria takes guts and lots of courage. For starters Our banks could be more helpful. But, for that to happen they need a total reform, not only of policy but mind set, because without the right support, many dreams would just die unrealised. Look at the Apple brand, the success it basks in today is not due to Steve jobs and his partner coming from wealthy homes or having powerful uncles, instead its due to them having great ideas and receiving the necessary support from established financial institutions. As far back as 1977, Steve Jobs was able to secure a bank loan of $250,000 USD. How many startups in Nigeria can hope to secure even a minimal $25,000 loan? Jack Ma of AliBaba got rejected by banks 77 times, but today he’s worth about 21 billion dollars. So as far as I am concerned, our philosophy is be a man of our word, let it be our bond, put quality first, nurture our dream until it becomes an empire that inspires my generation. So, you are saying that you regret your nationality … (Cuts in) Of course not! I am proud to be Nigerian. If I die today and comeback, I would never want to be Togolese, Ghanaian or South African. Nigerians are uniquely resilient people. Just consider that we generate our own lights, source our own water, maximise our own security and often build our own roads. We have produced world-class citizens who can compete against any standard in the world. Look at Aliko Dangote, Ms. Alakija, Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka, the great writer Chinua Achebe, and the legendary Fela Anikulapo Kuti. We achieved great things even with all the challenges we had to face. What do you think would have happened to Nigerians if we had the complete infrastructure that we truly needed? I keep telling my South African friends. Let’s do a swap for a day. Let all South Africans come to Nigeria, and we Nigerians go to South Africa. Then we’ll truly see what greatness the creativity of the average Nigerian can breed, if given the right opportunity. Olajumoke spoke recently about your gestures to her, sparking rumours of ulterior motives. What are your views on this? The Olajumoke story is an African story. Do you know what it is to move from sleeping on a bakery floor to sleeping into a 3bed apartment, or eat 3 full meals a day? Anyone who has had a rough and poor beginning, anyone who understands that ‘if your neighbor is hungry, your chicken is not safe’, anyone who believes in the alleviation of poverty, would understand why I helped that girl and her family. For me, I saw my mother in Olajumoke, a woman like many families who came to Lagos in search of opportunities. Olajumoke for us is a lifetime project; we would help her till she’s able to stand-alone and help others. So, how was the festive season? Let’s talk about all your gifts. (laughs) You know what? In December 2015, we brought about 3 billion naira into the banking system. In 2015, I gave out about 300 gifts, while I got about 20 presents. This year I gave out about a 100 gifts to people that had a direct impact on our organisation. In 2016, we had a cash flow of about 2 Billion naira in our bank. Guess how many gifts I received? Just TWO – from a friend and a Client. Sadly I received nothing from my bankers (sarcastic tone). I’m not upset. Respect, I have learnt, is a rare commodity, which now, is safe to say, this bank no longer deserves from me. As for Nigerians, they are just reminding me that I need to work harder. (laughs) What’s your plan for the LorenzoBySujimoto project in 2017, and what’s your message to Investors? Without the tough experiences of 2016, my entrepreneurial journey would have been, at best, shallow. So, I’m glad I went through these hard times, for they have shaped our company and me. 2017 is already looking bright for us, as we have finalised talks with our Saudi Investors. We have stopped selling Lorenzo for now until we break-ground around April May. We also have another small 20-townhouse project in Banana Island, and a low-cost boutique hotel in Ikoyi. We are doing something exceptional and unique in Victoria Island. It’s a secret for now. 2017 is our year of restoration. To all our Local and International partners, Investors and friends, I would like to say: ‘Thank you’ for believing in the Sujimoto Values and Vision. Let’s work together to make 2017, even better and more beneficial for us all!” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share via Email In this article: Sijibomi OgundeleThe Lorenzo You may also like ‘The church is accountable to God’ 3 days ago  Interview ‘NJC is not up to date with disciplining of judges’ 4 days ago  Interview We have developed the right energy mix for Nigeria, says Fashola 18 Jan 11  Interview Gabon 2017 Updates Top stories of the week 1 Nigeria’s petrol import drops by nine million litres in 2016 2 Ghana ready for Pharaohs in today’s last group game 3 Ex-VP, Atiku’s campaign poster floods Kebbi 4 Northern governors, emirs move to fight poverty, insecurity 5 FG releases N72b full counterpart funding for Lagos-Ibadan rail Contributor Rotimi Fawole Still on guaranteed unconditional transferability Exchange Monitor Currency Interbank Rate Parallel Rate USD 306 498 GBP 375 597 EUR 325 522 Last Modified: January 24, 2017 at 8:39 am Latest DR Congo whip Togo to advance unbeaten 25 mins ago  Sport NCS has not dismissed any officer in 2017 30 mins ago  Nigeria Financial inclusion : First Bank takes banking to campuses, markets 30 mins ago  Business News Ivory Coast vs Morocco: Defending champions, Ivory Coast crash out of AFCON 31 mins ago  Sport Imo Air born, to be operated by Dana 1 hour ago  Aviation Get the latest news and analysis of issues from Nigeria, Africa and around the world, direct into your inbox, daily Subscribe Now Stock Monitor UBA UNITED BANK FOR AFRICA PLC -0.06% N5.10   ACCESS ACCESS BANK PLC. -0.05% N7.00   PRESCO PRESCO PLC   — N44.12   DIAMONDBNK DIAMOND BANK PLC   — N1.08   ZENITHBANK ZENITH INTERNATIONAL BANK PLC -0.55% N15.40   NESTLE NESTLE NIGERIA PLC. +29.00% N749.00   SEPLAT SEPLAT PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT COMPANY LTD +15.00% N380.00   GUINNESS GUINNESS NIG PLC +2.50% N71.00   UACN U A C N PLC. +0.81% N17.13   STANBIC STANBIC IBTC HOLDINGS PLC +0.66% N16.80   7UP 7-UP BOTTLING COMP.

The world’s biggest smartphone maker Samsung blamed faulty batteries on January 23 for the fires that led to last year’s humiliating recall of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 device. / AFP PHOTO / YONHAP / South Korea The world’s biggest smartphone maker Samsung blamed faulty batteries on Monday for the fires that led to last year’s humiliating recall of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 device. Samsung Electronics was forced to discontinue the smartphone, originally intended to compete with Apple’s iPhone, after a chaotic recall that saw replacement devices also catching fire. The debacle cost the South Korean company billions in lost profit and reputational damage, in a torrid period which has also seen it embroiled in the corruption scandal that has resulted in President Park Geun-Hye’s impeachment. ADVERTISEMENT Internal and independent investigations “concluded that batteries were found to be the cause of the Note 7 incidents”, Samsung said in a statement. “We sincerely apologize for the discomfort and concern we have caused to our customers,” Koh Dong-Jin, the head of its mobile business, told reporters in Seoul. Samsung Electronics is the most prominent unit of the giant Samsung group, South Korea’s largest conglomerate with a revenue equivalent to about a fifth of the country’s GDP. It announced a recall of 2.5 million units of the oversized Galaxy Note 7 in September 2016 after several devices exploded or caught fire, with the company blaming batteries from a supplier, widely believed to be its sister firm Samsung SDI. When replacement phones — with batteries from another firm, largely thought to be Chinese manufacturer ATL — also started to combust, the company eventually decided to kill off the Note 7 for good. As many as 1.9 million of the phones were sold in the United States, where authorities banned the device from use on planes and even from being placed in checked luggage. Aviation authorities around the world issued similar prohibitions. The firm has since embarked on a campaign to restore its battered reputation, issuing repeating apologies and putting full-page advertisements in prominent US newspapers including the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Washington Post admitting that it “fell short” on its promises. The next model in the series, the Galaxy S8, had been expected to be unveiled at next month’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, but Koh said it would be delayed to ensure that it had no safety issues. No legal action Samsung deployed around 700 researchers and engineers on its investigation, testing more than 200,000 fully-assembled devices and more than 30,000 batteries, it said. It did not identify the battery makers on Monday, but independent investigators UL and Exponent agreed with the findings. Battery A had a design issue that pushed down the right corner of the battery, while Battery B had defective internal welds, said Kevin White, principal scientist at Exponent. But Koh dismissed the possibility of suing the manufacturers. “Whatever parts we use, the overall responsibility falls to us for failing to verify its safety and quality,” he said. “At this point, I don’t think it’s right to seek legal action. Around 1,000 different parts from some 450 suppliers were needed for each Galaxy Note 7. Samsung acknowledged that it provided the specifications for the batteries, adding in its statement: “We have taken several corrective actions to ensure this never happens again. The lessons of the past several months are now deeply reflected in our processes and in our culture.” The fiasco took a major toll on the reputation of the firm, which is set to announce fourth-quarter and full-year results on Tuesday. It has estimated the cost of the recall at $5.3 billion, according to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency. Samsung Electronics shares were up 0.5 percent at 1.87 million won in Seoul on Monday morning after the announcement. The firm has separately been caught up in South Korea’s wide-ranging political corruption scandal, with prosecutors last week seeking the arrest of its vice-chairman Lee Jae-Yong on charges of bribery, embezzlement and perjury. Lee, who became Samsung’s de facto head after his father suffered a heart attack in 2014, is accused of bribing Choi Soon-Sil, Park’s secret confidante at the center of the scandal, and receiving policy favors from Park in return. Samsung is the single biggest contributor to two non-profit foundations controlled by Choi, but a court rejected the arrest request on grounds of insufficient evidence. play_circle_filled Nintendo reboots with new Switch game console January 15, 2017 play_circle_filled Avatar-style South Korean manned robot takes first baby steps January 04, 2017 play_circle_filled 'Heart-in-a-box' device helps save lives January 04, 2017 play_circle_filled Inquirer yearender: How will technology continue to revolutionize people’s lives?

The National Weather Service has issued a high wind warning for the Big Apple and southern New York state. Two to three inches of rain is expected to pour over the region. Northeast winds will likely blow 30-40mph with some gusts topping 60-70mph. The service mentions that a high wind warning means: 'damaging winds will blow down trees and power lines. Numerous power outages are expected.' There may be power outages in NYC as winds may hit 60-70mph on Monday. Pictured above, a cloudy day in the city on Sunday The northeast storm could cause power outages in NYC with winds blowing 60-70pmh New York is expected to get 2-3 inches of rain tomorrow in addition to the high winds 'Travel will be difficult, especially for high profile vehicles and on elevated roadway and bridges.'  The high wind warning begins at 1am Monday morning and ends 1am Tuesday EST. The worst winds will blow Monday afternoon and evening. Governor Andrew Cuomo warned New Yorkers in a statement: 'As this storm could cause power outages across downstate and flooding for communities near the coastline, I am directing all relevant state agencies to be on alert and ready to respond to whatever Mother Nature throws our way.' 'We will be closely monitoring storm conditions and deploying resources and equipment as necessary. I encourage all New Yorkers in these areas to plan ahead, avoid unnecessary travel, and above all else — stay safe.' High winds will affect the northeast tomorrow with some gusts reaching 60-70mph Rain is not expected to freeze tomorrow with temperatures staying in the low 40s Electricity provider Con Edison warned east coasters to be wary of fallen power lines.  Joseph Esposito, New York City's Emergency Management Commissioner said: 'We’re urging New Yorkers to use extra caution when outdoors Monday and allow for extra travel time during tomorrow’s commutes.' 'Coastal residents in vulnerable neighborhoods should take steps to protect their property ahead of this storm.' At least the rain shouldn't freeze in NYC tomorrow with temperatures expected to stay between 40 and 43 degrees. However, snow is expected to affect upstate New York and New England according to the Weather Channel.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next Tom Brady is going to the Super Bowl! Patriots star POSES...

In the smartphone era, the journey from futuristic fantasy to everyday nuisance is short. When the Motorola Atrix 4G made phones with fingerprint scanners widely available in 2011, then when the iPhone 5S made them very widely available two years later, it was the sort of thing you would hungrily unpack the box to play with. Now, if a scanner gets your attention at all, it’s because the blasted thing won’t work. Right now especially. For many people, it is a winter ritual to place a thumb on the sensor, then place it again, then again, then try a finger instead and ... oh, forget it, just pretend it’s still 2011 and enter the code! As Apple explains, and as we all know: “Moisture, lotions, sweat, oils, cuts or dry skin might affect fingerprint recognition.” So might “certain activities ... including exercising, showering, swimming, cooking”. Which is just a typically wholesome day, of course, in the life of an iPhone user.

This is not because your phone is cold (although subzero temperatures can slow it down) or, per se, because your skin is. The issue here is cold weather actually changing your fingerprint enough to make it unrecognisable. This may in part be a matter of the tiny skin ridges stiffening temporarily. More often, it is a matter of your skin being dried and roughened by exposure to cold air, which alters the print shape and changes its conductivity. (The mechanics of optical, capacitative and ultrasonic fingerprint scanners are too complex to explain in the space available. This is a narrow escape because they are also too complex for me to understand.) Happily, there are many possible solutions. One is to use a lot of hand cream, and try to keep your fingertips summery and youthful. Another is to teach your phone the “fingerprints” of your gloves. Indeed, there are gloves made specifically for this purpose. Some people have even found that you can record a nose print instead of a finger, although it is not clear that the skin on your nose is any more resilient. Probably the best solution overall is to install a new set of “winter fingerprints” with your worn fingers, much as you might switch to a winter wardrobe. And just as classy, I’m sure you will agree.

Amazon and Google always thrive in the fourth quarter as people get out their wallets for Christmas. Both companies – or in Google’s case, its parent group, Alphabet – are therefore expected to announce booming revenues in their fourth-quarter results over the next fortnight, with Alphabet going first on Thursday and Amazon the following week. But analysts are already looking beyond the simple question of how many cardboard boxes Amazon filled and how many searches Google answered. They’re wondering which company will win the battle to control your home. That battle is being fought by two carafe-sized cylinders from the respective companies. One is Amazon’s Echo, with its voice-operated “personal assistant”, Alexa; the other is Google Home, which responds to the phrase “OK Google”. Both are internet-connected, home-based devices which can be command to do things: give the weather forecast; play music; read out news headlines; update shopping lists; and control “smart” devices in the home such as light bulbs or power points. In theory, if a device can be linked to it, the Echo can control or monitor it, and keep you informed. And simply by saying “Alexa, add sugar to the shopping list”, users can keep up to date on house supplies and even purchase them directly.

Though Amazon has not – and does not – release sales figures for any individual item, investment bank Morgan Stanley estimates that 11m Echos had been sold by the end of November 2016; other estimates suggest a further 7m have been sold since. About 700,000 were estimated to have been sold in the UK and Germany, the only countries outside the US where it is available. The Morgan Stanley estimate would put an Echo in more than 8% of US households. This is a significant figure, especially compared with the best estimates for Google Home, which put its sales at less than a million since its launch in October 2016. Why should Google care about Amazon? Because voice is seen as the next big field for computer interaction, and the home is a far better environment for voice detection than the great outdoors. Research company Gartner reckons that by 2018, 30% of all interactions with devices will be voice-based, because people can speak up to four times faster than they can type, and the technology behind voice interaction is improving all the time. The risk to Google is that at the moment, almost everyone starting a general search at home begins at Google’s home page on a PC or phone. That leads to a results page topped by text adverts – which help generate about 90% of Google’s revenue, and probably more of its profits. But if people begin searching or ordering goods via an Echo, bypassing Google, that ad revenue will fall. And Google has cause to be uncomfortable. The shift from desktop to mobile saw the average number of searches per person fall as people moved to dedicated apps; Google responded by adding more ads to both desktop and search pages, juicing revenues. A shift that cut out the desktop in favour of voice-oriented search, or no search at all, would imperil its lucrative revenue stream. Amazon is copying one feature of Google’s success in smartphones: it is offering methods to connect and control smart devices via the Echo for free, rather as Google’s Android software was offered as a free platform for smartphones. There are signs it is paying off: Wynn hotels in Las Vegas announced in December that it would be adding Echos to all 5,000 rooms, for functions such as playing music and controlling curtains and blinds. That gained some notice, as much as anything because the life cycle of such hotels implies they will be there for a decade or so. Similarly, at January’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES), also in Las Vegas, commentators were struck by how many devices incorporated Alexa. And Amazon is even stealing into Google’s territory: some phones sold in the US from China’s Huawei, which uses Android, will incorporate Alexa rather than Google’s Assistant programme. Google’s natural reaction is to have its own voice-driven home system, in Home. But that poses a difficulty, illustrated by the problems it claims to solve. At the device’s launch, one presenter from the company explained how it could speak the answer to questions such as “how do you get wine stains out of a rug?” Most people would pose that question on a PC or mobile, and the results page would offer a series of paid-for ads. On Home, you just get the answer – without ads. What analysts wonder is: how can Home bridge that revenue gap? So far, Google hasn’t explained. Even if it can fend off the Echo, it may not be able to defend its core business. By contrast, the Echo’s benefit to Amazon is much clearer: it can make online shopping (at Amazon) a breeze, play music from Amazon’s paid-for subscription service, and generally act as a passive block on your using rival shopping sites – rather as Google cemented its dominance by being the default search engine on multiple browsers in the mid-2000s. Richard Windsor of Edison Investment Research suggests that time is running out for Google: “It has to act quickly, as Amazon is on the brink of becoming the industry standard for controlling smart home devices. “At CES, everyone was integrating with Echo, with Google Home and Apple HomeKit barely present.” Indeed, where are Apple and Microsoft, which also have their own voice-driven assistants in the form of Siri and Cortana? Although both can be used in the home – Siri on the iPhone or iPad, and to play content on the Apple TV set-top box, and Cortana on the Xbox games console – neither seems to be intent on the “home assistant” market. Phil Schiller, Apple’s vice-president of marketing, seemed to suggest recently that Apple wouldn’t follow Amazon and Google into offering a voice-only device: “Having my iPhone with me as the thing I speak to is better than something stuck in my kitchen or on a wall somewhere.” He also emphasised the importance of a visual display: “We still like to take pictures and we need to look at them, and a disembodied voice is not going to show me what the picture is.” Even so, there are persistent rumours that Apple has prototyped an Echo-like device in secret but is undecided on whether to release it. The company hasn’t commented. It could be ready to unveil something – or may never do so. Microsoft, meanwhile, is in more homes than the Echo via the Xbox, but isn’t trying to make itself a listening device linked to a shop. So, will we all be burbling away to thin air in a few years, asking how long our commute will take while our smartphones sit unused in the kitchen? Perhaps – though Ken Sena, a senior analyst at investment bank Evercore ISI, suggests that home-based voice assistants will never be used as widely as smartphones. According to Sena, they are not such a must-have. Yet, they were a hot Christmas present – and voice interaction is still in its early days, perhaps comparable to the smartphone market in 2005, when BlackBerry, Palm and Microsoft dominated. Or, it could be like the smartphone market now, effectively dominated by Google and Apple. But which? Alexa, can you see into the future?

X Close Nation Home > News > Nation < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 23 January 2017 | MYT 12:43 PM Samsung confirms faulty batteries cause Note 7 fires SEOUL (AFP): The world’s biggest smartphone maker Samsung on Monday blamed faulty batteries for the fires that led to last year’s humiliating recall of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 device. Internal and independent investigations “concluded that batteries were found to be the cause of the Note 7 incidents”, the South Korean company said in a statement. The giant conglomerate was forced to discontinue the smartphone - originally intended to compete with Apple’s iPhone - after a chaotic recall that saw replacement devices also catching fire. The debacle cost the company billions in lost profit and reputational damage. ”We sincerely apologise for the discomfort and concern we have caused to our customers,” Koh Dong-Jin, the head of Samsung’s mobile business, told reporters in Seoul. Samsung acknowledged that it provided the specifications for the batteries, adding in its statement: “We are taking responsibility for our failure to ultimately identify and verify the issues arising out of battery design and manufacturing. ”We have taken several corrective actions to ensure this never happens again.” It deployed around 700 researchers and engineers on its investigation, testing more than 200,000 fully-assembled devices and more than 30,000 batteries, it said. Samsung announced a recall of 2.5 million units of the oversized Galaxy Note 7 in September 2016 after several devices exploded or caught fire, with the company blaming batteries from a supplier, widely believed to be its sister firm Samsung SDI. When replacement phones - with batteries from another firm, largely thought to be Chinese manufacturer ATL - also started to combust, the company eventually decided to kill off the Note 7 for good. The fiasco took a major toll on the reputation of the firm, which is set to announce fourth-quarter and full-year results on Tuesday. It promised to reform its production and quality controls to prevent a similar crisis, and said Monday: “The lessons of the past several months are now deeply reflected in our processes and in our culture.” Samsung shares were up 0.5 percent at 1.87 million won in Seoul on Monday morning after the announcement. Samsung’s English-language Samsung statement referred only to Galaxy Note 7 “incidents” but in Korean it spoke of “damage by fire”.

(Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters) Related Stories Samsung's flammable phone scandal may cause consumers to hang up on them forever Taking a flight? No Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones allowed on Canadian, U.S. carriers Samsung exec wins court ruling in Korea scandal probe, but could still be indicted Samsung Electronics said Monday that after testing more than 200,000 Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, it found defects in two sets of batteries from two different manufacturers made the devices prone to catch fire. Samsung's mobile division president, Koh Dong-jin, ruled out any problems with other aspects of the Note 7, either in its hardware or its software. He denied the South Korean company, had rushed to release the premium phone to beat Apple's release of its new iPhone. The Note 7 was launched on Aug. 2, about a week earlier than its predecessor in 2015. Samsung discontinued the Note 7 just two months later in one of its worst product fiascos ever. It said that in ferreting out the cause of the problem, 700 researchers and engineers tested more than 200,000 devices and more than 30,000 batteries and replicated what happened with the Note 7 phones. ANALYSIS Note 7 fire debacle couldn't come at worse time ​Samsung Galaxy Note 7 banned from Canadian, U.S. flights U.S. companies UL and Exponent also examined the batteries supplied by South Korea-based Samsung SDI and China-based Amperex Technology Ltd., or ATL. The German company TUV Rheinland analyzed the Note 7 supply chain as part of the investigation, Samsung said. Samsung permanently dropped its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones October after reports they were overheating and catching fire. The company estimates the problems will cost it at least $5.3 billion US through early 2017. (Ahn Young-joon/Associated Press) The Galaxy Note 7 featured one of the biggest battery capacities so far for smartphones at 3,500 mAh, or milliampere hour, which gave it the highest energy density of all Samsung's devices. Koh said Samsung and the outside inspectors found no evidence that the high energy density alone had made the phones prone to overheating. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. A highly technical explanation of Note 7 problems boiled down to the relatively large batteries not fitting well into the phones, and not enough insulating material inside. In batteries by one manufacturer — likely Samsung SDI — used in the phones in the initial Note 7 recall, inspectors found damage to upper corners. That, combined with thin separators and high energy density, caused the phones to overheat. The cell-pouch design of the battery did not include enough room to safely accommodate its electrodes — another flaw. Pressed suppliers for innovation It was unclear to what extent the battery maker was responsible for those problems: Samsung said only that it had provided "targets" for the batteries. "We suggested that the Note 7 has innovations and a compact design and a 3500 mAh (battery) but we did not know how to make the separators within (the battery) or how many millimetres thick they should be," Koh told reporters. That may suggest a breakdown both in communication between Samsung and its suppliers and in quality control and testing. In other batches of batteries from a second manufacturer, presumably ATL, the researchers found welding defects and a lack of protective tape in some battery cells. Though it faulted the batteries from its suppliers, Samsung said in a statement "we provided the target for the battery specifications for the innovative Note 7, and we are taking responsibility for our failure to ultimately identify and verify the issues arising out of battery design and manufacturing." Koh said Samsung would treat the event as a "chance to strengthen the safety of lithium-ion batteries for the entire industry, not only us." Recalls of the Note 7s began in September after reports emerged that some of the phones were overheating and catching fire. At the time, Samsung blamed a flaw in the lithium batteries from one of its two suppliers, without saying which manufacturer was to blame. In October, Samsung dropped the phone for good after new Note 7s with different batteries issued as replacements also were found to be catching fire. It estimates the problems will cost it at least $5.3 billion through early 2017. The company has recalled 3.06 million Note 7 phones. About four per cent, or 120,000 units, of the recalled Galaxy Note 7, are still not returned. Samsung has taken heat for its handling of the recall and its hasty, apparently incomplete initial investigation into what went wrong. The company has said it is planning the release of its next generation Galaxy phones. To do so, it needed to definitively resolve the mystery over the Note 7. © The Associated Press, 2017 Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Stay Connected with CBC News Mobile Facebook Podcasts Twitter Alerts Newsletter Top News Headlines Trudeau cabinet welcomes Trump's Keystone XL decision There's no place like home: NASA releases beautiful satellite photos of Earth Douglas Garland had lots of cuts and bruises at time of arrest, triple-murder trial hears TSX and Dow close near record highs as Trump pushes business-friendly agenda Teen dead 2 weeks, but school twice sends family automated notice he is absent Latest Technology & Science News Headlines Learn math in just 10 minutes a day?

Samsung Electronics was forced to discontinue the smartphone, originally intended to compete with Apple's iPhone, after a chaotic recall that saw replacement devices also catching fire. The debacle cost the South Korean company billions in lost profit and reputational damage, in a torrid period which has also seen it embroiled in the corruption scandal that has resulted in President Park Geun-Hye's impeachment. Internal and independent investigations "concluded that batteries were found to be the cause of the Note 7 incidents", Samsung said in a statement. "We sincerely apologise for the discomfort and concern we have caused to our customers," Koh Dong-Jin, the head of its mobile business, told reporters in Seoul. Samsung Electronics is the most prominent unit of the giant Samsung group, South Korea's largest conglomerate with a revenue equivalent to about a fifth of the country's GDP. It announced a recall of 2.5 million units of the oversized Galaxy Note 7 in September 2016 after several devices exploded or caught fire, with the company blaming batteries from a supplier, widely believed to be its sister firm Samsung SDI. When replacement phones -- with batteries from another firm, largely thought to be Chinese manufacturer ATL -- also started to combust, the company eventually decided to kill off the Note 7 for good. As many as 1.9 million of the phones were sold in the United States, where authorities banned the device from use on planes and even from being placed in checked luggage. Aviation authorities around the world issued similar prohibitions. The firm has since embarked on a campaign to restore its battered reputation, issuing repeating apologies and putting full-page advertisements in prominent US newspapers including the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Washington Post admitting that it "fell short" on its promises. The next model in the series, the Galaxy Note 8, had been expected to be unveiled at next month's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, but Koh said it would be delayed to ensure that it had no safety issues. - No legal action - Samsung deployed around 700 researchers and engineers on its investigation, testing more than 200,000 fully-assembled devices and more than 30,000 batteries, it said. It did not identify the battery makers on Monday, but independent investigators UL and Exponent agreed with the findings. Battery A had a design issue that pushed down the right corner of the battery, while Battery B had defective internal welds, said Kevin White, principal scientist at Exponent. But Koh dismissed the possibility of suing the manufacturers. "Whatever parts we use, the overall responsibility falls to us for failing to verify its safety and quality," he said. "At this point, I don't think it's right to seek legal action. Around 1,000 different parts from some 450 suppliers were needed for each Galaxy Note 7. Samsung acknowledged that it provided the specifications for the batteries, adding in its statement: "We have taken several corrective actions to ensure this never happens again. The lessons of the past several months are now deeply reflected in our processes and in our culture." The fiasco took a major toll on the reputation of the firm, which is set to announce fourth-quarter and full-year results on Tuesday. It has estimated the cost of the recall at $5.3 billion, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. Samsung Electronics shares were up 0.5 percent at 1.87 million won in Seoul on Monday morning after the announcement. The firm has separately been caught up in South Korea's wide-ranging political corruption scandal, with prosecutors last week seeking the arrest of its vice-chairman Lee Jae-Yong on charges of bribery, embezzlement and perjury. Lee, who became Samsung's de facto head after his father suffered a heart attack in 2014, is accused of bribing Choi Soon-Sil, Park's secret confidante at the centre of the scandal, and receiving policy favours from Park in return. Samsung is the single biggest contributor to two non-profit foundations controlled by Choi, but a court rejected the arrest request on grounds of insufficient evidence.

Samsung Electronics Co. said Monday, Jan. 23, 2017, that problems with the design and manufacturing of batteries in its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones caused them to overheat and burst into fire. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File) SEOUL, Korea, Republic Of – Samsung Electronics said Monday that after testing more than 200,000 Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, it found defects in two sets of batteries from two different manufacturers made the devices prone to catch fire. Samsung’s mobile division president, Koh Dong-jin, ruled out any problems with other aspects of the Note 7, either in its hardware or its software.

Though it faulted the batteries from its suppliers, Samsung said in a statement “we provided the target for the battery specifications for the innovative Note 7, and we are taking responsibility for our failure to ultimately identify and verify the issues arising out of battery design and manufacturing.” Koh said Samsung would treat the event as a “chance to strengthen the safety of lithium-ion batteries for the entire industry, not only us.” Recalls of the Note 7s began in September after reports emerged that some of the phones were overheating and catching fire. At the time, Samsung blamed a flaw in the lithium batteries from one of its two suppliers, without saying which manufacturer was to blame. In October, Samsung dropped the phone for good after new Note 7s with different batteries issued as replacements also were found to be catching fire. It estimates the problems will cost it at least $5.3 billion through early 2017. The company has recalled 3.06 million Note 7 phones. About 4 per cent, or 120,000 units, of the recalled Galaxy Note 7, are still not returned. Samsung has taken heat for its handling of the recall and its hasty, apparently incomplete initial investigation into what went wrong. The company has said it is planning the release of its next generation Galaxy phones. To do so, it needed to definitively resolve the mystery over the Note 7. ___ Follow Youkyung Lee: http://www.twitter.com/YKLeeAP and https://apnews.com/search/youkyung%20lee 000000 000000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Samsung announced tighter quality controls and more rigorous testing and took responsibility for failing to ensure that design specifications given to its suppliers were failsafe. The South Korean company was also delaying its next Galaxy phone, the Galaxy S8, which is usually announced in February. The spontaneous fires, many chronicled in videos circulated on YouTube, prompted Samsung to recall millions of phones and take a $5.3 billion hit on its earnings -- and an unknown amount in reputation. While praising Samsung's frankness and apologies, analysts question whether the world's largest smartphone maker has really gotten to the bottom of the problem in blaming flaws in the design and production of batteries. "Samsung said the weaknesses could make the phone prone to catch fire. That I understand, but what did trigger fires in such conditions? Did they discuss if there is another cause? No," said Park Chul Wan, a former director of the next generation battery research centre at the state-owned Korea Electronics Technology Institute. Forrester analyst Frank Gillett said the company's emphasis seems to be on detecting problems in manufacturing, not preventing design problems earlier. The company, he said, needs to find ways to prevent commercial pressures, such as getting a phone out quickly, from causing engineers to make bad decisions. Samsung's Note 7 was timed, in part, to beat Apple's iPhone 7 by weeks. Ramon Llamas, an analyst at research firm IDC, said he would like to see Samsung show more of a "human side" to solving its problem and say what it's doing to work with consumers affected by this. During a two-hour press conference livestreamed in English, Chinese and Korean, Samsung said tests involving more than 200,000 phones and 30,000 batteries showed different problems with both kinds of batteries used in the Note 7. Though some experts had speculated that the phones' ultra-thin design or water-resistant features could have made them prone to overheat, Samsung says the investigation found no such problems. Samsung also ruled out software or design with the rest of the phone's hardware, as well as the supply chain. The Note 7 has one of the biggest battery capacities for a smartphone, but Samsung said the company and outside inspectors found no evidence that the high energy density alone was to blame. Samsung introduced the Note 7 on Aug. 2 and weeks later recalled the first batch after reports emerged that the phones were overheating and in some cases exploding. After replacement phones also started catching fire, aviation authorities banned them on flights and the company dropped the product for good. Having received complaints for failing to fix the problem after the first recall, Samsung brought in three private inspectors to help. Inspectors found damage to the upper corners of batteries made by one manufacturer -- likely sister company Samsung SDI -- and used in the initial batches of Note 7s. That, combined with overly thin separators and high energy density, caused the phones to overheat, Samsung said. The cell-pouch design of the battery also did not have enough space to safely accommodate its electrodes -- another flaw. In other batches of batteries from a second manufacturer, presumably China-based ATL, used in replacements for the recalled smartphones, the researchers found welding defects and a lack of protective tape in some battery cells. Patrick Moorhead, president of Moor Insights & Strategy, said the odds of two different suppliers having issues with the same phone are extremely low. The case "may signal we may have reached an inflection point in smartphone battery technology," Moorhead said. Though Samsung faulted the batteries from its suppliers, it said it would bear all costs. It was unclear to what extent the battery makers were responsible, as Samsung said only that it had provided "targets," such as capacity and thickness. That may suggest a breakdown in communication between Samsung and its suppliers and in quality control and testing. The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire because of lithium battery problems. Manufacturers like the batteries because they weigh less and pack much more energy into the same space than other batteries. But they are also more susceptible to overheating if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Koh Dong-jin, president of Samsung's mobile division, said Samsung would use what it learned from its investigations to improve lithium battery safety for the industry. To avoid further problems, Samsung said it was introducing an eight-point battery safety check with more intense durability tests; a new test on accelerated usage and a charge and discharge test. The tighter safety measures will be implemented in "every element of the company's devices," it said, including overall design and materials used. Samsung said it also will seek advice on battery safety and innovation from a group of battery experts. The company has recalled 3.06 million Note 7 phones. About 4 per cent, or 120,000 units, of the recalled Galaxy Note 7s have not been returned. AP Technology Writer Barbara Ortutay contributed to this story from New York.

Breaking with tradition, the Korean electronics giant said it won’t unveil its latest flagship Galaxy S phone at Mobile World Congress at the end of February. The delay comes as the Samsung boss said the company needs to regain consumer trust after the botched release of the high-end Note 7. It also follows the long-awaited results of Samsung's investigation into the Note 7 fires, caused by a battery fault, which led to a global recall and $5.3bn (£4.2bn) being wiped from its operating profit. Images of blown up Samsung Note 7 handsets spread across social media  Credit: AP “The lessons of this incident are deeply reflected in our culture and process,” said Koh Dong-jin, Samsung’s chief executive. “Samsung Electronics will be working hard to regain consumer trust.” The S8 is expected to have a new design with a larger screen that fills the front of the device. Samsung is said to be ditching the physical home button to make room for the larger screen, which could use organic light-emitting diode technology and be the first mobile phone with a 4K screen, a high quality resolution to date reserved for televisions and computer monitors. Other reports suggest the flagship handset could be waterproof and come without a headphone jack, following Apple’s lead with the iPhone 7. Analysts expect the S8's delay, which arose in part because Samsung engineers were investigating the Note 7’s overheating fault, to be about a fortnight long and said it could still go on sale in April. Samsung assured customers that the S8 wouldn’t come with any of the problems of the Note 7, and that it wouldn’t be a fire risk. “We look forward to moving ahead with a renewed commitment to safety,” it said. “The lessons of the past several months are now deeply reflected in our processes and in our culture.” Samsung Galaxy Note7 | October 11 statement An investigation, by the company and independent organisations, revealed the Note 7 fires were caused by faulty batteries from two suppliers rather than a problem with the Samsung’s hardware and software. An embarrassment for the company, Samsung was forced to recall the Note 7 after scores of phones and their replacements overheated, caught on fire and, in some cases, exploded. Samsung may start reselling the recalled Note 7 handsets, 3m of which had been sold, as refurbished phones fitted with new, safe batteries. The Korean company has recovered rapidly from the scandal and, having initially reported billion-dollar losses, is expected to reveal record high profits on Tuesday in its earnings report for the fourth quarter of 2016. Profits could hit a three year high of 9.2 trillion won (£6.2bn), according to the company’s earnings guidance. Its shares were up 2.3pc at the end of Monday despite the mobile phone news. The company remains bolstered by booming sales of its microchip and screen technologies.

Internal and independent investigations "concluded that batteries were found to be the cause of the Note 7 incidents", the South Korean company said in a statement. The giant conglomerate was forced to discontinue the smartphone -- originally intended to compete with Apple's iPhone -- after a chaotic recall that saw replacement devices also catching fire. The debacle cost the company billions in lost profit and reputational damage. "We sincerely apologise for the discomfort and concern we have caused to our customers," Koh Dong-Jin, the head of Samsung's mobile business, told reporters in Seoul. Samsung acknowledged that it provided the specifications for the batteries, adding in its statement: "We are taking responsibility for our failure to ultimately identify and verify the issues arising out of battery design and manufacturing. "We have taken several corrective actions to ensure this never happens again." It deployed around 700 researchers and engineers on its investigation, testing more than 200,000 fully-assembled devices and more than 30,000 batteries, it said. Samsung announced a recall of 2.5 million units of the oversized Galaxy Note 7 in September 2016 after several devices exploded or caught fire, with the company blaming batteries from a supplier, widely believed to be its sister firm Samsung SDI. When replacement phones -- with batteries from another firm, largely thought to be Chinese manufacturer ATL -- also started to combust, the company eventually decided to kill off the Note 7 for good. The fiasco took a major toll on the reputation of the firm, which is set to announce fourth-quarter and full-year results on Tuesday. It promised to reform its production and quality controls to prevent a similar crisis, and said today: "The lessons of the past several months are now deeply reflected in our processes and in our culture." Samsung shares were up 0.5 per cent at 1.87 million won in Seoul today morning after the announcement. Samsung's English-language Samsung statement referred only to Galaxy Note 7 "incidents" but in Korean it spoke of "damage by fire".   Tweet Go to Top Related Tweets Videos Anti-bullfighting protests erupt in Colombia Over two million people flood US cities for women's marches Women's March on Washington goes global Former President Obama waves goodbye Donald Trump officially sworn in as president US director Michael Moore says political bloodbath is on its way Violence flares in Washington during Trump inauguration Trump signs first executive order on Obamacare: Mattis, Kelly sworn in Live | Donald Trump: The Inauguration of the 45th President of the United States Videos Man dies trying to catch a glimpse...

In foreign policy, energy, jobs and trade, Donald Trump’s key plans put ‘America First’ “Secondly, the trend of politics serving the economy is clearly defined, and thirdly, the proportion of real economy [concerned with actually producing goods and services] is getting increasingly bigger.” His comments came two days after US President Donald Trump vowed in his inaugural speech to make “America First” one of the priorities of his protectionist agenda, which would include distancing the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement backed by his predecessor Barack Obama, and making US friends and allies pay for their security currently aided by Washington. Speaking at the same event, Gou reiterated that Foxconn was considering setting up a display-making plant in the US in an investment deal that would exceed US$7 billion. Whether the proposal could go ahead would depend on negotiations with US state and federal authorities, he said. In early December, Foxconn was reported to be planning to expand its US operations after Massayoshi Son, chief executive of Japan’s SoftBank Group, revealed a document following a meeting with Trump that showed Foxconn wanted to invest US$7 billion and create 50,000 jobs in the US over the next four years. Foxconn says it’s mulling a US$7 billion US plant for displays Beijing later expressed its concerns about whether it would mean a reduction in Foxconn’s multi-billion-US-dollar investments on the mainland. Gou reportedly told Beijing he did not plan to withdraw capital from the mainland, and that his US investment plan was still pending, and he would wait to see how the Trump government had settled in before making any final decision. Despite the rise of protectionism, Gou, said he was confident his company would be able to make profits this year owing to the return to real economy – the production of goods and services as opposed to an economy driven by buying and selling on financial markets. He said the increase in the production of goods would complement the internet of things business, which his company was developing. Foxconn’s profits were reported to have fallen 2.18 per cent to NT$4.36 trillion (HK$1.08 trillion) last year compared with 2015 – a performance which led Gou to apologise to both his staff and investors during the event. Taiwan’s tech-dominated manufacturers, which ship a large number of their products to the United States, are concerned about the potentially protectionist policies that Trump could adopt leading to increased customs tariffs to protect American jobs and businesses. Foxconn announces plans for new $8.8bn television flat-panel factory in Guangzhou In December Gou signed a framework agreement with Japan’s Sakai Display Products Corporation – mostly owned by him – to build a US$8.8 billion television flat-panel screen factory in Guangzhou. Foxconn is one of the biggest employers on the mainland where it operates factories that produce most of Apple’s iconic iPhones. In Taiwan, Gou is regarded as one of the most popular choices as the island’s future presidency among voters who are dissatisfied with the performances of both the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the opposition Kuomintang, according to several opinion polls published in October and November. Former vice-president Wu Den-yih of the KMT and the party vice chairman, Hau Lung-bin, have expressed their support for Gou to run for president in 2020 if no one from the KMT has gained more support than him in polls. So far Gou has declined to comment on the matter.

Finance Search Battery defects blamed for Note 7 firesAAP – Mon, Jan 23, 2017 1:59 PM AEDT Related Content View Photo   Samsung has blamed faulty batteries for causing its flagship Galaxy Note 7 phones to catch fire and has announced steps to avoid repeat incidents. The announcement on Monday came more than three months after Samsung scrapped the short-lived competitor of Apple's iPhones, wiping $US5.3 billion off its operating profit in one of the biggest tech failures in history. In its first explanation of the cause of the debacle, the world's top smartphone maker ruled out problems with the premium device's hardware and software, and said there would be no repeat of the fires in future devices such as the S8. "We look forward to moving ahead with a renewed commitment to safety. The lessons of the past several months are now deeply reflected in our processes and in our culture," the company said in a statement. While Samsung Electronics' mobile division is expected to have bounced back from the Note 7 failure during the fourth quarter, investors remained cautious about the outlook due to uncertainty about how the Note 7 fires would affect sales of future flagship devices. "Consumers will not be reluctant to buy the S8, expected in April or May, only if Samsung clearly finds out what caused the fires," Hi Investment analyst Song Myung-sup said. Investigations by the company and independent organisations found the batteries were the sole cause of the Note 7 fires, Samsung mobile chief Koh Dong-jin told reporters during a briefing in Seoul. Reports of Note 7 handsets catching fire spread on social media soon after their August launch. A recall to replace the batteries did not solve the problem, prompting a second recall and a discontinuation of the model in October. Despite the impact of the Note 7's demise, the South Korean company expects fourth-quarter operating profit to hit a more than three-year high, driven by booming chip sales. That forecast pushed Samsung's share price to a record high this month. Samsung will announce its final earnings figures on Tuesday.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel | 1 Comments The world's biggest smartphone maker Samsung blamed faulty batteries today for the fires that led to last year's humiliating recall of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 device. Internal and independent investigations "concluded that batteries were found to be the cause of the Note 7 incidents", the South Korean company said in a statement. The giant conglomerate was forced to discontinue the smartphone -- originally intended to compete with Apple's iPhone -- after a chaotic recall that saw replacement devices also catching fire. The debacle cost the company billions in lost profit and reputational damage. "We sincerely apologise for the discomfort and concern we have caused to our customers," Koh Dong-Jin, the head of Samsung's mobile business, told reporters in Seoul. Samsung acknowledged that it provided the specifications for the batteries, adding in its statement: "We are taking responsibility for our failure to ultimately identify and verify the issues arising out of battery design and manufacturing. "We have taken several corrective actions to ensure this never happens again." It deployed around 700 researchers and engineers on its investigation, testing more than 200,000 fully-assembled devices and more than 30,000 batteries, it said. Samsung announced a recall of 2.5 million units of the oversized Galaxy Note 7 in September 2016 after several devices exploded or caught fire, with the company blaming batteries from a supplier, widely believed to be its sister firm Samsung SDI. When replacement phones -- with batteries from another firm, largely thought to be Chinese manufacturer ATL -- also started to combust, the company eventually decided to kill off the Note 7 for good. The fiasco took a major toll on the reputation of the firm, which is set to announce fourth-quarter and full-year results on Tuesday. It promised to reform its production and quality controls to prevent a similar crisis, and said today: "The lessons of the past several months are now deeply reflected in our processes and in our culture." Samsung shares were up 0.5 per cent at 1.87 million won in Seoul today morning after the announcement. Samsung's English-language Samsung statement referred only to Galaxy Note 7 "incidents" but in Korean it spoke of "damage by fire".

Wrapping up its months-long probe, the world's top smartphone maker said faulty batteries from two suppliers were to blame for a product failure that wiped $5.3 billion off its operating profit. Samsung mobile chief Koh Dong-jin said procedures had been put in place to avoid a repeat of the fires as the South Korean firm prepares to launch the Galaxy S8, its first premium handset since the Note 7's demise. "The lessons of this incident are deeply reflected in our culture and process," Koh told reporters at a press briefing. "Samsung Electronics will be working hard to regain consumer trust." Koh said the Galaxy S8 would not be unveiled at the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona beginning Feb. 27, the traditional forum for Galaxy S series launches. He did not comment on when the company planned to launch the handset, though analysts expect it to start selling by April. Investors have said Samsung needs to reassure consumers that it is on top of the Note 7 problem and can be trusted to fix it. Samsung's reputation took a hammering after it announced a recall of fire-prone Note 7s, only for reports to emerge that replacement devices also caught fire. Images of melted Samsung devices spread on social media and airlines banned travellers from carrying them on flights. The handset, Samsung's answer to Apple Inc's iPhones, was withdrawn from sale in October less than two months after its launch, in one of the biggest failures in tech history. Samsung said later on Monday it has not decided whether to reuse parts in the recovered Note 7s or resell any recalled phones. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters reselling some Note 7s as refurbished phones was an option. The firm said it has recovered 96 percent of the 3.06 million Note 7s sold to consumers. SHORT CIRCUITS Investigations by internal and independent experts ruled out problems with the Note 7's hardware and software. Instead, they said the batteries, which came from two suppliers, featured different manufacturing defects or design flaws that caused them to short-circuit. "The odds that two different suppliers had issue with the same phone is an extremely low likelihood and may signal we have reached an inflection point in smartphone battery technology," said Patrick Moorhead, president of technology analyst and advisory firm Moor Insights & Strategy. Samsung did not name the suppliers on Monday but previously identified them as affiliate Samsung SDI Co Ltd and China's Amperex Technology Ltd (ATL). SDI said separately it would invest 150 billion won ($129 million) to improve product safety and expected to continue supplying batteries for Samsung phones. ATL declined to comment. Samsung said it accepted responsibility and would not take legal action against suppliers. The company touted longer battery life and fast charging as major improvements when it launched the Note 7. "The current situation is not largely different from that of the first recall, when Samsung pointed the finger at battery defects," said Park Chul-wan, a former director of the Centre for Advanced Batteries at the Korea Electronics Technology Institute. BATTERY CHECKS Among other measures to boost safety, Samsung said it had implemented an eight-point battery check system to avoid any such problems going unnoticed again. While Samsung's mobile division is widely expected to have bounced back from the Note 7 failure during the fourth quarter, experts remained cautious about the outlook for sales of future flagship devices. "Consumers will accept the results (of the probe) only if there are no problems with the S8," said Park. Moorhead, however, said he thought Samsung had done enough to convince consumers that it can prevent future issues. Samsung Electronics shares ended up 2.3 percent in a flat wider market. Analysts said the rise was mainly due to a healthy outlook for makers of tech components such as memory chips but also boosted by hopes the firm will be able to put the Note 7 fiasco behind it. The firm expects fourth-quarter operating profit to hit a more than three-year high when it reports earnings on Tuesday, driven by booming chip sales.

Ltd. plans on Monday to reveal reasons behind the spontaneous combustion of its recalled Galaxy Note 7, as the world's biggest smartphone maker works to regain consumer trust before launching its next premium model. The announcement would come more than three months after Samsung scrapped the short-lived competitor of Apple Inc.'s iPhones, costing $5.3 billion in operating profit. Reports of Note 7 handsets catching fire began soon after their August launch. A recall to replace the batteries did not solve the problem, prompting a second recall. Its reputation damaged, sales of the Galaxy S8 will be widely seen as a barometer of Samsung's ability to bounce back from the debacle. "Consumers will not be reluctant to buy the S8, expected in April or May, only if Samsung clearly finds out what caused the fires," said Hi Investment analyst Song Myung-sup. Samsung is likely to offer several reasons for the fires, including the battery - whose capacity was 16 percent more than the preceding model - as well as heat management software, said former Samsung mobile engineer Kim Yong-serk. "Samsung may have given a really high target for its battery capacity to suppliers, as consumers demand longer battery life," said Kim, a professor at Sungkyunkwan University. "Its waterproof feature may have prevented heat from dissipating." 'BIG MISTAKE' Samsung on Friday said it would announce the findings of investigations conducted by itself and independent organisations, as well as a "quality enhancement plan". Mobile chief Koh Dong-jin will chair a briefing on the fires' causes. In September, the engineer-turned-president announced the recall of 2.5 million Note 7 handsets due to faulty batteries from a supplier, later identified as affiliate Samsung SDI Co. Ltd. But handsets with cells from another supplier - China's Amperex Technology Ltd (ATL) - continued to catch fire, casting doubt on the faulty battery explanation. That prompted a second recall and permanent end to sales. Analysts said shipping replacement phones before identifying the root cause of the fires injured Samsung's reputation. "The biggest mistake Samsung made was that it recalled its Note 7 again," said HMC Investment Securities analyst Greg Roh. The firm would have difficulty convincing investors the matter is resolved if it again only blamed the batteries, he added. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters last week that Samsung was able to replicate the fires and had identified the batteries as the main cause. The person said the fires could not be explained by hardware or software design. Despite the impact of the Note 7's demise, the South Korean firm expects fourth-quarter operating profit to hit a more than three-year high, driven by booming chip sales. That forecast pushed Samsung's share price to a record high this month. Samsung will announce its final earnings figures on Tuesday.

For the secretive U.S. hedge fund started by Jim Simons, it turned out to be an especially savvy bet. Shares of V Tech, as it’s known, surged almost threefold in 2016, with much of the gain coming after Renaissance first reported a stake. V Tech, whose market value has jumped to $690 million, posted the second-best stock performance in a broad index of Tokyo-listed companies last year. Shigeto Sugimoto Photographer: Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg While Renaissance is staying silent on why it built a $27.8 million position in the stock, V Tech President Shigeto Sugimoto says he’s never been more confident about his company’s outlook. He’s betting V Tech will soon sign a revenue-doubling deal with one of the Chinese screen makers seeking to break Samsung Group’s dominance of the latest big thing in mobile phones: organic light-emitting diode displays. “The OLED market will have to grow,” Sugimoto, 58, said in an interview in Yokohama. “Our products can help make that happen.” Display makers in China, the world’s largest smartphone market, are stepping up investments in OLEDs as an increasing number of handsets come with OLED displays, which don’t need a backlight and have the potential to be curved, bendable and wearable. Perhaps ironically, China’s attempts to wrest market share from South Korea are expected to benefit Japanese suppliers such as V Tech. V Tech spent five years developing a key component of machines for manufacturing OLED screens, Sugimoto says, unveiling in 2016 an upgraded version of what it calls fine hybrid masks, which are used for patterning the organic layers on the displays. The masks are a potential alternative to those currently used by Samsung Electronics Co.’s display unit. Samsung controls about 98 percent of the OLED display market, according to Yi Choong-hoon, chief analyst at UBI Research in Seoul. V Tech is in talks with several Chinese display makers and hopes to sign a deal with one of them by March to supply the masks and other equipment, according to Sugimoto, who declined to identify the companies. An artist’s rendering of V-Technology’s partial laser annealing system. Source: V-Technology Co. Revenue Boost Such an agreement could bring in sales of as much as 50 billion yen ($441 million), Sugimoto says. V Tech’s revenue more than doubled to 39.2 billion yen in the fiscal year ended March. “Our company would double in size in one go,” he says. While Samsung Electronics adopted OLED screens for its smartphones in 2008, others stayed away due to high manufacturing costs. But as the technology develops and demand grows for more innovative mobile devices, more smartphone makers are opting for OLEDs. Apple  plans to ship at least one new iPhone with an OLED screen this year, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg last year. This isn’t Sugimoto’s first time to sense shifting tides in the display industry. The former engineer founded the company in 1997 as a maker of equipment for producing plasma displays. A few years later, he realized that manufacturers were shifting to liquid crystal displays. V Tech turned its focus to LCDs, which have been the dominant technology for mobile phones since the early 2000s. Read: Apple’s Search for Better iPhone Screens Leads to Japan’s Rice Fields In June 2015, Sugimoto bought a color-filter business from bearings-maker NSK Ltd. Color filters are used in producing LCD screens, which suddenly became increasingly in demand in China. “It was like winning the lottery,” Masahiko Ishino, a senior analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute Co., said of the acquisition. “They bought the business for 2 billion yen and won supply orders worth 15 billion yen and 18 billion yen,” he said. V Tech said the 18 billion yen order also included other products. V Tech shares soared 185 percent last year as LCDs helped boost earnings and investors bet on the company’s success in the OLED business. Renaissance first reported a holding in June and owned 4.8 percent of shares as of its latest filing, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Renaissance declined to comment. V Tech surged 16 percent in heavy trading on Monday in Tokyo. The stock posted its biggest gain in seven months and its highest close in more than a decade, even as the broader Topix index slid. With its new mask, V Tech is aiming to build on the OLED experience it gained through supplying quality-testing equipment to Samsung since 2009, Sugimoto said. Chinese Phones China’s OLED production capacity will probably more than double each year, accounting for 32 percent of the global total by 2021 from 6 percent in 2016, according to research firm Display Supply Chain Consultants. Huawei Technologies Co. and Xiaomi Corp. are among Chinese phone makers that have already adopted OLED screens for some models. “China isn’t a land of risk for those in the display industry: it’s a land of opportunity,” said Sugimoto. “Upstart Chinese makers are willing to try out new techniques,” he said. “I’m asking the companies we’re in talks with to make a decision quickly.” Not everyone is optimistic that V Tech will succeed in finding a Chinese OLED partner.

I question whether any company is willing to go down that road with them.” Sugimoto sees a 60 percent chance of winning a contract. Any failure would be cushioned by a solid outlook for V Tech’s LCD business, he says. The company’s 70 billion yen sales forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2018 excludes its new OLED products, according to Sugimoto, who jokes he may retire if a deal comes through. “It’ll be huge if the company finds a business partner in China,” Tokai Tokyo’s Ishino said. “The odds are hard to predict but it would be explosive for the stock.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Wrapping up its months-long probe, the world's top smartphone maker said faulty batteries from two suppliers were to blame for a product failure that wiped $5.3 billion off its operating profit. Samsung mobile chief Koh Dong-jin said procedures had been put in place to avoid a repeat of the fires as the South Korean firm prepares to launch the Galaxy S8, its first premium handset since the Note 7's demise. "The lessons of this incident are deeply reflected in our culture and process," Koh told reporters at a press briefing. "Samsung Electronics will be working hard to regain consumer trust." Koh said the Galaxy S8 would not be unveiled at the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona beginning Feb. 27, the traditional forum for Galaxy S series launches. He did not comment on when the company planned to launch the handset, though analysts expect it to start selling by April. Investors have said Samsung needs to reassure consumers that it is on top of the Note 7 problem and can be trusted to fix it. Samsung's reputation took a hammering after it announced a recall of fire-prone Note 7s, only for reports to emerge that replacement devices also caught fire. Images of melted Samsung devices spread on social media and airlines banned travellers from carrying them on flights. The handset, Samsung's answer to Apple Inc's iPhones, was withdrawn from sale in October less than two months after its launch, in one of the biggest failures in tech history. Samsung said later on Monday it has not decided whether to reuse parts in the recovered Note 7s or resell any recalled phones. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters reselling some Note 7s as refurbished phones was an option. The firm said it has recovered 96 percent of the 3.06 million Note 7s sold to consumers. SHORT CIRCUITS Investigations by internal and independent experts ruled out problems with the Note 7's hardware and software. Instead, they said the batteries, which came from two suppliers, featured different manufacturing defects or design flaws that caused them to short-circuit. "The odds that two different suppliers had issue with the same phone is an extremely low likelihood and may signal we have reached an inflection point in smartphone battery technology," said Patrick Moorhead, president of technology analyst and advisory firm Moor Insights & Strategy. Samsung did not name the suppliers on Monday but previously identified them as affiliate Samsung SDI Co Ltd and China's Amperex Technology Ltd (ATL). SDI said separately it would invest 150 billion won ($129 million) to improve product safety and expected to continue supplying batteries for Samsung phones. ATL declined to comment. Samsung said it accepted responsibility and would not take legal action against suppliers. The company touted longer battery life and fast charging as major improvements when it launched the Note 7. "The current situation is not largely different from that of the first recall, when Samsung pointed the finger at battery defects," said Park Chul-wan, a former director of the Center for Advanced Batteries at the Korea Electronics Technology Institute. BATTERY CHECKS Among other measures to boost safety, Samsung said it had implemented an eight-point battery check system to avoid any such problems going unnoticed again. While Samsung's mobile division is widely expected to have bounced back from the Note 7 failure during the fourth quarter, experts remained cautious about the outlook for sales of future flagship devices. "Consumers will accept the results (of the probe) only if there are no problems with the S8," said Park. Moorhead, however, said he thought Samsung had done enough to convince consumers that it can prevent future issues. Samsung Electronics shares ended up 2.3 percent in a flat wider market. Analysts said the rise was mainly due to a healthy outlook for makers of tech components such as memory chips but also boosted by hopes the firm will be able to put the Note 7 fiasco behind it. The firm expects fourth-quarter operating profit to hit a more than three-year high when it reports earnings on Tuesday, driven by booming chip sales.

ROS LBoard 1 Devolution of powers: Sarawak panel eager to send report to Cabinet Richard T.W. Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Samsung blames Galaxy Note 7 fires on faulty batteries AFP | January 23, 2017 We are taking responsibility for our failure to ultimately identify and verify the issues arising out of battery design and manufacturing. UPDATED SEOUL: The world’s biggest smartphone maker Samsung blamed faulty batteries on Monday for the fires that led to last year’s humiliating recall of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 device. Internal and independent investigations “concluded that batteries were found to be the cause of the Note 7 incidents”, the South Korean company said in a statement. The giant conglomerate was forced to discontinue the smartphone — originally intended to compete with Apple’s iPhone — after a chaotic recall that saw replacement devices also catching fire. The debacle cost the company billions in lost profit and reputational damage. “We sincerely apologise for the discomfort and concern we have caused to our customers,” Koh Dong-Jin, the head of Samsung’s mobile business, told reporters in Seoul. Samsung acknowledged that it provided the specifications for the batteries, adding in its statement: “We are taking responsibility for our failure to ultimately identify and verify the issues arising out of battery design and manufacturing. “We have taken several corrective actions to ensure this never happens again.” It deployed around 700 researchers and engineers on its investigation, testing more than 200,000 fully-assembled devices and more than 30,000 batteries, it said. Samsung announced a recall of 2.5 million units of the oversized Galaxy Note 7 in September 2016 after several devices exploded or caught fire, with the company blaming batteries from a supplier, widely believed to be its sister firm Samsung SDI. When replacement phones — with batteries from another firm, largely thought to be Chinese manufacturer ATL — also started to combust, the company eventually decided to kill off the Note 7 for good. The fiasco took a major toll on the reputation of the firm, which is set to announce fourth-quarter and full-year results on Tuesday. It promised to reform its production and quality controls to prevent a similar crisis, and said Monday: “The lessons of the past several months are now deeply reflected in our processes and in our culture.” Samsung shares were up 0.5 percent at 1.87 million won in Seoul on Monday morning after the announcement. Samsung’s English-language Samsung statement referred only to Galaxy Note 7 “incidents” but in Korean it spoke of “damage by fire”.

These were caused by manufacturing issues, including poor welding at the battery manufacturer. It came during a torrid period when it has also been embroiled in a corruption scandal that has seen President Park Geun-Hye impeached.  Internal and independent investigations 'concluded that batteries were found to be the cause of the Note 7 incidents', Samsung said in a statement. 'We sincerely apologise for the discomfort and concern we have caused to our customers,' Koh Dong-Jin, the head of its mobile business, said bowing before hundreds of reporters and cameramen at a press conference in Seoul. The first issue was that the battery components in the Galaxy Note 7 did not fit in the battery's casing.  This caused the battery cell's upper right corner to be crimped by the casing.   The second round affected the devices sent to replace the original faulty phones.

Share this article Share 34 shares Samsung has blamed lithium-ion batteries for causing its Galaxy Note 7 mobile phones to overheat and catch fire  These were caused by manufacturing issues, including poor welding at the battery manufacturer. Samsung is the most prominent unit of the giant Samsung group, South Korea's largest conglomerate with a revenue equivalent to about a fifth of the country's GDP. It announced a recall of 2.5 million units of the oversized Galaxy Note 7 in September 2016 after several devices exploded or caught fire, with the company blaming batteries from a supplier, widely believed to be its sister firm Samsung SDI. When replacement phones - with batteries from another firm, largely thought to be Chinese manufacturer ATL - also started to combust, the company decided to kill off the Note 7 for good. The first issue was that the battery components in the Galaxy Note 7 did not fit in the battery's casing. This caused the battery cell's upper right corner to be crimped by the casing The world's biggest smartphone maker was forced to discontinue the smartphone, originally intended to compete with Apple's iPhone, after a chaotic recall that saw replacement devices also catching fire. Pictured is a test in which the Galaxy S7 battery caught fire under pressure  As many as 1.9 million of the phones were sold in the US, where authorities banned the device from use on planes and even from being placed in checked luggage. Airlines around the world issued similar prohibitions. The firm has since embarked on a campaign to restore its battered reputation, issuing repeating apologies and putting full-page advertisements in prominent US newspapers including the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Washington Post admitting that it 'fell short' on its promises. Analysts said that Samsung was looking to move on from the crisis with the announcement, which did not implicate other devices. 'Consumers tend to be forgiving the first time,' said Tom Kang, research director at Counterpoint Technology. 'But if it happens again, it will leave a lasting mark on Samsung's quality and brand image.' Samsung had concentrated on innovative design, thinness and battery capacity rather than safety, he said. The firm's next model, the Galaxy S8, had been expected to be unveiled at next month's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, but Samsung's Koh said it would be delayed to ensure that it had no safety issues.  The second round affected the devices sent to replace the original faulty phones. These were caused by manufacturing issues, including poor welding at the battery manufacturer Koh Dong-Jin, president of Samsung Electronics¿ Mobile Communications Business apologises for the faults in its Galaxy Note 7 devices that led to their recall  Analysts said that Samsung was looking to move on from the crisis with the announcement, which did not implicate other devices. Pictured is the Galaxy S7  Customers whose devices spontaneously set on fire shared their pictures since the first incidents were reported in August Samsung deployed around 700 researchers and engineers on its investigation, testing more than 200,000 fully-assembled devices and more than 30,000 batteries, it said. It did not identify the battery makers on Monday, but independent investigators UL and Exponent agreed with the findings. Battery A had a design issue that pushed down the right corner of the battery, while Battery B had defective internal welds, said Kevin White, principal scientist at Exponent. But Koh dismissed the possibility of suing the manufacturers.  'Whatever parts we use, the overall responsibility falls to us for failing to verify its safety and quality,' he said. 'At this point, I don't think it's right to seek legal action. GIRL, 13, SUFFERS MINOR BURN FROM NOTE 7 REPLACEMENT   A Minnesota father says his daughter suffered a minor burn to her thumb when her replacement Samsung smartphone melted in her hand last week. Andrew Zuis of Farmington, Minn., said his daughter, Abby, was holding the Galaxy Note 7 in her left hand Friday when it melted. Zuis saidthat the family had acquired the new phone on the day the replacement phones were released. There had been no problem with the original phone, he said. 'She's done with Note 7s right now,' Zuis said of his daughter. Reports of more replacement phones catching fire continued  'It's very fortunate Abby was not injured and was holding the phone,' Zuis said. 'If it was in her pocket, I think it would have been a whole different situation. I'm just very disappointed in Samsung and their product.' Zuis provided KSTP-TV with receipts showing that the family bought a Galaxy Note 7 in August and then exchanged it Sept. 21 after Samsung announced the recall. Andrew Zuis, of Farmington, Minn., showed the replacement Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phone belonging to his 13-year-old daughter Abby, that melted in her hand 'She's done with Note 7s right now,' Zuis said of his daughter. A Samsung representative told KSTP that an investigation is underway. 'We want to reassure our customers that we take every report seriously and we are engaged with the Zuis family to ensure we are doing everything we can for them and their daughter,' the representative said in a statement.  Around 1,000 different parts from some 450 suppliers were needed for each Galaxy Note 7. Samsung acknowledged that it provided the specifications for the batteries, adding in its statement: 'We have taken several corrective actions to ensure this never happens again. The lessons of the past several months are now deeply reflected in our processes and in our culture.' The firm, which is set to announce fourth-quarter and full-year results on Tuesday, has estimated the cost of the recall at $5.3 billion. But investors welcomed today's announcement with Samsung shares trading up 1.9 percent at 1.90 million won in Seoul in the afternoon. The firm has separately been caught up in South Korea's wide-ranging political corruption scandal, with prosecutors last week seeking the arrest of its vice-chairman Lee Jae-Yong on charges of bribery, embezzlement and perjury. Lee, who became Samsung's de facto head after his father suffered a heart attack in 2014, is accused of bribing Choi Soon-Sil, Park's secret confidante at the centre of the scandal, and receiving policy favours from Park in return. Samsung is the single biggest contributor to two non-profit foundations controlled by Choi, but a court rejected the arrest request on grounds of insufficient evidence.

Close share panel Image copyright AFP The chief executive of Taiwan's technology giant Foxconn has confirmed his company is considering setting up a new plant in the United States. Terry Gou told reporters the investment might exceed $7bn (£5.7bn). The investment by a major supplier of Apple Inc would be likely to generate thousands of jobs, if it goes ahead. The plans come after US President Donald Trump confirmed his "America First" agenda meant overturning international trade treaties. During his campaign, and since his election, Mr Trump had repeatedly threatened high import tariffs in order to encourage US and foreign companies to move production to the US. He singled out China as a significant cause of lost manufacturing jobs in the United States. Image copyright VOISHMEL Image caption Foxconn manufactures products for Apple among other global giants Foxconn - formally known as Hon Hai Precision - has most of its factories in China where it assembles Apple's iPhones. Last year, the firm took over Japanese electronics veteran Sharp and the display-making investment being considered in the US is thought to be under the new Sharp unit. The White House website, updated after President Trump's inauguration, makes clear that the new administration will pursue plans to alter trading relationships with Asian countries. President Trump has also announced he will be renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with Canada and Mexico.

Amazon and Google always thrive in the fourth quarter as people get out their wallets for Christmas. Both companies – or in Google’s case, its parent group, Alphabet – are therefore expected to announce booming revenues in their fourth-quarter results over the next fortnight, with Alphabet going first on Thursday and Amazon the following week. But analysts are already looking beyond the simple question of how many cardboard boxes Amazon filled and how many searches Google answered. They’re wondering which company will win the battle to control your home. That battle is being fought by two carafe-sized cylinders from the respective companies. One is Amazon’s Echo, with its voice-operated “personal assistant”, Alexa; the other is Google Home, which responds to the phrase “OK Google”. Both are internet-connected, home-based devices which can be command to do things: give the weather forecast; play music; read out news headlines; update shopping lists; and control “smart” devices in the home such as light bulbs or power points. In theory, if a device can be linked to it, the Echo can control or monitor it, and keep you informed. And simply by saying “Alexa, add sugar to the shopping list”, users can keep up to date on house supplies and even purchase them directly. Amazon is in the lead, having launched the Echo in November 2014, two years before Google Home came out. Though Amazon has not – and does not – release sales figures for any individual item, investment bank Morgan Stanley estimates that 11m Echos had been sold by the end of November 2016; other estimates suggest a further 7m have been sold since. About 700,000 were estimated to have been sold in the UK and Germany, the only countries outside the US where it is available. The Morgan Stanley estimate would put an Echo in more than 8% of US households. This is a significant figure, especially compared with the best estimates for Google Home, which put its sales at less than a million since its launch in October 2016. Why should Google care about Amazon? Because voice is seen as the next big field for computer interaction, and the home is a far better environment for voice detection than the great outdoors. Research company Gartner reckons that by 2018, 30% of all interactions with devices will be voice-based, because people can speak up to four times faster than they can type, and the technology behind voice interaction is improving all the time. The risk to Google is that at the moment, almost everyone starting a general search at home begins at Google’s home page on a PC or phone. That leads to a results page topped by text adverts – which help generate about 90% of Google’s revenue, and probably more of its profits. But if people begin searching or ordering goods via an Echo, bypassing Google, that ad revenue will fall. And Google has cause to be uncomfortable. The shift from desktop to mobile saw the average number of searches per person fall as people moved to dedicated apps; Google responded by adding more ads to both desktop and search pages, juicing revenues. A shift that cut out the desktop in favour of voice-oriented search, or no search at all, would imperil its lucrative revenue stream. Amazon is copying one feature of Google’s success in smartphones: it is offering methods to connect and control smart devices via the Echo for free, rather as Google’s Android software was offered as a free platform for smartphones. There are signs it is paying off: Wynn hotels in Las Vegas announced in December that it would be adding Echos to all 5,000 rooms, for functions such as playing music and controlling curtains and blinds. That gained some notice, as much as anything because the life cycle of such hotels implies they will be there for a decade or so. Similarly, at January’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES), also in Las Vegas, commentators were struck by how many devices incorporated Alexa. And Amazon is even stealing into Google’s territory: some phones sold in the US from China’s Huawei, which uses Android, will incorporate Alexa rather than Google’s Assistant programme. Google’s natural reaction is to have its own voice-driven home system, in Home. But that poses a difficulty, illustrated by the problems it claims to solve. At the device’s launch, one presenter from the company explained how it could speak the answer to questions such as “how do you get wine stains out of a rug?” Most people would pose that question on a PC or mobile, and the results page would offer a series of paid-for ads. On Home, you just get the answer – without ads. What analysts wonder is: how can Home bridge that revenue gap? So far, Google hasn’t explained. Even if it can fend off the Echo, it may not be able to defend its core business. By contrast, the Echo’s benefit to Amazon is much clearer: it can make online shopping (at Amazon) a breeze, play music from Amazon’s paid-for subscription service, and generally act as a passive block on your using rival shopping sites – rather as Google cemented its dominance by being the default search engine on multiple browsers in the mid-2000s. Richard Windsor of Edison Investment Research suggests that time is running out for Google: “It has to act quickly, as Amazon is on the brink of becoming the industry standard for controlling smart home devices. “At CES, everyone was integrating with Echo, with Google Home and Apple HomeKit barely present.” Indeed, where are Apple and Microsoft, which also have their own voice-driven assistants in the form of Siri and Cortana? Although both can be used in the home – Siri on the iPhone or iPad, and to play content on the Apple TV set-top box, and Cortana on the Xbox games console – neither seems to be intent on the “home assistant” market. Phil Schiller, Apple’s vice-president of marketing, seemed to suggest recently that Apple wouldn’t follow Amazon and Google into offering a voice-only device: “Having my iPhone with me as the thing I speak to is better than something stuck in my kitchen or on a wall somewhere.” He also emphasised the importance of a visual display: “We still like to take pictures and we need to look at them, and a disembodied voice is not going to show me what the picture is.” Even so, there are persistent rumours that Apple has prototyped an Echo-like device in secret but is undecided on whether to release it. The company hasn’t commented. It could be ready to unveil something – or may never do so. Microsoft, meanwhile, is in more homes than the Echo via the Xbox, but isn’t trying to make itself a listening device linked to a shop. So, will we all be burbling away to thin air in a few years, asking how long our commute will take while our smartphones sit unused in the kitchen? Perhaps – though Ken Sena, a senior analyst at investment bank Evercore ISI, suggests that home-based voice assistants will never be used as widely as smartphones. According to Sena, they are not such a must-have. Yet, they were a hot Christmas present – and voice interaction is still in its early days, perhaps comparable to the smartphone market in 2005, when BlackBerry, Palm and Microsoft dominated. Or, it could be like the smartphone market now, effectively dominated by Google and Apple. But which? Alexa, can you see into the future?

Apple Looking To Facial Recognition In iPhone 8: KGI Analyst 22 January 2017, 2:00 pm EST By Athena Chan Tech Times The Evolution of iPhoneNow Playing Apple - Here's What You May Not KnowNow Playing KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says enhanced security features are expected in the rumored iPhone 8 and the 2017 iPhone lineup. Revamped biometric tech will come by way of better Touch ID and even facial recognition.  ( Justin Sullivan | Getty Images ) Advertisement Will the Touch ID security feature of the iPhone be replaced soon? A well-known analyst and forecaster of Apple's business moves has raised the possibility of Cupertino revamping its existing biometric and security features in 2017 iPhones. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says Apple might explore various new technologies such as better sensors and even a facial recognition system that it can incorporate into the latest installations of the iPhone. That includes the iPhone 8 and the mysterious iPhone X. The question is whether the Touch ID will be replaced completely. Recent predictions have stated that the new iPhones to be released later in the year will likely have remarkable features such as an embedded Home button, 5.8 inch "fixed flex" edge-to-edge display, wireless charging, and a glass body. Rumors regarding the iPhone 8 perhaps having augmented reality camera features also circulated alongside reports of possible advanced biometric capabilities. Adapting To Edge-To-Edge Design In the new report, Kuo believes that Apple may yet switch their current FCPB sensor to a film sensor to provide better sensitivity and user experience. As the new OLED iPhone is expected to have an edge-to-edge display, Kuo expects that it will also come with a flexible OLED panel. Under its film sensor, a metal structure will likely be placed for solid structural support. Touch ID And Facial Recognition Given the radical new design of the upcoming iPhones, Kuo expects the company to explore various ways to develop a new Touch ID technology to match the full screen. A likely result, Kuo says, is the placement of the fingerprint recognition "under panel" as compared to the current iPhones on the market with an "under glass" placement. The move not just complements the iPhone's new design, but also enhances the phone's security. Apple's interest in biometric tech, however, points to the company's likelihood of replacing the current Touch ID security feature with facial recognition technology. Recent bio-recognition patent applications of Apple provide clues that the company is more likely to develop a facial recognition technology rather than the initially expected iris scanner. Whether the company plans to completely bypass the Touch ID and rely solely on facial recognition is still unknown. The company's exploration of new security features is always welcome, of course. The Touch ID system, for instance, has been questioned about its merits as a viable security feature. While some believe that the system upped the security game of their iPhones, others find that the feature offers more risks than benefits. Though it is still uncertain whether the new iPhone releases will have enhanced Touch ID capabilities, facial recognition, or a possible combination, the move aims to enhance security for Apple users.

He specialises in artificial intelligence (AI) and is the only author from India who is part of an 18-member study panel of the Stanford University-hosted report titled Artificial Intelligence and Life. Kalyanakrishnan’s expertise broadly fits in the area of machine learning. Called reinforcement learning, it defines what actions software agents should take to maximize a certain type of reward after learning from reward and punishment. In an interview, he urges people to be more optimistic about the things AI can do rather than be obsessed with the fear around AI machines. Edited excerpts: How was the Stanford AI report conceived? How did you get involved? In the last 5-10 years, the public has been forced to take notice of AI. You do searches, for instance, and get the information you want. You can talk to your phone using Apple’s Siri. There is so much intelligence in your car. Everywhere, intelligent software is assisting you in your lifestyle in a very noticeable way. The common man’s perception is that AI is taking away jobs. Jobs that people used to do about 10 years back have been replaced either partially or even fully in some cases by software and hardware developments. This triggered the conversation, which led to experts being asked about their opinion of where AI is heading and what can be done about it. In the last few months, there have been some alarmist views, even by physicist Stephen Hawking. Moreover, even a person like Elon Musk, who is responsible for taking technology forward with his ventures like Tesla and SpaceX, has expressed similar sentiments—that things could go awfully wrong once we have AI doing actions that human beings traditionally have done. Eric (Horvitz, a computer scientist and technical fellow at Microsoft) has been with Microsoft Research and is primarily responsible for this report. He decided that we needed a more sober assessment of AI—not based on emotions but one that is more rigorous and scientific. We will have a study panel every five years. This is the first one. I was chosen by Peter (Peter Stone, professor at the department of computer science, University of Texas) because the study panel was looking at diversity in age, gender and geography. This came together in May 2015, and we were given a year to do this. As a group, we agreed that it is true that AI is game-changing, that it is moving at a fast pace. Hence, we did not forecast beyond 2030, because it is not scientific to do so when there is so much uncertainty about the concept. Can you list some of these uncertainties? Look back to 1995. I don’t think it was possible way back then to predict accurately some of the things that we have today. The Internet has happened, so have smartphones and social networks. It’s the nature of science and technology which makes it difficult to predict beyond a certain period. There are just too many variables. What was your contributions to the AI report? My contribution was more to define AI. We take intelligence for granted in human beings. We expect people to be able to do certain tasks, to answer questions meaningfully etc. So what are the operating principles that define intelligence? How is it constructed? What are its mathematical foundations? We have asked these questions earlier too, and even in the 70s we had automata (a machine which performs a range of functions according to a predetermined set of coded instructions). For instance, you still have churches where clocks do specific tasks (for example, birds chiming) when their gongs strike midnight. The confluence of software and mathematics really took place in the 1950s when computers became available. We had the Eniac (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) which was built during the war (World War II), and it became possible to build computer systems that could exhibit intelligence. So technically speaking, the first such computer systems were aimed at helping soldiers during the War—used to calculate things like the trajectory of a missile; planning logistics, etc. This explains why DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) has been funding computer science in general and AI for a long time. But the pioneers of AI have also been thinking about AI in scientific terms. Scientists like Alan Turing, who can be considered to be the fountainhead of AI despite the fact that he did not have access to real hardware, was one (such, who was), thinking about writing a programme to play chess. So what exactly is AI? The term was coined only in 1956 in a workshop (Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence) put together by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon and Nathaniel Rochester. So you can think of AI as a branch of computer science but it is multidisciplinary: it has constant inputs from psychologists, linguists, roboticists, etc. You know intelligence when you see it. But how do you get an artificial agent to show intelligence? Most people would consider a machine to be endowed with AI if it performs like a human being. You can think of examples like Google search or Google Maps. Computers can play chess, which was the holy grail of AI, and now even beat grandmasters. We think of intelligence as a spectrum that is constantly being propelled forward. And AI is what can do this. In some sense, AI is this desire to replicate intelligence in hardware. It is also, in a strange sense, the sum total of what an AI researcher is doing—something in robotics, NLP (natural language processing), etc. AI does not have a rigid definition. Hence we went with (Nils J.) Nilsson’s definition in the AI report (AI is that activity devoted to making machines intelligent, and intelligence is that quality that enables an entity to function appropriately and with foresight in its environment). What does the AI concept comprise? The broad architecture of an intelligent agent is one that senses the environment, which does some amount of thinking, and then takes actions in the real world. If you consider sensing, there is the whole area of Computer Vision, which tries to make sense of objects we see. We, then, have the field of speech processing that has to do with audio. When you go to actuation, you have fields like robotics, haptics, etc. AI also comprises machine learning, knowledge representation and logic. Humans typically make changes to their behaviour as they learn from experiences. So if the experience that a programme undergoes somehow changes its behaviour, you can say that the programme is applying machine learning. Now we have data-driven machine learning. Consider the case of hospitals gathering patient data—vital parameters like blood sugar level, age, gender, blood pressure, etc. Now let’s presume the hospital has collected this data for, say, 1,000 patients and diagnosed diabetic patients from this lot. A machine learning algorithm can then sift through this data and learn a predictor and predict whether a new patient (whose body parameters are available) is diabetic or not. Similar is the case with Google search that has moved from also displaying irrelevant links to using machine learning algorithms that have refined this task over the last few years. The technical base for designing machine learning systems comes primarily from streams like probability and statistics. Then we have NLP, which is the most natural. By speaking natural languages that is quite different from the language that computers use to communicate (1s and 0s—bits and bytes), NLP has got to a state when you can take a shot at machine translation. The basic building blocks for NLP comprise actual models of languages. The linguistic hierarchy of language begins with syntax, moving on to semantics (study of relationships between words and how we construct meaning) and later, pragmatics (e.g. you can use sarcasm, puns—typically where you need an understanding of culture and context). Anyone dealing with NLP has to know these branches. What about Deep Learning? Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) aim to simulate the human brain. They can be used to map inputs to predictions. There are standard learning algorithms to train ANNs based on data. Neural networks have been around for almost three decades but it was very difficult to train large and deep (with more layers) neural networks. Technically, they get stuck in the so-called Local Minimum (defined as the best solution to a problem within a small neighbourhood of possible solutions as opposed to the concept of ‘global optimum’, which is the optimal solution when every possible solution is considered). Ironically, you do need ANNs with many layers. Deep Learning helps us to successfully train larger ANNs. Will true AI ever be achieved? This has divided researchers over the decades. Most people in the AI community subscribe to the view that it does not really matter if machines are exactly replicating what human beings can do, as long as we do things that are intelligent and of value. For example, we have software that can fly an aircraft—very differently from how a human being would do it but it is doing it nevertheless. What are the challenges? Explaining AI to the public itself is a challenge. That said, can inputs be automatically learnt or combined in ways that can give higher level abstractions, to make the task of prediction easier? In the context of vision, the inputs to computer vision systems is just images (matrix of 0s and 1s). But deep learning algorithms are able to abstract things out like edges, boundaries, locations of objects, etc. You can have a deep learning system to autonomously drive a car. The software agent needs to reason about stop signs, etc., (and) not only about camera images; it has to learn a host of features from scratch. The other challenge is that hardware needs to match the pace of development in software. The brain also uses less energy than the chips that we are building today, which are simulating our neurons using a different architecture that generates a lot of heat. Hence, there is a move to develop specialized hardware using a neural architecture as opposed to the traditional Von Neumann architecture. If this becomes a reality a decade from now, we will be able to do a lot more with neural networks than we can now. Not only does a neural network need to be good at its task, it should also be energy efficient. There is a lot of scare-mongering around AI. What is your perspective on this issue? People are driven a lot by what they see in movies. Part of the common person’s concern is around the Frankenstein that will do nasty things. The fact is that AI is beginning to work in very specialized tasks like controlling an airplane or driving your car. It’s hard to think of any general AI machine that can do all of these tasks in unison—clearly something that humans excel at. As far as AI machines are concerned, this is certainly not on the horizon for at least the next 15-20 years. This scare is unfounded. But the fear that certain types of jobs will vanish because AI (software bots and machines) will do it more efficiently is genuine. Policy makers should prepare themselves for this, and proactively retrain and reskill the people who will be affected to help them cope better with the situation.
