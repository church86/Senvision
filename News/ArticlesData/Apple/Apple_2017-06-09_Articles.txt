The new app review guidelines stipulate that developers may no longer create their own pop-ups to ask for a rating. Apple is making it mandatory to use its official in-app rating function in the Apple API. This will only allow apps to show review pop-ups three times a year, and will block apps from presenting the pop-up if you have already rated them. Users will also be able to opt out of receiving pop-ups entirely.

The last of the big four US carriers has announced its sales plans for the new 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models. Sprint has begun taking orders for the two new Apple tablets and will begin shipping them and stocking them in stores from Tuesday, June 13. Some specific models, like the 64GB silver 12.9-incher, have already sold to the point where shipments may be delayed as far back as June 19. The odd model out is the 256GB silver 12.9-incher with a “ship by” date of July 15. Mind you, the 12.9-inch model has been updated to feature the same Apple A10X Fusion processor and improved display technology as seen on the new 10.5-inch model (basically a 9.7-inch iPad Pro’s shell with a larger screen). As Apple has set the prices for these devices, all Sprint can do is offer installment options. Both iPad Pro has financing options where the down payment grows by $100 with each memory tier — and that’s with good credit. Here’s the breakdown: iPad Pro Model Down payment Monthly installments (24) Full retail price 10.5" (64GB) 0 $32.50 $779.99 10.5" (256GB) $100 $32.50 $879.99 10.5" (512GB) $200 $36.67 $1079.99 12.9" (64GB) $100 $34.59 $929.99 12.9" (256GB) $200 $34.59 $1029.99 12.9" (512GB) $300 $38.75 $1229.99 T-Mobile, if you’re wondering, is capping monthly payments for all iPad Pro models at $30 for two years and is ramping the down payment for each version accordingly. If you don’t need cellular connectivity with your iPad Pro, perhaps consider what Best Buy is doing for the cheaper Wi-Fi only variants. Or, worse comes to worst, buy it from Apple.

You can’t possibly remember everything you come across. But when something is important, it helps to have a quick way to remember it. Smart technology is dumbing down the human race Is Smarter Technology Dumbing Down the Human Race? Is Smarter Technology Dumbing Down the Human Race? As a child, you memorized your friend's phone numbers; now you just add them to your phone. You used to memorize directions; now you just use your GPS. Are humans becoming stupid? Read More , but it’s also about how you use it. Offloading the non-important bits of your memory to a device will free up room for you to retain other information. There’s no reason for you to remember John the assistant’s birthday or your mother-in-law’s favorite color, so let one of these apps do it for you instead. 1. Google Assistant (Android, iOS): The Best “Remember” Voice Command Google Assistant, the company’s answer to Siri, is the most remarkable piece of artificial intelligence in any phone. You probably don’t know the remarkable things Assistant can do 10 Things You Didn't Know Google Assistant Could Do 10 Things You Didn't Know Google Assistant Could Do Android's version of Siri -- Google Assistant -- is more powerful than most people realize. Read More . One of those is smartly remembering things for you — and we don’t just mean reminders. As usual, this works via voice commands. Say “OK Google” followed by “Remember,” and then speak whatever you need it to remember. For example, “Remember I parked the car on level 2 bay P-3.” Later, ask Google Assistant, “OK Google, where did I park the car?” and it will spit out the answer. Android users will need the Google Allo app to use Assistant Google's Most Interesting: Apps, Projects, and Services You Must Know About Google's Most Interesting: Apps, Projects, and Services You Must Know About Google always has dozens of projects going at any given time and it can be hard to keep track of them all.

Wonder (Messenger, Google Home, Amazon Echo): The Anti-Google Antidote If you don’t want to offload more of your private information to Google, there’s another app that does what Assistant does. Wonder is a bot that works with Facebook Messenger, and smart voice controllers like Google Home and Amazon Echo Amazon Echo vs. Google Home vs. Apple's Competitor Amazon Echo vs. Google Home vs. Apple's Competitor In this article, you'll learn the differences between the Amazon Echo and Google Home. We'll also take a look at what features an Apple speaker may include. Read More . Wonder calls itself a search engine for your personal life, but it’s not as invasive as it sounds. You need to actively command the things you want it to remember. You will again use the “Remember” command, whether typing it in Messenger or saying it out loud to Echo or Home. Wonder uses natural language processing, so you don’t have to be robotic about how you feed it information. But be warned, it doesn’t work as well as Google Assistant does. 3. Reminder Team (Web): When You Don’t Want to Sign In What do you do when you want to remember something for later, but don’t have one of your gadgets or a reminder app with you? Reminder Team is the easy no-signup website that you need 15 Excellent No-Sign Up Websites for Everyday Use 15 Excellent No-Sign Up Websites for Everyday Use Do you like websites which have no sign-ups, no registerations, and no downloads? Then, you will like these hassle free web apps and sites which make daily productivity a lot easier. Read More . What you’ll do is write an email to yourself from Reminder Team. Key in your email address, the message, and when to send it. That’s right, you can schedule the email to be sent later. You can also make that email come to you every month, every quarter, or every year. It’s a ridiculously simple web app that you should bookmark for future use. In fact, make your life easier and remember “ReminderTeam.com” so that you don’t need to remember anything else. 4. WorldBrain (Chrome, Firefox): Full-Text Search of Your Browser It has happened to each of us. You were browsing something on the web a long time ago, and you need it now. But you don’t remember the website’s name or anything else about it. Don’t worry, WorldBrain will remember it for you. WorldBrain calls itself a “(Re)search-Engine” because it’s all about searching your own personal data. While you browse the web, WorldBrain will be quietly remembering everything you do. Don’t worry, all the data is stored locally, it never goes to the cloud (unless you specifically want it to). Plus, it stores all the text of every page, so you are actually searching the whole page, not just the title. When you need to look anything up, search WorldBrain through the omnibar of your Chrome or Firefox browser. And yes, it also works with Opera or other Chromium browsers How to Install Google Chrome Extensions in Opera Browser How to Install Google Chrome Extensions in Opera Browser Opera is making a case for you to switch to it.

Cozi and Process Street: Premade Checklists for Anything To-do lists keep you productive, but what happens when you forget to add things to to-do lists? Some tasks are so small and repetitive that you don’t add them, and then you don’t complete them. Instead of trying to remember every small piece of an item, use pre-made checklists and to-do lists. Two apps do this better than any others to help forgetful people remember things 12 Apps To Help Forgetful People Remember Things 12 Apps To Help Forgetful People Remember Things Organization can prove tricky for forgetful people. From recalling birthdays to putting faces to names, here are 12 awesome apps that can help you remember pretty much anything. Read More . Cozi (Web, Android, iOS, Windows) is a family organization app that has plenty of checklist templates you can use. From grocery staples to vacation planning, there’s a checklist for almost anything that a household needs. Process Street (Web) is pretty new, but anyone who works in an office will love it. This app is meant more for companies, so the checklists are made accordingly. For example, there is a “Daily Store Opening Checklist” or a “Client Onboarding for a Marketing Agency” list. It covers most of the top industries, with detailed checklists for each. The free version gives you five checklists at a time, but you can pay to use unlimited checklists.

If not, then now is the time to prepare because it will have a huge impact on ASO. A few days ago, Apple unveiled the iOS 11. It is their upcoming iOS operating system update due this fall. It comes with new improvements such as the new cards layout, the removal of the top grossing chart in the main navigation, new ratings and reviews look, app preview updates, IAP purchases updates, and the metadata overhaul. In this post, we’ll just talk about the improvements that will impact ASO, so let us begin. iOS 11 Update – Changes in the App Name In iOS 11, the Title field will be reduced from 50 to 30 characters. And to make up for the loss Apple added the Subtitle field that can hold up to 30 characters. With this in mind, prepare a new title for your app, as well as the subtitle. Make sure to not spam it with keywords. Use relevant keywords and maximize the space allotted. I suggest that you target long tail keywords and use exact match. iOS 11 Update – Changes in App Preview Apple decided to give more focus on the app preview. They will show up before the screenshots, so while you still can, create an awesome app previews for all your apps. Apple decided to give more focus on the app preview. They will show up before the screenshots, so while you still can, create an awesome app previews for all your apps. iOS 11 Update – Changes in the In-app Purchases If your app does not have IAPs, now is the time to rethink. IAPs can boost your ASO rankings because this will appear in the search results and will be indexed by Apple. You can have up to 20 IAPs and both the name and the description are going to be indexed. IAPs Name can hold up to 30 characters, while the description can hold up to 45. Imagine how many keywords can you put in there! iOS 11 Update – Changes in the App Description The app description looks promising because Apple might index this field in their next update. Why did I say so? Apple said that we have to upload a new build whenever we make an update on the description. I don’t know, but it seems like a hint to me.  There will be a Promotional Text field as well, where you can add notes about your app’s latest news and promotions. This will not be indexed though. Final Thoughts So there you have it. That’s everything you need to know about the upcoming iOS 11 update – ASO wise! iOS 11 means a lot to the users, but it will be even more revolutionary for ASO providers looking to push their apps to the top of App Store rankings. So what are you waiting for? Gather your team and start preparing a new ASO strategy for your apps while you still have time!

REUTERS/Brian Snyder (Reuters) Reuters REUTERS Friday, June 9, 2017, 12:53 PM By Ross Kerber CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (Reuters) - Apple CEO Tim Cook on Friday warned graduates at MIT, a pioneer in fields like computers and robots, about technology's dehumanizing aspects and urged them to infuse its development with their own values. "I’m not worried about artificial intelligence giving computers the ability to think like humans," Cook said in his commencement speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "I'm more concerned about people thinking like computers, without values or compassion, without concern for consequence." Speaking to thousands of students and their families at MIT's Cambridge, Massachusetts, campus, Cook praised the benefits of new devices and social media. But he also cautioned that the same technologies can divide people through threats to privacy or security, and said technology must be tempered with human knowledge. "Technology is capable of doing great things, but it doesn't want to do great things. It doesn't want anything," the Apple Inc chief executive said. "That part takes all of us." Cook’s speech did not break new ground for him as head of the world's most valuable technology company but added some context around some of his past decisions, such as taking controversial stances to protect privacy rights and investing heavily in green technologies. Cook has criticized President Donald Trump’s policies but offered only a gentle joke at the president's expense on Friday, telling students it is obvious they have taken over Trump’s Twitter account. “I can tell college students are behind it because most of the tweets happen at 3 a.m.,” Cook said. His 15-minute talk stood in contrast to a lengthier graduation speech his predecessor, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, gave at MIT rival Stanford University in 2005, in which Jobs outlined his free-thinking background and told graduates to find work they loved. Cook took a more conventional career path to the top of Apple, where he became CEO in 2011 after stints at IBM and Compaq. Cook, who is openly gay but famously circumspect, gave few details about his own life on Friday except to outline what he described as a frustrating search for meaning until joining Apple. He said at one point he sought guidance in religion and last year met with Pope Francis, who Cook said reinforced his own sense that technology must be harnessed with strong values. He said Francis told him, “Never has humanity had such power over itself, yet nothing ensures that it will be used wisely."

And unless it’s a newer model with recent software updates, your security could be at risk. Two competing operating systems own the real estate in our smart phones: Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android. Apple’s phones are expensive — the cheapest model starts at $400, while some Android phones cost less than $50. Android users are more likely to have fragmented security updates than Apple’s streamlined ones. ASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge The closed system Apple has built means that everyone who has an iOS device gets access to the same software and security updates at about the same time. Android, though, is much more fragmented. Mary Madden, a researcher with Data & Society, says low income people are more reliant on their phones as the primary form of Internet access. This is how they pay bills, connect with friends and family, and access education and work opportunities. “All of these differences in digital security are important because they can result in disproportionate levels of surveillance such as law enforcement monitoring during protests or a greater likelihood that low-income smartphone users will experience malware attacks,” Madden told CNNTech. More malware is written for Androids than iPhones. On top of that, almost half of the top 50 Android devices didn't have the most recent security updates by the end of 2016, according to Google. Even if your phone is only a year or two out of date, it’s vulnerable to some very simple hacks, says Nathan Freitas, a fellow at Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society. “It doesn’t take much for your adversary to get into your [Android] device, and that's a big problem.” When Google releases an update to Android, it takes a while to get to consumers, unless you have a Google-branded phone like the Pixel. Carriers and device makers customize Android with different apps and services, and there are at least 11 different versions of Android. Each customized version has to be updated separately by the carrier or device maker before rolling out to consumers. Google, for its part, is constantly working to improve device security. Recently, it introduced Google Play Protect, which monitors Android devices and alerts you if there are security risks. And its line of inexpensive laptops — Chromebooks — are regarded by experts as some of the most secure computers you can buy. Last year, the FCC and FTC launched an inquiry into mobile security updates, and asked mobile carriers and device manufacturers to explain the process of releasing security updates. The results have not been released, however the FCC told CNN Tech that they have received responses and are reviewing results. Android is slightly more popular in the United States than iOS, with 53 percent of smart phone users on Google’s operating system, compared with 45 percent on Apple. Globally, Android is significantly more popular — almost 90 percent of phones shipped in the third quarter of 2016 ran Android. But the demographics break out even further: College-educated people tend to buy iPhones over Androids; Androids are more popular with low-income Americans; and African-Americans are more likely to have an Android than an iPhone. This gap between the security haves and have nots is often called the “digital security divide,” which researcher Chris Soghoian described in a 2016 Ted Talk. And the security differences between Android and iOS are also a problem for developers. People who build apps — especially those with secure functionality — have to build multiple versions for Android and potentially decide not to support outdated phones. Beyond security updates, there are other differences between the brands, such as Apple’s default messenger is iMessage, which is encrypted when you chat with other iOS users. Texting on Android isn’t encrypted by default, and full-disk encryption isn’t mandatory on all Android phones.

Tablets by Chris Matyszczyk 10 June 2017 6:28 am AEST @ChrisMatyszczyk Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives. This is a scene from an Apple ad. Who'd have thunk it? Apple/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET Apple's in its 40s now.  When you get there, you want everyone to believe you're still young and strong, the apogee of vibrant power. Even if you might shortly need a hip replacement. Lately, Cupertino has been running ads based on, gasp, tweets -- something Apple itself never really bothered with.  The latest ad, though, has a loud explosion in it. For many who have followed Apple over the years, this might seem so very un-Apple, cool as it's always been. Here, though, Apple is responding to a young man who's desperate for a more powerful computer. To which the voice-over replies he should get an iPad Pro.  Apple has been desperate to persuade for some time now that the iPad Pro is a computer. Microsoft has been desperate to laugh at the idea. In this ad, Apple uses a wonderfully hard-selly, macho voice to intone about the A10x fusion chip. This turns the iPad Pro into the Arnold Schwarzenegger of tablets. Or, um, computers. The ad is so spectacularly teenage and so pleasantly un-Apple.  In another ad released on Friday, Apple wants you to believe its stylus, aka Pencil, has no lag. There's a joke in this ad and a man screaming loudly. Yes, more loud noise.  Apple didn't stop there with the younger-pandering notions.  More Technically Incorrect Uber -- how do you make it likable? Apple confronts Trump climate agenda during NBA finals In an ad from earlier this week, a young girl tweet-complains: "I hate everything."  Apple's helpful dad-voice replies: "Well, you're really going to hate the new iPad Pro because you can do pretty much everything with it."  It's really quite charming watching Apple try to be nice and the young, slightly Gothic girl merely offering hate in return. The cleverness in this campaign is that Apple is trying to be short, youthful (without being fake) and relatively witty.  The young don't have the patience for you, old Tim. They want to know what you've got and they want to know now. In as few characters as possible. Oh, make some powerful noise too. The young are very easily distracted.

How safe is your Appl Watch in your hands? Is it safe from hackers? If it's stolen, how easily can a thief reset or steal the data from Apple Watch? Below are the 5 precautions you need to take on Apple Watch security. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Activation lock If your Apple Watch is stolen, the first thing to do is to take out your iPhone open the Apple Watch App -> choose "Apple Watch" from My Watch -> select Mark as a Missing option. This option will disable the Apple Pay options and activates the Activation Lock feature. This makes the Watch useless until the correct Apple ID and password are entered. Passcode Always make sure that you enable a passcode on your watch if you are not sure about it. It has different options ranging from a 4-digit password, more than 4-digit password and an option to unlock the watch from your iPhone. These options are available from the Apple Watch app on your iPhone in the "Passcode" menu. Erase Data after 10 failed attempts If you don't want anyone to see the data after it gets stolen, it is better to enable "Erase Data" option from the passcode menu. This will delete your watch's data when someone enter the wrong passcode more than 10 times. Data Privacy If you don't want to share your personal data with anyone, you can turn it off by heading on to Privacy Settings -> Motion and Fitness menu of the Apple Watch App on your iPhone.

Not only because cracks make it difficult to use your phone as a very expensive mirror, but also because Apple has made fixing those cracks a time-consuming nightmare that involves sitting in an Apple store for hours. Now, Reuters reports that butter-fingered iPhone users may be able to spend hours in a Best Buy instead.   Apple is finally letting other vendors fix their phones, giving authorized third-party repair stores access to their proprietary glass-fixing devices, called Horizon Machines. By the end of 2017, there will be 400 authorized third-party repair centers in 25 countries, Apple executives told Reuters, including Best Buy. It's hard to say whether Apple has seen the error of its iPhone-fixing ways or if they are simply acting preemptively as more states sign on to so-called "right to repair" bills that are intended to help consumers fix their very expensive mirrors despite efforts by tech companies to monopolize the repair market.  [Photo: Flickr user mjayspanet]  ML Apple 06.09.17 | 4:14 pm A drone crash knocked out power to City Hall and 1,600 utility customers in Mountain View: police Police in Mountain View, California, say an errant drone crashed into a power line Thursday night, cutting power to City Hall and a public library, as well as 1,600 utility customers. Authorities say the crash caused tens of thousands of dollars in damage, with repairs finished early Friday morning. Officers say flying the drone in the area was "not permitted," citing FAA regulations. They're asking for help finding the suspected pilot, described as a white man with white hair driving a white hatchback. [Photo: via Mountain View Police Department] SM Drone Seize the day!

For the second time in a month, the network has cut ties with someone for publicly espousing anti-Trump views. June 9, 2017 ">First it was Kathy Griffin; now it's Reza Aslan's turn. CNN said today it will not move forward with a second season of Aslan's show Believer after he called Trump a "piece of shit" on Twitter. Aslan deleted the tweet and apologized, but conservative groups like Media Research Center have been demanding his head. Now they have it. Aslan's full statement is below.  My statement about the cancellation of #Believer pic.twitter.com/ITtXAyQwd5— Reza Aslan (@rezaaslan) June 9, 2017 CZ kathy griffin 06.09.17 | 3:49 pm Trump says he’d testify under oath about Comey—here’s the thing about presidents testifying under oath  President Donald Trump today said he would "100%" testify under oath about the conversations he had with former FBI director James Comey. Yesterday, Comey testified before the Senate and divulged many bombshells about his interactions with the president. Trump is now denying these claims. Two very important things to note: One, Trump also said he'd release his tax returns and make Mexico pay for a giant wall, neither of which has happened yet. Two, the United States impeached a president 20 years ago because he lied under oath.  Who knows what the future holds?

The capability comes courtesy of Nuance, the speech recognition and virtual assistant provider that already integrates with several other messaging services, including Facebook Messenger, WeChat, and text messaging. Nuance's Nina platform powers customer service bots for about 6,500 companies and organizations, including many telecoms, banks, and airlines. "If you call a bank and can speak to a virtual assistant, that's almost certainly our technology," says Nuance EVP Robert Weideman. Nuance claims that Nina-powered bots can resolve 80% of customer requests, such as transferring money, or changing airline seats. The Apple deal comes just over a week after Nuance announced that Nina-powered bots will be available on Amazon Alexa smart speakers and eventually on Google Home. Could Siri and Apple HomePod be next?

At the same time, Pandora is selling TicketFly, the ticket-selling service it acquired in 2015, to Eventbrite for $200 million. So much for the idea of Pandora getting into the ticketing business and rewiring the way concerts get booked and sold. For now, it seems like the streaming pioneer's biggest priority is sorting out its core business and trying to become a legit player in the on-demand subscription market dominated by Spotify.  JPT pandora 06.09.17 | 12:39 pm J.K. Rowling just said what every woman online thinks in an epic 14-tweet rant There is one thing that unites women of any age, background, or political allegiance who are in the public eye: being the recipient of online vitriol from men. It's so bad that every 10 seconds, someone on Twitter calls a woman a "slut" or "whore."   Today, beloved Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling addressed a frustrating element of that trend: When men who identify as liberal (and maybe even feminist) use those same degrading slurs against conservative women.  Her 14-tweet rant laid out how the words men use to insult women speak betray their real values even if they profess to be liberal. "I don't care whether we're talking about Theresa May or Nicola Sturgeon or Kate Hooey or Yvette Cooper or Hillary Clinton: femaleness is not a design flaw. If your immediate response to a woman who displeases you is to call her a synonym for her vulva, or compare her to a prostitute, then drop the pretense and own it: you're not a liberal." Just unfollowed a man whom I thought was smart and funny, because he called Theresa May a whore. 1/14— J.K.

Justin Amash (R-Mich.) in a primary election, reports the New York Times's Eric Lipton. The Hatch Act is a federal law that limits federal employees from engaging in political activities.

He spoke about his career trajectory and how working at Apple—and meeting Steve Jobs—helped the technology guru find his life's purpose. While the speech revolved around finding one's purpose in a profession, Cook also warned about technology's potential ills. "Technology alone isn't the solution," he said, "sometimes it's even part of the problem." He named some specific culprits including fake news and "social media that becomes antisocial." Cook concluded this line of thought by imploring the graduates to imbue future technology with humanity and empathy. "I'm not worried about artificial intelligence giving computers the ability to think like humans," he said. "I'm worried about people thinking like computers without values or compassion."

Shares of the social media, er, camera company fell to near-record lows of $18.09 this morning after some press outlets picked up on reports that downloads of the Snapchat app are in decline. According to Fortune—which cited an investor note from Nomura's Instinet—app downloads have dropped by 22% in the last two months. Even more startling, Snapchat downloads on Apple's iOS tumbled more than 40% in the first two months of the second quarter. Stagnate user growth has been a chief concern for Snap investors since its IPO earlier this year, and with Facebook and Instagram cloning Snapchat features like there's no tomorrow, it's hard to see how things improve.  [Photo: Flickr user Anthony Quintano] CZ Snap Inc 06.09.17 | 9:15 am Facebook posts mocking the Thai royal family lead to a 35-year prison sentence A social media user in Thailand was given 35-year prison sentence over Facebook posts that mocked the country's royal family. The 33-year-old man allegedly posted a series of photos, comments, and videos using a fake account that impersonated another person he was in a fight with, according to TechCrunch, which cited a report from the local reform group iLaw. The group identified the man simply as Whichai.  Thailand has strict lèse majesté laws that make it illegal to mock the royal family, and the military-run government has been cracking down, going so far as to threaten to jail Facebook users who like, share, or even look at offending posts on social media, the Bangkok Post reported last month. Whichai's 35-year sentence is the most severe yet, BP reports. Initially, he was sentenced to 70 years but the court cut that in half after he confessed.  [Photo: hanibaram/iStock] CGW Facebook 06.09.17 | 9:00 am Uber is interviewing engineers from Luxe valet service  Despite the damning headlines and all the controversy over sexist workplace issues, Uber is continuing business as usual. That includes considering an acquisition of some of Luxe Valet's engineers and technology. The company is currently in talks with Luxe about a solution that involves short-term car rentals, according to the Wall Street Journal. Luxe has reportedly struggled with costs and it shut down its app last month. Founders Curtis Lee and Craig Martin will apparently retain the Luxe name and some of its technology with plans to relaunch. RR Uber 06.09.17 | 7:37 am This leaked memo sent by Uber’s Travis Kalanick set guidelines on having sex with employees The "Miami letter," which was obtained by Recode, laid out ground rules on sexual activity for about 400 Uber staff members who were attending a company event in Miami in 2013. The memo, a reflection of the ride-hailing giant's frat-house culture, was reportedly notorious at Uber and included such lines as "You better read this or I'll kick your ass." Among the guidelines was: "Do not have sex with another employee UNLESS a) you have asked that person for that privilege and they have responded with an emphatic "YES! I will have sex with you" AND b) the two (or more) of you do not work in the same chain of command." Other cringeworthy lines from the memo: • "Yes, that means that Travis will be celibate on this trip. #CEOLife #FML [Fuck My Life]." • "There will be a $200 puke charge for any public displays on the Shore Club premises."  • "Do not throw large kegs off of tall buildings."  MB travis kalanick Advertise Privacy Policy Terms About Us Site Map Fast Company & Inc © Mansueto Ventures, LLC

Planet of the Apps is a marketing tool, not compelling television. By Emily Bary June 9, 2017 3:41 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Illustration: Pixabay Apple has been late to the game with original content. If its initial effort means anything, the company remains lackadaisical about creating quality TV. Apple premiered its first show -- Planet of the Apps -- on Tuesday. The 10-episode run is available only to Apple Music subscribers, a rather small base of customers. The new show is unlikely to compel additional sign-ups. (The pilot episode is available free for a “limited time.”) More from Barron’s Next You Won’t Have to Wait for That iPhone 8 iPhone Users Have Seen the Galaxy and They’re Not Impressed How Apple Is Trying to Fix This Weak Link Planet of the Apps follows iOS app developers as they try to earn the support of celebrity panelists and ultimately win venture-capital funding for their apps. Hopeful developers make a 60-second “escalator pitch” for their products as they descend down a moving walkway to reach judges Jessica Alba, will.i.am, Gwenyth Paltrow, and Gary Vaynerchuk. Following the pitch, the star panel votes on whether it wants to hear more about the app. As long as there’s one “yes” vote, the judges begin peppering the developer with questions about business models, user counts, and competitive advantages. I’m fascinated by new technology and Apple products, and still I was bored while watching this show. Maybe it’s entertaining to watch celebrities critique bad singers on The Voice, but the concept doesn’t extend to apps, as just about anyone but the Apple programming team could have predicted. It might be fun to watch people take risks on stage, but it’s hard to get emotionally invested in software. The show’s presentation doesn’t do much to help. Definitions of tech words get flashed on screen throughout the pitches, which makes the whole thing feel like a college lecture. In the first episode, terms related to “augmented reality” popped up on multiple occasions. The AR primer felt like a promotional gimmick to get people more excited about the technology. AR, of course, is one of the big new iOS features Apple talked about in its keynote address this week. Apple seems more interested in scoring marketing points for iOS than creating original television, and that’s not going to fly in a TV market that’s already saturated with great content. From a business perspective, Apple’s aim is also unclear. Is it to grow Apple Music’s base to better compete with Spotify? Is it to create a credible streaming alternative to Netflix, Amazon.com, or Hulu? (Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment.) The company has another original coming in August, when it rolls out a series based on the Carpool Karaoke segments made popular by James Corden. The company should hope its second attempt at original content goes better. Planet of the Apps is not a promising start. New episodes of Planet of the Apps come out every Tuesday and are available only to Apple Music subscribers.

(We love, for example, their Apple Watch.) These days, every iteration of the iPhone becomes a must-have item before it hits the store, creating a fervor for the products that is unmatched in the tech world. (Judging by the hype, the iPhone 8 will be no exception.) However, the latest Apple object of everyone's desire isn't particularly sleek and futuristic. In fact, it's a chunky, retro edition that is positively dated by today's standards of design. We're auctioning off a vintage, rare pair of #Apple sneakers, made only for employees in the 1990s: https://t.co/OXgFMLPMJe via @SneakerNews pic.twitter.com/8TTVtd9AAn — Heritage M&C Art (@heritagemandc) June 3, 2017 Advertisement Advertisement Daily Dose Keep this field blank Enter your email address You may unsubscribe at any time. Privacy Policy | About Us We're referring to this pair of Apple Sneakers, which is being auctioned off for $15,000 by Heritage M&C Art. They're big, all-white low-tops with what looks like solid heel cushioning and a puffiness typical of many '90s sneakers. And it's their vintage appeal and novelty that is surely what's driving that price tag up. For reference, the latest pair of Yeezy Powerphase Calabasas sneakers, which bear some resemblance to these kicks, retailed for $120. Perhaps Apple's original rainbow logo just has that much more cachet than Adidas' three stripes. Stunningly, the Verge points out that Heritage actually believes the shoes to be worth double their starting price. Yes, $30,000. These shoes are like a fine wine. Of course, if these sneakers are out of your price range, you aren't the only one. Here's one pair of cheaper alternatives that will be able to serve as your shoe for the summer. Or, you can try one of these five pairs of nice warm weather kicks instead. Tags: sneakersnewstech Privacy Policy  |  About Us Copyright © 2017 Rodale Inc.

Apple made a change that could save 50% of your iPhone's camera storage Alex Heath Business Insider June 9, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share iPhone 6 Gold cameraMore (George Frey/Stringer/Getty Images) What if you could save half of your iPhone's camera storage without doing anything differently? That's what Apple is promising with iOS 11, the next major software update for iPhone and iPad coming this fall. Thanks to a technical change, Apple is promising that photos and videos you shoot will require 50% of the storage they do now. That's because Apple is switching from the h.264 video compression and JPEG photo formats to HEVC and HEIF. We were first alerted to the change by 9to5Mac, which tested iOS 11's developer beta and found that the new formats cut the file size of photos nearly in half while maintaining image quality. That's good news for iPhone and iPad owners who are concerned with saving storage. It also paves the way for Apple to bring higher-quality 4K video, which uses HEVC as well, to the Apple TV. The only catch is that these new photo and video formats will only work on Apple devices running the A9 processor or newer. That means you won't get this storage-saving change if your device is older than the iPhone 6s or 2017 iPad.

A Beijing court said the case has been brought by a production center that alleges that Apple has infringed its exclusive online rights to broadcast a film that depicts Chinese fighting against Japanese soldiers in northern China in the early 1930s. The plaintiff also sued the developer and operator of the Youku HD app available on Apple’s App Store that it said enabled users to watch the film and caused it “huge economic losses,” according to the Beijing Haidian District People’s Court. The court said it has accepted the case brought by Movie Satellite Channel Program Production Center that comes under the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television. The plaintiff alleged that Apple has infringed its exclusive online rights to broadcast “Xuebo dixiao,” which loosely translates as “Bloody Fight with the Fierce Enemy” and was first shown in 1994. The production center is also suing Heyi Information and Technology (Beijing) Company Ltd., which developed and operated the Youku HD app, the court said in an online statement Thursday. The app is sold by Youku.com, according to information on Apple’s iTunes site. The Youku site is one of China’s best known movie and TV program streaming sites and is owned by Youku Tudou Inc., which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The plaintiff wants the two companies to immediately stop broadcasting the film and is seeking compensation of 50,000 yuan ($7,500) plus its “reasonable expenditure” of 20,158 yuan ($3,000) in attempting to stop the infringement of its rights, the court said. Emailed requests for comment to Apple spokespeople were not answeredSaturday, and a spokesman for Youku Tudou was not able to immediately comment. Apple Inc. has recently faced legal setbacks and other obstacles in China, its second-biggest global market. In April, it suspended its iBooks and iTunes Movies services, reportedly due to an order by Chinese regulators. In May, a Beijing intellectual property tribunal in Beijing ordered Apple to stop selling its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in the city after finding they look too much like a model made by a small Chinese brand. Sales of the phones are continuing while Apple appeals. Also that month, Apple suffered another setback when a court ruled that a Chinese company is allowed to use the iPhone trademark on bags, wallets and other leather goods.

Macs & Mac OS X | 06 Jun 2017 | Print  | Comment (21) Apple Beefs Up iMac and MacBook Lines, Teases the iMac Pro by Adam C. Engst At WWDC 2017 today, Apple devoted a non-trivial segment of the keynote to new Mac hardware, showing off improved iMacs and performance-enhanced MacBook Pros and mentioning a speed bump to the MacBook Air in passing. After running through all the changes to today’s models, Apple gave a sneak preview of the iMac Pro, a workstation-class version of the 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display that’s scheduled to ship at the end of the year. No mention was made of the Mac mini or Mac Pro, though Apple has already said that the Mac Pro is in the middle of a major redesign that won’t be done until 2018 at the earliest (see “Maca Culpa: Apple Admits Mac Pro Missteps and Promises More Transparency,” 4 April 2017). iMac -- The workhorse of Apple’s desktop line has long been the iMac, which Apple continues to offer in three basic models: a 21.5-inch non-Retina version, a 21.5-inch iMac with 4K Retina display, and the 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display. On the CPU front, each model receives a speed bump thanks to Apple using Intel’s 7th generation “Kaby Lake” processors and increasing clock speeds. You can see the specifics on Apple’s Tech Specs page, but the summary is that Apple is focusing more effort on the 21.5 Retina iMac, offering just a single configuration of the non-Retina model. Benchmarks will show how much faster the combination of new CPUs and higher clock speeds will be, but I suspect purchases will mostly be based on price. Although the iMac Retina displays are already gorgeous, Apple claims to have improved them even more in both the 21.5-inch and 27-inch sizes, increasing brightness 43 percent to 500 nits and supporting display of up to 1 billion colors. The non-Retina iMac model drives its screen with the integrated Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, but all the Retina models now take advantage of Radeon Pro GPUs, the 555 and 560 for the 21.5-inch models and the 570, 575, and 580 models for the 27-inch models. The notable win here is for the 21.5-inch Retina models, which were previously limited to integrated Intel Iris Pro Graphics 6200. Apple has made the Fusion Drive standard in more configurations, and the company claims that the SSDs available in 256 GB, 512 GB, and 1 TB capacities are up to 50 percent faster. You can also configure the top-of-the-line 27-inch iMac with a 2 TB SSD for a whopping $1400. When it comes to RAM, all base models still ship with 8 GB. The non-Retina iMac and low-end 21.5 Retina model remain limited to 16 GB, but the high-end 21.5-inch Retina model can now take 16 GB or 32 GB, a welcome improvement. Similarly, the low-end 27-inch model still maxes out at 32 GB, but the two higher-end models can take 16 GB, 32 GB, or 64 GB. RAM in the 21.5-inch iMac models cannot be upgraded by the user, but you can install memory in the 27-inch model yourself. Unsurprisingly, Apple replaced the previous models’ Thunderbolt 2 ports with a pair of Thunderbolt 3 ports that support DisplayPort for external screens, Thunderbolt at up to 40 Gbps, USB 3.1 Gen 2 at up to 10 Gbps, and various other protocols via adapters (see “Explaining Thunderbolt 3, USB-C, and Everything In Between,” 3 November 2016). All these changes are welcome for anyone in the market for a new iMac. I doubt they’re significant enough to warrant trading in an existing Retina iMac, unless Thunderbolt 3 is a necessity. The most interesting changes are actually in the 21.5-inch models, which move past the RAM and graphics limitations of the previous configuration while introducing a cheaper config. The 21.5-inch non-Retina iMac remains priced at $1099, with the two Retina configurations starting at $1299 and $1499. The 27-inch model comes in three configurations: $1799, $1999, and $2299. They’re all available now. Perhaps I’m just boggled by the number of changes Apple announced in the WWDC keynote, but I couldn’t see how to give more context for the changes in relation to previous configurations because the matrix of what models get which build-to-order options was just too complicated. If you want to price out different possibilities, I recommend opening several browser windows so you can compare the configurations side by side. MacBook, MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air -- As with the iMac, Apple updated the processors in the MacBook and MacBook Pro with new Kaby Lake processors running at higher clock speeds. That should improve performance, although likely not by that much. The MacBook Pro models also get improved graphics processing, with the 13-inch MacBook Pro models using Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 and 650, and the 15-inch models switching to Radeon Pro 555 and 560 discrete GPUs on top of Intel HD Graphics 630 and 640. You can now buy a MacBook with 16 GB of RAM, up from the previous limit of 8 GB, and Apple claims that the MacBook’s onboard SSD is up to 50 percent faster. That might make the MacBook a more attractive option, given that lackluster performance was one of its main disadvantages. Despite rumors to the contrary, the MacBook Air lives, but it sees the least change, replacing its stock 1.6 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with a 1.8 GHz model. It remains upgradeable to an Intel Core i7 running at 2.2 GHz. Although these changes are all positive, they do nothing to simplify the difficulty of choosing between the three models. Each falls into the three-dimensional graph of price, performance, and size in a different spot. You’ll have to decide what’s most important to you — cost, speed, or portability — and figure out which of Apple’s notebooks best fits your needs. As with the new iMac models, these updated notebooks are all available now. iMac Pro -- During the private media meeting in which Apple executives confessed to the company’s sins with regard to the Mac Pro, mention was made of pro-related announcements about the iMac coming this year. Apple has now revealed more of what that means, pulling back the curtains on the iMac Pro. Due in December 2017, the iMac Pro retains the same form factor of the 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display, but swaps the brushed aluminum look for a space gray finish that extends to the Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad, Magic Mouse 2, and an optional Magic Trackpad 2. The goal of the iMac Pro is to provide workstation-class performance within the iMac design. The hardest part of that is dealing with heat, because the iMac Pro will feature Intel Xeon processors in 8-core, 10-core, or 18-core configurations. Also playing into the necessary thermal architecture redesign is Apple’s use of a new Radeon Pro Vega GPU, which reportedly features a next-generation compute core and up to 16 GB of on-package high-bandwidth memory (HBM2). Apple says that the iMac Pro with Vega GPU delivers up to 11 teraflops of single-precision compute power for real-time 3D rendering and high frame rate VR. For half-precision computation that’s reportedly ideal for machine learning, the iMac Pro can deliver up to 22 teraflops of performance. (No, we don’t really have a sense of what that means, either, but Apple PR did a good job of making it sound impressive.) The iMac Pro will come with 32 GB of RAM by default, but for a machine in this class, the fact that it’s configurable to 64 GB or 128 GB is more important. A 1 TB SSD is also standard, with 2 TB and 4 TB SSDs as options. Unsurprisingly, the iMac Pro sports four Thunderbolt 3 ports, which enables it to drive up to two 5K displays and two high-performance RAID arrays at the same time. Other connectivity options mimic what’s on the 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display now, with the exception of Ethernet. Instead of gigabit Ethernet, the iMac Pro will include 10 Gb Ethernet, which could be a big deal when transferring huge amounts of data between machines. How much will all this cost? A lot, with the base iMac Pro configuration starting at $4999. Apple claimed that a comparable workstation would cost about $7000, without a 5K display. Even still, given the high price of large SSDs and RAM, we anticipate that a loaded iMac Pro will easily meet or exceed that $7000 mark. But that won’t stop the audience for the iMac Pro. If you need the maximum performance from a Mac, the iMac Pro will provide it. At least until a new Mac Pro makes its debut, and many of those who live and die by the teraflop won’t want to wait.   READERS LIKE YOU! Support TidBITS by becoming a member today!

The most unexpected news, however, was the announcement of the iMac Pro, due in December 2017. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Michael E. Cohen   2017-06-06 10:48 And if anyone out there thinks the iMac Pro means that a Mac Pro ISN'T also coming, Apple's press release on the iMac Pro puts that misconception to rest: "In addition to the new iMac Pro, Apple is working on a completely redesigned, next-generation Mac Pro architected for pro customers who need the highest-end, high-throughput system in a modular design, as well as a new high-end pro display." Reply Mackay Bell  2017-06-07 20:38 It seems that part of the reason they revealed that they were working on an expandable Mac Pro (and apologizing for the trash can version) is they wanted people to get excited about the iMac Pro, and not suck up all the air complaining about the lack of an expandable system. By getting that story out before the release, they could get a little more excitement going for the coming of the iMac Pro. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-09 09:49 I think you're spot on. Reply Alan Forkosh   2017-06-06 11:09 It's noteworthy that Apple didn't mention anything about the Touch Bar. As it stands now, Touch Bar is an orphan, present on only on the MacBook Pro line. It strikes me as something that can't really be considered a standard until there is a desktop version of it also--either a new keyboard or a standalone item to be paired with a keyboard. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-06 12:00 In fact, it turns out that Apple did release a new wireless Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad. But not with a Touch Bar. Boo! http://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/apple-has-a-new-wireless-magic-keyboard-with-a-full-numeric-keypad/amp/ Reply Paul Ellis  2017-06-06 13:53 The Touch Bar is a gimmick. It breaks all the rules of ergonomics and focus. It might possibly make some sense when positioned close the the screen, and therefore point of focus, on a laptop, but makes little sense for a desktop. If I were a developer, which thankfully I'm not, I wouldn't be wasting any time developing for it, and certainly not if I'd previously been stung by OpenDoc, QuickTime VR, etc. etc. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 14:57 I like what Apple is doing with the iMac and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to assuming they'll make things right with the new Mac Pro once it finally arrives. The MBP seems fine. I still don't see what TouchBar is supposed to accomplish - I also think it's mainly a gimmick with poor ergonomics. Apple didn't spend any time on it at this WWDC. Does anybody think it might disappear during the next overhaul? I don't really get why Apple is keeping the MBA around instead of just trying to make an inexpensive entry-level MB instead. Since there is no inexpensive entry-level MB, I assume that means the MB is targeting the middle/high-end of the compact/light market. So with that in mind, why in the world did they not replace that USB-C with TB3? If this were a budget Mac at $999 targeted at schools and students, fine. But since this is a midrange Mac we're talking about, why leave it stuck with USB-C? Nothing TB3 offers can't be done with USB-C, but TB3 is just more versatile and it is no doubt the new standard across Macs - well almost, sigh. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 14:59 (cont.) My only real gripe on the Mac side is the Mac mini. How can Apple just let it sit there to die? Either kill it off already (so people know they'll have to go Hackintosh) or update it. But just leaving it sit there without a clear plan makes we wonder what message Apple is trying to send. It reminds me of the Mac Pro situation before pressure from pros and tech journalists forced Apple to take a stand. I see a lot of potential for the Mac mini, from cheap servers to simple office computers, offering a low-price entry point to the Mac universe, schools, home media servers, etc. I'm afraid all of that is "too techy" and not sexy enough for the new Apple. I really hope I'm wrong. I'm holding onto my trusty Core i5 Mac mini, but with its 4 GB of RAM (could be upgraded) and 500 GB HDD (could also be upgraded, but is that worth it?) its days are numbered even as my home media server. Reply Bertrand Morin  2017-06-06 19:27 Is the memory (RAM) upgradable in the iMac 27in. by the user, as it wad older iMac… Reply James  2017-06-08 07:58 Did you read the product page for the 27" iMac? If not, go back and read it again. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-09 09:48 Yes, it is in the 27-inch model. But RAM in the 21.5-inch model is not user-upgradeable (although it's not soldered to the motherboard either). Reply Scott M.   2017-06-07 01:08 Is there any indication yet if the new iMac models (both 21.5" and 27") have user upgradable RAM? There is some wording on the Apple page that you can upgrade the 21.5" RAM after purchase through Apple or an authorized dealer, but it not 100% clear. And the page for the 27" is completely silent. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-07 09:59 The 21.5-inch models are NOT user-upgradeable, but the 27-inch model is. See http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201191 Reply Bob  2017-06-08 18:02 Scott, MacRumors reports "iFixit has published a teardown of the new 4K 21.5-inch iMac, which reveals that – surprisingly – Apple's smallest all-in-one desktop machine has both removable RAM and a Kaby Lake processor that's not soldered onto the logic board." Note though, updating is an involved process. Certainly not user-replaceable by the average owner. But at least users aren't irrevocably locked in to what they originally purchased. Reply Scott M.   2017-06-09 02:28 I guess that I should have been a little more accurate with my question. I was more trying to determine if the RAM in both the 21.5" and 27" is upgradable, whether user upgradable as officially supported by Apple or even just upgradable but only officially by Apple or an Apple ASP (which means a user can do it if they are afraid to open up their Mac and maybe end up having Apple not provide support under the warranty if there is a problem). Reply Scott M.   2017-06-09 02:32 Good to know. I am not afraid to open up a Mac even for supposedly no user upgradable items at least officially in Apple's eyes. On my original 2006 MBP, I replaced a fan that was squealing due to the bearings and also upgrade the WiFi card, neither of which was consider user upgradable by Apple (certainly not the fan at least...not sure about the WiFi card). It likely would not matter as if I were in the market for an iMac (I am currently not), I would be going for a 27" model anyway. I am kind of used to the 27" Thunderbolt display that I have, so going back to what would seem like a freakishly small (to me) 21.5" screen would not really be an option. Reply Henrik Munster  2017-06-09 10:46 There is "not user upgradeable" and then there is "not user upgradeable". I have myself opened a few MacBooks and even PowerBooks, but opening an iMac seems to me to be quite frightening. My suggestion would be to at least take a look at the instructions at iFixit before attempting to do anything. Reply Scott M.   2017-06-09 22:00 Always do. When I am going to crack open any Mac (or any other Apple product or even some non-Apple products these days although they tend to cover every Apple product but not so much for non-Apple products), iFixit is the first stop when I even start to think about it. It was their guides that helped me replace the fan on the 2006 MBP and upgrade the WiFi card for that same Mac. iFixit is an excellent source for determining what kind of trouble I might get into. ;-) Reply Simon  2017-06-08 18:20 I wonder if the non-retina 21.5" iMac will have the same SO-DIMM slots? I guess the replaceable CPU is a given because apparently Intel does not offer desktop Kaby Lake with BGA (i.e. soldered). Reply Scott Randell  2017-06-09 15:13 Hey Adam, the hardware part of the announcements were of little interest to me. Mostly because of the price points. The average user will not need an iMac Pro, nor could they justify paying for it. The price points on the regular iMac are ridiculous. The 27 inch with 512 GB SSD is a much better value than the 21 inch with the same add ons. Especially when you consider you can install extra 8 GB of ram yourself for about $60.00 vs the $200.00 Apple charges. With the same add ons the 27 inch is only $260.00 more than the 21 inch. Unless space is a consideration the 27 inch is a much better value, and you can add more ram down the road. I personally hope they come out with a reasonably priced user upgradable tower you can buy as much or as little as you need. Regards to all Tidbits staff. Reply David   2017-06-09 15:45 "The average user will not need an iMac Pro, nor could they justify paying for it" Er...yes? I don't think it's particularly aimed at the average user.

As part of the announcement-heavy WWDC keynote, Apple has revved the iMac line with Intel’s 7th-generation Kaby Lake CPUs, higher performance graphics, brighter screens, and faster SSDs. The MacBook and MacBook Pro also get new CPUs, the MacBook becomes more expandable, and the MacBook Air receives a small speed bump. The most unexpected news, however, was the announcement of the iMac Pro, due in December 2017. Add a comment  Search   Cached. Unless otherwise noted, this article is copyright © 2017 Adam C.

Shares of Apple fell nearly 4 percent on Friday, while the other four companies fell more than 3 percent. For most of the day, only 3 stocks in the S&P 500 tech sector were in the green: IBM (IBM), Teradata (TDC) and Western Union (WU). Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet all traded more than 2 times their 30-day average volume. It's a rare down day for a sector that's soared this year. The technology select sector SPDR ETF (XLK) is still up nearly 16 percent so far this year, while the information technology sector is the leading gainer in the S&P 500, up more than 18.5 percent. "They're just plain overbought," said David Bahnsen founder, managing director and chief investment officer of The Bahnsen Group, a private wealth management firm. "They are extremely stretched from a valuation standpoint." The high-flying sector has made investors jittery with "valuation anxiety," The New York Times noted this week. Goldman analysts wrote that the tech sector momentum "has built a valuation air pocket." "There is a sense that a lot of investors think there's safety there " Bahnsen told CNBC's "Closing Bell" on Friday. "A lot of managers are afraid to not own these names, and I can understand that." Still, the Dow Jones industrial index closed at a record high, and the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) on track for its best week of the year. "You just have to wait until these big — I don't know if it's ETF-driven or index-driven — selloffs create some buying opportunities," Tim Lesko, principal and portfolio Management at Granite Investment Advisors, told "Closing Bell" on Friday. — Reporting by CNBC's Patti Domm, Chris Hayes, FredImbert and Robert Hum.

But today one report is focusing on a feature that the next iPhone might lack. Apple’s next iPhones won’t include support for gigabit LTE speeds, claims sources speaking to Bloomberg. That’s because while Qualcomm currently offers a modem with support for 1 gigabit LTE download speeds, Intel doesn’t yet have such a modem available. Apple has been using both modems in its devices, and the company reportedly doesn’t want to rely on a single supplier for parts in its flagship device. Apple and Qualcomm are currently in the middle of a legal battle, with the former company claiming that the latter one has been abusing its position as a manufacturer of important cellphone chips to ask for unreasonable patent licensing terms. So Apple will likely end up using modems from both Qualcomm and Intel in its next iPhones. And while those Qualcomm modems may be capable of 1 gigabit LTE download speeds, Apple probably doesn’t want to end up offering one version of iPhone that can achieve gigabit LTE speeds and another version that can’t. All four major US carriers are working toward offering gigabit LTE speeds, with some claiming that we could see this service launch in 2017. We’ll have to wait and see if that pans out for the carriers and if Apple does end up shipping its new iPhones without gigabit LTE support, but even if those things happen, the lack of gigabit LTE may not be a huge deal for Apple’s new iPhones. LTE is still plenty fast for a lot of folks, and it’s unclear how widespread the carriers’ gigabit LTE coverage will be initially.

Allegedly sold to a lucky Apple employee, these unique sneakers have rarely been seen, or even photographed since they were made in the early 90s. The white sneaker has since resurfaced, being recently spotted in an online auction with a starting bid of $15,000. The nostalgic pair of sneakers are made from the white leather material that was popularized in the early 90s, and features the company's original rainbow logo printed on the tongue, and the side. The soles of the shoes are made from rubber that allegedly don't leave skid marks. These vintage branded apple sneakers are estimated to sell at over $30,000, appealing to lovers of nostalgic vintage clothing, and rare collectors items.

And, the owner has his own prediction that if the Warriors do win it all, people will celebrate in the streets without causing any major damage. (KGO-TV) KGO By Eric Thomas Friday, June 09, 2017 07:18PM OAKLAND, Calif. (KGO) -- The NBA Finals mean serious business for some Bay Area police officers. Customers at Oakland's Big Apple Café are predicting a sweep. And, the owner has his own prediction that if the Warriors do win it all, people will celebrate in the streets without causing any major damage. "Enjoy the win. That's' the best thing, not to harm other people," shop owner Khalil Hamadeh said. Khalil had windows broken during political protests at an old location, but never at this new location, and never related to the Warriors. That's why he has no plans to board the place up Friday night. The city hopes to keep it that way. Mayor Libby Schaaf says if there is a sweep, Oakland will be ready. "We're excited. We're positive. We're prepared. But, we are very confident that things will go very beautifully tonight," Schaaf said. Oakland police called in every available officer and briefed them Friday afternoon on what to expect. "You will see a lot of officers throughout the city of Oakland; not only Oakland police, but we have BART, Alameda County Sheriffs and the CHP," Oakland Police Officer Johnna Watson said. When the warriors last won the title in 2015, fans poured into the streets - some jumping on cars, others setting off fireworks. Both of those activities are illegal, and police say they won't be tolerated. "We want to make sure everybody has a safe place and a safe celebration," Watson said.

The next iPhone won't be the absolute fastest phone for downloading files or streaming music, because it will likely lack a gigabit LTE modem, Bloomberg reported on Friday. Apple sources its modems from two different suppliers, Qualcomm and Intel, and while Qualcomm's latest modems can take advantage of gigabit-per-second download speeds that some mobile carriers are now offering, Intel's gigabit modem isn't quite ready yet. Rather than use Qualcomm's modem exclusively for its next iPhone, Apple will continue to use Intel's modems in some models even though they are slower, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with Apple's decision. The decision is not entirely unexpected, since Apple has varied its modem suppliers for many previous iPhone models. But it is particularly noteworthy now because of two recent developments: Apple is locked in a legal battle with Qualcomm, which it accuses of monopolistic and illegal business practices, and one of the iPhone's chief competitors, the Samsung Galaxy S8, has a modem that already supports the gigabit speeds that several carriers are now advertising. Related Need to Fix Your iPhone Screen? That's About to Get Easier Need to Fix Your iPhone Screen? That's About to Get Easier Neither Apple nor Intel immediately responded to a request for comment, and Qualcomm declined to comment. For its part, Apple portrays its smartphones as better than Samsung's, and judging by the queues of eager customers outside Apple stores following a new iPhone announcement, the market for high-end handsets doesn't seem to care much about the device's innards. Those who do care might be able to divine the type of modem in their handset based on which mobile carrier they use. The Intel 7480 modem, one candidate to show up in the next iPhone, doesn't support Sprint or Verizon's CDMA technology, so it's likely that it will power the GSM iPhones for AT&T and T-Mobile, while Qualcomm modems will power the CDMA version. The modem kerfuffle could all be sorted out next year, when Intel's new 7560 gigabit modem is ready. The 7560 supports both GSM and CDMA, which puts it in the running to take over from Qualcomm as the iPhone's only modem.

Will QR code reading save Apple sales in China? June 9th, 2017 | Add a Comment 0000000 The iPhone maker is finally working its way into the barcode scanning culture to appeal to Chinese shoppers. QR code reading is a regular part of daily life in mainland China, but Apple hasn’t taken part in this trend. Now, the company has become one of the last to look to quick response codes to try to appeal to the over 700 million mobile device users in the country. The barcodes haven’t seen nearly as much use in the western world as they have in China, where they are regularly used. Apple has been watching its share slowly taken by rivals in the country. As a result, it has been working hard to develop a strategy to appeal to Chinese consumers. Among the points in that strategy is a focus on QR code reading; something that has never seen much – if any – time in the Apple spotlight. That said, Apple is now rather late in the QR code game. Its rivals have all had the chance to develop their technology and their positions within the market. The success of the Apple QR feature within the country will greatly depend on the number of app developers interested in collaborating with the company. Moreover, even among those that do take part, it will depend on how broadly they wish to do so. The new QR code reading feature was the central option directed toward the Chinese market this week. Apple’s iOS 11 operating system preview at its Worldwide Developers Conference centered around the QR codes and the ability for users to scan them with iPhone cameras. That feature will launch officially along with the iOS 11, this fall. The idea is to make barcode scanning faster and more convenient for iPhone users. They will be able to scan the quick response codes without having to launch a dedicated app as is currently the case. The new iOS 11 also includes a handful of other “localized” features geared toward the Chinese consumer. For example, a phone number can be used as an Apple ID, there will be an SMS fraud extension (to spot possibly fraudulent texts), and it will support Shanghainese dictation. “It is a wise move for Apple to embrace QR code as a way to better localize [its features] in China, given the decline of its iPhone shipments in the country,” said IDC China research manager Jin Di in a statement regarding the QR code reading and other localized options in iOS 11.

Apple rumors: What's coming next! By Serenity Caldwell, Rene Ritchie Friday, Jun 9, 2017 at 1:00 pm EDT If you like to spoil yourself over Apple's upcoming product and software lines, you've come to the right place. Updated June 6 2017: The WWDC 2017 keynote has come and gone and that means there are far fewer rumors left on our list — for now. Rumors about Apple's various iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and software ventures abound: Whether it's a leak from the supply chain or a hint from a case manufacturer about upcoming design changes, you can't go a day without running into a new bit of information. If you love to know the very latest from the Apple rumors space, you've come to the right place. If you don't, well, here be dragons: We'd advise clicking away. Phones, Watches, and Apple TV | Macs | Accessories | Software and Services RELIABLE There are enough reliable sources and historical data that we feel confident in this product's projected launch date. UNRELIABLE There are conflicting data sources or not enough data to confirm this product's projected launch date. NO DATA There is not enough data to offer a projected launch date. Phones, Watches, and Apple TV iPhone 8 September 2017 iPhone 7s — iPhone 8 — iPhone X — whatever Apple ends up calling the next and "tenth anniversary" iPhone, it's expected next fall, and with a new design and new set of features. But what will they be? iPhone 8 rumors — Everything you need to know! Apple Watch series 3 October 2017 It's been just about seven months since the release of the Apple Watch Series 2, and as is my wont, I'm already thinking about the next version. What will it look like? What new features will it have that pique my fancy? Don't get me wrong: I love my current Apple Watch. The Series 2 offered huge battery improvements for both 38mm and 42mm users, and I use it to track my workouts and respond to notifications almost every day. But if I had my druthers, I wouldn't mind seeing an Apple Watch series 3 in the fall with a few new features. Apple Watch Series 3 rumors — Everything you need to know! Apple TV 5 2018 The current Apple TV tops out at 1080p. It's a rock-solid 60 frames-per-second (fps) 1080p, but it's still 1080p. Likewise, it only supports the sRGB color standard. Wouldn't it be great, though, if the next-generation Apple TV 5 could do more — if it could handle 4K and DCI-P3? Apple TV 5 rumors — Everything you need to know! Laptop and Desktop Macs Mac Pro 2018-2019 Apple broke with decades of tradition to spoil its upcoming product line to the world. And not just any product line: The company gave a sneak peek of its plans for the future of Mac Pro. I'm going to repeat that: A new Mac Pro. And new pro displays, branded by Apple. What can we expect, and when can we expect it? Let's break it down. Mac Pro rumors — Everything you need to know! iMac Pro December 2017 Apple took the wraps off of the iMac Pro, an all-in-one aimed at high-end professional tasks. While Apple didn't offer an exact release date, they did say that the iMac Pro would ship in December. iMac 2018 Apple just updated its all-in-one desktop lineup with Kaby Lake processors, more memory options, and better graphics, so it's likely we won't see an update for the iMacs until next year. MacBook Pro 2018 Apple just updated its laptop lineup with Kaby Lake processors and better graphics, so it's likely we won't see an update for the MacBook Pros until next year Mac Mini Unknown The Mac mini hasn't been updated since October 2014, when it was made even more appliance-like than previous generations. Since then Apple's bring-your-own-mouse-keyboard-and-monitor Mac has been missing in action. Here's what we know. Mac Mini rumors — Everything you need to know! Apple Accessories Apple Pencil 2 Summer-Fall 2017 We've heard enough about iPad rumors — let's talk about my favorite accessory: The Apple Pencil. There are claims that new Apple Pencil components are in Apple's Chinese supply chain — possibly for a later 2017 release alongside rumored iPad Pros. Spoilers!!! Except, no: I don't feel all that spoiled. Because of course Apple is going to refine the Pencil for 2017 alongside new iPad Pro models. Apple Pencil 2 rumors — Everything you need to know! AirPods 2 Unknown Apple's AirPods only came out last December, but we're already racking up hopes for generation 2 — including multiple fits for those with differently-shaped ears, customized tap controls, hardware volume adjustment, and more. AirPods 2 rumors — Everything you need to know! Apple Watch Bands Fall 2017 Since Apple Watch launched in 2015, the case has only been updated once but the bands have been updated multiple times — every spring and every fall. In addition to the original sport, leathers, and metal bands, woven nylon, Nike, and Hermès have been added to the mix, as have a plethora of new colors. Apple Watch Band rumors — Everything you need to know! Software & Services iOS 12 Fall 2018 Apple has just announced iOS 11, which is due out later this year, likely in September. The followup, iOS 12, will likely be introduced at WWDC 2018, followed by a launch to consumers in Fall 2018. Apple Music Unknown In 2016, Apple Music got refocused and redesigned. The service, at least ostensibly, got simpler and the app, bigger, bolder, and more beautiful. It made Apple Music better, inarguably, but did it make it better enough? Apple Music rumors — Everything you need to know! iCloud Unknown iCloud is Apple's online service that consists of iCloud Photo Library, iCloud Drive, iCloud Keychain, and a long list of other features, right down to email, contact, and calendar sync. It deputed alongside iOS 5, way back in 2011, and since then has grown, fumbled, frustrated, marveled, and enabled iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and Mac users everywhere. But what should it do next? iCloud rumors — Everything you need to know!

Updated June, 2017: All the choices on this list are still top-notch. If you have any better suggestions, though, hit us up in the comments below! As we say goodbye to the SD card reader, Thunderbolt, and so much more with the Late 2016 MacBook Pro, we also say hello: to many, many USB-C ports. USB-C connectors are great tools in that they can connect multiple types of devices to your MacBook, and when you're done, you can simply detach the port and go on your merry way. But if you're using your MacBook Pro at home, you may want to avoid the constant fun of disconnecting and reconnecting a million devices; instead, connect just one USB-C device to your Mac — a hub — that then controls everything else. There are several great USB-C hub options depending on your lifestyle: Below, we highlight our favorites! Anker USB-C to 3-Port USB HyperDrive USB 5-in-1 Hub AUKEY USB-C Hub Satechi Type-C USB Combo Hub Moshi USB-C Multiport Adapter HyperDrive: Thunderbolt 3 USB-C 2016 MacBook Pro Hub Anker USB-C to 3-Port USB Highly rated (with 5 stars on Amazon), fast, and compact, the Anker USB-C to 3-Port USB is a reliable option for those looking to pick out a USB-C hub for their MacBook Pro. Anker did it again. Another great quality product from these guys that I just love. They have great product, but mostly great customer service if anything happens. I have bought tons from them either on Amazon.ca or .com over the years and have proven to be of the highest standards. Designed to transfer data at speeds of up to 5 Gbps – which is fast enough to transfer an entire HD movie in just a few seconds – the Anker USB-C hub provides three additional USB ports along with an ethernet adapter, making it the perfect partner to pair with your MacBook Pro. If something goes wrong with your Anker USB-C to 3-Port USB, then never fear: This little piece of tech comes with an 18-month warranty and highly-praised customer service. See at Amazon HyperDrive USB 5-in-1 Hub Instantly turn your single USB-C port into an SDXC port or micro SDXC port, and double the USB space with the HyperDrive USB 5-in-1 Hub. Sleek and slim, this little hub instantly attaches to your MacBook Pro, while it's brushed metal finish matches it perfectly. It's even the same thickness as the new MacBook Pro, so nothing sticks out or feels overly bulky and protrude-y. The HyperDrive comes in three different colors that match Apple's shades spot-on, including silver, gold, and space gray. See at Amazon AUKEY USB-C Hub If you're looking for some more USB space, AUKEY's USB-C Hub has got you covered. At around the size of a credit card, this pocket-perfect USB-C hub has over-current protection to protect connected devices from power surges, while the hub also supports incredibly fast data transfer rates. Plus with four ports, you have more than enough room for everything you need! See at Amazon Satechi Type-C USB Combo Hub With its modern, Apple-riffic design, instant connectivity, and pass-through charging support, the Satechi Type-C USB Combo Hub is a great option to consider for your MacBook Pro. Just attach your Satechi straight to your MacBook without any wires, and you'll instantly be able to use your SD and micro SD cards, have full access to two USB ports, and more. You can even easily charge your MacBook Pro, too! The Satechi Type-C USB Combo Hub comes in four different colors to really match your sense of style, including space gray, silver, rose gold, and gold. See at Amazon Moshi USB-C Multiport Adapter With the Moshi USB-C Multiport Adapter, you'll always have a USB-C hub at the ready. Coupled with its compact design and LED charging indicator, the Moshi is a solid multiport adapter option to keep in mind. Designed with a sleek aluminum look to match your other Apple products, this fast-charging, data transferring hub works well with the MacBook Pro. With its folding cable, you can easily unplug and tuck away your Moshi, and when it's plugged in, you can use it without having it take up a ton of space. Utilizing the latest USB-C chips, this multi-function adapter supports crystal clear 1080p and 4K video output to any HDMI-enabled monitor or TV. A standard USB port is included to charge/sync your smartphone or connect other legacy devices such as an external USB hard drive or hub. See at Moshi HyperDrive: Thunderbolt 3 USB-C 2016 MacBook Pro Hub CNET: This accessory fixes everything that's wrong with Apple's new MacBook Pro. ExtremeTech: This multi-port accessory adds back everything Apple removed from the latest MacBook Pro. BGR: One MacBook Pro 2016 accessory that will save you from dongle hell. If you're looking for a USB-C hub that's been widely praised, has been supported by over 20,000 people, and that aims to 'fit the MacBook Pro aesthetics pretty well', then you're going to want to take a peek at the HyperDrive: Thunderbolt 3 USB-C 2016 MacBook Pro Hub. The HyperDrive: Thunderbolt 3 USB-C 2016 MacBook Pro Hub claims to be the world's most compact and faster USB-C hub that's designed specially for the 2016 MacBook Pro. With the HyperDrive: Thunderbolt, you get a HDMI video output, a thunderbolt 3 outlet, USB-C, a slot for your SD card and microSD, and two USB 3.1 gen 1 ports. Measuring out at around 114.5mm long and 28.5mm wide, HyperDrive is the perfect accessory to bring from home to the office to a friend's place, travelling, and so, so much more! Oh, and did we mention that there's a version for your silver or your space gray MacBook Pro?! The HyperDrive hub isn't available on Hyper's site yet, but you can still check out its Kickstarter page and watch Hypershop.com for availability. See at KickStarter So… What's your pick?

The OWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock and the similar Thunderbolt 3 Belkin unit. All of these, except the last one from Kickstarter, are simply USB. And what's with the nonsense in the article about giving up Thunderbolt? There is no such loss on the MacBook Pro. 0 9 hours ago Reply Douglas Maske The OWC hub is not compatible with the MacBookPro13,3 2016 model.

It has gigabit Ethernet, USB 3, USB 2, USB-C, HDMI, VGA, SD card reader, two jacks for microphone and headphone, and even a 90 W charger is included. Not cheap but it gives me all the connectors I missed with new MacBook Pro 2016. Sent from the iMore App 0 3 months ago Reply Ginseng108 I posted but the post was deleted for some reason. In any case, do a search for HyperDrive Thunderbolt Hub Kickstarter and you'll find what you're looking for. 0 4 months ago Reply rickstr I thought there's one that looks like the Satechi but with two USB C's going into the pro. Has anyone seen this? Link? 0 4 months ago Reply Ginseng108 Note: I preordered on the CalDigit company's US Storefront. The special pricing is not available on their Amazon storefront as far as I could tell. 0 4 months ago Reply Ginseng108 I've been looking for a Thunderbolt 3 hub for my late-2016 MBP 13 TB and have identified the following candidates as of the end of January 2017. The critical features I need are DisplayPort, gigabit ethernet, laptop charging, 2xUSB 3, 2xTB3. Nice to have are headphone output, USB 3.1, SD card reader. 1. Elgato TB3 Dock - https://www.elgato.com/en/dock/thunderbolt-3, has all the critical features and additionally a headphone out jack. Expensive at an anticipated $300. Flat format case. 2. Belkin TB3 Express Dock - http://www.imore.com/e?link=http%3A%2F%2Fbelkin.7eer.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F... has all of the critical features and additionally a headphone out jack. Insanely expensive at an anticipated $430. Flat format case. 3. OWC TB3 Dock - http://www.imore.com/e?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-7293438-... has all of the critical features and additionally a headphone out jack and SD card reader as well as USB 3.1 gen 1. It also has superfluous features: S/PDIF and Firewire 800 jacks. It is priced at $279 preorder or $299 normally. Flat format case. 4. CalDigit TB3 Thunderbolt Station 3 - http://www.caldigit.com/thunderbolt-3-dock/, has all of the critical features and additionally audio in/out, USB 3.1 gen (?), and superfluous feature: 2xeSATA ports. It is priced at $200 preorder or $250 normally. Vertical format case. The CalDigit TS3 is likely the unit I'll go with. It has the best balance of critical and nice to have features with the fewest superfluous (I don't need or use them) features. The price is among the most reasonable. Also, the unique vertical format case takes up less real estate on my already cluttered desktop so that's an extra plus. 0 4 months ago Reply EBFoxbat **CAUTION** Not all of these will work with the 15" Touch Bar. OWC notes in their website that theirs doesn't, but it's far more widespread. There's something with the chipset thats commonly used that just doesn't work. I spent an inordinate amount of time and money finding a USB hub that offered atlas 87watts of power pass thought (USB PD as it's known). I ended up using the Apple display adapter, and a regular USB-A hub. I use a USB-C male to female extensions cable. Only the extension cable is visible above my desk. This allows me to have my "one cable to rule them all" solution. I'm super exited for Thunderbolt 3 docks, but it seams OWC is the only one with an SD slot on the front, so I preordered with them. 0 4 months ago Reply eziduzit I'm not sure how you can include so many poorly rated items in this "Great" list. Starting with the Satechi Type-C USB... do your homework people! And like others, I would like to see options that are actual quality but don't cost $200+. 0 6 months ago Reply Matty Wack We need USB-C Gen 2 Splitter that functions as a USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 to USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 + Charge adapter for the new Macbooks Pro. Similar to the Lightning + Charge Rockstar adapter by belkin for the iPhone 7. I would use this with the Thunderbolt 3 to Thunder Bolt 2 adapter to charge and connect to my Thunderbolt Display simultaneously. 0 6 months ago Reply jayzero76 waiting for a docking station with charger and everything. maybe apple should make one. sd card reader USB and HDMI... easy to connect and than everyone has nothing to complain anymore. 0 6 months ago Reply Hennes4800 There is one by belkin.

My pick is my Early 2015 MBP with 2 Thunderbolt ports, a dedicated MagSafe 2 port, 2 3.0 USB port, HDMI port, and SD card port. I got mine maxed out and now the "update" is a touch bar and a .3 GHz increase is max CPU. Psssssh, I am not cult of Mac, but even if I was I can't imagine how someone can justify buying this thing. 0 7 months ago Reply DannyJJK You came here just to be incredibly negative about the new MacBook Pro rather than get people's opinions. There's plenty more upgrades than what you're listing, also I like how you listed all the different ports in the old MacBook Pro as if that's a good thing. I'd rather have one type of port which is cable of doing all these tasks, USB-C is the future, adapters are only temporary for now 0 6 months ago Reply Ginseng108 Well, here's how I justified buying a 2016 MBP 13" TB, 16 GB ram, Core i7: My faithful 2008 CoreDuo 13" MacBook has served me well for nearly 9 years and I decided to splurge and treat myself to a laptop of similar format with 3X the processing power and incredible (though currently through dongles and a dock on the way) connectivity. Maybe that makes me "cult of mac" ;) 0 4 months ago Reply directordeek How about a list of upcoming USB C Gen 2 devices/hubs/docks?

It is not gen. 2, but I do not have any USB peripherals delivering north of 5 Gbps.

I know they are coming out with the thunderbolt hub in the new year but i really just need it for mic, and my mouse and keyboard. I think for the price difference the usb c hub is a much better value. I have been using it with my hp for irk and it performs just fine. 0 7 months ago Reply adsvfv *ugh* This is the 8th article I've seen with the same underperforming USB-C hubs now. All I want is power, 1x DisplayPort, 1x USB3, 1x gigabit ethernet, 1x audio in and 1x audio out. And preferable one that doesn't cost $200. FireWire 800, SD card, thunderbolt port and more USB ports would be nice to have but don't really matter for my setup. 0 7 months ago Reply nutmac Does anyone know whether Satachi or HyperDrive will block nearby USB-C port? 0 7 months ago Reply jimmers There are 2 ports on each side of the MacBook Pro for a total of 4. According to pictures, the Satechi and the HyperDrive will use one and cover the other but you'll still have the 2 ports on the other side of the MacBook Pro. 0 7 months ago Reply returnmyjedi "At around the size of a credit card..."

Guys, c'mon! The Satachi and HyperDrive are practically the same device! And while these USB-C hubs are perfectly fine for the MacBook and the newer MacBook Pro, let's not forget that the Pro uses ThunderBolt 3 and that docks like the new one from OWC (https://eshop.macsales.com/preorder/owc-thunderbolt-3-dock/ ) are much more capable for the new MacBook Pro than the OWC USB-C dock you listed. Also, make sure that any USB-C hub is rated for USB 3.1 Gen 2 (10 Gbps) versus USB 3.1 Gen 1 (5 Gbps). The Pro can handle the higher speed while the MacBook cannot. 2 7 months ago Reply jayzero76 thunderbolt 3 vs usb C whats the difference 1 6 months ago Reply steviet02 it's not USBC vs Thunderbolt 3. It's thunderbolt 2 vs thunderbolt 3. 0 6 months ago Reply ewelch Thunderbolt 3 has vastly more speed than USB-C, and it supports USB 3 gen 2, HDMI, and DisplayPort, all over the same cable.

And why not mention Hyper's 7in1 (it's the better version of the 5in1 and it has no lookalikes, let alone 'specslikes'). What I find strange too: a hub and a dock are two totally different things. Dock sits on my desk with screen, DAS, keyboard, speakers,... attached. Hub sits in my pocket or backpack for attaching external HD, CF card reader,... on location. 0 1 month ago Reply rodaleach I picked this one up from Anker. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XU6PM68/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s... 1 7 months ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Newsletter Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Apple's Pencil stands out from the rest of the iPad stylus crowd for a number of reasons: It works in tandem with Apple's display to create low-latency brush strokes, it's lengthier than your average digital pen, and it charges via Lightning connector. But when it comes to drawing or writing with one, there are only a few basic techniques you need to know before you can start mastering your new tool. Learn how to draw from the masters If you love the idea of an Apple Pencil but your drawing skills are lackluster, my best advice is going to be the advice of many artists before me: Practice! Drawing constantly is the best way to get better. If you're just starting out, I recommend looking at some of your favorite artists, studying their styles, and trying to recreate them on your choice of digital canvas. It's a fun exercise, and should get you thinking about shapes and styles. That might be too complex for you — and that's fine! If you truly want a 101 course, there are a couple of wonderful free drawing sites out there that offer great tutorials and videos. Drawspace boasts the slogan "now everyone can draw," and if its excellent step-by-step drawing lessons are anything to go by, that statement is the absolute truth. Proko offers a bunch of great videos on drawing forms and anatomy shapes, while Draw a Box offers some great active tutorials for drawing everyday objects, people, landscapes, and yes — boxes. Use your hands In conjunction with the iPad Pro, the Apple Pencil features palm-rejection technology, which means your hand, arm, and fingers can rest against the screen while you draw. While previous third-party styli have had variations on palm rejection in certain apps, they never quite worked perfectly; the Apple Pencil, in contrast, is about as perfect at palm rejection as you can be with a digital touchscreen. Because of bad stylus experiences in the past, I've seen dozens of first-time Pencil users awkwardly gripping the pen to hover their hand above the screen. Trust me: I did it too, but you don't need to with the Pencil. Feel free to rest your hand against the screen while you draw. It'll take a bit of getting used to, but once you do, it'll feel as natural as resting your hand on paper. Test the Pencil's pressure Equipped at the drawing end of the Apple Pencil is a beautifully responsive plastic nib for all manner of sketching and writing. It's pressure-sensitive, too, so you shouldn't be afraid to press harder and softer on the screen to see how your Pencil reacts. One of my first calibration tests with any new drawing tool — digital or not — is drawing a series of vertical and horizontal lines, to test how different pressure results in different line widths. I highly encourage everyone to do something similar — not only will it get you comfortable with the Pencil's variations, but you'll also get a better sense for how you need to hold the tool for optimal control. I also recommend moving your grip up closer to the nib when doing detailed lettering or drawing: It gives you more precision over those fine lines. (And don't be afraid to pinch-to-zoom with your free hand — most great apps support it.) Shade with the sides It's not just the tip of the Pencil nib that works on the iPad Pro's screen: The entire cone of that nib is responsive. As a result, you can use the side of the Pencil to shade with your digital brushes — much as you might use the side of a graphite stick to color in a shadow on paper. Not only is it a cool effect, but it's one I see early Pencil users miss out on when they're first getting to know their new tool. Shading also looks different in different apps and with different brushes — don't be afraid to experiment to find which brushes and apps work best for your purposes. Tap and scroll In addition to being a great drawing implement, the Apple Pencil can be used to navigate your iPad in-between drawing programs. I really enjoy using the Pencil to scroll lists and swipe between views — its precision tip makes tapping and selecting certain items a whiz, and if I have to switch to another app while drawing, it keeps me from having to put the Pencil down to enter a task. Add a clip (and store that cap) While the Pencil's smooth, cylindrical shape may please the eye in the negative space of an Apple Store or design lab, in the real world... well, pencils roll. The Apple Pencil does have a clever weighted magnet that stops slow rolls, but even that won't help you when you want to store the Pencil somewhere. Luckily, it's easy enough to add a free-standing clip or one stolen off your nearest pen. I adorned my Apple Pencil with a clip from one of my Micron pens: Once you slide it off the Micron top, you just have to slip it on, nib first, up the Pencil body. Easy peasy. One other accessory-style tip — or cap, as it were: If you charge the Pencil with your iPad's Lightning port, you can store its magnetic cap on the iPad surface using one of the two bottom Smart Cover magnets next to the home button. I use this trick constantly: It's a great way to avoid losing a tiny white plastic cylinder while charging the slightly larger cylinder it belongs to. Questions?

What will the specs be? Will it have special features? Here's everything we know! iPhone 8 — iPhone X — whatever Apple ends up calling the next and "tenth anniversary" iPhone, it's expected next fall, and with a new design and new set of features. But what will they be? This article is continuously updated to include the latest news and rumors. Bookmark it, save it, share it, and check back often! May 26, 2017: Score one more rumor for Touch ID beneath the screen Rumors have been going back and forth over where exactly Apple will put Touch ID in iPhone 8. Everyone wants it under the front glass, embedded in the display, but the tech is hard enough other rumors suggest Apple might have to settle for the back or lose it entirely. Now, randomly accurate rumor site Digitimes adds one to the gossip pile for the front: Apple will use an optical fingerprint sensor to enable authentication directly on the screen, said the report. Additionally, the new iPhone devices will also come with invisible infrared image sensors to enhance the functionality of high-pixel camera and to enable AR applications. The information is credited to TSMC, one of Apple's frequent chip fabricators. Weigh it as you will. May 5, 2017: This is what one leaker claims iPhone 8 might look like Rendered images and videos, claimed to be based on CAD designs of an iPhone 8 prototype leaked from the factory, have been posted online by Gear India The site hedges heavily but seems to believe this is close to what Apple will ship. Apple has been testing out several prototype designs for the iPhone 8. For the same reason, at this time, we are not in a position to confirm if the renders showcased above indeed belong to the final design that was selected by Apple. That said, there are chances that the final design of the iPhone 8 will closely match the renders shown above with minor differences. The model you see in the renders measure roughly 143.5 x 70.9 x 7.7mm (8.9mm with back camera bump). There is also some confusion at this point regarding the positioning of the sensors and the camera lenses on the front fascia. Given the seemingly conflicting rumors, along with the lack of parts leaks from the supply chain, some believe Apple hasn't yet come to a final design decision or begun manufacturing ramp up. Whatever the reason, we should learn more as fall approaches. What will the next iPhone be called? If Apple sticks to the same pattern the company has been using since 2010, the 2016 iPhone 7 will be followed by the 2017 iPhone 7s, but given that 2017 is the iPhone's 10th anniversary, we may get something entirely different. iPhone 8? iPhone Edition? iPhone X?! iPhone: 2007 iPhone 3G: 2008 iPhone 3GS: 2009 iPhone 4: 2010 iPhone 4s: 2011 iPhone 5: 2012 iPhone 5s: 2013 iPhone 6: 2014 iPhone 6s: 2015 iPhone 7: 2016 Any pattern can be broken, of course, and Apple can ultimately call any iPhone anything the company wants — iPhone Pro, Apple Phone, etc. Because it's rumored to be an all new design, it's possible Apple will skip iPhone 7s and go straight to iPhone 8. Because it'll be 10 years since the first iPhone was introduced, Apple could also call it iPhone X. According to Macotakara, the phone currently thought of as the iPhone 8 may in fact be given the name of "iPhone Edition". The phone could also be arriving later than the rumored iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, though all three phones would apparently be introduced at the same event. For the sake of simplicity, iPhone 8 will be used in our rumor roundup until we hear otherwise. Will there be an iPhone 8 Plus? Probably not. There was an iPhone 6 and an iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, and iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. iPhone 6 Plus: 2014 iPhone 6s Plus: 2015 iPhone 7 Plus: 2016 But iPhone 8 is getting a new design where the display can be iPhone Plus sized while the casing around it remains iPhone regular size. Rumor has it, though, there'll still be iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus alongside iPhone 8 (singular). When will the iPhone 8 be released? Update: Despite previous rumors of severe delays, a new report (via Digitimes) claims that after a September introduction, all three of Apple's rumored new phones for 2017, including the iPhone 8, will launch in October. While that would indeed be later than previous years, it is said that actual production of devices will happen on schedule. Since the iPhone 5, Apple has announced every new iPhone during a special event held the first or second Tuesday or Wednesday of September. iPhone 5: September 12, 2012 iPhone 5s: September 10, 2013 iPhone 6: September 9, 2014 iPhone 6s: September 9, 2015 iPhone 7: September 7, 2016 Likewise, since the iPhone 5, Apple has shipped every new iPhone the second Friday following the event, with the exception of the iPhone 6s in 2015, which shipped the third Friday following the event: iPhone 5: September 21, 2012 iPhone 5S: September 20, 2013 iPhone 6: September 19, 2014 iPhone 6s: September 25, 2015 iPhone 7: September 16, 2016 Past patterns are the best indicator of future events, but they aren't perfect. Apple can and will throw curveballs whenever the company's logistics or strategy demands. So, be aware of the dates but don't be bound to them. Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White (via MacRumors) claims that while pre-orders for all three of Apple's rumored 2017 iPhones (iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, and iPhone 8) will all begin in September, the iPhone 8 may not ship until "several weeks" later due to issues with its 3D sensor technology. Analyst Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company contradicts White's report with his own investigation (as reported by AppleInsider), believing that it's not 3D sensor issues to blame, but low Touch ID yields: For the 5.8-inch OLED version, the biggest bottleneck remains integrating an under-glass fingerprint sensor into the display— the current yield rate of Apple's in-house AuthenTec solution remains low and AAPL seems unwilling to use other vendors' products. Arcuri theorizes that Apple could avoid delays entirely by ditching Touch ID entirely in lieu of facial recognition (not likely) or move the fingerprint scanner to the rear of the casing, but Apple will most likely just accept the delay and move forward with small quantities (a la the AirPods and Apple Pencil). This isn't entirely unusual for the high-end iPhone model, either: Apple's Jet Black iPhone 7 was under severe shipping constraints when it first launched, as well. KGI Securities' Ming-Chi Kuo (via 9to5Mac), believes iPhone 8 will prove difficult enough to manufacture that we won't see it, even in constrained quantities, until October or November 2017: KGI blames several 'significant hardware upgrades' in the iPhone 8 for the delays. This includes a custom OLED display panel, a custom Apple A11 10-nanometer SoC, an all-new designed 3D Touch module and 3D sensing cameras. Kuo (via MacRumors, since doubled down on his belief iPhone 8 will be ramped up later than usual and be severely constrained at launch: According to Kuo, who titled his note "Rising probability of worst-case scenario for iPhone shipments," production ramp-up of the iPhone 8 could be delayed to "as late as October-November," a departure from Apple's traditional August to September ramp-up period. The result will be "severe supply shortages" that persist for "a while" after the new iPhone models are introduced in September. To be clear, Kuo continues to believe Apple will introduce the iPhone in September, but he suggests there's a strong possibility the device will be hard to come by for several months following its release. Rumors of delays typically presage every new iPhone release and while products are sometimes constrained, like iPhone 7 Plus, none have been pushed back past the recent September launch period. (iPhone 4s, in 2011, was the last to launch in October.) Given the incredible amount of cutting edge technology Apple plans to include in iPhone 8, however, no timeline could reasonably be considered certain. What can we expect in the iPhone 8 design? Update: DigiTimes, all three of Apple's rumored 2017 iPhones, the iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, and iPhone 8 will feature reinforced glass bodies with metal frames, with the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus featuring aluminum frames, and the iPhone 8 sporting a stainless steel one. The iPhone 8 is also the only one of the three models said to have an AMOLED display. At any given point in time, Apple is working several years ahead on the iPhone line. Upcoming models may already be in the testing or prototype stages while future models may be little more than components attached to boards. Sometimes multiple versions will also exist, some more conservative, others more audacious. What eventually ships depends on what can reliably be produced given the limits of technology and economics. Since 2008 Apple has also followed a "tick-tock" cycle for iPhones. On the "tick" year the company unveils a new design and on the "tock" year the company takes that same design to its limits. In 2016, though, Apple broke from that pattern and released a second tock — iPhone 7. iPhone 3G: 2008 — Plastic shell. iPhone 4: 2010 — Antenna band and glass back. iPhone 5: 2012 — 16:9 aspect ratio, chamfered edges. iPhone 6: 2014 — Bigger screens, rounded edges. iPhone 7: 2015 - New finishes. Rumor has it the next big iPhone redesign will be more dramatic one, with less bezel around the sides and at the top and bottom and virtualized buttons. Other reports also say that the iPhone 8 will feature a glass front and back, with either aluminum or stainless steel around the edges of the phone. Stainless steel is said to be reserved for the more expensive models. ETNews (via MacRumors), in contrast, reports that the iPhone 8 will feature a glass casing and a "water drop design" that will harken back to the original iPhone from 2007. Noted leaker Sonny Dickson has shown off what appears to be a possible schematic for the iPhone 8, which shows a device with a metal back and a rear-mounted Touch ID sensor. This contradicts a previous report from Bloomberg that the iPhone 8 would feature a glass front and back with a stainless steel frame. Benjamin Geskin on Twitter (via 9to5Mac), has posted what he claims is a "dummy" mockup of iPhone 8, matching several of the rumors. Specifically, for iPhone 8 with Touch ID remaining on the front, beneath the glass. iPhone 8 Dummy (This is CNC model according to Foxconn) Back is 2.5D Glass.#iPhone8 #iPhoneX #iPhoneEdition pic.twitter.com/Z8mH7b7z4r— Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) April 23, 2017 Wait, Touch ID on the back of iPhone 8... like... like... Android? If Apple wants to remove the bottom bezel, there Touch ID sensor will have to be changed or removed to accomplish that. It sounds like Apple wants to keep Touch ID on the front but put it under the display. That would be ideal, given Apple already made the Home button virtual with iPhone 7. Samsung had similar plans for the Galaxy S8, however, but was forced to change when it couldn't get the technology to work and put it on the back instead. Apple might well succeed where Samsung failed, or might have to make a similar compromise. That's likely why we keep seeing multiple purported schematics for iPhone 8: the audacious version with Touch ID under the display, and the pragmatic version where it's forced onto the back. What colors will the iPhone 8 be offered in? So far Apple has saved the new iPhone finishes for the years absent big redesigns, save for 2017's iPhone 7 Project RED special edition. iPhone 5s: 2013 — Gold. iPhone 6s: 2015 — Rose gold. iPhone 7: 2016 — Black and jet black. iPhone 7: 2017 - (Product) RED. That said, Apple can do anything the company wants, any time the company wants, including introducing new colors with new designs — including new casing material. Apple Watch Series 2 being released in white ceramics sent the internet atwitter with thoughts of iPhone 8 being made out of the same material. Tougher than stainless steel, it still remains to be seen if it would hold up in a device as big as an iPhone or iPhone Plus. Notably, Greg Koenig of Luma Labs thinks it unlikely, writing on Atomic Delights: More bluntly, not only is Apple not using any new ceramics manufacturing technology in the new Watch Edition, they are not even utilizing the primary patent the original Quora article pins most of its extrapolations on - that patent described a vacuum liquid slurry casting process for ceramics. The Edition watch uses a very common pressed powder forming method. In short, not only does the ceramic Watch quash any hopes of a ceramic iPhone, I think it actually indicates that Apple isn't chasing down ceramics for iPhone production any time on the horizon. What specs will the iPhone 8 have? Update: A Goldman Sachs analyst note (via MacRumors) claims that Apple will release the iPhone 8 in 128GB and 256GB variations for $999 and $1,099, respectively. Since Apple introduced the company's first branded system-on-a-chip (SoC) in 2010, every new iPhone has come with a new A-series chipset. If Apple sticks to that pattern, the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus will ship with Apple A11 processors. New SoC typically take advantage of better processes that let them be faster and more powerful but also more energy efficient. Apple has also been adding coprocessors to handle motion voice activation, and now big.LITTLE fusion. A11 could further build on those capabilities as well, including implementing artificial intelligence and machine learning at the silicon level. The custom CPUs Apple has been producing have gone from Swift to Cyclone to Typhoon to Twister, so... Tropical Storm next? Hurricane? Rumors also persist that Apple is working on custom GPUs and even modems as well, which would allow the company to take full control of everything from graphics to radios. Recent reports indicate that Intel will be supplying at least some of the modems for this year's iPhone lineup. What about an iPad Pro-style Smart Connector? Apple typically introduces a technology in one device and then rolls it out across the lineup. Retina was like that with iPhone 4 and Touch ID with iPhone 5s. The Smart Connector, which debuted with the iPad Pro in the fall of 2015, attaches via a magnet and runs power, data, and ground directly from the device. It currently powers Apple's Smart Keyboard and a similar keyboard from Logitech, with more expected to follow. Apple could certainly engineer a Smart Connector for iPhone 8, but what it would be used for is a more interesting question. Apple made a smaller Smart Keyboard for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, but would the company make an even smaller one for iPhone 8 Plus? For iPhone 8 standard? According to The Verifier, the iPhone 8 will feature a Smart Connector, which it will apparently use both for charging and for augmented and virtual reality features. What about the display? More HD? TrueTone? Apple hasn't updated the resolution on iPhone or iPhone Plus since 2014. As such, it makes them less than desirable for applications like VR, and less than competitive when it comes to spec comparisons. It does make them more energy efficient, though, given they still use LCD rather than OLED panels. There have been rumors that we could see a bump to 1920 x 1080 for the 4.7-inch model and 2560 x 1440 for the 5.5-inch model. There have also been rumors about OLED, but right now the LED component of the LCD system is used to implement the pressure-sensitive 3D Touch system, so would Apple re-engineer that? Or would they simply skip ahead again to something like quantum dot? According to The Korea Herald, any and all OLED versions will be curved and made of plastic, rather than the glass typically used on flat panels. Also, while iPhone 7 got the DCI-P3 wide gamut color system of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, it didn't get the True Tone system. True Tone employs two ambient light sensors, with four channels each, to measure the color temperate of the surrounding area and then match the display to that temperature. Investment bank Barclays (via MacRumors) believes that Apple's next iPhone will feature True Tone displays, however. Will the iPhone 8 be waterproof? iPhone 7 is water resistant but not water proof. Rated IP67, it can survive accidental splashes, dunks, and floods, but isn't rated as highly as some competing phones from Samsung and others. Although swimming with an iPhone may not be on everyone's wish-list, those whose jobs or pastimes expose them to the elements, and even those who want to do underwater photography at shallow depths would be thrilled by IP68, and a new report from The Korea Herald claims that the iPhone 8 will feature just that. Will the iPhone 8 have wireless charging? Up until mid-2015, it hadn't been possible to do wireless charging—also known as inductive charging—on a phone with a metal back. Since Apple switched from the glass of the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s to the aluminum of the iPhone 5 and later models, that effectively meant the company couldn't offer wireless charging as well. Now methods for induction through metal are being introduced, which means it's possible Apple could keep the aluminum back and offer wireless charging. A report from KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo (via 9to5Mac) claims that all rumored 2017 iPhones will feature wireless charging; the iPhone 8 will also apparently have a thin sheet of graphite to protect its new 3D Touch sensor from the heat generated by wireless charging. Recent rumors have also suggested Apple is working on resonant inductive coupling, which would let devices charge even at a distance. (The greater the distance, the lower the efficiency.) Such technology is likely a year or more away, though. Okay, what do we know for sure? Only that nothing is confirmed until an Apple executive holds an iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus up on stage!

Rated IP67, it can survive accidental splashes, dunks, and floods, but isn't rated as highly as some competing phones from Samsung and others." Right, until you see the test done on Youtube where the person put the Samsung Flagship and the iPhone 7 in to buckets and lowered them to the bottom of some body of water. Even down to (hope I remember correctly) 45 feet, for about a half hour to 45 minutes, both phones held up. But the Samsung finally was nuked, while the iPhone soldiered on to greater depths. They never did ruin it. Apple's ratings are underestimated, while apparently Samsung's are't as underestimated, but way better than you would expect. 0 1 month ago Reply givmedew Unfortunately there are different tests showing different varying points where the devices fail for both Apple and Samsung. There are tests that show some iPhones failing sooner and some showing Samsungs that last longer. There is a reason for this though. You have 2 versions of iPhone 7 and 2 versions of S7 and S8 and you will always have variances in manufacturing. So you could perceivably have 2 galaxy s7 side by side and they almost certainly won't fail at the same time. Because the drop of water that kills them isn't going to enter at the same exact time and it isn't going to move to the same exact location in the phone and then when whatever fails gets wet it may or may not go instantly. Also the mineral content in the water maters more than anyone understands. The best place to do these tests is in salt water. You could manufacture a test showing an iPhone 4 surviving being dunked in a bowl of water and if the water came from a jug or bottle well it might not be very conductive. It's the minerals and impurities in the water that makes it so conductive. It takes longer for a component to fail in distilled water than tap water and it takes longer to fail in tap that salt water because tap water could be 50-1000x more conductive than distilled water and salt water can be 1000x more conductive than tap water. Then there is possible internal coatings that like conformal coating and other things that could allow a device to survive water ingress. But that's not it... There are so many factors and the thing is that these tests DO NOT SHOW WHEN WATER ENTERS THE DEVICE!!!! They show when the device critically fails! The truth and reality though is that even 1 drop of water inside of a phone means trouble. This drop will not easily get out, it may never escape and it could cause issues with camera optics, touchscreen sensitivity, foggy display etc. To assume that Apple decided to underate the phone is silly. To decide that Samsung overrated their phone is silly. I have used both phones up to their rated spec and had no issue. That's good enough for me... For anyone to try and say look this one specific sample from millions of phones out performed this other example when we took them way way past there rated ability is just silly. 0 1 month ago Reply ChrisS9938 Does it really matter?

Personally, I think the renders with the 'missing' home button and the screen that goes all the way down looks great! I think it'll be very slippery, if it's an all-glass design, and you'll more than likely want to protect it with a case, but that's the reality of smartphones in general -- you're talking a $650 - $1000 personal computer that, by its very nature, is vulnerable to being dropped. 0 3 months ago Reply Morjesta Is it true that they want to integrate the TouchID to the screen removing the home button?

Apple's existing technologies include wireless charging, Raise-to-Wake, water-expelling speakers, Apple SIM and a dearth of user-replaceable parts. If curved OLED edges allow Apple to replace the hardware buttons with software ones, I wonder if they would combine this with the rumoured new TouchID and their existing technologies to go so far as removing *all* buttons and ports from the OLED iPhone... It would certainly be one way to achieve an IP68 rating, and would appeal to Jony Ive I think. A phone aesthetic with no disruption to the surface other than a speaker grill is probably his end-game. If they did do this, hopefully the wireless charger would include the capability to somehow force a hardware reboot. I don't think this is very likely, but I can see how it could all line up. And yes - right now people need to plug a Lightning cable in to charge it, so many users have several cables but *most* have just the one that came with their phone.

It's not possible, by anyone, until some major new technological advances are made outside of consumer gadgets (like some university discovers X and it trickles into the market). So each year, we get a new phone, with great, but not earth shattering updates. This is true of every smartphone maker! They have to release each year due to competition, so the updates can't be that huge. That doesn't mean everyone has to buy it and complain it didn't blow their minds from last year. I don't see any massive earth shattering revelations in any other industry every year, but gadget people are so spoiled, such $hitty rotten entitled babies, they expect nothing less than mind blowing re-imaginings of every device every single year as if it was possible from people working 50-60 hour weeks to make this happen. For some reason, I don't see this in any other industry. No one is making statements like "new Ford Mustang, same internal combustion 4 wheeled vehicle as the old Mustang". If someone is fiscally smart, they'll wait 2-3 years before upgrading and then the new iPhone WILL surprise them. But like anything else, if you buy a new TV every year or a new car every year, of the same model, you won't be impressed. So I'm complaining about this attitude because I don't understand where it comes from. I do get a new iPhone every year because I'm silly like that, but I'm not a dumb enough to expect it to melt my brain. I enjoy the minor updates and appreciate it because I couldn't do any better and I'm not helping to make it any better. And if it really doesn't change much at all, then I'll wait another year. Making things is very hard people. End rant 4 4 months ago Reply cc3d probably because Apple makes out like they have achieved the moon...EVERY year!

Frankly, some of the things mentioned are obvious and don't need the speculation, or dissatisfaction. So, I'm reading- "plastic", as though that's a bad thing that Apple would never do. There's an obvious misunderstanding of what's going on. Yes, the display can be plastic. And LCD displays would also be made of plastic, if they could be, but they can't. That doesn't mean that the cover for the display will be plastic. It will be glass, as always. Of course, OLED is capable of DCI-P3. True Tone was left out because of the lack of room for the extra light sensors. Will they make it into a new phone? If space allows. Pressure sensitivity? Sure, there's nothing about OLED that would prevent the same system from working. The US government doesn't allow the use of the term "waterproof" in most products. There's really no such thing. Even diving watches designed for 5,000 meters are called water resistant to that pressure. A water resistant phone to Apple Watch standards of 50 meters would be hard to do. Is it worth it? Not really. If it went to 5 meters, that would be great, but still no warrantee for water ingress.

Police and the military use ceramic plates in their ballistic armor. They have solved the shattering problem with new processes and chemical additives. The question is can the cost and difficulty in manufacturing feasibly and cost effectively produce hundreds of millions of phone cases a year.

I think if they're going to do 3 phones with one of them being a 5" that the other two will be slightly larger and smaller than the current two sizes to create more of a difference. 0 7 months ago Reply wlonsdale How do their devices "compete against each other" Totally different markets and uses. 0 6 months ago Reply siryodi I have been hoping for a 5" to 5.2" iPhone for a long time. I think that is the sweet spot for a Smart Phone. It would make sense to just do the 5 or 5.1"" and 5.5" then keep selling the iphone 7 for a year in 4.7" before dropping it when the following year's phones come out. 0 5 months ago Reply JosuUrien AppleInsider denies the rumor, and says they will stick to 4,7" and 5.5". Anyway, I don't see any problem in Apple replacing the 4,7 with a 5" model if, as rumored, is all screen and no bezel. Think that a 4,7" screen is a bit wider than an iPhone SE, but shorter in height. So a 4.7" model without any bezel would be smaller than an iPhone SE model right now, and a 5" would be very similar in size to the SE, a little wider but not taller. 0 7 months ago Reply ChrisS9938 I'd love to see an app drawer as an option, but that's a software thing. I'd like to see screens at 5 and 5.5 with a 5.7 or better pro model. The 4.7 7 will be the next "SE" model. I'm all for removing the button altogether and just having a circle on the glass. Apple needs screens that are the equivalent of gorilla glass 5. I LIKE the aluminum body! I really don't want to go back to glass. My upgrade comes dead between the two models, and I am seriously considering android for the first time in years. I have nougat on my work Pixel C and it works wonderfully, so I can use both systems. But the odds are still pretty good I'll get a 7 plus in black. Water resistant is extremely attractive to me and the Pixel phones don't appear to have it. Samsung has glass backs. Don't panic about sales. The iPhone is a really good product, and Apple has a lot of people like me using a 6 that still works great who aren't ready to rush out in September and buy early, but will upgrade over the next year.

I want more screen per overall size. Smaller bezels will be appreciated. For a given device size, I want as much screen as possible. Apple is a bit behind here. 2. Processing and graphics power matters. The more Apple can continue to lead in this area, the more the iPhone can do. Processing power also means we users can get longer life out of our phones. I expect this from Apple, but it is worth saying. Is this an area where Apple can sustain their advantage? 3. I see Siri as a big part of the future for the iPhone. The more Apple can improve Siri -- hardware has to be important here -- the more we can all move beyond legacy input modes. This is one step to the future. 4. Battery life is huge. I don't know how companies like Apple will eventually break away from evolutionary battery improvements and OS efficiencies versus simply adding larger batteries, but this is a tech disruption waiting to happen. If Apple did one thing, and one thing only, they would further lead the pack instantly by improving battery life without simply adding a physically larger battery.

And like last year, this means the company will resort to throttling Qualcomm's modems in order to ensure that they perform at the same level as Intel's. While Qualcomm already has a modem that can theoretically reach gigabit LTE speeds (and this is included in the Snapdragon 835 chipset that powers 2017's Android flagships), Intel isn't there yet. It's reportedly working on a modem with similar capabilities, but that part won't be ready in time for the iPhone 8, iPhone 7s, and iPhone 7s Plus that Apple will launch this fall. Apple doesn't want to depend on just one supplier for such a crucial hardware component, and especially not Qualcomm - with which it's embroiled in a lawsuit where it alleges the chip maker is engaging in monopolistic practices. Apple's solution for this entire conundrum is to do what it did last year: throttle Qualcomm's higher-performing modems to the same level as what Intel's part is able to achieve. Thus there will be no performance difference between iPhones sporting the two parts. This might however create a marketing issue for Apple. The big US carriers have all promised to make gigabit LTE networks a reality by the end of the year, and when those launch the newest iPhones won't support them. On the other hand, Samsung's Galaxy S8, S8+, and Note8 all will, along with other Android handsets powered by the Snapdragon 835. As the carriers are expected to push this advancement a lot in their ads, Apple's image could suffer.

WE are edging closer to Apple’s reveal of the iPhone 8, but is it worth holding out for? Check out our detailed breakdown of the market to find out. Matthew Dunnnews.com.au@mattydunn11 news.com.au June 10, 201710:42am Key iPhone 8 feature could be disastrous A leaked image of the iPhone 8 has highlighted one key feature and the fury from some customers is spilling over. THE question everyone keeps asking is should they wait for the iPhone 8 or is there a better option to buy now? We decided to give you an in-depth breakdown of the best phones currently on the market to help you make an informed decision. IPHONE 8 Having kept to an almost identical design for its flagship smartphones since 2014, Apple is set to provide a fresh overhaul for the forthcoming iPhone 8. The tech giant is tipped to use its annual September event to announce the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, which will offer moderate updates from the predecessors — the main change will be swapping the aluminium case for glass to allow for wireless charging. But Apple will also use the event to launch the radically redesigned iPhone 8, a device expected to set tongues wagging. The bold new design is expected to include a stainless steel frame between two glass panels, which slightly curve to give the appearance of one continuous sheet of glass. Apple’s iPhone 8 is expected to have an advanced edge-to-edge 5.8-inch OLED display that will rival the impressive 83 per cent screen-to-body ratio seen on Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and S8+. Using finalised schematics leaked from the manufacturer of Apple’s next-generation smartphones, pictures show what the iPhone 8 is going to look like when it’s unveiled later this year. To achieve the 83 per cent screen-to-body ratio, Apple has removed the physical home button from the front of the display. As the leaked design doesn’t include a fingerprint scanner on the rear of the device, it is believed the TouchID sensor will be embedded in the display. The design also shows a new dual-lens camera system that will feature the same optical zoom capability as the iPhone 7 Plus’ camera, LED flash and a microphone. Surprisingly, the camera module on the iPhone 8 is oriented vertically, which is likely to do with the internal hardware engineering needed to fit the dual camera, front camera and new 3D infra-red sensors on the smaller device. However, it could be designed to specifically to enable the new augmented reality features Apple is expected to reveal at the event. While being unveiled this coming September, the release of the iPhone 8 might not come until early 2018 if recent rumours of manufacturing difficulties prove to be correct. Pros: • Full OLED display • Tipped to have 83 per cent screen-to-body ratio • Could have augmented reality features Cons: • Full glass display could make phone fragile • There will likely be no headphone jack • Might not have USB-C charger SAMSUNG S8 Samsung Galaxy S8 review2:25 Can Samsung's latest flagship help it bounce back from the exploding battery saga? May 16th 2017 25 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ Easily the sexiest release of the year, the ‘Infinity Display’ of the S8 Plus maximises the nearly bezel-less screen by using the curved glass to remove the left and right borders, with the top and bottom including only what is needed for things like the front-facing camera and iris scanner. As the tallest flagship phone the company has produced, the S8+ measures a whopping 6.2-inches, while the S8 has a much more humble 5.8-inch display. Despite the S8+ having such a long display, it measures only 73.4mm wide, making it thinner than the iPhone 7 Plus and easier to operate in one hand — this coming from a man genetically cursed with little sausage fingers. When watching 16:9 content on the 6.2-inch display you will have black bars on the side of the content, however if watching cinematic content shot in 2.35:1 or 2.39:1, the entire display will be filled, offering marvellous content. To help with the bezel-less display, Samsung has replaced the physical home button with virtual buttons and the branding has been moved to the rear of the phone because, honestly, there is nothing sexy about SAMSUNG staring at your face every time you look at the device. Also located on the back of the phone is the rear camera, which has been made to sit almost flush with the screen The fingerprint scanner also sits on the back of the phone to the left of the camera and while aesthetically pleasing, it’s a little awkward for unlocking the device at times and can lead to some nasty smudges on your camera. Thankfully there is the option for passcode facial recognition and iris scanning to avoid this issue when unlocking the device. The 12-megapixel rear camera has been kept the same specifications as the S7, which is a little disappointing. The Galaxy S8 features the IP68-rated water and dust resistance you’ve come to expect from Galaxy phones. As for the battery life, the S8 Plus has three display settings, allowing you to run the phone at either a WQHD+ (2960 x 1440), FHD+ (2220 x 1080) or HD+ (1480 x 730) resolution, with the lower tiers obviously offering more battery life. With the default FHD+ setting, the 3,500 mAh battery allows you to expect around eight hours battery life, which is pretty standard and not all bad with wireless adaptive fast charging. Also included on the phone is Bixby — Samsung’s own personal assistant to rival Siri and Google Assistant. Pros: • Slim, sleek and sexy — this design is phenomenal • High screen to body ratio of 84 per cent • No exploding battery saga Cons: • Phone is very fragile without protective case • Fingerprint scanner in strange location • Camera hasn’t seen a huge update from its predecessor. The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ cost $1199 and $1349, respectively. HUAWEI P10 AND P10 PLUS Huawei P10Source:Supplied Having already crushed Apple and Samsung in China, the world’s third most popular smartphone manufacturer is trying to achieve similar impact locally with the P10 and P10 plus. The smaller phone and its larger counterpart have 5.1-inch and 5.5-inch LCD displays, offering 1920x1080 and 2560x1440 pixels, respectively. The company’s latest flagships also look very similar to Apple’s 2014 iPhone 6S — great news for those who like the iPhone design but not iOS. Unlike other Huawei devices, the fingerprint scanner has been removed from the rear of the device and placed below the display, where it also doubles as a physical home button. It has smooth, curved corners, minimal side bezels and is available in gold and blue and black. Like its predecessor flagship smartphone, the Leica-branded dual camera set up is one of the best aspects of the device. Located flush at the top left of the device is the dual camera set up, which has a 12MP RGB sensor working alongside 20MP monochrome shooter. Both sensors capture images independently and combine them into one photo — this is supposed to enhance detail and contrast. Huawei’s P10 and P10 Plus also offer a front-facing 8MP camera, which includes a Leica-branded portrait mode. Shooting in portrait will use new facial tracking software that detects more than 190 points on the human face to ensure the camera focuses for the best possible shot. Both models offer Huawei Supercharge, which can take the battery from 0 to 25 per cent in 15 minutes or 0 to 88 per cent in an hour. Unlike its competitors, the P10 and P10 Plus are not water and dust resistant, which could be a deal breaker for those who find extra comfort in the setting. Pros: • Very similar to the look and feel of iPhone for people who don’t like Android • Dual camera provides excellent picture quality • Cheaper than other smartphones on the market Cons: • Not water or dust resistant • The P10 has a short battery life The Huawei P10, P10 Plus cost $899 and $1099 respectively. JELLY Jelly is described as a mini-sized 4G smartphone for everyone.Source:Supplied The highly anticipated return of the Nokia 3310 has proven consumers not only have a lust for nostalgia, but that bigger isn’t always better when it comes to smartphones. And while the 3310 is bound to fly off the shelves when it’s released later this year, it’s not without limitations — it won’t work in Australia long-term as it is designed to only operate using 2G networks. Thankfully, there is another smartphone manufacturer looking to fill the market demand for smaller smartphones. The Jelly is a “mini-sized phone with full features” that runs on Android Nougat 7.0 — the latest operating system found on most new Android smartphones. Customers will have the choice between the Jelly or the Jelly Pro, which offer 8GB and 16GB of on-board storage respectively — this can be expanded to 32GB with a MicroSD. Both models will have a 2.45-inch display and a replaceable 950mAH battery capable of up to three days working time or seven days standby. The smartphones will both include a 2MP front facing camera, with an 8MP shooter on the rear. Other key features include a dual SIM card, gyroscope and GPS. Since the concept was born in April 2016, the developers have been able to produce test samples of the product and believe it will start shipping in August this year. Pros: • Smaller than most smartphones, but offers same features • Battery life of up to three days working time or seven days standby • Cheap Cons: • Only has 32GB of space • Poor camera quality compared to bigger smartphones Preorders can be placed now, with the Jelly costing $A106 or $A127 for the Jelly Pro. OPPO R9S It might look like an iPhone 7, but it’s actually an Oppo.Source:Supplied There is no need to spend more than $1000 for a premium smartphone, with Oppo offering high-end specs for just a fraction of the cost. The latest addition to Oppo’s R9 line-up has been designed to meet current demands for greater camera features and improved technologies. Just like its predecessors, the R9s has been designed to be the perfect device for selfie lovers and includes 16MP front facing camera, with a large f/2.0 aperture and Oppo’s Screen Flash technology for quality images in low light conditions. An all new Sony IMX398 sensor has been exclusively designed for the smartphones rear facing 16MP camera, which combines with an extra wide f/1.7 aperture to capture 40 per cent more light than the previous models. The 5.5-inch R9s is eerily similar to the iPhone in design — both with its all-metal body physical appearance and the design of the app icons and fonts. It has a 1080p display, 8-core processor, 4GB of RAM memory and 64GB of on-board storage, which can be expanded to 256GB with a Micro SD card. The R9s further enhances the performance with a “six-string” antenna design — operating on six frequency ranges, which dynamically chooses the best for 4G and Wi-Fi signals. The device’s 3010 mAh battery and VOOC Flash Charge technology will offer heavy users enough charge for the day, while the fingerprint recognition system will become faster over time as it constancy refines its image of the user’s fingerprint. Pros: • Looks and feels similar to iPhone for a fraction of the cost • Selfie lovers dream with 16MP front camera Cons: • Not water/dust resistant • No NFC chip for mobile payment • Comes with Google Android Marshmallow 6.0.1, not the latest Android Nougat OS The R9s is $548 outright or the R9s Plus is $648.

(AAPL) Makes HomeKit Easier for Third Parties, But at a Cost Apple revamped HomeKit to make it easier for manufacturers By Brad Moon, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Jun 9, 2017, 7:25 pm EDT Get AAPL alerts: Submit     View All   Popular Posts: WWDC 2017: Apple Inc.

(AAPL) Makes HomeKit Easier for Third Parties, But at a Cost The 10 Biggest E3 New Video Game Announcements Ever Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Gets the Nod From Apple Inc. (AAPL) View All Posts Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has fallen behind in the race to be the smart home hub. There are a growing number of smart products that support AAPL’s HomeKit standard, but it’s nowhere near the pace being set by rivals Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). Source: Apple As WWDC 2017 wraps up, Apple announced it’s making a big change to HomeKit, making it much easier for third party device manufacturers to adopt the standard in the hope of boosting its popularity. However, the move to make HomeKit easier to adopt comes at a cost. Apple’s standard will be giving up some of the rock-solid security that gives it an advantage over competing standards. Making Apple HomeKit Certification Easier to Boost Adoption Amazon’s Alexa has thousands of “skills” that let its Echo smart home speaker interact with online services and control third party connected accessories, such as Google’s Nest smart thermostat. Apple HomeKit has a much more modest adoption rate among device manufacturers and a big part of that is the current certification process. Partners must become MFi licensed and use an Apple authentication chip in their device. Apple HomeKit certification is more costly and takes additional time in comparison to other standards. The requirement for the chip in particular means that companies can’t simply use a firmware update to make their products HomeKit compatible, they have to be specially designed and manufactured. As reported by AppleInsider, the company announced at WWDC 2017 that is loosening its licensing requirements and eliminating the requirement to use its authentication chip. This means product developers can work on HomeKit-compatible prototypes without first having a MFi license. If they decide to go ahead and produce the device, they do still need that license, but Apple is hoping this move will encourage companies that aren’t already partners –and wouldn’t be otherwise– to try out HomeKit, then go ahead and potentially release a commercial product. More importantly, not requiring the Apple authentication chip cuts manufacturing costs and opens up the possibility that smart home products could be made HomeKit compatible through a firmware update. That could even work for previously shipped products already in consumer’s homes. Making it Easier for Smart Home Partners Means Loosening Security Standards The downside to this move is that by employing software authentication instead of a specialized chip, Apple is giving up some of the security that made HomeKit smart devices far more resistant to potential hacking.

REUTERS/Brian Snyder Bloomberg News Jun 9, 2017 at 3:33 pm | Print View Verizon, AT&T and the rest of the U.S. wireless industry have a big boast for this year’s crop of smartphones. Thanks to network upgrades, devices will be able to download as much as a gigabit of data in a single second — speeds 100 times faster than before. But that won’t be the case for Apple Inc.’s newest iPhones, devices to go on sale later this year, leaving the company’s most important product potentially lagging behind the data performance of rival smartphones. The reason stems from the delicate and sometimes complicated way Apple manages the supply of the components embedded in its flagship device — in this case, the modems, which handle the connection between a phone and the cellular network. One of Apple’s suppliers, Qualcomm Inc., sells a modem capable of the 1 gigabit download speeds. Another supplier, Intel Corp., is working on a modem with the same capability, but it won’t be ready for the iPhone’s introduction, according to people familiar with Apple’s decision. The shares fell as much as 1.6 percent, to $152.56, in New York on Friday, the biggest intraday drop since May 17. Apple in theory could use Qualcomm’s chips. But it has an aversion to being dependent on a single supplier, and its relationship with San Diego-based Qualcomm is particularly thorny. Apple is embroiled in a bitter legal fight with the chipmaker, accusing the supplier of maintaining an illegal monopoly, and it’s seeking to loosen Qualcomm’s grip on the market for high-end smartphone modems. That’s why Apple will stick with Qualcomm modems for some of its new iPhones while relying on Intel for others. Until Intel is able to offer its chips with matching features, Apple won’t enable some of capabilities of the phones running with Qualcomm modems, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plan isn’t public. Apple, Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment. Apple’s decision clashes with the marketing plans of a cellular industry desperate to show off faster network speeds to grab market share. The top U.S. wireless carriers — Verizon AT&T, T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. — have declared 2017 the year of 1 gigabit speeds. Like what you're reading?

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady iFixit posts teardown of 2017 21.5-inch iMac, finds user-upgradable RAM, modular CPU Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Friday, June 9th, 2017, 05:33 Category: Hardware, iMac, News, Processors The pork has soared and it looks like Apple has finally released an iMac with a user-upgradable CPU as well as RAM. The cool cats at iFixit have just completed a full teardown of Apple’s new 21.5-inch iMac with 4K display. The unit features both removable RAM and a modular CPU, although Apple has yet to say if these components are user-replaceable. Accessing and replacing these components isn’t exactly easy, but it’s still possible. This is the first time Apple has had a 21.5-inch iMac with expandable RAM since 2013, and the first modular CPU since 2012. No one seems to know exactly why Apple has reverted to a socketed CPU, and perhaps there were lengthy discussions with Intel regarding it. iFixit offered the following comments regarding the teardown: Despite the upgradable RAM and CPU, we’re still giving this iMac a 3/10 for repairability. Here’s why: the iMac remains distinctly un-fun to open. Everything is buried under a finicky glass panel. It requires a speciality pizza-cutter-like tool to breach the adhesive before any repair. Plus the glass and Retina Display are fused together, fabulously increasing the cost of replacement. But hey, a 3/10 is triple the score of the iMac’s 2015 predecessor. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Elyse Betters10 June 2017Apps Apple iOS 11 expands Apple Pay to include Apple Pay Cash It's a person-to-person payments service in iMessage With it, you can receive or send money to friends in the US Apple will release iOS 11 with Apple Pay Cash this autumn Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Apple will introduce a feature, called Apple Pay Cash, in iOS 11 to make it easier for you to send money or receive money from friends. Apple Pay Cash is technically part of Apple Pay, Apple's mobile payment system, but it lives in Apple's iMessage app. And all the money you receive via Apple Pay Cash will live on a virtual card called Apple Pay Cash card, which exists within Wallet, Apple's other app for storing credit cards, debit cards, loyalty cards, boarding passes, tickets, and more. So, are you confused yet? No worries. Pocket-lint has explained everything you need to know below. Will my iPhone or iPad get iOS 11? iMessage apps: Which should you download first and how to install them? How does Apple Pay Cash work? iMessage app Apple When iOS 11 launches, Apple will allow person-to-person payments, just like apps Venmo, Square Cash, and believe it or not, Snapchat. Apple Pay Cash can be found in Apple's iMessage app. All you have to do is tap the Apple Pay thumbnail within the redesigned app drawer in iMessage. You can then set the payment amount, tap either request or pay, and approve the transaction. TouchID authentication Apple If you're requesting money from someone, a link to make the payment will show up in your iMessage chat window with that person. If you're paying someone, you must hit the send button and use TouchID to approve the transaction. The TouchID sensor offers secure authentication for any type of Apple Pay Cash transaction, and yes, all transactions will be encrypted. Wallet app Apple Payments will be sent from your debit card or credit card stored in Apple's Wallet app. But any money received will go into your "Apple Pay Cash" card, a virtual card that lives in Wallet. Apple is partnering with prepaid payment card company Green Dot on the virtual Apple Pay Cash card. From there, you can use the funds in the virtual card to pay others via iMessage and more. Siri assistance Apple Siri will be able to detect any conversation in iMessage about cash or payments. It'll automatically bring the Apple Pay app to the front of your iMessage app drawer if you or your friends are talking about money in iMessage. Furthermore, if any payment amount is mentioned, that amount will automatically be set when you open up the Apple Pay app, making it a breeze to send cash. Where does Apple Pay Cash work? Apple Pay Cash works wherever Apple Pay is supported. You can learn more about Apple Pay from Pocket-lint's guide here. Not only can you use funds in your Apple Pay Cash card to send and receive money via iMessage, but you can also use it to make Apple Pay purchases at retail locations, on the web, and in apps. You can even transfer the funds to your own bank account. Which devices support Apple Pay Cash? Apple Pay Cash will be available through iOS 11 on iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. But it only works on TouchID-supported devices, including Apple Watch, which means older iOS devices won't be able to take advantage of the peer-to-peer payments service. Apple Here is the list of support devices: iPhone SE iPhone 6 and later iPad Pro iPad 5th generation iPad Air 2 iPad Mini 3 and later Apple Watch Are there any fees? To send money using Apple Pay Cash, you will have to add a debit card or credit card to Apple’s Wallet app. Money-transfer services backed by a debit card will be free, while those backed by a credit card will be charged a 3-per cent fee - the same as competitors. You can transfer directly to a bank account without having to pay a service fee, though the transfer may not be immediate. When can you use Apple Pay Cash? Apple Pay Cash person-to-person payments (also called peer-to-peer payments) is coming to iOS 11 this autumn. It will be made available across all your Apple devices, like iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. Where is Apple Pay Cash available? Apple Pay Cash will only be available in the US at launch. There's no word yet on UK availability. Are there Apple Pay Cash alternatives? Apple Pay Cash will go up against competing offerings from PayPal, PayPal-owned Venmo, Square Cash, Snapchat's Snapcash feature, and popular bank services like Chase QuickPay. But unlike those competitors, Apple’s service is limited to iMessage users on iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, and it doesn't offer a ledger option so you can keep detailed memos about each transaction.

Apple, Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment. Apple's decision clashes with the marketing plans of a cellular industry desperate to show off faster network speeds to grab market share. The top U.S. wireless carriers — Verizon AT&T, T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. — have declared 2017 the year of 1 gigabit speeds. The carriers are already in a fierce price battle for subscribers. As the pool of new customers has declined, most of the user gains are coming at the expense of rivals. Sprint and T-Mobile have been taking customers from AT&T and Verizon by offering cheaper unlimited data at a time when video hungry users seek lower-cost plans to support their habits. The ability to advertise a service that's 100-times faster may help carriers shift consumer focus to network performance and away from cut-throat pricing. T-Mobile promised to have the first 1 gigabit data service available in the U.S. this year and has already started making network upgrades, Chief Technology Officer Neville Ray said in February. AT&T has started 1 gigabit mobile service in Austin, Texas, and plans to expand to as many as 20 cities this year. Verizon will begin 5G trials in 11 markets this summer and plans to start mobile testing of 1 gigabit speeds in those cities. Sprint has been one of the most aggressive proponents of 1 gigabit mobile speeds, promising in December that it would offer the fastest service in the industry. Sprint said it will have at least three 1 gigabit capable phones available this year — with the exception of iPhones.

Tight integration between the hardware, software and app store makes it easy to use. The Bad It's a bit thicker and heavier than the now defunct iPad Air 2. It lacks the stylus support, better speakers and better screen of the iPad Pro. The Bottom Line Pro and Air 2 owners can skip this one, but for nearly everyone else, the updated iPad is an ideal all-around tablet at a fantastic price. 8.4 Overall Review Sections Review Prices Specifications User Reviews CNET Mobile Tablets Apple iPad (9.7-inch, 2017) Editors' note, June 8, 2017: At its Worldwide Developer's Conference, Apple unveiled a new iPad Pro. Starting at $649, £619 and A$949, the new model replaces the original 9.7-inch iPad Pro, packing a bigger screen -- a 10.5-inch Retina display -- into a footprint similar to that of the cheaper, 9.7-inch, non-Pro model Apple debuted in March (reviewed below). The new 10.5-inch iPad Pro also comes equipped with a more powerful processor, higher-quality cameras, and, when it debuts in the fall, iOS 11. These upgrades are also coming to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, which starts at $799, £679 or AU$1,249. The other two iPad models -- the iPad and iPad Mini 4 -- remain a part of the lineup, unchanged since their earlier debuts. Remember the iPad? In the afterglow of its splashy 2010 debut, Apple's tablet became the post-smartphone "it" gadget of the decade. In recent years, however, sales have dipped -- both for iPads and tablets in general. But not for lack of trying: Near-annual improvements have pushed the iPad family forward, with higher-resolution retina screens, ever thinner bodies, and -- with the more expensive iPad Pro -- towards productivity and creativity features such as stylus support and a high-end keyboard. Ironically, the iPad line's biggest problem was that the older models were so good that there wasn't a huge incentive to replace them. And it didn't help that phone screens have gotten ever larger in the past few years, too: Why lug out a tablet, even a slim one like an iPad, when a 5.5-inch iPhone offers a reasonably close experience? Those newer iPad Pro models, meanwhile, were perfectly lustworthy, but priced at laptop pricing tiers of $600 and up. For watching videos, reading the web and playing Super Mario Run, older iPads -- or those big-screen phones -- remained good enough for a lot of users. Sarah Tew/CNET That's why I'm surprised that I'm as excited as I am about this new 2017 model, a 9.7-inch tablet simply called iPad. Like the superthin 12-inch MacBook, it drops all the honorifics -- no Air, Pro or Mini here -- and instead positions itself as the most purely distilled example of the concept. Not the bells-and-whistles flagship, but the one that delivers the iPad basics at a very competitive cost. The price, in fact, is the most exciting thing about this otherwise very familiar iPad. It starts at $329 for the 32GB Wi-Fi only model and goes up to $559 for 128GB of storage and 4G LTE cellular data, which is the model tested here. There is no 64GB option. That starting price of $329 is $70 less than the $399 starting price of the iPad Air 2 ($339.95 at Amazon.com) it replaces. That's $60 more than the previous budget champ, the smaller iPad Mini 2 ($299.77 at Amazon.com) (now discontinued), but it still makes this new model the most affordable full-size iPad ever. Apple iPad prices 32GB Wi-Fi 128GB Wi-Fi 32GB LTE 128GB LTE US $329 $429 $459 $559 UK £339 £429 £469 £559 Australia AU$469 AU$559 AU$669 AU$779 Sarah Tew/CNET Thanks to its lower starting price, this is a great first iPad for someone new to the brand, or an opportunity to update from an older model that doesn't support iOS 10, such as the third-gen retina iPad or the original iPad Mini. It's close enough to impulse buy territory for a lot of people, and it's also a near-perfect gift for anyone. Apple iPad (9.7-inch, 2017) Price as reviewed $559, £559 or AU$779 Display size/resolution 9.7-inch 2,048x1,536-pixel touchscreen CPU A9 Storage 128GB SSD Networking 802.11ac wireless, Bluetooth 4.2, LTE Operating system iOS 10.3 Let's call it the iPad SE So how did Apple cut the price on a full-size iPad without cutting into their legendary profit margins? Well, let's just say that this new iPad may not actually be as new as it seems. It follows the half-step-forward, half-step-back model used in the Apple Watch Series 1 and the iPhone SE ($420.00 at Amazon.com), essentially putting updated components in a bit of a throwback physical package, while keeping more expensive, more feature-filled models on sale right next to it. 41 The best iPad games This new iPad replaces the iPad Air 2 in Apple's tablet lineup, but it's actually closer to the original iPad Air in some ways. In fact, it has the exact same 7.5mm thickness and 469 gram weight as the 2013 iPad Air 1. By comparison, the Wi-Fi version of the iPad Air 2 is 6.1mm thick and weighs 437 grams (as does the 9.7-inch iPad Pro). Note that the LTE versions of these tablets weigh 7 to 9 grams more. An iPad Air 2 on the left, and the new iPad on the right. Sarah Tew/CNET Even though this new model is slightly thicker and heavier, you'd probably have to put them side by side to notice. It's minor, but in person, there's a definite difference. It's a small step backwards in design, and it's probably also at least one reason this new tablet reverts back to the classic iPad name rather than the iPad Air. Apple says new smart covers and related accessories for the iPad are backwards compatible with the original iPad Air line, but the reverse may not be true because of some shifting in where the magnets that control the sleep/wake feature are located.

Twenty-two people have been detained on suspicion of infringing individuals’ privacy and illegally obtaining their digital personal information, according to a statement from police in southern Zhejiang province. Of the 22 suspects, 20 were employees of an Apple “domestic direct sales company and outsourcing company”. The suspects allegedly used an internal company computer system to gather users’ names, phone numbers, Apple IDs, and other data, which they sold as part of a scam worth more than 50 million yuan (RM31mil). The statement referred to “domestic employees of Apple” but it was unclear whether they were directly employed by the company or by Apple suppliers or vendors. It also did not specify whether the data belonged to Chinese or foreign Apple customers. An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the matter. The local police did not respond to requests for comment. Following months of investigation, the statement said, police across more than four provinces – Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian – apprehended the suspects over the weekend, seizing their “criminal tools” and dismantling their online network. The suspects allegedly charged between 10 yuan (RM6.2) and 180 yuan (RM112.80) for pieces of the illegally extracted data. The sale of personal information is common in China, which implemented on June 1 a controversial new cybersecurity law aimed at protecting the country’s networks and private user information. In December, an investigation by the Southern Metropolis Daily newspaper exposed a black market for private data gathered from police and government databases. — AFP Tags / Keywords: World Related Stories Related Stories Mass funeral held for Myanmar plane crash victims Thai govt targets social media Man gets 35 years for defaming Thai royals Guo told us to do it, say staff Ma richer by RM11.9bil in just one day You May Be Interested Condoms, bribery, warlords: Afghans find truth in comedy Animal lovers file complaint over ‘cat vs scorpion’ YouTube video Breath of fresh air: 4 ways to improve air quality at home 10 last-minute IKEA styling tips for Raya Reasons why mums are our heroes 6 places you must visit in your lifetime Others Also Read Developer behind Pokémon Go backs Apple’s push into AR Mixing it up with moonlight jams Most sticking with London travel plans advertisement Latest News Exclusive: U.S. special forces helping Philippines troops to end city siege Iran says arrests seven suspects linked to Tehran attacks Marine cops snag boat transporting 38 Indonesia-bound illegals Grandmother poisons neighbour’s young son over secret five-year grudge Motorcyclist who allegedly hit boy in hit and run incident leaves number plate behind, netizens enraged Most Viewed in News Motorcyclist who allegedly hit boy in hit and run incident leaves number plate behind, netizens enraged United Airlines and top Chinese tennis star in bust-up over ‘excess baggage’ Grandmother poisons neighbour’s young son over secret five-year grudge Exclusive: U.S. special forces helping Philippines troops to end city siege MACC officer arrested for allegedly demanding bribe from cop Man fined for cutting roof off car to make it look like convertible Man alleges that hospital's negligence led to baby's death Kidnapped Japanese businessman rescued from Bangkok apartment Selangor Ruler’s younger sister laid to rest Secret tunnel found in historical site Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

NEW YORK: Shares of Apple Inc  fell more than 3 percent on Friday after Bloomberg News reported that iPhones launched later this year will use modem chips with slower download speeds than some rival smartphones. Apple is widely expected to upgrade its iPhone this year, which marks the device’s 10th anniversary, and suggestions that its technology will lag the performance of high-end smartphones running Alphabet Inc’s Android system could hurt its sales. An Apple spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Apple supplier Qualcomm Inc sells modems capable of downloading data at cutting-edge 1 gigabit speeds, but rival chipmaker Intel Corp’s modem technology does not yet have that capability, according to the Bloomberg report. Since Apple is traditionally reluctant to rely on just one supplier, it is using modems from both companies, but capping download speeds of the quicker Qualcomm modems so that all of the new iPhones perform the same, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources. Shares of the Cupertino, California company have surged 29 percent so far in 2017, largely in anticipation of the iPhone upgrade. The stock on Friday declined 3.5 percent to $149.60.

(Photo: Josh Edelson / AFP/Getty Images) 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Verizon Corp., AT&T Inc. and the rest of the U.S. wireless industry have a big boast for this year’s crop of smartphones: thanks to network upgrades, devices will be able to download as much as a gigabit of data in a single second — speeds 100 times faster than before. But that won’t be the case for Apple Inc.’s newest iPhones, devices to go on sale later this year, leaving the company’s most important product potentially lagging the data performance of rival smartphones. The reason stems from the delicate and sometimes complicated way Apple manages the supply of the components embedded in its flagship device — in this case, the modems, which handle the connection between a phone and the cellular network. One of Apple’s suppliers, Qualcomm Inc., sells a modem capable of the 1 gigabit download speeds. Another supplier, Intel Corp., is working on a modem with the same capability, but it won’t be ready for the iPhone’s introduction, according to people familiar with Apple’s decision. Apple could in theory just use Qualcomm’s chips, but it has an aversion to being dependent on a single supplier, and its relationship with Qualcomm is thorny. Apple is embroiled in a bitter legal fight with the chipmaker, accusing the supplier of maintaining an illegal monopoly, and it’s seeking to loosen Qualcomm’s grip on the market for high-end smartphone modems. That’s why Apple will stick with Qualcomm modems for some of its new iPhones while relying on Intel for others. Until Intel is able to offer its chips with matching features, Apple won’t enable some of capabilities of the phones running with Qualcomm modems, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plan isn’t public. Apple, Qualcomm and Intel declined comment. Apple’s decision clashes with the marketing plans of a cellular industry desperate to show off faster network speeds to grab market share. The top U.S. wireless carriers — Verizon AT&T, T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. — have declared 2017 the year of 1 gigabit speeds. Apple used two modem suppliers — and the same technique to mask performance disparities — for last year’s iPhone 7. But the rise of gigabit wireless networks could make the strategy more risky: iPhone users will have a unified experience, no matter what modem is inside the new device, but it could look even less speedy compared to newer gigabit-ready smartphones from other manufacturers. The carriers will be able to boast about 1 gigabit speeds if customers use other phones. Samsung Electronic Co.’s Galaxy S8, the main rival to the next iPhones, has Qualcomm’s X16 LTE modem and will keep up with the top speeds of the major wireless networks. Sprint sells the gigabit-ready HTC U11 and will have a Motorola Gigabit LTE phone later this year. Apple’s decision to introduce new technology when it wants, rather than chase whatever the market dictates, isn’t new. The original iPhone launched in 2007 without support for 3G networks, and it was still wildly successful. It wasn’t until 2012 that the iPhone supported LTE technology that’s the basis of 4G networks — a year after Samsung Electronics Co. added that capability to its smartphones. Still, Apple is dealing with a market that’s crying out for innovation to revive growth. Last year, the company’s revenue from iPhones, which generates more than 60 percent of Apple’s $216 billion annual sales, fell for the first time. Smartphone total market growth was just 2.5 percent, breaking a run of double-digit annual surges, according to industry analyst IDC. Whether Apple’s decision will overshadow the company’s slick new design and features in the phone coming later this year, as well as its customer loyalty, remains to be seen. Achieving 1 gigabit data speeds requires almost lab-like optimal signal conditions that seldom occur in the real world. Nonetheless, the first carrier to claim such network capabilities will get bragging rights and an edge at selling the promise of instantaneous movie downloads and high-quality live video. It’s one area where service providers can’t afford to be seen as laggards. Carriers are already in a fierce price battle for subscribers. As the pool of new customers has declined, most of the user gains are coming at the expense of rivals. Sprint and T-Mobile have been taking customers from AT&T and Verizon by offering cheaper unlimited data at a time when video hungry users seek lower-cost plans to support their habits. The ability to advertise a service that’s 100-times faster may help carriers shift consumer focus to network performance and away from cut-throat pricing. T-Mobile promised to have the first 1 gigabit data service available in the U.S. this year and has already started making network upgrades, Chief Technology Officer Neville Ray said in February. AT&T has started 1 gigabit mobile service in Austin, Texas, and plans to expand to as many as 20 cities this year. Verizon will begin 5G trials in 11 markets this summer and plans to start mobile testing of 1 gigabit speeds in those cities. Sprint has been one of the most aggressive proponents of 1 gigabit mobile speeds, promising in December that it would offer the fastest service in the industry. Sprint said it will have at least three 1 gigabit capable phones available this year — with the exception of iPhones. 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2s5OV6b TOP VIDEOS Rossetti architects design Ashe Stadium's retractable roof 4:58 Utica schools students study science in 3D 1:21 Innovative Vehicle Design Challenge 1:01 Crash test dummies brought to life at Humanetics 3:04 Mary Barra on the next generation Volt 13:47 Mary Sue Coleman says universities should be 'innovators' in economy 8:18 MSU plant geneticist explains his work 1:50

The shortages and waiting means that many users will turn to eBay or Craigslist to buy a new iPad faster, even if it means paying more than retail. if you are willing to pay an extra $100 to $150 for a new iPad now, instead of waiting weeks, you should make sure you’re getting a 3rd Generation iPad, not just a “new iPad”. (Read – New iPad Review) While Apple calles the latest version of the iPad, the new iPad, anyone selling a shrink wrapped iPad on Craigslist can call it a “new iPad”. If you don’t know what to look for, you can be scammed out of your cash for nothing more than an iPad 2. There’s nothing wrong with an iPad 2 for some users, but there is definitely something wrong with paying $600 or $700 for an iPad 2. Complicating the process problem is Apple’s design choice for the new iPad and the new iPad box. The new iPad looks very much like the old iPad, and the box is the same white background and side profile of the iPad. Thankfully, there are two ways you can tell if you are buying a new iPad 3rd Generation, or an iPad 2. The first thing to do is to look for the new iPad background. When you compare the background image on the iPad  on each box you can see a difference. The iPad 2 box, shown to the left, has a lighter water droplet image. The new iPad, shown to the right, has a darker water image with ripples. The difference is most noticeable at the bottom of the iPad image. Another place to look is at the back of the box where you will see a part number that starts with a “MC”. The part number indentifies which iPad you are purchasing, and is found near the barcodes on the back. As you can see below, I have a 32GB WiFi new iPad . The new iPad models have the following part numbers. Model number for 32GB new iPad. WiFi (Black – White) 16GB – MC705LL/A – MD328LL/A 32GB – MC706LL/A – MD329LL/A 64GB – MC707LL/A – MD330LL/A New iPad WiFi + 4G Verizon (Black – White) 16GB – MC733LL/A – MD363LL/A 32GB – MC744LL/A – MD364LL/A 64GB – MC756LL/A – MD365LL/A New iPad WiFi + 4G AT&T (Black – White) 16GB – MD366LL/A – MD369LL/A 32GB – MD367LL/A – MD370LL/A 64GB – MD368LL/A – MD371LL/A If you don’t see the right background on the iPad box or a matching part number, you should walk away from the deal. It is best if you can meet in a very public place when purchasing on Craigslist anyway, but even more important if you need to walk away from a scam. On eBay, if you pay with your credit card or PayPal you should have some protection, but make sure that you look closely at what you are bidding on.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Tablets Apple ‘totally undersells’ the iPad Pro’s new processor Chris Smith @chris_writes June 9th, 2017 at 6:12 PM Share Tweet Apple just revived the iPad with the help of some pretty exciting software features shipping in iOS 11 that will make it behave more like a traditional computer when it comes to productivity needs. There’s a file browsing app, support for drag-and-drop, a dock that’s home to more than just a handful of apps, and plenty of new multitasking tricks to name just a few. To power it all up is a brand new processor, the A10X Fusion, that’s supposed to deliver an even better performance than the iPhone 7’s A10 Fusion chip. Apple, of course, bragged about the new iPad Pro’s chip on the stage, detailing the improvements under the hood. But it turns out that Apple lied. But for once, that’s actually good news. Don't Miss: Confirmed: OnePlus 5 is an iPhone 7 Plus clone You see, as Motley Fool puts it, Apple “totally undersells” the A10X’s powers. Apple on stage said the A10X is 30% faster than the A9X chip in the previous iPad Pro generation. That number is accurate only for the single-core performance, as fresh tests are revealing. The A10X hits 3929 in Geekbench 4 compared to 3031 for the A9X chip. That’s a 30% increase in line with Apple’s estimates. But on the multi-core side, things are even better. Apparently, the A10X chip goes all the way up to 9372, which is a whopping 82% more than the 5138 score that an A9X iPad Pro might reach. That’s something Apple doesn’t mention on its site, although it does note that the iPad is “more powerful than most PC laptops.” Sure, these are synthetic benchmarks that do not replicate real-life use. But Apple’s A-series chips have no rival in the mobile universe. Not even the latest chips from Qualcomm and Samsung can outperform the iPhone 7 in single-core performance — which is what matters most to Apple considering its “lie.” But the fact that the A10X chip is capable of such performance is very exciting. First of all, a new chip generation is around the corner, the A11 that’ll power 2017 iPhones and should be even faster than the iPhone 7’s chip. With that in mind, the A11X going into next year’s generation of iPads should be incredible. For comparison purposes, the entry-level 15-inch MacBook Pro hits 4255 in the same test, and 13727 in multi-core speeds. It sure looks like a MacBook Pro running on a custom A-series chip is just around the corner.

John Martellaro @jmartellaro 5 minute read Jun 9th, 2017 4:49 PM EDT | Particle Debris The P.D. article of the week is: ” Apple’s Strengths And Weaknesses.” by Ben Thompson. After the WWDC keynote, author Thompson bluntly addressed the various keynote elements and Apple initiatives from the standpoint of the company’s strengths and weaknesses. It’s an interesting read, and I recommend it highly. Tim Cook & team hit multiple bases-loaded home runs during WWDC keynote. But what problems remain? I do have some quibbles with it, however. For example, a genuine weakness either manifests itself as a loss of business or position against the competition. Apple’s weaknesses are generally a proactive choice rather than grievous mistakes. (Although Apple makes those also.) For example, an Apple weakness is declining iPad sales. That’s addressed by Thompson, but many of the other weaknesses cited don’t have an obvious manifestation. In fact, Apple generally succeeds nicely despite analyst assessments of Apple’s weaknesses. That more often than not suggests that Apple’s perception of and adjustments to the market differ from the analyst’s. Back to the iPad. I strongly disagree with Thompson’s assertion that “bad developer economics is the fundamental reason that the iPad hasn’t fulfilled its potential.” I believe, instead, that the biggest problem with the iPad has been the evolution of its hardware, combined with iOS, to create modern, practical ways of using the iPad and creating content. The iOS 11 homage to macOS GUI principles, in order to get to the next level, proves my point. (More about that on page 2.) Even so, the observations by Thompson generally punch through the traditional hype of the WWDC keynote and focus on the practical aspects of Apple’s business. A persistent thread in the article is that Apple’s attention to privacy can put it at a competitive disadvantage against, say, Amazon’s Alexa. See, for example, “Former Apple employees rip the company for letting Siri fall behind.” Foremost in my mind in all this is the consumer awareness of what Apple does for them in terms of protecting their privacy. Most any customers will agree that they want their personal data protected, but then they go out an grab an Amazon Echo and the latest Android smartphone. That’s due to the persuasiveness of the ad campaigns that are heavy on glitzy promises and light on the underlying gotchas. Apple tries to tell it’s story in a simple way, but if Apple has any true weakness, it’s that it hasn’t been able to make the iron-clad case, embedded in the public psyche, that the iOS/macOS ecosystem is truly going to give the average user an edge when it comes to security and privacy. Ads like the above are just too simple-minded and low impact. I’d love to see an Apple security consciousness raising campaign that rises to the level of Apple’s “Get a Mac” campaign. That would be an amazing thing to see.

As for thoughts on the iPad and declining sales: I think the problem is that Apple does not build hardware that goes obsolete the moment its unboxed. For years, us Mac users were pointing out TCO when comparing Macs to Windows machines, and making the claim that because Macs last longer they save money in the long run. Thus I believe it is with iPad. I believe too many people — pundits, analysts, etc. — saw the iPad as having the same upgrade cycle as the iPhone. That’s not going to happen. With programs like AT&T Next, people (like me) can pretty much get a new iPhone every year and it doesn’t seem to be that big of an economic hit. Do I need the latest and greatest iPhone every year? No, not at all, but its a want I seem to be able to (fairly) easily fulfill. Plus with no landline for years now, my iPhone is my one-and-only phone, so it is a critical piece of hardware in my life. So is my Mac, as I’m a website/graphic designer, but as I’ve said before somehow my 9-year old iMac keeps fulfilling my professional needs. Likewise, my iPad Air is all I need for a tablet right now and more. Critical communication? iPhone. Critical work? iMac. Content consumption and a mobile resume/portfolio? iPad. Of the three, the iPad is the last on my list of needed upgrades, simply because my iPad Air does everything I need it to do without a single problem. I doubt I’m alone in making such an upgrade priority, and I believe that this is truly behind the declining sales of iPad more than anything else. June 9, 2017 at 5:44 EDT PM geoduck June 9, 2017 I have an iPad Air as well and yes, it does everything I throw at it, from writing to graphics to gaming to the latest iOS, to streaming video, to…whatever. But the updated iPad Pro with iOS11 and a Pencil is tempting me. Maybe with next years tax refund… The article on how the iMac Pro cost is not out of line struck a chord. Last fall I got an iMac. Part of the reason I was willing to plunk down $2500 for a fairly solid system was that it included a 27 inch 5K monitor. I looked around and I could not build a Hackintosh or a Linux box of comparable strength for the price WITH THAT MONITOR. Not to mention that it would not require any kludges or tinkering to keep it happy, and it came with a warrantee.

According to Bloomberg, Apple’s practice of avoiding single-source components means the 2017 crop of iPhones won’t include Qualcomm’s gigabit-download modem chips. It’s being seen as a setback for Apple, but will be little more than a blip in iPhone’s overall trajectory. Apple and Qualcomm Qualcomm has a wireless modem for smartphones today that offers theoretical download speeds up to 1Gb per second on some networks. We’ll get to that theoretical maximum below the fold, but the story starts with Apple and Qualcomm. The two companies are in a bitter fight over how the smartphone industry pays royalties. Qualcomm would like to continue long-standing industry-practice of basing royalty rates for patented technology on the retail price of consumer electronics devices. That practice works fairly well in the race-to-the-bottom world of open licensing and craptacularly mediocre products. Apple, however, makes premium products it sells for premium prices, and the company wants to pay royalty rates based on the overall value a patent is bringing the product, not its retail price. Put another way, Apple’s 0.05% royalty rate on an $800 iPhone is significantly higher than the 0.05% Samsung pays for some piece of crap $89 Android device. And they’re both paying for the same component. Apple wants to change this, Qualcomm doesn’t. And the two companies are engaged in a major court fight over the issue. While Apple and Qualcomm continue to do business—just like Apple and Samsung continue to do business despite their epic patent fight—Apple may be loathe to make itself beholden to Qualcomm for such a critical component as its modem chip. Two Companies, One Component The reality, though, is that Apple seldom allows itself to be beholden to any one company for a critical component. That’s been a big part of Apple’s strategy since Tim Cook took over Apple’s operations in 1998. There are a couple of reasons for that, both key. The first is that Apple plays one company against another to extract the best possible price. The second is that Apple has a fall back in case one supplier has quality or logistics problems. Bloomberg noted that Intel has its own gigabit download speed modem in the works, but it won’t be ready in time for Apple’s 2017 iPhone product line. Because Apple’s production numbers are massive, iPhones announced in September are being ramped up even now. Half-Baked Technologies There is no doubt that carriers and hardware makers first to market with Gigabit download speeds will bray the news far, wide, and loudly. There is even less doubt that the tech blogosophere and echo chamber will masticate the fact that iPhones can’t do what Samsung or HTC or whomever can. Apple haters will cackle with glee that this or that destined-for-malware Android device is markedly faster than iPhone. But it won’t matter to the general public for several reasons. 1.) Outside the echo chamber, few will know or care about gigabit download speeds. 2.) Apple haters gonna hate. They’ve been doing it forever, yet Apple is Apple. 3.) Initially, gigabit download speeds will be theoretical, not real. As Bloomberg put it, “Achieving 1 gigabit data speeds requires almost lab-like optimal signal conditions that seldom occur in the real world.” Apple seldom (if ever) supports half-baked carrier technologies for iPhone. Apple was later than the rest of the market with 3G network support and LTE/4G support. Apple’s competitors (and its haters) tried to make hay about that, too, and we know how that story ended. I bet you, dear reader, had completely forgotten about the Apple-is-dead-because-iPhone-doesn’t-do-LTE narrative permeating the echo chamber a few years ago. iPhone Will Cruise Along Certainly Apple will be hammered for not doing gigabit speeds for a few month, but “hammered” is relative. As much as many of us in the echo chamber thinks the echo chamber matters, it’s still an echo chamber. Apple will introduce gigabit download speeds to iPhone when it’s ready, and the world will quickly forget it ever cared. It is known. Shares of $AAPL dropped 3.88% on Friday to close at US$148.98, down $6.01, on almost triple the normal volume. That drop was part of a broader tech selloff. *In the interest of full disclosure, the author holds a tiny, almost insignificant share in AAPL stock that was not an influence in the creation of this article.

The tech-heavy index fell by as much as 2.8% just before 3 p.m. ET before retracing some of its losses minutes later. Earlier in the day, Goldman Sachs came up with a new acronym for the big-player stocks in the tech space —"FAAMG" — encompassing Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet.  Shares of all five got slammed on Friday, with each falling about 4-5% around 3 p.m. ET. First up, the scoreboard: Dow: 21,271.97, +89.44, (+0.42%) S&P 500: 2,431.77, -2.02, (-0.08%) Nasdaq: 6,207.92, -113.85, (-1.80%) US 10-year yield: 2.206%, +0.012 WTI Crude: $45.84, +0.20, +0.44% 1. Goldman came up with a new acronym for the most powerful drives of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. "While FANG has dominated investor focus, the nature of the acronym has expanded more broadly to encompass mega-cap tech," Robert Boroujerdi and his colleagues wrote in a note on Friday. "Indeed, the bigger story in our view is FAAMG — Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet — a group of five stocks which have been the key drivers of both the SPX & NDX returns year-to date." 2. And then tech stocks got slammed. Nasdaq touched a record high of 6,341 after the opening bell. But then around 3 p.m. ET, Facebook was down by 4%, Apple was down by 4.9%, Microsoft was down by 3.7%, and Alphabet was down by 3.9%. And Nvidia tumbled about 9% after Citron Research called the GPU manufacturer a "casino stock." 3. Amazon dropped sharply and suddenly — and then quickly recovered. The stock oscillated by about $35 per share over the course of 3 seconds. Commentators have speculated that the flash crash was either a so-called "fat finger" trade or an automated trade. 4. Canada's jobs report crushed it. The economy added 54,500 jobs in May, according to the latest data from Statistics Canada. Notably, full-time employment surged by 77,000 last month, and jobs for men ages 25 to 54 rose by 25,000. 5. The US oil-rig count jumped for the 21st week in a row — the longest streak in at least three decades. The oil-rig count rose by eight to 741, the highest level since April 10, 2015, data from Baker Hughes showed. The number of gas rigs rose by three to 185. With miscellaneous rigs unchanged at one, the total rig count rose by 11 to 927. 6. "We have no idea what's being proposed": Democratic senator gives impassioned speech on GOP healthcare bill secrecy. Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democratic senator on the Senate Finance Committee, railed against what she viewed as a secretive process around the healthcare legislation as Republican leaders move toward a vote before the July 4 recess. 7. Tesla is hurtling towards $400 per share. Tesla has gone from trading at about $250 per share last year to, as of Friday, trading at $375. The 13-year-old company is up 22% over the past 30 days alone. Since its 2010 IPO, it's up almost 1,300%. ADDITIONALLY: Canada's housing market appears to be "teetering on the brink of a downturn."

This underground network consisted of dozens of employees of direct Apple suppliers and other firms Apple outsources work to, and the group gathered users’ names, phone numbers, Apple IDs, and other data and then sold it piecemeal for between 10 ($1.47) and 80 yuan ($11.78) per data point, for a total of 50 million yuan ($7.36 million). It’s unclear if the data gathered was only on Chinese Apple users, or if it included users elsewhere too. CHINESE SCAMMERS SOLD $7.36 MILLION WORTH OF IPHONE DATA It took Chinese authorities, working out of the southern Zhejiang province, months to build the case before arrests were carried out this past weekend across Zhejiang, as well the Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Fujian provinces. The suspects in question worked in for companies with access to company databases and other tools containing sensitive customer information. The sale of data in China is nothing new. The country is rife with marketplaces for illegally obtained information, either gleaned from corporate or government databases. However, due to the perception that owners Apple products are more affluent than those with lower-budget smartphones, hackers and other data theft specialists may specifically target iPhone users in an attempt to extort them or gain access to more sensitive data stored in the cloud. Correction: An earlier version of this article mistakenly identified the suspects as official Apple employees in China. That is incorrect. The employees in question belong to Apple suppliers and companies Apple outsources work to.

 Apple's Jony Ive wants to design a soap dispenser Alex Heath Jun. 9, 2017, 6:18 PM 3,972 facebook linkedin twitter email print Jony Ive. Getty Jony Ive wants to design a soap dispenser. Apple's top designer revealed his ambition during a recent interview with The Financial Times. "There aren’t any good soap dispensers,” Ive explained, adding that it “really bothers” him. Ive is credited with leading the design of all of Apple's top products, from the iPhone to original iMac. He's even in charge of designing Apple's futuristic, spaceship-like campus that's about to open. But the famed designer has also crafted a diverse range of objects outside of Apple over the years, including a special Leica camera and a Christmas tree. Ive is clearing still thinking about designing products that would fall outside of Apple's purview.

Desai will serve in a senior role at Apple in the growing health team but will continue to see patients at Stanford, said people familiar with the move. It's unclear whether Desai will oversee the company's existing digital health efforts, such as its software frameworks ResearchKit, HealthKit and CareKit, or head up an unannounced project. Either way, the people said, it demonstrates that Apple is taking its health ambitions seriously. At Stanford, Desai was involved in a number of digital health projects with big tech companies and start-ups, including Apple. At Stanford's digital health center, she worked with Silicon Valley technology companies to test and develop new tools in collaboration with the university's medical experts. She also devised the strategy for Stanford's first virtual primary care clinic, called ClickWell Care. That proved to be an early success and is used as a case study for the medical industry, especially in reaching an at-risk population that wasn't utilizing primary care all that much. Within a year, some 55% to 60% of 4,000 clinic visits were done virtually. The center is also accepting proposals for health care research projects focused on innovative uses for Apple Watches. In addition to providing up to 1,000 of the watches, the center will award $10,000 to the winning project for one year, starting in April. Her research interests involve finding new ways to use technology to improve the patient experience in health care, which overlaps with Apple's strategy in the space. Desai isn't the first high-profile doctor scooped up by the iPhone maker. Stanford pediatric endocrinologist Rajiv Kumar joined the team in June of last year, alongside the medical team from a start-up called Gliimpse by way of acquisition. And Apple's vice president of medical technology Michael O'Reilly is a trained anesthesiologist. Prior to going to medical school, Desai worked as a strategist at The Walt Disney Company and a public policy research fellow at Kaiser Family Foundation. Christina FarrReporter for CNBC.com

As Apple kicked off its annual three-day Worldwide Developer Conference, techies and consumers tuned in for much-anticipated updates and announcements. Here are some of the most talked about iOS 11 updates and product announcements so far: – New iMacs, including the “most powerful” Apple machine ever Apple hasn’t updated its line of iMacs since 2013, but that all just changed. -The company announced iMac updates with Intel 7th generation Kaby Lake processors, which the company called “the best Mac display ever,” the company said. The new 21.5-inch model and 27-inch model will have two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports and double the current number of gigabytes. According to the Verge, the 21.5-inch iMac will start at $1,099 and the 4K 21.5-inch model will start at $1,299. The updated iMacs are currently available. Apple also previewed its new all-in-one iMac Pro, calling it the “most powerful Mac ever.” The 27-inch machine includes a matte gray casing and features four Thunderbolt 3 ports, a 1080p FaceTime camera, code compiling, realtime 3D rendering and more. According to 9to5mac.com, the new iMac Pro will be available in December and will start at $4,999. – All Macbook, Macbook Pros will get updates Apple announced all Macbooks and Macbook Pros would be getting speed and performance updates with the newest operating system, macOS High Sierra. The company is also adding a cheaper $1,300 MacBook Pro option. – HomePod smart speaker The HomePod smart speaker, which uses Siri for assistance, will cost $349 and will ship to the U.S. in December, features wireless access to Apple Music’s library. Like Amazon’s Alexa, the smart speaker is also designed as a home assistant for information on news, weather, reminders and will be able to control smart home products. – Apple TV adds Amazon Video, finally Apple TV will finally have an official Amazon Video app for streaming TV and movies. According to CNET, the app will be available on the fourth-generation Apple TV streaming and gaming box ($150). COOLEST iOS 11 FEATURES: – Bounce, loop, long exposure camera effects You need to be Logged in to sign up for Express Login. Using optical image stabilization, True Tone flash and HDR, Apple’s camera update will feature more expressive live photos that look even more professional, the company said. Loop and bounce effects create continuous video loops, whereas long exposure can capture both time and movement. – Person-to-person Apple Pay The new iOS 11 update will offer users person-to-person payment options (like Venmo and Square Cash). Money from these transactions can be stored in the Apple Pay Cash Card and transferred to personal bank accounts. – Apple Maps Do Not Disturb option The new and improved Maps will offer speed limits, lane guidance and the option to turn on Do Not Disturb While Driving, which won’t show text messages by default. But, Apple said, in cases of emergencies, message senders are able to reply with “urgent.” – Augmented reality kit (ARKit) Snap Inc. brought smart filters and Facebook followed with its AR camera. Now, Apple’s here with its ARKit, which the company called the “largest AR platform in the world.” The tool will allow developers to bring even more AR apps to iOS devices. – Multilingual Siri Siri just got a whole lot smarter with its ability to translate various languages, including English, Chinese, French, German, Italian and Spanish. Siri will also get a voice updated to sound more natural. – App Store makeover The new App Store will feature a separate tab for games, how-to content and a “Today” tab of all notable new releases.

Cook told MIT graduates and their families that technology without basic human values is worthless. (John Wilcox/The Boston Herald via AP) John Wilcox Share Tweet Share Email Comments CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Science is worthless if it isn’t motivated by basic human values and the desire to help people, Apple CEO Tim Cook told graduates of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Friday, urging them to use their powers for good. In a commencement address, Cook — who as Apple’s chief executive since 2011 has overseen the rollout of the iPhone 7 and the Apple Watch — said the company is constantly looking for ways to combine tech with a sense of humanity and compassion. “Whatever you do in your life, and whatever we do at Apple, we must infuse it with the humanity that we are born with,” said Cook, who previously served as chief operating officer and headed the Macintosh division. “That responsibility is immense. But so is the opportunity,” he said. Cook said Apple wants to make products that help people. As examples, he cited iPhone technology that can help a blind athlete run a marathon and an iPad that connects an autistic child to the world around them. “When you keep people at the center of what you do, it can impact,” he said. Cook also said he isn’t worried about artificial intelligence giving computers the ability to think like humans. “I’m more concerned about people thinking like computers without values or compassion or concern for the consequences,” he said. “That is what we need you to help us guard against. Because if science is a search in the darkness, then the humanities are a candle that shows us where we have been and the danger that lies ahead.” Cook also urged graduates to resist becoming cynical. “The internet enabled so much and empowered so many, but it can also be a place where basic rules of decency are suspended and pettiness and negativity thrive,” he said. “Don’t let that noise knock you off course. Don’t get caught up in the trivial aspects of life. Don’t listen to trolls, and don’t become one. Measure impact in humanity; not in the likes, but the lives you touch and the people you serve.” Tagged: Tim Cook, Apple Inc, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Massachusetts, United States, North America Click to comment Close comments Related Apple unveils Siri speaker The Latest: Siri is be getting the option of a male voice Prosecutor: Woman in texting suicide case wanted attention Newspaper: Harvard pulls student offers over online comments Sports State softball: Rice Lake completes epic comeback to advance to D2 title game Front Page Breakfast in the Valley: Local farmers draw support Front Page State softball: Bloomer falls just short in D3 semifinals Sports State softball: McDonell advances to D5 title game © 2017 Leader-Telegram, Eau Claire, WI.

The technology sector, which soared this year and led the market's rally, finished down 2.7 percent, after paring declines. But financials and energy, which have lagged the broader rally this year, were strong. Energy gained 2.5 percent and financials rose 1.9 percent. "It is a rotation today and it is out of tech into some of the other sectors," said Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 113.85 points, or 1.8 percent, to end at 6,207.92. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 89.44 points, or 0.42 percent, to 21,271.97, while the S&P 500 lost 2.02 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,431.77. Apple Inc shares fell 3.9 percent in their biggest daily percentage decline since April 2016 and were the biggest weight on the three major indexes, after a report that iPhones to be launched later this year will use modem chips with slower download speeds than some rival smartphones. Facebook Inc fell 3.3 percent, its biggest decline since November 2016, and Alphabet ended down 3.4 percent, its worst day since June 2016. Microsoft Corp fell 2.3 percent. chipmaker Nvidia closed down 6.5 percent at $149.60 after Citron Research said the stock could trade back to $130. Kepner said the combination of the comments on Nvidia and a cautious Goldman Sachs report about tech stocks was leading to a "little air coming out of the balloon." Shares of software company Cloudera also tumbled, shedding 15.6 percent after its quarterly results. "Tech has been on a tear for a very, very long ... time," said John Praveen, managing director for Prudential International Investments Advisers in Newark, New Jersey, adding that investors may be using the Cloudera quarterly results as "an excuse to take some profits." Investors were also digesting major political and economic events this week in the United States and Europe. U.S. stocks had started Friday's session strong after the results of the UK election, in which British Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority. Investors also viewed former FBI Director James Comey's testimony on Thursday as not disruptive to the stock market. Market watchers had been concerned that the result of the Congressional hearing could derail President Donald Trump's plans for lower taxes, fiscal spending and looser regulations, which have helped drive the S&P 500 up 13.7 percent since his election. Focus was turning to the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week, when the U.S. central bank is overwhelmingly expected to raise interest rates. "Markets are probably expecting that the Fed will raise rates, but they will be very gradual in removing monetary accommodation," Praveen said. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.68-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored advancers. About 8.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, well above the 6.7 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Here's Why Tech Stocks Fell Today Ryan McQueeney Zacks June 9, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Shares of some of the world’s largest technology companies—including Facebook FB, Apple AAPL, Nvidia NVDA, and Microsoft MSFT—slumped on Friday afternoon as investors finally seem to be hesitating on this year’s hottest sector. Today’s tech slump was inspired by a new note from Goldman Sachs that warned investors about potential unconsidered risk in the space. First, the firm argued that the popular “FANG” acronym is outdated, instead proposing “FAMMG”—Facebook, Amazon AMZN, Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet GOOGL—as the most relevant group of tech giants. “While FANG has dominated investor focus, the nature of the acronym has expanded more broadly to encompass mega-cap tech,” said Goldman Sachs analyst Robert Boroujerdi. “Indeed, the bigger story in our view is FAAMG — Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet — a group of five stocks which have been the key drivers of both the SPX & NDX returns year-to date.” Goldman thinks a heavy emphasis on FAAMG could pose a problem, especially if more passive investors move to these stocks for their relatively low volatility. “The fear is that if fundamental events cause volatility to rise, these same passive vehicles will sell and exacerbate downside volatility,” the note said. Overall, Goldman sought to warn investors that these tech stocks may not be the safe havens that they are being touted as. The firm seems worried that some may not be considering certain risks, such as cyclical exposure and regulatory concerns, which are inherent to these companies. One of the tech industry’s biggest decliners was Nvidia, the red-hot chipmaker that was notably left out of Goldman’s cautious report. Nvidia is facing its own pressure today, with shares falling nearly 8% after the company found itself the latest target of notorious short-seller Citron Research. In a new report published today, Citron likened NVDA, which has gained more than 40% year-to-date, to a “casino stock” and argued that its recent rally has gone too far (also read: Citron's Andrew Left Hammers Nvidia, Shares Dip). “In the recent frenzy in NVIDIA shares, it has added more to its market cap than the total valuation of its competitor AMD. Now it is fueled by an irresponsibly bullish number from Citi,” Citron said. “Just seven months ago, their analyst team had a $90 price target. But yesterday, their target is doubled $180 ... despite the weakness in NVDA's core gaming business.” Nvidia competitor Advanced Micro Devices AMD was also down about 6% in early afternoon trading Friday. Overall, the DOW was up nearly 0.3% on Friday afternoon, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ slipped more than 1.4%. It’s worth noting that today’s movement could just be a slight pullback after the sector’s incredibly hot start to the year. According to our Zacks Sector Rank data, the overall “Computers and Technology” business has gained more than 19% year-to-date. That’s some insane growth. Maybe we could all use a bit of hesitation at the moment. Interested in the week’s other top stories? Make sure to check out the latest episode of the Zacks Friday Finish Line podcast.

Elyse Betters9 June 2017Apps Apple Shop, make appointments, and get customer service Now you can interact with businesses in real-time All through the new iMessage app in iOS 11 Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Apple is adding a major new feature to its iMessage app in iOS 11. On Apple's Developer site, there is a new section outlining the feature, called Business Chat, even though Business Chat wasn't directly mentioned by Apple during its WWDC 2017 keynote in June. Based on how the feature is described on the site, we know Apple wants to provide businesses with a way to make themselves available for quick chats in the iMessage app for customer service purposes. From what we can tell, you can find a business using Safari, Maps, Spotlight, or even Siri, and then you can initiate a text-based conversation with the business through Apple's iMessage app. You can get answers to questions, resolve issues, and complete transactions, and more. Here's everything you need to know about the feature, including how it works and when can start using it. Apple iOS 11: 11 new features coming to your iPhone and iPad Apple iMessage explained: What's new and how to use it Apple/TheVerge What is Business Chat? Business Chat is a new tool that will allow businesses to offer real-time customer support. A similar feature exists in Facebook Messenger. But unlike that offering, Apple won’t require businesses to have a social media account. Customers can search for a business in iOS via Safari, Maps, Spotlight, or Siri, and from any of those services, they can open iMessage and chat with the business. How does Business Chat work? Customer support During a WWDC session, Apple explained Business Chat in more details, including how it works, according to The Verge. When in a chat with a business, you can shop, schedule appointments, ask general inquiry advice, file a dispute, and more - all from the same chat thread. There are also other built-in features, like predictive text, which will load an address or number a business asks for it. Shop Just like in Messenger, you can shop and buy products directly from chat. But your only payment solution will be through Apple Pay, of course. Businesses can show items in stock in a list format, which will appear in the conversation and doesn't require you to open a new window. Appointments If you want to use Business Chat for appointments, the feature will link up to your own calendar and smartly suggest time slots that won't conflict with your schedule. Businesses may sometimes direct you to download an iMessage app to complete certain request. An airline, for instance, might have a separate app that helps you select a seat. This can all be down within the conversation. How do you start a chat? Customers can find a business either through Safari, Maps, Spotlight, or Siri, and they can initiate a conversation with that business from Apple's updated iMessage app on their iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. You will see a different thread for each business you're chatting with.  Which businesses are using it? Any business can register, integrate their customer service platforms, and develop their own custom features, like a separate iMessage app to complete certain tasks. A handful of companies have already signed up, including LivePerson, Salesforce, Nuance, and Genesys. Business Chat therefore isn't limited to retail or businesses with retail locations. We suspect more will be signing up soon. When can you try Business Chat? Apple is currently offering Business Chat in a developer preview. Businesses can register here. The feature won't officially be available for all customers to use until iOS 11 rolls out this autumn. Want to know more?

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Moe Slah Why the iPhone 8 won’t support gigabit LTE Yoni Heisler @edibleapple June 9th, 2017 at 4:53 PM Share Tweet When Apple releases the iPhone 8 later this year, the company’s flagship smartphone may not be able to access mobile data as fast as some of its Android-based rivals, according to a new report from Bloomberg. Though some carriers have started rolling out network upgrades that can handle gigabit data speeds, the iPhone 8 will reportedly be unable to play along. The issue stems from Apple’s tendency to source key components from varying suppliers. Not only does this lower the risk of supply issues becoming a problem, pitting two component suppliers against each other also helps Apple secure favorable pricing. Don't Miss: E3 2017 schedule: Press conference dates, times, live streams and what to expect In regards to the iPhone 8, the device will feature LTE modems from both Qualcomm and Intel. Needless to say, Apple wants to ensure that iPhone 8 performance remains uniform no matter what LTE modem it happens to feature. So although Qualcomm’s offering can support the aforementioned gigabit data speeds, the iPhone 8 won’t support such speeds because Intel’s LTE modems can’t compete just yet. Until Intel is able to offer its chips with matching features, Apple won’t enable some of capabilities of the phones running with Qualcomm modems, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plan isn’t public. Apple, Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment. Apple’s decision clashes with the marketing plans of a cellular industry desperate to show off faster network speeds to grab market share. The top U.S. wireless carriers — Verizon AT&T, T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. — have declared 2017 the year of 1 gigabit speeds. Now that’s not to say Intel doesn’t have something coming soon. On the contrary, Intel earlier this year debuted a new XMM 7650 modem that can handle gigabit LTE speeds. The only wrinkle is that it just won’t be ready in time for the iPhone 8. According to Intel reps — who spoke on the matter this past February, their blazing fast LTE modem won’t be available until 2018.

While the iPad will receive many terrific (and much-needed) big-screen features (see “iPad Pro Gets More Professional,” 5 June 2017), the rest of iOS 11 focuses on UI refinement, artificial intelligence, and developer capabilities. Regardless, some big changes are coming when iOS 11 is released this fall. Control Center and Lock Screen -- Whenever you install iOS 11, the first big thing you’ll likely notice immediately is the new Control Center, which had ballooned to up to three pages in iOS 10. For iOS 11, Apple has compressed it back down to one page, in a grid that takes up more of the screen. Despite being squeezed into a single page, Control Center will offer more options than before. You’ll be able to 3D Touch a Control Center “platter,” as Apple called them, or presumably long-press it on devices that don’t support 3D Touch, to pop open a panel with more options. The other big front-facing change is that Notification Center is going away in iOS 11. Instead, you’ll be able to scroll through all of your notifications on the Lock screen. It wasn’t quite clear how you’d be able to see your older notifications without locking the device. Messages -- In iOS 11, Apple is finally fixing Messages with Messages in iCloud. Your messages will be synced across devices via iCloud, so you won’t have unsynced or jumbled messages. If you delete a message on one device, it disappears on all devices. Also, your older messages will be stored in iCloud so they won’t hog precious storage space on your devices. Of course, your messages will still be end-to-end encrypted to ensure your privacy. Apple is also redesigning the Message app drawer for iOS 11. The company introduced Message apps in iOS 10, but they’ve been underwhelming so far. A better-designed app drawer may make these mini-apps more accessible. That will also be key for a new feature coming to Apple Pay… Apple Pay -- Apple is becoming a financial services company of sorts, since Apple Pay will support person-to-person payments in iOS 11. To store the money you receive, you’ll have an Apple Cash Card in Wallet, and you can transfer money from it to your bank. Apple was a bit skimpy on details, but it seems that the primary way of making person-to-person transactions will be with a Message app that can send money via iMessage. Siri -- Siri will receive some major enhancements in iOS 11. In addition to new, more natural voices and a new look, Siri will now sync the data it knows about you between devices to better help personalize your queries. Siri is also getting smarter. Thanks to what Apple calls Siri Intelligence, Siri will better understand your interests and the contexts in which you are speaking. For instance, if you search for Iceland in Safari, Apple News will recommend articles about Iceland, and the keyboard will intelligently suggest related terms. Apple has spread this intelligence throughout iOS 11. For instance, Calendar can now extract events from Safari. This is one of those features that’s difficult to demo or describe, so we’re anxious to get our hands on it to see how it works in reality. Unhappy with the results Siri usually gives you? In iOS 11, Siri will offer alternative answers that you can choose by tapping the screen. Presumably, Apple will use this to tailor its recommendations. Perhaps the coolest new feature coming to Siri is translation. You’ll be able to say something like “How do you say what the most popular dishes in your restaurant in Chinese,” and Siri will speak what you said in Chinese. Apple emphasized that this is a beta feature, so we don’t quite have the Babel fish from “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” yet. Finally, the SiriKit API for developers is gaining some new features, such as photo search, car controls, task management, and banking. That should mean that we’ll be able to use Siri to control many more apps than in iOS 10. App Store -- Apple is totally revamping the App Store in iOS 11. The old top charts seem to be gone. Instead, there are tabs for daily featured apps, games, and apps. Apple seems to be moving toward curating the App Store more. Apps featured in the Today tab will include short articles and how-to videos. Likewise, the other new tabs will feature highlighted apps every day. The idea seems to be to get users to check in with the App Store every day to see what’s new. That may be great for developers, but we’re horrified that Apple seems to think you should waste vast amounts of time browsing the App Store for new apps daily. Developers will appreciate the App Store’s new “phased releases,” which roll out a new or updated app slowly instead of all at once. That’ll be especially welcome for developers whose apps require a lot of server resources. Camera -- Have you noticed that the file sizes for photos are growing with each new iPhone model? Apple is tackling that with two new technologies: HEVC H.265 video compression and a new image format called HEIF. Apple claims that HEVC compression can cut the size of videos by half. HEIF, or High Efficiency Image File Format, is a new file format standard that will replace JPEG for iOS photos. Apple claims that images in HEIF will be easy to share with others, but we’re waiting to see how well that pans out. Portrait Mode for the iPhone 7 Plus is also getting some much-needed enhancements: improved image quality, better low-light performance, and optical image stabilization. Photos -- The Memories feature that Apple introduced in iOS 10 is getting smarter and better able to identify different objects and people, but the change you’re most likely to notice is that Memories in iOS 11 will be able to switch from landscape to portrait orientation. But the most impressive new stuff coming to Photos in iOS 11 is all the things you’ll be able to do with Live Photos. You’ll be able to trim and edit Live Photos, pick a different key photo, and create loops. You’ll even be able to reverse the directions of loops if you want a bounce effect. But perhaps the coolest new feature with Live Photos is being able to combine all the frames together to form a long exposure shot. Maps -- As always, Apple’s Maps is playing catchup. Maps in iOS 11 will inform you of speed limits and offer lane guidance — standard features on most standalone GPS units. However, more interesting is that Maps will begin offering indoor maps of large places like malls and airports. Support will be limited to a small number of major cities at first, but that will hopefully grow over time. CarPlay for the Rest of Us -- Even Apple admits that CarPlay hasn’t been widely adopted, so that’s why the most interesting new automotive feature will be available to all iOS 11 devices: Do Not Disturb While Driving. When your iPhone detects, either via Bluetooth or the Wi-Fi Doppler effect, that you are in a car, it will shut off notifications to your phone. You’ll be able to set an auto-reply text message in case anyone messages you, which the sender can break through by stating that the message is urgent. You can also turn off Do Not Disturb While Driving if you’re riding in a car instead of driving. We strongly hope this feature will help cut down on the number of accidents caused by texting and inappropriate iPhone use while driving. HomeKit -- Apple’s home automation platform will gain some more capabilities, but the key thing Apple wanted to discuss is the new AirPlay 2 protocol and its integration with HomeKit. If you have multiple AirPlay 2 enhanced speakers, you’ll be able to use the Home app to broadcast music throughout your house. A number of manufacturers have signed on to produce AirPlay 2-compatible speakers, and we presume Apple’s own HomePod will do so as well. Apple TVs running tvOS will also be able to act as AirPlay 2 receivers. I hope this musical HomeKit integration will let me do things like play a song in response to an event or even sync my lights to music. Apple Music -- Remember Ping? Or Apple Music Connect? Well, Apple just won’t give up on the dream of a social music experience, so Apple Music in iOS 11 will let you see what your friends are listening to. We hope you can turn that feature off; there’s a reason each of Apple’s previous attempts in this area has failed. Apple is also offering developers an API for Apple Music, so developers of apps like Shazam can tie into Apple Music. It will be interesting to see what developers do with that. Behind the Curtain -- WWDC being a developer conference, Apple announced some new technologies that could lead to new, exciting apps. The two most interesting ones for end users are Core ML and ARKit. Core ML is a developer framework to make machine learning readily available to developers. Developers can use it to handle things like face detection and tracking, text detection, object tracking, palm rejection, and barcode scanning. Apple claims that with Core ML, iOS image recognition will be six times faster than with Google’s Pixel phone. ARKit is a framework to help develop apps using augmented reality, which mixes the real and virtual worlds. The example most people are probably familiar with is Pokémon Go, which lets players capture and battle with pocket monsters around the world (see “What the Heck Is Pokémon Go?,” 17 July 2016). Apple even demonstrated how ARKit will make Pokémon Go better by showing that a thrown pokéball will bounce around on a real-life sidewalk. Apple senior vice president Craig Federighi also showed how an ARKit app lets him place virtual objects on a table. And Alasdair Coull, head of director Peter Jackson’s Wingnut AR studio, showed off an entire battle overlaid over the auditorium. AR is an interesting technology, but it has yet to find a killer app. Pokémon Go seemed to be the app, but its luster has quickly faded. However, if Apple ever did develop a car, AR could be an essential technology. Where is iOS Going? -- iOS 11 has no marquee feature, but that’s not really a problem. As with many recent iOS releases, iOS 11 instead provides a series of refinements, many of which should improve the user experience in real ways. We’ll be poring over the beta releases in the next few months to find and share the most useful of these changes. If there is one central thread, it’s that of artificial intelligence, as Siri becomes more robust and better integrated throughout iOS and independent apps. It’s clear that, for Apple, this is a year to establish the building blocks necessary for whatever comes next in technology.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Jay  2017-06-06 02:15 DND in car: It's not easy to confirm someone's a driver in a car. You could just as easily be on public transit, air (as long as devices can be on), or even riding in a skyscraper elevator, besides just being a passenger in a car. People will learn to keep DND off. Drivers already have the choice to not respond to texts or calls and check them later. Making it another toggle for DND is no different than silencing the device and putting it away. If it's acceptable for a driver to have messages read aloud by a passenger, or to talk to another person in the car, then it's no appreciable difference to engage in the same activity via carplay or Siri by handsfree device or BT connection. Often enroute messages or calls are received about changes in plans, updates to arrival ETAs, and the like. What IOS devices might do is record video of what's happening in the car at the time of communication, and either interpret that activity (and limit it) or save +/or cloud upload for forensic analysis. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-06 11:45 The simple fact is that too many people use their iPhones when driving now, despite the fact that there are plenty of ways of NOT using them. So I think it's a very good move on Apple's part to build in an optional technology that could prevent much of this use. We'll see how good it is about detecting actual car use, but connecting to a Bluetooth car system or moving horizontally at car-like speeds should be possible to detect with decent accuracy. And Apple was very clear about how there's an override for passengers, plus a way for people to break through the cone of silence for urgent messages. So I think it's an entirely positive feature, at least based on what we know now. Reply Scott M.   2017-06-09 02:42 I agree it is positive, but agree with the original commenter's basic gist...I just don't know how positive it will really be since it is optional and can likely easily be bypassed. After all, there is a very simple and elegant solution now for the issue of things like reading texts/using your phone in the car now...it is call DO NOT DO IT. But, since the "DO NOT DO IT" option is optional and easily bypassed, most people do not employ it. So, Apple's approach might help some, but it still is optional and likely can be easily bypassed (due to the dilemma of the "need" to still allow passengers to use their phones), so it is entirely proper to wonder how effective it really will be. Do not get me wrong, I think it is a good thing to have. I just don't know how much it will really help. But, then any improvement is better than none. So, even if just one person enables that feature that actively used their phone while driving before, then it is worth it. Reply dshelbyd   2017-06-06 12:16 The new feature that stuck me as "killer" from the perspective of iOS productivity is the file manager. I hope that it will provide expanded options to solve the "Where can I put this?" or "Where did it go?" questions. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 14:23 I really like what I'm hearing so far about iOS 11. Refine things, but don't add to the feature bloat. Focus on adding iPad features that specifically leverage those devices' larger size and their use while improving already sufficient functionality on the iPhone side. This sounds like Snow Leopard for iOS and I really like that. I read elsewhere about the option to use Siri 'silently', i.e. by typing/reading. I would appreciate that a lot as I currently don't want to use (loud) Siri. Can anybody confirm? I enjoyed reading about improvements to Photos too. Any idea if users will get some kind of control over what 'special' albums get displayed? I'm not interested in groupings such as People, Selfies, Screenshots, etc. But iOS 10 offers no way to hide these. Any changes with iOS 11? Reply Josh Centers   2017-06-06 16:09 Yes, it appears that you can type to Siri in iOS 11. I'm super excited about that! Not sure about the albums yet. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 16:36 Thanks, Josh. If you type to Siri, will she also reply silently, i.e. with text on the screen? Reply Robert Morrison  2017-06-06 18:57 The feature is designed as an accessibility feature for people with low or no hearing, so I would assume that the feature supports fully silent use. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 19:20 Great. Thanks, Robert. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 14:16 (cont.) I think the Maps improvements are awesome. Speed limits and lane guidance are two of the three remaining features I preferred about my expensive GPS app (offline maps being the third). But since I so much prefer Maps' graphics and its audio directions to my GPS app, I've been anxious to switch to Maps for driving full time. Looks like it will finally happen with iOS 11. :) Any idea about other Maps improvements? Trails in national parks for example still seem to be much better represented in Google Maps? Any news if Apple is also improving walking/transit instead of just focusing on roads and driving? Reply Josh Centers   2017-06-06 16:10 I would imagine other improvements are happening continuously at the back end. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 14:21 (cont.) Finally, while I understand where Apple is coming from by disabling old 32 bit apps, it does mean I will lose my beloved encrypted notes storage app Firebox. Can anybody make good suggestions for a secure encrypted notes app? I know Notes offers encryption, but my understanding is these encrypted notes get sync'ed over iCloud and I'd prefer using a totally local encrypted storage on a single device of my own (even if that means no cross-device syncing). I don't trust loading my most secret information up to iCloud - encrypted or not. Especially not these days - FBI, Patriot Act, circumventing privacy rights, etc. (I back up to my Mac too, not iCloud). Reply Josh Centers   2017-06-06 16:10 You can store notes in Notes locally. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 16:39 That's true. But can I mix locally stored notes and iCloud-synced notes? For simple stuff like grocery lists I don't mind syncing to my other devices over iCloud. In fact, I use it a lot. In my notes list, I only see one available iCloud account. Reply Robert Morrison  2017-06-06 19:04 Yes. The "folder" of notes can be on iCloud or on your device. You can't mix messages within a folder, but entire folders are what they are. Also, moving notes between categories with different storage settings have been difficult historically. Try making a new folder and it should ask whether you want it to iCloud sync. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 20:00 Now I see. Thanks! I had to activate the "on my phone" account first in settings. Then I can create notes only on the iPhone. I suspect I can then create an encrypted note on that account to keep it local to the device. Reply gastropod  2017-06-07 18:26 If you store locally, is there any way to get them out as Notes files (packages?), and move them to Notes on a different device? Thanks Reply Simon  2017-06-06 14:42 Any idea what kind of iPhone/iPad hardware will be required for HEVC/H.265 hardware encoding support? VLC on iOS can obviously do more formats than those built in to iOS, but you really notice the battery life take a hit when things aren't hardware accelerated. Edit: I just noticed Apple had originally advertised using HEVC on iPhone 6 for FaceTime. Does that indicate an iPhone 6 should be able to do hardware decoding of HEVC material under iOS 11? Reply Minus van Baalen  2017-06-07 05:10 Upgrading or not? This is going to become a dilemma! There are more downsides than andvatages for me it seems (there are quite a few 32-bit apps that I use on a daily basis). What is Apple's policy regarding security updates for older iOSs? Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-07 10:00 With iOS, Apple hasn't provided security updates for older versions at all, as far as I can remember. So you'll want to upgrade at some point for security reasons. Reply Scott M.   2017-06-09 02:48 I want to say that Apple has provided an update (don't recall if it is was a security update or bug update or both) to an older version once or twice after a new iOS version came out, but it was typically only for older devices that could NOT run the new iOS version. I remember this frustrating me on a device that I had not upgraded to the new iOS version yet (I typically wait a bit so that Apple can beta test on other people), but there was an update to the older iOS version that I could not get as the new iOS update was the only thing offered. Reply Simon  2017-06-07 17:21 Has there been any indication so far that iOS 11 might allow prioritization for wifi networks like macOS does? Reply Harry Ewasiuk  2017-06-09 16:05 I have a iPhone 6S and am wondering if I'll be able to enjoy all the bells and whistles of iOS 11 and, if not, which features will be compromised by the 6S' hardware. It would be really nice if an article on iOS 11 could be published outlining which features function without compromise, which features are compromised, and which features are non functional. This would also be useful in deciding when to upgrade hardware. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-09 16:27 iOS 11 will run on the iPhone 6s, but it's too early to know if there will be any real-world slowdowns. That can't be determined until we're fairly close to release. Reply To leave a comment, click Add a Comment and then enter the text, your name, and your email address (which won't be displayed).

The developer of the app, Pepe Scream, received an email from an Apple app review employee saying the “your app contains images and references of Pepe the Frog, which are considered objectionable content." Read: Trump Leaks: Michael Moore Launches TrumpiLeaks Website For Admin Whistleblowers App Store icon Photo: PhotoAtelier/Flickr Pepe Scream was rejected by Apple for violating section 1.1 of Apple's App Store Review Guidelines, which states that apps "should not include content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, or in exceptionally poor taste." “My friend and I came up with the idea of combining sh--posting with autistic screeching, so we made this just for fun,” the developer said on Reddit. “But when we tried to release to the App Store, we got hit with 'Your app contains images and references of Pepe the Frog, which are considered objectionable content.' This is pretty stupid, because we spent a ton of hours trying to get this to work on iOS and spent $99 on the developer license, and now we can’t even post it to the App Store.” The developer pointed out that the app is live in Google’s Play Store, which also houses other Pepe the Frog apps, including Pepe Snap, Rare Pepe Clicker, Flappy Pepe and Pepe Button. Read: Apple Takes Down Drone Notification App 'Metadata' From App Store -- Again Pepe Scream isn’t the first Pepe app Apple has rejected. Last October, the App Store denied Build the Wall: The Game, also over objectionable content. The game lets users build President Donald Trump’s wall and features Pepe the Frog. Apple could have rejected those apps because Pepe the Frog is seen as a hate sign. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a nonprofit that fights anti-Semitism, listed the character as a “general hate symbol.” "The majority of uses of Pepe the Frog have been, and continue to be, non-bigoted,” said ADL in a post. “The number of ‘alt right’ Pepe memes has grown, a tendency exacerbated by the controversial and contentious 2016 presidential election. Though Pepe memes have many defenders, the use of racist and bigoted versions of Pepe memes seems to be increasing, not decreasing.” Meanwhile, Apple CEO Tim Cook poked fun at Trump’s early morning tweeting habit. During his commencement speech at MIT Friday, Cook said he’ll “never figure out” how the school’s students “have obviously taken over the president's Twitter account." "I can tell college students are behind it, because most of the tweets happen at 3 a.m.," Cook said as the audience laughed.   Apple has been at odds with Trump recently. The company criticized the administration over the Trump’s travel ban. Cook  also said Trump made the wrong decision regarding the Paris climate agreement. “I think it’s not in the best interest of the United States what he decided,” Cook told Bloomberg. “My view is that first and foremost things are about, can you help your country and if you can help your country and you do that by interacting, then you do it. The country eclipses politics.” Join the Discussion Most Read The Newsletter Exclusive articles delivered to your inbox daily.

The new guidelines, updated to accommodate App Store policies that will go into effect when iOS 11 is available, will require app developers to begin using Apple’s official in-app rating interface instead of their own custom prompts. Read: iOS 10.3 Update: Apple Will Allow Developers To Respond To App Store Reviews Apple's App Store will now disallow app makers from constantly asking for reviews. Photo: ParampreetChanana/Pixabay The change, which will be required for all apps going forward, will prohibit app makers from prodding users to leave a review with regular pop ups. Instead, the App Store rating API (application program interface), which allows for limited review requests, will be mandatory for all iOS apps. The rule, found in section 1.1.7 of the App Store Review Guidelines posted by Apple, reads as follows: “Use the provided API to prompt users to review your app; this functionality allows customers to provide an App Store rating and review without the inconvenience of leaving your app, and we will disallow custom review prompts.” The text leaves little wiggle room for developers who want to continue to be persistent in the pursuit of reviews. Undoubtedly, the change will be a welcome one for most users who get inundated with asks to give an app a rating on the scale of one to five stars. With the Apple API, developers are only allowed to ask for a review three times a year. Read: iOS 11 Beta: 5 Features We're Excited To Use On The New iPhone If a user chooses to leave a review, the app has to wait for at least a full year and after a new version of the app has been released before it can ask the user to review it again—a feature developers my find too restrictive and make it difficult to get feedback on new features. On the plus side for developers, using Apple’s official interface for reviews also may increase the response rate because the review prompt allows the user to leave a review without leaving the app. Custom, in-app prompts used by developers require the user to move over to the App Store to leave a review, a solution that may yield feedback but also pulls the user out of the app itself in order to do so. The new rules will also give users more control over whether they even want to be asked to leave reviews. Within the Settings app for iOS, there is a feature that allows a user to block the review prompts entirely. To block review requests from ever appearing on screen again, users can open the Settings app and scroll down to the iTunes & App Store menu. From here, find the In-App Ratings & Reviews menu, where users should see a switch. Turn the switch off and review requests will be suppressed entirely.

Asks UBS UBS strategists ponder whether the so-called F.A.A.M.G. stocks -- Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google (Alphabet) -- have staying power after driving a good chunk of the broad market's returns this year. By Tiernan Ray Updated June 9, 2017 5:15 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large The Nasdaq Composite Index’s nearly 2% drop today, which took down names across the spectrum, from Apple (AAPL) to Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) to Oclaro (OCLR) to Facebook (FB), had at least a couple catalysts among sell-side equity research. As my colleague Crystal Kim posted earlier, Godlman Sachs’s Robert Boroujerdi notes the group of F.A.N.G. names — Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon (AMZN), and Netflix  (NFLX), though he re-christens them “FAAMG” to include Microsoft (MSFT) — are starting to show “min vol characteristics.” By which he seems to mean that crowding into the stocks of the four top tech names is leading to “positioning extremes." (Crystal notes in a separate post that ETFs for semiconductors took a bath today, including the PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Portfolio (PSI), down 4.8%. The SPDR S&P Semiconductor (XSD), down 4.3%, and the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX), off 4.2%. Another note today raises concerns for tech. UBS strategists Julian Emanuel and Omar Elangbawy note that the five of the F.A.A.M.G. have contributed one third of the S&P 500’s year-to-date gain. They write that such phenomena of “clustering” is not unusual, but it does raise the “Trillion-dollar question” of whether you should stay with tech. Their conclusion is that in the “near term,” the current low level of volatility in the techs can’t last, and you would be forgiven for taking “protection” in the form of Put contracts.  But, they both think that growth in earnings, reasonable valuations, and cash eligible for repatriation are “reasons to expect tech to continue to outperform." If you’re looking for a reason to sell, they offer that Apple hitting $1 trillion in market cap, or perhaps doing a very large acquisition — like the Time Warner/AOL deal in 2000 — could be “guideposts for curbing technology enthusiasm.

Anita Balakrishnan | @MsABalakrishnan 9 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Trading Nation: Big drop for Apple, NASDAQ    12 Hours Ago | 02:35 U.S. stock markets punished tech stocks on Friday, and big tech names saw the worst of it. The so-called "big five" — Apple, Alphabet Class A shares, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon — lost more than $97.5 billion in market value between the close on Thursday and the close on Friday, according to FactSet, dragging the Nasdaq to its worst week of the year. Shares of Apple fell nearly 4 percent on Friday, while the other four companies fell more than 3 percent. For most of the day, only 3 stocks in the S&P 500 tech sector were in the green: IBM, Teradata and Western Union. Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet all traded more than 2 times their 30-day average volume. It's a rare down day for a sector that's soared this year. The technology select sector SPDR ETF (XLK) is still up nearly 16 percent so far this year, while the information technology sector is the leading gainer in the S&P 500, up more than 18.5 percent. Getty Images Cars drive by the Nasdaq headquarters in New York City. "They're just plain overbought," said David Bahnsen, founder, managing director and chief investment officer of The Bahnsen Group, a private wealth management firm. "They are extremely stretched from a valuation standpoint." The high-flying sector has made investors jittery with "valuation anxiety," The New York Times noted this week. Goldman analysts wrote that the tech sector momentum "has built a valuation air pocket." "There is a sense that a lot of investors think there's safety there," Bahnsen told CNBC's "Closing Bell" on Friday. "A lot of managers are afraid to not own these names, and I can understand that." Still, the Dow Jones industrial index closed at a record high, and the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) was on track for its best week of the year. "You just have to wait until these big — I don't know if it's ETF-driven or index-driven — sell-offs create some buying opportunities," Tim Lesko, principal and portfolio manager at Granite Investment Advisors, told "Closing Bell" on Friday. — Reporting by CNBC's Patti Domm, Chris Hayes, Fred Imbert and Robert Hum.

Tech stocks plunge Posted: Friday, June 9, 2017 4:24 PM EDT Updated: Friday, June 9, 2017 4:25 PM EDT Tech stocks took a hit after a Goldman Sachs analyst questioned this year's run-up in the industry's five biggest names -- Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet -- the parent company of Google. By Paul R. La Monica NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Tech stocks took a hit after a Goldman Sachs analyst questioned this year's run-up in the industry's five biggest names -- Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet -- the parent company of Google. The Nasdaq, which hit an all-time high Friday morning, fell nearly 2% by the end of the day. The tech wreck put a dent in the performance of the Dow, which includes Microsoft and Apple, and the S&P 500. The Dow and S&P had also hit records earlier as investors shrugged off worries about the British election and about fired FBI director James Comey's testimony on President Trump and Russia. But the market resilience was replaced by worries that the tech sector could be due for a collapse. Goldman Sachs analyst Robert Boroujerdi took a close look at the Nasdaq's five leading stocks and compared their recent performance with how other big tech stocks fared during the bubble period of 1999 and early 2000. His verdict? Giant tech companies today are cheaper than their counterparts were 17 years ago, a time when the biggest names included Cisco, Oracle, Intel and Lucent (now part of Nokia), as well as Microsoft. Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google -- which Boroujerdi dubbed FAAMG -- also have more cash and are generating greater cash flow than the leaders from 2000. (FAAMG is not to be confused with FANG, which many traders still use as a fun acronym to describe four top techs. They swap out Apple and Microsoft and add either Netflix or chip giant Nvidia.) But Boroujerdi is concerned that today's tech leaders aren't as profitable as their counterparts from 2000. Another worry: The biggest five techs have an outsized impact on the overall market, just as tech leaders did in 2000. The top five techs today account for 13% of the market value weighting in the S&P 500, even though they are only 1% of the companies in the index. The top five techs made up about 16% of the S&P 500 in 2000. "The recent run in large-cap tech stocks has evoked memories (nightmares?) for some investors of the last euphoric NASDAQ run," Boroujerdi wrote. The good news is that techs are financially healthier than they were in 2000, thanks in large part to all that cash. And Boroujerdi acknowledged that the stocks are much cheaper now than they used to be. Still, investors hit the panic button Friday. Apple was down 4%. Amazon, Google and Facebook each fell about 3%. Microsoft dipped 2%. Netflix and Nvidia, which was the top performer in the S&P 500 in 2016 and has surged again this year, dropped 5% and 6.5% respectively. All these stocks are still up sharply this year, mainly because of strong earnings growth. So it remains to be seen whether the selloff is a classic case of bored traders grasping at straws on a sleepy almost-summer Friday or the beginning of a correction -- or, worse, another bear market -- for the tech sector.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | June 9, 2017 -- 20:45 GMT (13:45 PDT) | Topic: Apple Apple this week announced Business Chat, a tool that enables people to connect with businesses via Apple Messages. Customers can use Business Chat to ask questions, get customer support and make transactions on their iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch. While other messaging platforms, like Facebook's Messenger and WhatsApp, offer customer support systems, Business Chat could appeal to enterprises all in on iOS. The tool lets users find businesses with Safari, Maps, Spotlight and Siri. Additionally, users pay for purchases via Business Chat with Apple Pay, and they can schedule appointments and deliveries using a built-in scheduling app. Businesses can give customers options within Business Chat using its built-in list app. They can also use Business Chat to prompt customers to download their custom-built iMessage app. Meanwhile, a handful of companies have already integrated their customer service platforms with Business Chat, including LivePerson, Salesforce, Nuance and Genesys. Through the integration of Nuance's Digital Customer Engagement Platform, businesses can use Nuance Live or Asynchronous Chat to connect with customers, or Nuance's AI-powered Nina Virtual Assistant. With Nina, only around 20 percent or less of incoming customer messages have to be routed to a contact center agent. "While Siri made the virtual assistant mainstream, the ability to start a chat session with businesses using Messages is positioned to turn message-based customer service into the dominant way consumers engage with brands," Robert Weideman, executive vice president and general manager, for Nuance's enterprise division, said in a statement.

Apple unveils Business Chat, which brings customer service and shopping into iMessage Posted 10 hours ago by Anthony Ha (@anthonyha) 0 SHARES Next Story AR startup Meta sues former head of optics over trade secrets theft Apple just unveiled Business Chat, its bid to turn iMessage into a communication platform that can compete with Facebook Messenger – and perhaps, make iMessage one of the main ways you interact with businesses. The company quietly announced the service earlier this week with an update to its developer site, but few details were available at the time. Today was the real introduction, with a session at Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference. Business Chat will be part of iOS 11, allowing individuals to open an iMessage window from Safari, Maps, Spotlight, or Siri, and start a conversation with a business. Those conversations will include basic text chats, but Apple is also offering support and structure for more complex interactions, like scheduling an appointment. In fact, Business Chat may be the most promising opportunity for iMessage’s App Store. The idea is that businesses can include some of their app capabilities within a chat. For example, Apple showed off a conversation where the consumer could actually choose their airline seat without having to open a separate app. Business Chat will be integrated with other customer service products — the initial partners are LivePerson, Salesforce, Nuance and Genesys. In the case of LivePerson, CEO Robert LoCascio told me that businesses will be able manage their Business Chat conversations alongside their other customer service messages from within the LivePerson product. Ultimately, LoCascio said, LivePerson’s goal is to “eliminate” voice interactions when it comes to customer service and sales. Business Chat moves the industry closer to that goal, he said — the key is that the conversations are fully encrypted, allowing companies to include “real business processes”. And since Business Chat includes support for Apple Pay, that means customers can actually browse and buy products from within the chat. “I really think this changes how consumers are engaging with businesses,” LoCascio said. And while much of the discussion around Facebook Messenger has centered on chatbots, LivePerson’s Rurik Bradbury argued that Apple is “focused on trying to create a human experience.” There’s the simple fact that the customer, not the business, has to initiate the conversation. Plus, Bradbury said the launch version of Business Chat is limited to human-to-human conversations, no chatbots involved (though of course Apple could add chatbot support in the future). Apple is now allowing developers and businesses to test and create integrations with Business Chat. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Founded 1976 Overview Apple is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications.

Author Carter Dotson Posted On2017-06-09 17:00:25 News Apple made some changes to the App Store Review guidelines, and a modified portion of section 3.2.2, talking about unacceptable business models for apps. And a particular change to the wording has developers worried about whether or not Apple just killed incentivized video ads. Consider the text of 3.2.2 (vi), which says (emphasis added): Apps should allow a user to get what they’ve paid for without performing additional tasks, such as posting on social media, uploading contacts, checking in to the app a certain number of times, etc. Apps should not require users to rate the app, review the app, watch videos, download other apps, tap on advertisements, or take other similar actions in order to access functionality, content, use the app, or receive monetary or other compensation. Now take a look at what it said before, as shown by AppStoreReviewGuidelinesHistory.com, a site that is exactly what it says on the tin (new text in green, removed text in red): The problem is that there are several ways to interpret this. The worst reading is that incentivized ad rewards are now verboten. Apple's done it before back in 2014 before changing course. The thing is that incentivized video ads now are a huge business model for developers, especially smaller shops, that banning them would be a deathblow. That, and apps that Apple loves like Crossy Road [Free] have made it a major part of their business. It seems crazy that Apple would kill off a major revenue model in one fell swoop with a single line...but it is Apple. Now, the thing is that there are more benign interpretations. One could interpret this rule as making it so that a character unlock in a game can't be done by forcing people to watch an ad or post to Facebook, that there has to be an alternative option. The problem is that the wording is very unclear, and the collective response of industry people I asked for their thoughts on this can be summed up as ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ – nobody knows, and until Apple clarifies or starts striking down apps for violating the rule, things could get really interesting. And if this is an incentivized video ban, this could have a colossal effect on the mobile advertising industry. Or it isn't, and it's just trying to make apps a little more user-friendly! Or maybe not! We're all confused! Hat tip to Jeff "Papa Bear" Scott for pointing this out! 'The Mummy Dark Universe Stories' Will be Developed by the Studio Behind 'Oxenfree' and 'Mr. Robot' 'Twin Moon Galaxy' Is an Upcoming Sci-fi Turn-Based RPG D3ATHST3P I hope this isn’t the case. I’d rather have an option to watch video adverts for a tiny reward than have them forced on me. Is Apple high? Do they really want every free2play game forcing adverts on players? http://www.k3vin.net t3rminus Or you could just pay a small amount of real currency money to enjoy your games instead of selling little bits of your brain capacity and your "only-once" time on earth. Those 15 seconds add up, you know. If you paid up front, instead of having to watch video ads, you could be playing fun games at your own pace and leisure that aren't time-delayed or locked behind obnoxious videos that only advertise more games like the one you're playing in some kind of never-ending f2p circle-jerk. Severed Oh wow this could be a giant game changer. houseofg Ba dum dum... *rim shot* MajesticLobster I sure hope this cripples "free" apps that exploit users. It might actually make premium apps viable. Watching an ad is not free. It consumes time...the one one resource you will never have more of and contributes to a culture of ubiquitous advertising. repapermunky While I like the idea of premium games better as well, I don't think you understand the scope of what would happen to the AppStore if interpreted in that manner. Many developers who make awesome games may not be able to survive any longer due to that, and we would be the ones losing. And believe me, I HATE F2P. To the fellow below about wording, I hope that's he case. dancj The wording specifically refers to getting what you pay for - so it's possible that this rule will only apply to paid games - in which case, I approve. houseofg Great point. Psac42 One game I'm playing has a character that can be gotten only by inviting 10 friends on FB, and no other way whatsoever. This would be in violation of that rule. db2 God, I hope so. HelperMonkey As I read what already exists in 3.1.1: "If you want to unlock features or functionality within your app, (example: in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content...), you must use an in-app purchase. ... Apps may not include buttons, external links, [etc] that direct customers to purchasing methods other than IAP." It seems like a button or external link (like a video ad) that would unlock currencies or premium content is already prohibited. So, you know... Apple. tekott The first line, sounds like it applies only to paid games. Thats mean once we paid for the game, there should not be ads, video, and such which we need to see to or click to open content.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Why Apple, Rite Aid, and NVIDIA Slumped Today These stocks led the market lower. Find out why. Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Jun 9, 2017 at 4:30PM The stock market finished the week on a negative note on Friday, and much of the decline came late in the afternoon trading session. After having weathered fallout from the shocking defeat of U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party in Thursday's elections, major benchmarks started to lose ground, and the Nasdaq Composite eventually fell more than 2% before recovering somewhat in the final minutes of the day. Investors seemed ready for a rotation out of the high-flying tech sector into lagging parts of the market, and that showed up in precipitous declines for some of the best-known stock names late Friday, even as the Dow gained ground. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Rite Aid (NYSE:RAD), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly. Apple falls from the tree Shares of Apple dropped 4% in the wake of concerns about whether it will be able to deliver on promises for future product launches. Many investors are waiting impatiently for news on the iPhone 8 upgrade, and rumors have surfaced about a potential delay in when the 10th anniversary edition of the groundbreaking mobile device will be released to the public. In addition, a newer report suggested that performance of the iPhone modem could face competitive disadvantages. Yet with Apple stock having climbed so sharply in recent months, it's not surprising to see a quick pullback after a long run higher. Even with today's decline, Apple appears poised to keep benefiting from its popular consumer products for years to come. Image source: Apple. Rite Aid gets bad news Rite Aid stock plunged 15% in the wake of reports that seemed to confirm that the company's proposed acquisition by Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) will not pass antitrust scrutiny. Those following the transaction now believe that the Federal Trade Commission will reject the deal, even after the two companies have worked hard to find ways to address previous concerns and divest substantial parts of their combined store network. Share of both Rite Aid and Walgreens have already responded negatively to anticipation of such a decision, but what's interesting is that Rite Aid shares have now dropped below where they traded before the merger was initially announced. Some might see that as a bargain opportunity, but negative sentiment could carry Rite Aid stock down further before value investors swoop in to take advantage of the cheap shares. NVIDIA gets a negative review Finally, shares of NVIDIA finished down over 6%. The high-flying chipmaker found itself the subject of negative comments from short-seller Andrew Left of Citron Research, who said that numerous analyst upgrades have turned the stock into a vehicle for gambling among traders. Although Left acknowledges that NVIDIA's graphic processing chip franchise has substantial growth potential and could help drive further advances for the company as well, potential competition does exist that could hurt NVIDIA's pace of revenue gains going forward. Despite the drop, shares have still tripled in less than a year, and NVIDIA's promise in fast-growing areas like self-driving vehicles could become the catalyst for further long-term gains.

[Photo: courtesy of Apple] By Jared Newman6 minute Read The Apple Watch was supposed to be more than just a fancy fitness tracker with fashionable wrist straps when it launched in 2015. As Apple executives explained at the time, this device was supposed to save us from our phones, making our digital lives more efficient while keeping us engaged with the real world. advertisement Things didn’t quite work out that way, as the Watch’s non-fitness elements proved less compelling than Apple imagined. Consequently, the product’s direction has changed dramatically over the past two years. With the Watch Series 2, Apple made fitness the primary selling point, and last year’s WatchOS 3 update overhauled the entire interface, demoting unpopular features and de-emphasizing third-party apps. WatchOS 4, the upcoming software update that Apple announced this week, doesn’t seem like a major shift by comparison, at least not on the surface. But beyond its obvious new features–like a new Siri watch face, better workout tracking, and the ability to grab exercise data from gym equipment–WatchOS 4 brings lots of behind-the-scenes changes, especially for third-party apps. Together, they add up to a significant change that could bring the Apple Watch much closer to its original promise. Faster Apps Third-party apps on the Apple Watch used to be mostly worthless. Navigating through WatchOS to reach them was a chore, and the apps themselves were so unresponsive that taking out your phone was almost always faster and easier. WatchOS 4 aims to be a breakthrough for standalone apps. Although Apple has allowed third-party apps to run directly on the watch since WatchOS 2, the next update will combine each app’s code and interface elements into a single process that loads at runtime. Native apps should automatically become smoother, more responsive to the touch, and faster at loading new screens as a result. “This is going to make a huge difference in the performance of your apps,” Ian Parks, who works on the WatchOS software team, told developers during a presentation at Apple’s WWDC. Apple is also making a few tweaks to alleviate the Watch’s navigation woes. Users will be able to sort the app dock by recency, instead of having to pick favorites, and the home screen will offer a list view as an alternative to the cumbersome honeycomb grid. Another change seems more subtle, but elicited cheers from developers at WWDC: Apps that use a horizontal page layout can launch on any page, not just the left-most one. If you’ve ever swiped right on a smartphone app to pull up a menu, this will allow Watch apps to have a similar layout. The redesigned dock can be sorted in order of recent apps. Meanwhile, Apple is trying to streamline its own apps as an example for developers to follow. Apple’s Workout app, for instance, will allow users to launch new exercises from within existing ones. And by default, those exercises will use whatever goal the user had set previously. What used to involve a half-dozen steps will instead require just a couple of taps. advertisement “This is a great example of building a responsive user experience, where it’s not just about updating the data in your UI, it’s also about thinking of what the user might want to do next in your app based on what you already know,” Parks said during his developer presentation. Smarter Apps Aside from improving performance, Apple is also letting Watch app developers pull some new tricks. For instance, they’ll be able to gather location data in the background, then use sounds or haptic feedback to announce when something important happens. A mapping app might be able to signal upcoming turns this way, and an augmented reality game (think Pokémon Go) could alert users to nearby activity. WatchOS 4 streamlines the behavior of third-party apps to make them run faster, as shown in this slide from a WWDC presentation. Apple is also extending background privileges for audio recording, allowing apps to capture sound while the watch screen is off. If you can imagine a music app for recording jam sessions with a built-in haptic metronome, or one that delivers spoken translations in real time, WatchOS 4 will enable them in a way that doesn’t destroy battery life. Similar to WatchOS 4’s performance improvements, one of the most significant feature changes seems mundane on its face: Upon request, Apps can remain in an open state for up to eight minutes instead of the default two minutes, and then close once a given task is complete. Picture a shopping list that continues to pop up when you raise your wrist–but only until all the items are checked off–or a ride-sharing app that updates the driver’s location through to the time of arrival. WatchOS 4 will help avoid instances in which the app has closed, and users have to navigate back to it from the home screen. “This is something we are really excited about, and I think it’s going to change the way that we think about creating our Watch apps,” Parks said. Freedom From The Phone Even with WatchOS 4’s app improvements, many apps still won’t fully function without a nearby iPhone. But while rumors of an Apple Watch with cellular connectivity have circulated for more than year, Apple may not need to go that far to make its smartwatch less iPhone-dependent. advertisement The Apple Watch can already run some standalone apps and make payments through Apple Pay without a data connection, and it can use Wi-Fi networks for connectivity when a paired iPhone isn’t in range. With WatchOS 4, Apple is taking that independence a step further by letting the Watch connect directly to nearby Bluetooth devices. Tim Bajarin, the president of analyst firm Creative Strategies, says this is of great interest to him personally. Bajarin is diabetic, and has a device implanted on his stomach that measures blood sugar and transmits the data to his iPhone via Bluetooth. WatchOS 4 will allow him to get that data directly through the Apple Watch. (Dexcom, which makes the glucose monitor that Bajarin uses, was one of the partners Apple highlighted for WatchOS 4’s Core Bluetooth functionality.) “That to me was really a big deal,” Bajarin says. “Now, if I leave my phone downstairs, and I go upstairs, it doesn’t matter, because I’m going to get that blood glucose reading on my Watch no matter what.” Core Bluetooth will let the Apple Watch connect directly to other fitness devices, such as smart surfboards. The Watch’s new Bluetooth features should also let users connect directly to more specialized health and exercise devices, such as EKG monitors, smart surfboards, golf-swing monitors, and tennis trackers. Down the road, Bajarin theorized that the Watch’s Bluetooth smarts could connect to future Apple wearable devices, such as augmented-reality glasses. “I feel that particular piece is an important technical building block that eventually makes the Apple Watch even more useful” to other products, he says. WatchOS 4’s ability to grab workout data from gym equipment could also foreshadow greater smartwatch independence. Outside of Apple Pay, it’s the first instance of Apple using the Watch’s near-field communication chip to interact with objects in the real world. Apple is already opening up NFC chip access on the iPhone in iOS 11, so it’s reasonable to think the watch may follow. “It does show you that Apple is thinking about much more aggressive use of NFC, and this is just another good example,” Bajarin says. advertisement For what it’s worth, Apple itself seems to be downplaying the potential for greatly improved apps in WatchOS 4. Many of the improvements mentioned here are practically a footnote on the company’s WatchOS preview site, and some don’t get mentioned at all. Fitness still reigns as the ultimate Apple Watch selling point, and probably will long into the future. But WatchOS 4 is the surest sign yet that the dream of saving us from our phones hasn’t died.

Morris Jun 09, 2017 Apple CEO Tim Cook struck a worried but hopeful tone today in his commencement speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He called on the graduates, likely including plenty of future tech leaders, to find purpose in their work by putting human needs front and center. But he also acknowledged society's struggles with technology's downsides. Cook began his 20-minute speech on an upbeat note, describing the common ground between his company and the venerable university. “MIT and Apple share so much. We both love hard problems. We love the search for new ideas, and we especially love finding those ideas, the really big ones, the ones that could change the world.” But Cook suggested that while MIT grads could expect to accomplish great things, a deep sense of meaning may be the hardest thing to achieve in the end. He described his own long struggle to answer the big questions: “Where’s all this going . . . What is my purpose?” Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. “I kept convincing myself that it was just over the horizon, around the next corner,” he said. But through 15 years of career advancement, meditation, and religious and philosophical quests, Cook said, “nothing worked, and it was really tearing me apart.” Cook found his answer when he joined Apple in 1998 under CEO Steve Jobs. He connected instantly with the company’s uniquely clear and decisive mission. “It was just that simple: serve humanity. It was in that moment, after 15 years of searching, something clicked,” Cook said. To illustrate that mission and its challenges, he told a more recent story about rebuffing a shareholder who objected to Apple’s unprofitable environmental initiatives. According to Cook, he ultimately told the critic that he "shouldn’t own Apple stock.” Cook called on the new MIT grads to marshal their skills to help tackle issues from cancer to inequality to climate change. But he cautioned that “technology alone isn’t the solution. And sometimes it’s even part of the problem.” Among the problems bred by technology, Cook cited were “threats to our security, threats to our privacy, fake news, and social media that becomes anti-social." He continued that, "Sometimes the very technology that is meant to connect us, divides us.” As an alternative, Cook reiterated Jobs’ frequent dictum that technology should be guided by the insights of the humanities and liberal arts. “If science is a search in the darkness,” said Cook, “then the humanities are a candle that shows us where we’ve been, and the danger that lies ahead.” Though the road ahead is fraught, Cook said he is “optimistic, because I believe in your generation, your passion, your journey.” Cook’s speech wasn’t all grim warnings and grand challenges. He also worked in mild jabs at both Windows computers and President Donald Trump, applauding MIT pranksters who had “obviously . . . taken over the President’s Twitter account. I can tell college students are behind it because most of the tweets happen at 3 a.m.” Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers © 2017 Time Inc.

Tech Search Search NSANSA Backtracks on Sharing Number of Americans Caught In Warrantless Spying Fortune 500Silicon Valley Isn’t The Only Out-Of-Touch Tech Bubble TelevisionNearly 20 Million Viewers Watched James Comey’s Senate Testimony TwitterTwitter Account of Journalist, Activist Hacked to Spread Fake News Apple Why Tech Stocks Crashed Friday Aaron Pressman Jun 09, 2017 Top performing technology stocks plummeted on Friday afternoon after a leading investment bank warned that share prices of companies like Apple, Amazon, and Facebook had risen too quickly. At the close of trading, shares of Apple were down 4%, lopping more than $30 billion from the market capitalization of the world's most valuable company. Shares of Google parent Alphabet were down 3%, as were shares of Facebook and Amazon. Microsoft slipped 2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index, which is dominated by the five stocks, was down almost 2%. Investors have been growing increasingly uneasy about the skyrocketing value of the largest tech companies, but Friday's sell-off appears to have been sparked by a report from Goldman Sachs chief investment officer Robert Bouroujerdi warning of the growing risks on those five leading tech stocks. Almost 40% of the gain in the entire Standard & Poor's 500 Index this year is attributable to the five tech stocks, even though they make up only 13% of the index's market value, he wrote. "Five companies poised to dominate disruption – Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet – have added a total of $600 billion of market cap this year or the equivalent GDP of Hong Kong and South Africa combined," Bouroujerdi noted. "Parallels to the 'Nifty-fifty' and 1999-2000 are growing as their performance is even more pronounced on a risk-adjusted basis." Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. Other had been warning about the prominence of the big five for the past few weeks, comparing the situation to prior bubbles like the rise of Internet stocks in the late 1990s. At the end of May, Miller Tabak's analyst Matt Maley raised the comparison and wrote: "I just wonder how many people have said to themselves, 'If AMZN gets to $1,000, I’m going to take at least some profits.'"

[Photo: courtesy of Apple] By Mark Sullivan3 minute Read After mentioning its interest in augmented reality (AR) publicly on several occasions, Apple still managed to surprise many of us on Monday by announcing a new tool–ARKit–that will let developers create augmented reality experiences for the iPhone. advertisement This is a perfectly Apple way of entering a new tech space. Yes, plenty of big Apple platforms have launched the hardware, then later let developers create on it–iPhone, Apple Watch, Siri, tvOS, for example. But Apple is known for being patient and cautious about entering new tech areas, and leading with a development kit is just another way of doing that. Apple says the AR experiences that developers create will run on any iPhone with an A9 or later chip. The ARKit AR, in fact, is already starting to show up on Twitter. And, admittedly, they look impressive. Higher quality version on YouTube. https://t.co/1fzIg6Ghdh #ARKit — Cody Brown (@CodyBrown) June 7, 2017 “This is shot on a 6s,” says developer Cody Brown in a reply to the tweet. “Can only imagine what they will do with a better depth sensor.” Yep. I’m betting Apple’s real intent is to let developers start getting their feet wet developing AR for future iPhones that create better AR using more and better sensors. Developers, ultimately, are not going to be satisfied with the limitations imposed by the basic smartphone camera of most existing iPhones, which were built for taking photographs, not measuring 3D space (with the possible exception of the dual-camera iPhone 7 Plus). That’s why it makes sense that at least one of the new iPhones announced this fall will include a 3D sensor on the back to more accurately capture the fine layers of things situated closer or farther away from the camera. Only then can it place digital imagery within that environment in a convincing way. advertisement A key question is whether ARKit be used to create AR experiences that exceed the limitations of existing iPhones. Can ARKit create experiences that would look better with the help of an additional 3D sensor on the device they’re running on? Since developers are just getting their hands on the new SDK, it’s hard to know. But it would be strange for Apple to release a development kit that tied the quality of its product to the limitations of the existing consumption devices. Apple, if you haven’t noticed, isn’t shy about moving on to new and better technology standards, even at the expense of people who own older-generation devices. Anyway, here's a chameleon trying to catch bubbles. pic.twitter.com/RSSKV1nFYY — Paul Bronks (@virtuallydead) June 7, 2017 The new 3D sensor coming in the iPhone 8 (or “iPhone X” 10th anniversary edition) will be supplied, at least in part, by Lumentum. A recent channel check indicated that Lumentum will be supplying about half of the 3D sensors, while II-VI and possibly one other vendor will be proving the remainder. Until the announcement of ARKit on Monday, it was unclear whether the new 3D sensor would be located on the front of the phone for use in facial recognition (for unlocking the phone) or on the back of the phone for AR. Now it seems more clear that the sensor will be on the back of the phone. Releasing the SDK now will give developers ample time to create cool AR apps before the appearance of those new phones this fall. It’ll also allow a little more time for the general public (those who haven’t played Pokémon Go, anyway) to understand and warm up to the concept of AR. Of course Apple will develop some of its own native AR experiences, which will likely begin showing up in iOS 12. In Maps, for example, AR may be used to put digital place markers and other information within a sort of 3D “Street View” environment. Google has been working on AR for years with its Tango software. Apple is coming at AR from a very different angle, however. While Google has, so far, depended on partners like Lenovo to create phones with the multiple sensors needed to support AR, Apple brings its own consumption device with the iPhone. Because there are already hundreds of millions of iPhones in the wild that could run the ARKit apps, Apple says ARKit is already “the biggest AR platform in the world.” advertisement But claiming the biggest AR platform comes at the cost of lowering the threshold for admission, at least where the devices are concerned. ARKit experiences running on single-camera phones probably won’t be as good as those running on multiple-sensor phones (like Tango) or ones running on powerful dedicated devices (like Microsoft’s HoloLens and, potentially, Magic Leap). Apple, of course, won’t be comfortable with that competitive dynamic. It will want to build future iPhones for superior AR. And unless Apple has built software so magical that it can create great AR on existing single-camera iPhones, it’ll do that by adding new 3D sensors in the iPhone 8 and beyond.

Apple Evan Selleck Contributing Editor | June 9, 2017 0 shares 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0               Earlier this week, Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference officially kicked off with its keynote speech, where a variety of different Apple employees (and employees of other companies) took the stage to talk about what's new coming to Apple's software and devices. There was plenty to take in, with Apple rattling it all off at a pretty quick clip, but there were still some elements that didn't even get mentioned. There are a lot of new features in iOS, but one of them saw the light of day only after the keynote wrapped up. It's called "Offload Unused Apps," and it does exactly what the name implies. If you have a few apps on your phone that you might have wanted to use once, or maybe even used them a lot in the past, but have left them to squander on your device, this feature will take care of that for you. It works similarly to an implementation released in iOS 9 in 2015, and very similar to the way the company Nextbit handled cloud storage/on-device-apps for its Robin smartphone. Basically if you have an app (or apps) on your device that don't get used all that often, if ever, then the feature will automatically offload it from the iOS device -- but keep the documents and data on there. It does this so if you want to install that app again, the important bits are still there and ready to go. The apps that have been offloaded will appear grayed out on your device, and if you want to bring them back you just need to give the app icon a tap. iOS 11 users in the future will get to choose which apps they want to offload manually if they want, but the feature will also work automatically in the background depending on how much storage is remaining on your device. So, good news for devices with minimal storage. Storage space is always an important issue, so it's good to see Apple doing a lot with iOS 11 (including iCloud to help with other aspects of the software) to make it easier for people that might not have a phone with a ton of built-in storage. So instead of going the obvious route and asking how much storage you have on your phone, I'm going to go a more app-specific way. This upcoming feature actually made me think about all the apps I have on my phone, and go through what's there and find out what I actually don't use anymore. Unsurprisingly, there were a lot there. I mostly discovered that I've still got a ton of calculator apps on there, for whatever reason, and a lot of writing apps, too. A variety of different weather apps on there, too, because apparently I can never get enough of seeing how sunny it is out there. I deleted all of them, even ones I hesitated with and thought, "Well, maybe I'll use this again..." Because I know I really won't. I've got my favorite apps for those types of things, whether it's a built-in Apple stock app, or, usually, a third-party alternative. I love trying out new options, though, so I download a lot of them, and switch to something new if I can be convinced. Apparently, whatever the result, there's a straggler that gets left behind. What about you? How many apps do you have on your phone, and how many of those do you know you don't use on a regular basis? Do you find yourself deleting unused apps, or do you keep them around for whatever reason? Let me know!

In a commencement address, Cook _ who as Apple’s chief executive since 2011 has overseen the rollout of the iPhone 7 and the Apple Watch _ said the company is constantly looking for ways to combine tech with a sense of humanity and compassion. “Whatever you do in your life, and whatever we do at Apple, we must infuse it with the humanity that we are born with,” said Cook, who previously served as chief operating officer and headed the Macintosh division. “That responsibility is immense. But so is the opportunity,” he said. Cook said Apple wants to make products that help people. As examples, he cited iPhone technology that can help a blind athlete run a marathon and an iPad that connects an autistic child to the world around them. “When you keep people at the centre of what you do, it can impact,” he said. Cook said he isn’t worried about artificial intelligence giving computers the ability to think like humans. “I’m more concerned about people thinking like computers without values or compassion or concern for the consequences,” he said. “That is what we need you to help us guard against. Because if science is a search in the darkness, then the humanities are a candle that shows us where we have been and the danger that lies ahead.” Cook also urged graduates to resist becoming cynical. “The internet enabled so much and empowered so many, but it can also be a place where basic rules of decency are suspended and pettiness and negativity thrive,” he said. “Don’t let that noise knock you off course. Don’t get caught up in the trivial aspects of life. Don’t listen to trolls, and don’t become one. Measure impact in humanity; not in the likes, but the lives you touch and the people you serve.” Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Get our daily briefing on innovation, leadership, technology & the economy.

Macs & Mac OS X | 06 Jun 2017 | Print  | Comment (21) Apple Beefs Up iMac and MacBook Lines, Teases the iMac Pro by Adam C. Engst At WWDC 2017 today, Apple devoted a non-trivial segment of the keynote to new Mac hardware, showing off improved iMacs and performance-enhanced MacBook Pros and mentioning a speed bump to the MacBook Air in passing. After running through all the changes to today’s models, Apple gave a sneak preview of the iMac Pro, a workstation-class version of the 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display that’s scheduled to ship at the end of the year. No mention was made of the Mac mini or Mac Pro, though Apple has already said that the Mac Pro is in the middle of a major redesign that won’t be done until 2018 at the earliest (see “Maca Culpa: Apple Admits Mac Pro Missteps and Promises More Transparency,” 4 April 2017). iMac -- The workhorse of Apple’s desktop line has long been the iMac, which Apple continues to offer in three basic models: a 21.5-inch non-Retina version, a 21.5-inch iMac with 4K Retina display, and the 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display. On the CPU front, each model receives a speed bump thanks to Apple using Intel’s 7th generation “Kaby Lake” processors and increasing clock speeds. You can see the specifics on Apple’s Tech Specs page, but the summary is that Apple is focusing more effort on the 21.5 Retina iMac, offering just a single configuration of the non-Retina model. Benchmarks will show how much faster the combination of new CPUs and higher clock speeds will be, but I suspect purchases will mostly be based on price. Although the iMac Retina displays are already gorgeous, Apple claims to have improved them even more in both the 21.5-inch and 27-inch sizes, increasing brightness 43 percent to 500 nits and supporting display of up to 1 billion colors. The non-Retina iMac model drives its screen with the integrated Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, but all the Retina models now take advantage of Radeon Pro GPUs, the 555 and 560 for the 21.5-inch models and the 570, 575, and 580 models for the 27-inch models. The notable win here is for the 21.5-inch Retina models, which were previously limited to integrated Intel Iris Pro Graphics 6200. Apple has made the Fusion Drive standard in more configurations, and the company claims that the SSDs available in 256 GB, 512 GB, and 1 TB capacities are up to 50 percent faster. You can also configure the top-of-the-line 27-inch iMac with a 2 TB SSD for a whopping $1400. When it comes to RAM, all base models still ship with 8 GB. The non-Retina iMac and low-end 21.5 Retina model remain limited to 16 GB, but the high-end 21.5-inch Retina model can now take 16 GB or 32 GB, a welcome improvement. Similarly, the low-end 27-inch model still maxes out at 32 GB, but the two higher-end models can take 16 GB, 32 GB, or 64 GB. RAM in the 21.5-inch iMac models cannot be upgraded by the user, but you can install memory in the 27-inch model yourself. Unsurprisingly, Apple replaced the previous models’ Thunderbolt 2 ports with a pair of Thunderbolt 3 ports that support DisplayPort for external screens, Thunderbolt at up to 40 Gbps, USB 3.1 Gen 2 at up to 10 Gbps, and various other protocols via adapters (see “Explaining Thunderbolt 3, USB-C, and Everything In Between,” 3 November 2016). All these changes are welcome for anyone in the market for a new iMac. I doubt they’re significant enough to warrant trading in an existing Retina iMac, unless Thunderbolt 3 is a necessity. The most interesting changes are actually in the 21.5-inch models, which move past the RAM and graphics limitations of the previous configuration while introducing a cheaper config. The 21.5-inch non-Retina iMac remains priced at $1099, with the two Retina configurations starting at $1299 and $1499. The 27-inch model comes in three configurations: $1799, $1999, and $2299. They’re all available now. Perhaps I’m just boggled by the number of changes Apple announced in the WWDC keynote, but I couldn’t see how to give more context for the changes in relation to previous configurations because the matrix of what models get which build-to-order options was just too complicated. If you want to price out different possibilities, I recommend opening several browser windows so you can compare the configurations side by side. MacBook, MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air -- As with the iMac, Apple updated the processors in the MacBook and MacBook Pro with new Kaby Lake processors running at higher clock speeds. That should improve performance, although likely not by that much. The MacBook Pro models also get improved graphics processing, with the 13-inch MacBook Pro models using Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 and 650, and the 15-inch models switching to Radeon Pro 555 and 560 discrete GPUs on top of Intel HD Graphics 630 and 640. You can now buy a MacBook with 16 GB of RAM, up from the previous limit of 8 GB, and Apple claims that the MacBook’s onboard SSD is up to 50 percent faster. That might make the MacBook a more attractive option, given that lackluster performance was one of its main disadvantages. Despite rumors to the contrary, the MacBook Air lives, but it sees the least change, replacing its stock 1.6 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with a 1.8 GHz model. It remains upgradeable to an Intel Core i7 running at 2.2 GHz. Although these changes are all positive, they do nothing to simplify the difficulty of choosing between the three models. Each falls into the three-dimensional graph of price, performance, and size in a different spot. You’ll have to decide what’s most important to you — cost, speed, or portability — and figure out which of Apple’s notebooks best fits your needs. As with the new iMac models, these updated notebooks are all available now. iMac Pro -- During the private media meeting in which Apple executives confessed to the company’s sins with regard to the Mac Pro, mention was made of pro-related announcements about the iMac coming this year. Apple has now revealed more of what that means, pulling back the curtains on the iMac Pro. Due in December 2017, the iMac Pro retains the same form factor of the 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display, but swaps the brushed aluminum look for a space gray finish that extends to the Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad, Magic Mouse 2, and an optional Magic Trackpad 2. The goal of the iMac Pro is to provide workstation-class performance within the iMac design. The hardest part of that is dealing with heat, because the iMac Pro will feature Intel Xeon processors in 8-core, 10-core, or 18-core configurations. Also playing into the necessary thermal architecture redesign is Apple’s use of a new Radeon Pro Vega GPU, which reportedly features a next-generation compute core and up to 16 GB of on-package high-bandwidth memory (HBM2). Apple says that the iMac Pro with Vega GPU delivers up to 11 teraflops of single-precision compute power for real-time 3D rendering and high frame rate VR. For half-precision computation that’s reportedly ideal for machine learning, the iMac Pro can deliver up to 22 teraflops of performance. (No, we don’t really have a sense of what that means, either, but Apple PR did a good job of making it sound impressive.) The iMac Pro will come with 32 GB of RAM by default, but for a machine in this class, the fact that it’s configurable to 64 GB or 128 GB is more important. A 1 TB SSD is also standard, with 2 TB and 4 TB SSDs as options. Unsurprisingly, the iMac Pro sports four Thunderbolt 3 ports, which enables it to drive up to two 5K displays and two high-performance RAID arrays at the same time. Other connectivity options mimic what’s on the 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display now, with the exception of Ethernet. Instead of gigabit Ethernet, the iMac Pro will include 10 Gb Ethernet, which could be a big deal when transferring huge amounts of data between machines. How much will all this cost? A lot, with the base iMac Pro configuration starting at $4999. Apple claimed that a comparable workstation would cost about $7000, without a 5K display. Even still, given the high price of large SSDs and RAM, we anticipate that a loaded iMac Pro will easily meet or exceed that $7000 mark. But that won’t stop the audience for the iMac Pro. If you need the maximum performance from a Mac, the iMac Pro will provide it. At least until a new Mac Pro makes its debut, and many of those who live and die by the teraflop won’t want to wait.   READERS LIKE YOU! Support TidBITS by becoming a member today!

As part of the announcement-heavy WWDC keynote, Apple has revved the iMac line with Intel’s 7th-generation Kaby Lake CPUs, higher performance graphics, brighter screens, and faster SSDs. The MacBook and MacBook Pro also get new CPUs, the MacBook becomes more expandable, and the MacBook Air receives a small speed bump. The most unexpected news, however, was the announcement of the iMac Pro, due in December 2017. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Michael E. Cohen   2017-06-06 10:48 And if anyone out there thinks the iMac Pro means that a Mac Pro ISN'T also coming, Apple's press release on the iMac Pro puts that misconception to rest: "In addition to the new iMac Pro, Apple is working on a completely redesigned, next-generation Mac Pro architected for pro customers who need the highest-end, high-throughput system in a modular design, as well as a new high-end pro display." Reply Mackay Bell  2017-06-07 20:38 It seems that part of the reason they revealed that they were working on an expandable Mac Pro (and apologizing for the trash can version) is they wanted people to get excited about the iMac Pro, and not suck up all the air complaining about the lack of an expandable system. By getting that story out before the release, they could get a little more excitement going for the coming of the iMac Pro. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-09 09:49 I think you're spot on. Reply Alan Forkosh   2017-06-06 11:09 It's noteworthy that Apple didn't mention anything about the Touch Bar. As it stands now, Touch Bar is an orphan, present on only on the MacBook Pro line. It strikes me as something that can't really be considered a standard until there is a desktop version of it also--either a new keyboard or a standalone item to be paired with a keyboard. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-06 12:00 In fact, it turns out that Apple did release a new wireless Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad. But not with a Touch Bar. Boo! http://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/apple-has-a-new-wireless-magic-keyboard-with-a-full-numeric-keypad/amp/ Reply Paul Ellis  2017-06-06 13:53 The Touch Bar is a gimmick. It breaks all the rules of ergonomics and focus. It might possibly make some sense when positioned close the the screen, and therefore point of focus, on a laptop, but makes little sense for a desktop. If I were a developer, which thankfully I'm not, I wouldn't be wasting any time developing for it, and certainly not if I'd previously been stung by OpenDoc, QuickTime VR, etc. etc. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 14:57 I like what Apple is doing with the iMac and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to assuming they'll make things right with the new Mac Pro once it finally arrives. The MBP seems fine. I still don't see what TouchBar is supposed to accomplish - I also think it's mainly a gimmick with poor ergonomics. Apple didn't spend any time on it at this WWDC. Does anybody think it might disappear during the next overhaul? I don't really get why Apple is keeping the MBA around instead of just trying to make an inexpensive entry-level MB instead. Since there is no inexpensive entry-level MB, I assume that means the MB is targeting the middle/high-end of the compact/light market. So with that in mind, why in the world did they not replace that USB-C with TB3? If this were a budget Mac at $999 targeted at schools and students, fine. But since this is a midrange Mac we're talking about, why leave it stuck with USB-C? Nothing TB3 offers can't be done with USB-C, but TB3 is just more versatile and it is no doubt the new standard across Macs - well almost, sigh. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 14:59 (cont.) My only real gripe on the Mac side is the Mac mini. How can Apple just let it sit there to die? Either kill it off already (so people know they'll have to go Hackintosh) or update it. But just leaving it sit there without a clear plan makes we wonder what message Apple is trying to send. It reminds me of the Mac Pro situation before pressure from pros and tech journalists forced Apple to take a stand. I see a lot of potential for the Mac mini, from cheap servers to simple office computers, offering a low-price entry point to the Mac universe, schools, home media servers, etc. I'm afraid all of that is "too techy" and not sexy enough for the new Apple. I really hope I'm wrong. I'm holding onto my trusty Core i5 Mac mini, but with its 4 GB of RAM (could be upgraded) and 500 GB HDD (could also be upgraded, but is that worth it?) its days are numbered even as my home media server. Reply Bertrand Morin  2017-06-06 19:27 Is the memory (RAM) upgradable in the iMac 27in. by the user, as it wad older iMac… Reply James  2017-06-08 07:58 Did you read the product page for the 27" iMac? If not, go back and read it again. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-09 09:48 Yes, it is in the 27-inch model. But RAM in the 21.5-inch model is not user-upgradeable (although it's not soldered to the motherboard either). Reply Scott M.   2017-06-07 01:08 Is there any indication yet if the new iMac models (both 21.5" and 27") have user upgradable RAM? There is some wording on the Apple page that you can upgrade the 21.5" RAM after purchase through Apple or an authorized dealer, but it not 100% clear. And the page for the 27" is completely silent. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-07 09:59 The 21.5-inch models are NOT user-upgradeable, but the 27-inch model is. See http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201191 Reply Bob  2017-06-08 18:02 Scott, MacRumors reports "iFixit has published a teardown of the new 4K 21.5-inch iMac, which reveals that – surprisingly – Apple's smallest all-in-one desktop machine has both removable RAM and a Kaby Lake processor that's not soldered onto the logic board." Note though, updating is an involved process. Certainly not user-replaceable by the average owner. But at least users aren't irrevocably locked in to what they originally purchased. Reply Scott M.   2017-06-09 02:28 I guess that I should have been a little more accurate with my question. I was more trying to determine if the RAM in both the 21.5" and 27" is upgradable, whether user upgradable as officially supported by Apple or even just upgradable but only officially by Apple or an Apple ASP (which means a user can do it if they are afraid to open up their Mac and maybe end up having Apple not provide support under the warranty if there is a problem). Reply Scott M.   2017-06-09 02:32 Good to know. I am not afraid to open up a Mac even for supposedly no user upgradable items at least officially in Apple's eyes. On my original 2006 MBP, I replaced a fan that was squealing due to the bearings and also upgrade the WiFi card, neither of which was consider user upgradable by Apple (certainly not the fan at least...not sure about the WiFi card). It likely would not matter as if I were in the market for an iMac (I am currently not), I would be going for a 27" model anyway. I am kind of used to the 27" Thunderbolt display that I have, so going back to what would seem like a freakishly small (to me) 21.5" screen would not really be an option. Reply Henrik Munster  2017-06-09 10:46 There is "not user upgradeable" and then there is "not user upgradeable". I have myself opened a few MacBooks and even PowerBooks, but opening an iMac seems to me to be quite frightening. My suggestion would be to at least take a look at the instructions at iFixit before attempting to do anything. Reply Scott M.   2017-06-09 22:00 Always do. When I am going to crack open any Mac (or any other Apple product or even some non-Apple products these days although they tend to cover every Apple product but not so much for non-Apple products), iFixit is the first stop when I even start to think about it. It was their guides that helped me replace the fan on the 2006 MBP and upgrade the WiFi card for that same Mac. iFixit is an excellent source for determining what kind of trouble I might get into. ;-) Reply Simon  2017-06-08 18:20 I wonder if the non-retina 21.5" iMac will have the same SO-DIMM slots? I guess the replaceable CPU is a given because apparently Intel does not offer desktop Kaby Lake with BGA (i.e. soldered). Reply Scott Randell  2017-06-09 15:13 Hey Adam, the hardware part of the announcements were of little interest to me. Mostly because of the price points. The average user will not need an iMac Pro, nor could they justify paying for it. The price points on the regular iMac are ridiculous. The 27 inch with 512 GB SSD is a much better value than the 21 inch with the same add ons. Especially when you consider you can install extra 8 GB of ram yourself for about $60.00 vs the $200.00 Apple charges. With the same add ons the 27 inch is only $260.00 more than the 21 inch. Unless space is a consideration the 27 inch is a much better value, and you can add more ram down the road. I personally hope they come out with a reasonably priced user upgradable tower you can buy as much or as little as you need. Regards to all Tidbits staff.

As part of the announcement-heavy WWDC keynote, Apple has revved the iMac line with Intel’s 7th-generation Kaby Lake CPUs, higher performance graphics, brighter screens, and faster SSDs. The MacBook and MacBook Pro also get new CPUs, the MacBook becomes more expandable, and the MacBook Air receives a small speed bump. The most unexpected news, however, was the announcement of the iMac Pro, due in December 2017. Add a comment  Search   Cached. Unless otherwise noted, this article is copyright © 2017 Adam C.

According to a statement released on social media, it’s to celebrate the success of her most recent album, “1989.” Swift’s return to streaming is an interesting one, given that she previously declined to offer her “1989” album on streaming platforms when it was released, and went on to pull the rest of her catalog from those services as well. *Also Read:* Katy Perry Finally Confirms Taylor Swift Feud: 'She Started It and It's Time For Her to Finish It' However, TIDAL released much of Swift’s music catalog when it first launched in March 2015. The following June, Swift penned an open letter to Apple, explaining that she would withhold “1989” from Apple’s upcoming service in protest of its decision not to pay royalties for music streamed during its three-month free trial period. Later that day, Apple responded to Swift’s concerns and agreed to reverse its policy of not paying artists for their content. She then confirmed that “1989” would stream on Apple Music and went on to release exclusive content via Apple Music and star in multiple commercials. Perry’s album, “Witness,” launched at midnight on Friday as well, coincidentally or not. Rumors that Swift and Perry are feuding were confirmed by Perry last month. During her appearance on James Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke,” the singer said “honestly, it’s really like, she started it and it’s time for her to finish it.” *Also Read:* Taylor Swift Butt-Grope Lawsuit Moves to Trial During an interview with Rolling Stone in 2014, Swift explained that her hit “Bad Blood” was about another female artist: “For years, I was never sure if we were friends or not. She would come up to me at awards shows and say something and walk away, and I would think, ‘Are we friends, or did she just give me the harshest insult of my life?'” Swift then claimed that this artist “did something so horrible. I was like, ‘Oh, we’re just straight-up enemies.’ And it wasn’t even about a guy! It had to do with business. She basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour. She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me. And I’m surprisingly non-confrontational — you would not believe how much I hate conflict. So now I have to avoid her. It’s awkward, and I don’t like it.” ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ pic.twitter.com/kcpY03qHLp — Taylor Nation (@taylornation13) June 8, 2017 *Related stories from TheWrap:* Ruby Rose Tears Into Katy Perry Over Supposed Taylor Swift Diss Track Taylor Swift's Alleged Stalker Indicted for Loitering Outside Singer's Home Taylor Swift Sends Gift to Fan After She Couldn't Make it to the Grad Party (Photo) » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Splash News TV - 14 hours ago< > Embed Katy Perry Says Taylor Swift is Trying to Assassinate Her Character 00:51 It’s hard to imagine we’re still talking about the Katy Perry and Taylor Swift feud, but that’s exactly what’s going on.

(John Cetrino/European Pressphoto Agency) Apple chief executive Tim Cook appeared to make a veiled swipe at Facebook on Friday as he spoke to new graduates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Addressing the Class of 2017, Cook emphasized the importance of baking humanity into every decision and project, particularly when it came to technology. While tech has made the world better, he said, sometimes it has revealed new problems for societies to solve. “The potential adverse consequences [of technology] are spreading faster and cutting deeper,” Cook said. “The threats to security, threats to privacy, fake news and social media that becomes antisocial. Sometimes the very technology that is meant to connect us divides us.” Of course, Facebook’s whole mission as a company is to connect people, according to its own chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. And many Americans probably would never have heard about fake news had it not been for its prominence on Facebook during the 2016 election. Since then, Facebook has taken steps to minimize fake news's impact by working with third-party fact-checkers and highlighting when a particular article may be disputed, among other things. Cook blamed some of these societal issues on the way we think about technology. Urging Americans not to reduce the world to algorithms but to find the essence of humanity and inject it into our technology, Cook seemed to imply that some technologies draw us in the wrong direction. “Measure your impact in humanity not in the likes, but the lives you touch,” he said. “Not in popularity, but in the people you serve.” Facebook didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Alongside the new diabetes management features, app developers are getting more access to Workout data and other Apple Watch features, swimming tracking is getting improvements, and Health is introducing new Activity categories for tracking different types of exercises including Tai Chi, Mixed Cardio, and Hand Cycling. Head below for a roundup of new features coming to the Health app and watchOS 4 this fall: The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac As watchOS 4 gains the ability to connect directly to devices that track glucose and deliver insulin, Apple is also introducing a few new features to improve diabetes management, including support for tracking insulin delivery and more in the Health app… Diabetes Management & Insulin delivery tracking & Core Bluetooth  First off, with watchOS 4 adding CoreBluetooth, Apple Watch Series 2 is getting support for connecting directly to Bluetooth low energy accessories like those that are used for glucose tracking and delivery (like that one Tim Cook was spotted wearing recently). Apple announced the feature at WWDC and showed the Dexcom app on the Apple Watch (pictured above), a companion app for a company that makes a line of popular continuous glucose monitors. It didn’t, however, confirm support for any specific manufacturers planning to enable these new features. With a direct connection, users will be able to use these devices and other Low Power Bluetooth devices with Apple Watch for long periods of time without having to worry about having their iPhone around. The Health app is simultaneously adding a few new related metrics that will make for a richer experience for diabetes management and blood glucose tracking. HealthKit will now have the ability to track the relative meal time to a blood glucose sample. And it’s also gaining the ability to track insulin delivery together with supported accessories: Workout Routes Previously only available to Apple’s Activity app, Workout Routes allows app developers to tap into the same map of your location during workouts to display and use in third-party fitness apps after additional authorization from the user. This means if you use an app other than Apple’s for tracking running, swimming, cycling or another activity with Apple Watch, it will now be able to easily tap into that route data like shown in the example pictured above. Waist circumference & VO2 max Waist circumference is a new body metric available in Health this year that will allow users to keep track of their waist circumference data over time. VO2 max is another new data sample type available in Health this year. This body metric measures the maximum rate of oxygen intake during peak exercise. And this is actually something that Apple Watch can estimate now with watchOS 4 during certain walking and running workouts. New Workout Activity Types: Tai Chi, Mixed Cardio, Hand Cycling  Apple is adding three new workout activity types that developers can use with Health, including: Tai Chi, Mixed Cardio and Hand Cycling. While Tai Chi and Hand Cycling are obviously geared towards those specific activities, Mixed Cardio will be a new category that can be used for a varied number of different exercises. Workout & Swimming improvements New for swimming – Automatic set detection will allow for better tracking of continuous swimming. In the example above, Apple can automatically detect sets even when a workout isn’t necessarily paused and resumed. Third-party apps can also now enable water lock with watchOS 4, which forces Apple Watch to ignore any input caused by water until the digital crown is turned to disable the feature. And lastly, like the Workouts app on Apple Watch where you can easily pause and resume workouts by pressing the side buttons on the device, now third-party app developers will be able to implement this same functionality using a new Workout Pause/Resume API. Check out more features coming to Apple Watch with watchOS 4.

But Apple’s ho-hum demo during the event — a tabletop game, similar to what we’ve seen from other AR projects like Google’s Tango — still left a lot of us wondering how iOS developers would use AR once they got their hands on the tool that powers it. Thankfully, they’re already sharing their first results, and many of them are wonderfully weird. Bar charts Meetings will never be boring again!

Phone-based AR has been growing in fits and starts for the last few years, and Snapchat (and, of course, Instagram and Facebook) has sort of been bringing it to the masses with filters for your face and the world around you. But the idea that, by this fall, augmented reality could be spread to the billion devices running iOS means we could be facing a huge turning point for the technology. What looks like a weird idea this week could wind up being the next Pokémon Go this fall.

Apple Is Trying To Make Your iMessages Even More Private Apple wants to make its cloud as secure and private as its devices, starting with iMessage. Apple might have figured out a way to close what some privacy activists saw as a major loophole that undermined the security and privacy of some users of its popular chat app iMessage. Back in 2011 Apple launched iMessage, a then-new messaging service that, among a myriad of features, also promised "secure end-to-end encryption." That, in other words, is a type of encryption that in theory only allows the sender and the receiver of the messages—and no one else, including Apple or the cops—to read them. It was two years before Edward Snowden warned of NSA surveillance and popularized the importance of encrypting all the things and inadvertently accelerated the race to put end-to-end encryption in every chat app you can think of. But, as several security and privacy researchers warned over the years, there's always been a major, somewhat overlooked catch: If you back up iMessages to iCloud, then Apple—or authorities who can force the company to turn the back ups over—can still read those messages, which to some extent defeats the purpose of the encryption. With Apple's new mobile operating system, that might not be the case anymore. This week at WWDC, the company announced that it was moving iMessage onto the iCloud platform with iOS 11. During the WWDC keynote, the company's Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi presented it as a user experience improvement. Read more: People Can't Tell What Apps Use Encryption, And Don't Really Care, Study Finds Starting with the upcoming iOS11 all your conversations in iMessage will be automatically synchronized across your iPad, iPhone, Mac and whatever other iGizmo you own, he said. As anyone who uses iMessage knows, that's something that you can't do right now. And it leads to annoyances such as having to manually delete messages on all your devices if you want to get rid of an embarrassing message, or having to restore a full backup if you want old iMessages on a newer iDevice. But if iMessages, which are supposed to be end-to-end encrypted, now sync, doesn't that mean Apple can decrypt and read them at some point? Apple says that soon won't be the case. "Even if [users] store information in the cloud, it's encrypted with keys that Apple doesn't have." During an interview with Apple blogger and Daring Fireball's owner John Gruber, Federighi said that the company has figured out a way to do syncing while still remaining unable to read your iMessages. Here's what he said (this exchange is around the 01:05:30 timestamp in the video): "Our security and encryption team has been doing work over a number of years now to be able to synchronize information across your, what we call your circle of devices—all those devices that are associated with the common account—in a way that they each generate and share keys with each other that Apple does not have." "And so, even if they store information in the cloud, it's encrypted with keys that Apple doesn't have. And so [users] can put things in the cloud, they can pull stuff down from the cloud, so the cloud still serves as a conduit—and even ultimately kind of a backup for them—but only they can read it." It's unclear exactly how Apple is able to pull this off, as there's no explanation of how this works other than from those words by Federighi. The company didn't respond to a request for comment asking for clarifications. It's possible that we won't know the exact technical details until iOS 11 officially comes out later this year. Meanwhile, cryptographers are already scratching their heads and holding their breath. "The $6 million question: how do users recover from a forgotten iCloud password? If the answer is they can't, that's a major [user experience] tradeoff for security. If you can, maybe via email, then it's [end-to-end] with Apple managed (derived) keys," Kenn White, a security and cryptography researcher, told Motherboard in an online chat. "If recovery from a forgotten iCloud password is possible *without access* to keys on a device's Secure Enclave, it's not truly e2e. It's encrypted, but decryptable by parties other than the two people communicating. In that sense, it's closer to the default security model of Telegram than that of Signal."

A "smart home" can have one connected device or several; it's entirely up to you. And fortunately, you've already figured out the toughest part -- which voice control platform to use as the main point of access between you and your smart products.  Here's how to get started with an Apple HomeKit smart home today.  Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 148.98 -6.01 -3.88% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 978.31 -31.96 -3.16% 1. Do you have an iOS device? Unlike Amazon's Alexa speakers and the Google Home, Apple's voice control platform, HomeKit, relies on the iOS-only Home app -- and Siri -- to control your connected devices. That functionality will expand when Apple's HomePod speaker hits stores in December. For now, though, you're limited to controlling your Apple devices on your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. Want to know if your iPhone or iPad is compatible? Check here. 2. An Apple TV makes things easier You can use the Home app to control lights, window shades, and other devices anywhere you have a Wi-Fi or cellular connection. Siri voice control will only work when you're on your local Wi-Fi network -- unless you have an Apple TV. The Apple TV acts as a bridge, so you can say, "Siri, turn on the lights," even when you're away from home.  August CEO Jason Johnson, whose Smart Lock works with HomeKit, also suggested the upcoming HomePod would also serve as a gateway for remote Siri access on Tuesday. Apple did not respond to our request for confirmation. Rich, you should be able to make all the same HomeKit commands that you can with an AppleTV— Jason Johnson (@jcjohnson) June 6, 2017 3. Buy a HomeKit-compatible device (or devices) Load Error Think about the things you'd like to automate. Is it lights, locks, window shades, thermostats -- maybe all of the above? It's possible with HomeKit. I'd suggest starting with one HomeKit device and expanding from there as needed. Here's the current list of HomeKit products. 4. Install and configure your product(s) You may need to download the specific app for each HomeKit device you use to perform the initial set up, but Apple's own Home app, included within iOS, provides a convenient place from which to control your HomeKit devices day-to-day.  The Home app houses everything you need to adjust most settings of the various HomeKit products. You can also use the Home app to create scenes like "I'm home!" which then control multiple devices simultaneously. Note: Make sure to use the same iCloud Apple ID on your iOS device and your Apple TV. Remote Siri control won't work otherwise.  5. Kick back and let Siri control your smart home That's it. It's really that simple to get started with an Apple smart home. Stay tuned for updates, though. Apple's HomePod speaker is due out this December and its promised Siri and HomeKit integration will likely expand the functionality of Apple's smart home.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Apps iPhone Apps iPad Apps Mac Apps Apple TV Apps Apple Watch Apps The Best Apps Tutorials Jailbreak Jailbreak Tweaks Jailbreak Guide Unlock Guide Deals Latest Deals Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV More Download Wallpapers iPhone Photography Expert Tips Podcasts Apple now allowing developers to implement digital tip jars via In-App Purchase mechanism Christian Zibreg on June 9, 2017 0 Apple recently asked WeChat and other popular social networking apps in China to disable the popular tipping feature, and now we know why—the Cupertino giant has introduced an officially-sanctioned way for iPhone and iPad users to tip content creators in apps via the standard In-App Purchase mechanism. Like with other In-App Purchases, tipping content providers is subjected to Apple’s 70:30 revenue sharing scheme, meaning the company will keep 30 percent of any proceeds to itself. According to TechCrunch, the updated App Store Review Guidelines now include a clause that deals with tips, here’s a relevant excerpt: Apps may use in-app purchase currencies to enable customers to “tip” digital content providers in the app. Apps may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than In-App Purchases. According to the report, developers have the freedom to decide how much of the tips are passed to the content creators themselves (after Apple’s 30 percent cut, of course). At any rate, Apple was smart to implement this cool new feature. Tipping content creators like musicians, comedians, e-sports athletes and others is tremendously popular in China. The company has lacked a tipping system for iOS apps, meaning it couldn’t get in on the action to process such transactions through its own iTunes billing system. With tips now being officially supported via the familiar In-App Purchase mechanism, many customers who were previously reluctant to use PayPal or their credit card for tipping their favorite content creators will now be able to do so, directly in the app. And by taking tipping out of the grey area, as TechCrunch observes, more developers might implement digital tip jars— without fearing repercussions from Apple—as an alternative way to get creators paid without having to offer ad revenue sharing. In turn, the feature may create a whole new revenue stream for Apple at a time when the company is monetizing its huge user base in an attempt to boost its ever-growing Services revenue.

On 21 September 2010, Nokia appointed a new CEO: Stephen Elop, a director of Microsoft. Nokia was then world leader in mobile telephony, holding a 41% share of the world market. On 14 June 2011 Nokia and Apple reached an agreement whereby Nokia would license the patents to Apple for a considerable annual fee. In 2012, Nokia still held a market share of 18%, while Apple had 6%. In September 2013, Microsoft bought Nokia’s telephony division for EUR 5.44 billion and begun to wind it down. In June 2017, the last employee of Europe’s only flagship brand in the telephony/technology sector will have been made redundant. It would appear that Microsoft never truly wished to become a major global player in the telephony sector. Its main objective may thus have been to shut down Nokia following an agreement with Apple. Does the Commission intend to look into whether Apple and Microsoft secretly colluded, in violation of free competition, to limit production at Nokia? Such an agreement would be in breach of Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union Original language of question: FR   Last updated: 9 June 2017 Legal notice

Is AMP the answer to format fragmentation? Columnist Barb Palser makes the case for Facebook and other platforms to adopt Accelerated Mobile Pages. Barb Palser on June 9, 2017 at 11:48 am More Facebook says the idea for adding Accelerated Mobile Pages and Apple News support to its Instant Articles toolkit came from frustrated publishers asking for an easier way to produce all three formats. That rings true; format fragmentation is a growing burden for news publishers. But generating Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMPs) from Instant Articles seems like a strange answer to the wrong question. Instead of looking for incremental improvements to the underlying problem, publishers and platforms should revisit the premise that all of these formats are necessary in the first place. What if one distribution format could work across multiple platforms? Consider AMP, Instant Articles and Apple News, which are essentially three different ways of presenting news articles. Of those, AMP is the only non-proprietary format — and by far the most flexible. Instant Articles policy forbids ads above the fold, limits ad frequency and blocks ad networks except Facebook’s Audience Network. Facebook restricts the types of links allowed and where they can appear. With no navigation to the publisher’s website, Instant Articles keep the consumer in Facebook’s app. Facebook’s restrictions (and lack of compensatory reach) have led several major publishers to pull back or abandon Instant Articles entirely, shifting their focus to the more open, revenue-friendly AMP format. In that light, it’s hard to see how an AMP generated from an Instant Article — inheriting its limitations — would be very useful. Publishers could modify the AMP code to insert the elements Instant Articles disallows, but then how much effort is saved by using Facebook’s tools? It makes more sense to use AMP as the common distribution format. The AMP standard didn’t exist when Instant Articles and Apple News were first launched — but now that it’s established and ubiquitous, it can provide the control and performance platforms require and improve publisher ROI. It could lower the cost of participating in walled gardens and possibly lure back some of the defectors. There are a couple of ways this could work; here’s one idea using Facebook as the example: A Facebook AMP cache? Contrary to common belief, AMPs don’t have to be served by Google. For example, web performance and security company Cloudflare has a white-label AMP cache to serve AMPs on publishers’ own domains. Facebook could manage an AMP cache as well, which would allow it to do three things: Ensure super-fast delivery, like Instant Articles. Serve validated AMPs from its own cache instead of cdn.ampproject.org. Make certain modifications to the AMPs it presents in its own environments. Such modifications could include stripping out forbidden elements, or even replacing ad tags and analytics tags. Publishers could consent to these modifications as part of their inclusion in the platform’s products. (Arguably, Facebook should just present AMPs in their original state as long as they pass validation and let publishers make their money; the point is that platform-specific rules are possible.) The experience might be less pristine than today’s Instant Articles, but it could be just as fast — and still much cleaner than standard mobile articles. Publishers could focus on optimizing a common format, and Facebook could become an influential partner in the AMP Project instead of trying to sustain Instant Articles. Platforms already using AMP Other platforms have already embraced AMP. Twitter recently started linking to AMPs from its mobile web app and plans to start surfacing AMPs in its iOS and Android apps soon. LinkedIn presents AMPs in its news feed, and Bing displays AMP results in it search app. (None of these platforms has its own AMP cache; they’re using Google’s cache, Cloudflare’s cache or linking directly to the publisher AMP.) For most platforms, using AMP is a no-brainer. They get the performance benefits of a standardized format without having to convince publishers to build anything new. At this point, only a platform with the clout of Facebook — or the installed base of Apple News — has the ability to make publishers jump through hoops to produce a proprietary format. And there’s still a big, valid reason why they’d hesitate to give that up. Control and governance Here’s the hang-up: It would be surprising for Facebook or Apple to make a significant investment in AMP while Google holds so much influence over the format’s direction and features. The AMP Project is collaborative and open-source, but Google still manages the roadmap. Hopefully, this state is temporary. Google seems to want to help AMP leave the nest, and the company takes every opportunity to disavow proprietary ownership of the format. Participation by Facebook, Apple and other platforms would provide a counterweight to Google in the AMP Project, opening the door for even greater ecosystem investment and ultimately benefiting everyone, including publishers and Google. The transition to a new governance structure will be delicate and bumpy, but necessary. Publisher influence Rather than simply reacting to the choices platforms put in front of them, publishers can guide this discussion. Platforms are more engaged with the publishing industry than ever before — and they are looking for wins. The AMP Project itself was the result of publishers working with Google to address major performance and engagement problems with the mobile web — and publishers continue to advance the AMP standard by advocating for the capabilities they need. When it comes to the problem of proprietary format fragmentation, publishers must continue to use their collective leverage and ask for the right things. In this case, that means challenging all of the platforms to live up to the principles of collaboration and efficiency they espouse. That would be a huge win for everyone.

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo Shares of Apple Inc (AAPL.O) fell more than 3 percent on Friday after Bloomberg News reported that iPhones launched later this year will use modem chips with slower download speeds than some rival smartphones. Apple is widely expected to upgrade its iPhone this year, which marks the device's 10th anniversary, and suggestions that its technology will lag the performance of high-end smartphones running Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Android system could hurt its sales. An Apple spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Apple supplier Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) sells modems capable of downloading data at cutting-edge 1 gigabit speeds, but rival chipmaker Intel Corp's (INTC.O) modem technology does not yet have that capability, according to the Bloomberg report. Since Apple is traditionally reluctant to rely on just one supplier, it is using modems from both companies, but capping download speeds of the quicker Qualcomm modems so that all of the new iPhones perform the same, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources. Shares of the Cupertino, California company have surged 29 percent so far in 2017, largely in anticipation of the iPhone upgrade. The stock on Friday declined 3.5 percent to $149.60.

Apple revealed features that will be included in the upcoming iOS 11 update at WWDC this week. The iOS 11 is expected to roll out this fall, coinciding with Apple’s new smartphone lineup, which will include the company’s much-anticipated iPhone 8, which will be the company's 10th anniversary iPhone. Read: Siri vs. Alexa vs. Google Assistant: Apple Struggling With Privacy Concerns iOS 11 Maps Going to the mall? Apple wants to help you out. The iOS 11 update will allow you to see floor plans, let you browse floors, view directories and search. The feature will be available at malls in select cities to start, including New York, Boston, Tokyo, Chicago and London. It’ll also work at airports, which means you will be able to see where security is and where food venues are. The airport feature will be available in select cities worldwide to begin. Apple will add more locations in the future. Maps will also allow drivers to see speed limits and provide lane guidance. iOS 11 Do Not Disturb While Driving iOS 11 will not only help out drivers with Maps but also with its new Do Not Disturb While Driving feature. The mode automatically senses when the user is on the road, using speed detection. The feature shows a blank interface, turns off notifications while driving and also sends an auto-reply message when people send you texts, saying you’ll answer later. If someone is trying to contact you and it’s an emergency, they’ll be able to type in “urgent” so they can reach you while the feature is on. You can also disable the feature if you’re just a passenger. iOS Siri Update Siri will come with an improved interface, which will show multiple results, and feature a male voice option. Siri also will work as your translator. You’ll be able to ask Siri how to say a phrase in a different language and the virtual assistant will translate it for you. The translations will be available in Chinese, French, German, Spanish and Italian, with more languages coming in the next months. Siri will also understand context, your interests and how you use your device to predict what you’ll do next. Using that knowledge, Siri will be able to suggest topics in the News app, give you better response suggestions in the iMessage app and make calendar alerts based on something you have booked in Safari. The knowledge Siri collects will be synced across your Apple devices.

Most importantly, the iPhone maker announced you will be able to make person-to-person payments with Apple Pay. You’ll be able to send and receive money using your Touch ID while you’re messaging your friends and family. Apple Pay will be integrated into iMessage with iOS 11. Your iPhone will be able to detect when someone tells you money is owed in an iMessage and will pull up Apple Pay as a suggestion. The money you receive will be added to your Apple Pay Cash Card. The card can be used to send money to others on your device, make purchases with Apple Pay and transfer the funds to your bank. iOS 11 Camera Improvements iOS 11 is solving a problem everyone struggles with: storage. The update will compress video with high-efficiency video coding, offering up to two times better compression, Apple said. That should help save storage space on devices and iCloud. The Memories feature on the Photos app will create movies based on certain events or topics, which will be viewable in portrait and landscape mode. Apple added improvements to Live Photos, including a Boomerang-like feature and the ability to save single frames. Extra Features On iOS 11 The iOS 11 update will also include a single-page Control Center. Using 3D Touch on Control Center options will give users access to more controls, including brightness, volume and music. iMessage will come with a redesigned drawer for apps and stickers. iOS 11 will also automatically synchronize iCloud and iMessage conversations.

But he also cautioned that the same technologies can divide people through threats to privacy or security, and said technology must be tempered with human knowledge. “Technology is capable of doing great things, but it doesn’t want to do great things. It doesn’t want anything,” the Apple Inc chief executive said. “That part takes all of us.” Cook’s speech did not break new ground for him as head of the world’s most valuable technology company but added some context around some of his past decisions, such as taking controversial stances to protect privacy rights and investing heavily in green technologies. Cook has criticised President Donald Trump’s policies but offered only a gentle joke at the president’s expense on Friday, telling students it is obvious they have taken over Trump’s Twitter account. “I can tell college students are behind it because most of the tweets happen at 3 am,” Cook said. His 15-minute talk stood in contrast to a lengthier graduation speech his predecessor, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, gave at MIT rival Stanford University in 2005, in which Jobs outlined his free-thinking background and told graduates to find work they loved. Cook took a more conventional career path to the top of Apple, where he became CEO in 2011 after stints at IBM and Compaq. Cook, who is openly gay but famously circumspect, gave few details about his own life on Friday except to outline what he described as a frustrating search for meaning until joining Apple. He said at one point he sought guidance in religion and last year met with Pope Francis, who Cook said reinforced his own sense that technology must be harnessed with strong values. He said Francis told him, “Never has humanity had such power over itself, yet nothing ensures that it will be used wisely.“ Tech Wrap Get updates direct to your inbox E-mail * By registering you agree to our T&Cs & Privacy Policy Thank youYou are on the list.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Oppo unveils latest Apple, Samsung killer -- its R11 smartphone 2 How the QR code has forever changed China’s social habits 3 Alibaba is Asia’s No. 1 company as value soars to US$360 billion 4 Company as an economy: Alibaba aims to be No 5 by 2036 5 Think WeChat can’t get any bigger in China?

Click here to support us on Patreon. ★ News Apple Launches Promote Page to Help Developers Get Noticed for Possible Featuring Author Carter Dotson Posted On2017-06-09 13:30:00 News The stories from developers when it comes to Apple and featuring are often strange and full of mystery. Apple itself is an odd company that does things to the beat of their own drummer, and it's why they're so successful now. But considering that featuring can be the difference between an app being a hit or flopping, it being an arcane process, often based on knowing the right person, or managing to get coverage on sites like TouchArcade, can be frustrating for developers. Well, Apple has just introduced a brand new page for developers that lets anyone submit their app to Apple for potential featuring. What's interesting is beyond the cursory information such as estimated release date (Developers will talk about how Apple will tell developers good days to launch games, or at least strongly suggest doing certain things like that), is the "your story" section. This is something when I've given talks at events before to developers that when promoting their game, they need to figure out the interesting story and hook behind their game. Whether that's just something cool about the game or app itself, or an interesting story behind its creation, or if the developer themselves has an interesting story? That all helps! We've heard stories from developers that press coverage, especially here on TA, can be a major deciding factor in getting coverage, and so developers that get featured on TA probably want to leave links to that coverage in that box. Being smart, knowing what makes an app compelling, and showing that others who know compelling apps agree, will go a long way toward getting that desired featuring slot. And now developers can make their case straight to Apple. Hat tip to Tinytouchtales!

Like all other in-app purchases, Apple will now receive a 30 percent cut from the virtual currencies used for tipping. Tipping within apps is popular in China, where live-streaming apps like Yinke and Yizhibo have long allowed viewers to tip or give virtual gifts to the stars they watch as a token of gratitude, according to TechCrunch. Last month, however, Apple reportedly told WeChat and several other Chinese social networking apps to disable their "tip" functions to comply with App Store rules, as many of the virtual currencies sidestepped Apple's 30 percent cut on purchases. Now that Apple has formally outlined its stance on the matter, developers who previously feared repercussions from the company may be more inclined to begin offering virtual currencies for users to tip content creators with. Beyond Apple's 30 percent cut, it's up to developers to determine how much of the tips are relayed to the content creators themselves.

Rating: 3 Votes lostczech 12 hours ago at 11:39 am A single credit card transaction costs 20-30 cents. Plus percentage fees. Plus assuming cost of fraud and support. A single chargeback eats up $10 plus the loss. Plus maintaining a PCI-compliant infrastructure. For a $1-2 tip, Apple's margins are going to be cents. Where on earth did you get those numbers?! A single credit card transaction is NOWHERE NEAR 20-30 cents (otherwise, you are getting really ripped off by your payment gateway). Chargeback? In Apple's ecosystem that probably happens less than 0.1% of the time. Maintaining a PCI-compliant infrastructure, sure, but Apple has been doing that for quite some time, so that should be just a small line item in their overall expenditures. 30% is still ludicrous Correction, I'm used to spreading transaction fees across a monthly limit, small time users could see 20-30 cents, but trust me, Apple is not in this category Rating: 3 Votes sterlingindigo 12 hours ago at 11:50 am How can I send a tip to that girl?

Chris Smith @chris_writes June 9th, 2017 at 1:31 PM Share Tweet Now that Apple has released iOS 11 into the wild, designers working on iPhone 8 concepts don’t have to imagine operating system features and can create renders that are even more realistic. Add to that the most common iPhone 8 rumors and leaks, and you may end up with an iPhone 8 concept that foreshadows the real thing. Someone did exactly that, and the end result is equally impressive and troubling at the same time. Don't Miss: Let’s talk about the iPhone 8, which might make one of the worst design compromises we’ve ever seen A constant source of iPhone 8 leaks, including conflicting reports about Apple’s next iPhone release is Twitter user Benjamin Veskin. And while he’s yet to prove himself as a leaker, he certainly can create sleek renders based on available information. Image Source: iDropNews In his latest series of images, he used the iPhone 8 design that most rumors agree on at this point, and merged it with iOS 11 screenshots. As you can see in the following images, it all looks great until you realize there’s a massive problem staring you in the face. Image Source: iDropNews That area where the front-facing cameras and sensors are occupies a huge chunk of the front side of the display, and it needs to go. Or, if it’s meant to stay, then Apple has to figure out exactly how to redesign iOS 11 so that the camera assembly fits nicely with iOS 11. An iPhone 8 running iOS 11 as suggested in these images is hideous. Just look at the time, which is usually placed in the center of the top bar. That just can’t happen. It’d be even uglier than any questionable Apple decision has made in the past. Image Source: iDropNews One of the first things we noticed when Apple unveiled iOS 11 was the reintroduction of the antenna bars that replace the dots used in iOS 10. Apple may have done that to free up some space in the middle of the screen for that camera assembly. Apple also changed the way you open the notification pane on the phone — swiping up will open them on the lock screen — which may also have something to do with the central position of the complex camera system. Image Source: iDropNews But I can only hope that the final iPhone 8 design will not ruin iOS 11’s appearance like that. There are ways to fix it, such as including the entire camera assembly under the display if such a thing is technologically possible right now, or reducing the size of the camera system. Alternatively, we can always live with bigger top and bottom bezels than what’s shown in these images. As great as bezel-less designs are, I’m pretty convinced that we can still cope with bezels that are a few millimeters taller if it means getting a phone without that hideous cutout.

In fact, some things only last two years, two months, and 14 days. That’s how long, at least, Amazon’s absurdly cheap unlimited cloud storage made it. Now that the greatest deal in tech has come to an end, it’s worth taking a fresh look at your data-stashing options. Amazon’s Unlimited Everything plan truly was unprecedented when the company announced it in 2015, and went unmatched ever since. For $60 per year, you could keep as much as you could muster in your own private Amazon cloud locker. The industry standard, then and now, is roughly $10 per month for 1TB of space. Which is to say, twice as much as Amazon’s offering had been, with a firm cap, instead of all-you-can-cloud. The good news? Amazon’s still comparatively cheap. While the company killed off unlimited, it still gives you 1TB for the same $60 per year, with an extra $60 for every terabyte thereafter, up 30 terabytes. Not bad! Here’s how it measures up to your other top options—especially now that Apple slashed its iCloud pricing this week. A quick note that most of these offer lower tiers of storage/pricing, but we’re going to focus on the 1TB to 2TB range for ease of comparison, and because that should address the needs of most users. We’re also sticking with the big names, since long-term viability may be the most important factor in choosing the cloud storage that works for you. Dropbox Long the standard-bearer in cloud storage, Dropbox offers competitive pricing but also rock-solid speed and reliability. Perks include 30 days of version histories and file recovery, two-factor authentication support, and a relatively new collaboration tool, called Dropbox Paper, that you probably won’t use but looks nice. Storage: 1TB Annual cost: $100 Add more: If you need more than 1TB, you’ll have to upgrade from an individual Dropbox Plus plan to a Dropbox Business account. A 2TB business plan costs $150 per user per month, and you can go unlimited for $20 per user per month. iCloud Apple’s cloud pricing has dropped dramatically over the last two years, including a deep cut at this week’s WWDC developer conference. And as with many Apple offerings, it’s most useful if you’ve bought into the rest of the ecosystem. It keeps your photos, notes, calendar, and more backed up across all of your devices—unless you use, say, and Android phone, for which there’s no official support. Storage: 2TB Annual cost: $120 Add more: Nope! Sorry. iCloud maxes out at 2TB, but that should be enough for most use cases, even with family sharing. Just maybe take it easy on the 4K video. Google Drive Everyone should use Google Drive. Not the paid plan, necessarily, but Google lets anyone store as many photos (up to 16MP) and videos (up to 1080p resolution) for free. Free! Toss in Google’s extremely smart machine-learning photo search powers, and it’s a true no-brainer. It also offers top-notch real-time collaboration, thanks to Google Docs and its other productivity tools. The interface isn’t exactly elegant, but at least it’s reliable. One more quick note: Before you pay up for Drive, know that it gives you 15GB of free space, in addition to all that photo and video storage, which may be all you need. Storage: 1TB Annual cost: $100 Add more: Can you ever. Want 10TB? That’s $100 per month. 20TB? Okay sure, $200 per month. Do you want 30TB, you madman? It’s yours for $300 per month. After that, you’re on your own. Microsoft OneDrive It’s not quite as platform-limited as iCloud, but OneDrive will definitely appeal most to dedicated Windows users. And if you are one, it’s a good deal! Not only is the pricing competitive, but Microsoft also throws in an Office 365 subscription. (And vice versa; if you subscribe to Office 365, you also get OneDrive storage. The power of bundles!) The service itself, from interface to features, doesn’t blow the doors off otherwise, but if you’re firmly entrenched in Windowsworld you could surely do worse. Storage: 1TB Annual cost: $70 Add more: Microsoft offers a few multi-user configurations for both home and business, including an unlimited plan for $120 per year per user. That one doesn’t come with Office 365, but that’s still a solid deal. Amazon Cloud Drive Oh hello, Amazon. As we’ve said, it’s still cheap, just not quite as cheap. You’ve got some key factors to consider outside of just price, though. First, are you an Amazon Prime member? If so, you’ve got unlimited photo storage at your disposal, so do that. Yes, even if you’re already storing them in Google Photos or iCloud or wherever. The more important question, though, might be how prepared you are to live with Amazon’s stripped down cloud interface. It’s fine, just basic, which for novice users may be handy but could frustrate people who like to fiddle. Storage: 1TB Annual cost: $60 Add more: You can add another TB for an extra $60 year, up to 30TB. At that size, the savings really kick it; it’s half what Google charges for the same amount of space. #cloud #storage Most Popular gadget lab podcast iPad Is All You NeedAuthor: Wired StaffWired Staff This Could Be the First Airbag of the Self-Driving Car EraAuthor: Jack StewartJack Stewart Aviation Don't Freak Over Boeing's Self-Flying Plane—Robots Already Run the SkiesAuthor: Jack StewartJack StewartMore Stories View Comments Sponsored StoriesPowered By Outbrain Elizabeth Stinson This Play Dough Will Teach Your Kids All About Electricity Arielle Pardes How to Watch Apple’s WWDC Keynote Wired Staff WWDC 2017 Liveblog: Siri, iPads, MacBooks, and More Christopher Null Review: HP Envy 34 Curved All-in-One (2017) David Pierce WWDC 2017: What's Coming at Apple's Big Spring Fling Wired Staff OK, House.

But unlike what currently exists with Twitter’s DM feature or Facebook’s Messenger for Business, Apple’s platform won’t require businesses to have a social media presence, as customers can simply search for them on Spotlight, Siri, or Maps. During a WWDC session today, Apple elaborated more on just how it works. Business Chat essentially combines the app component of Messenger and the customer service portion from Twitter, letting you talk to businesses to get shopping / scheduling / general inquiry advice and reach out to file a dispute all from the same chat thread. Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Just like Messenger, Apple’s Business Chat will allow customers to shop and buy products straight from chat. Unlike Messenger, the linked payment solution appears to be strictly Apple Pay. Businesses can show items in stock in a list format which pops up from the conversation and prevents them from having to open a new window. For businesses that offer appointments, Business Chat links up with the user’s own calendar so that they can see if an offered time slot conflicts with their schedule. There are also other little useful features like predictive text, that can load a type ahead message such as address or phone number when the business asks for it. For things more complex than scheduling and shopping, businesses can direct users to download an iMessage app to complete their request. For example, an airline might have a specific app that helps a passenger select their seat from within their conversation. It’s a similar tactic to how Facebook encourages developers to build their own apps and bots within Messenger. The concept borrows from what’s already popular in Asia Business Chat currently works with other customer service platforms like Salesforce and Nuance, and is not restricted to companies without retail locations. The feature is currently being offered in a developer preview and businesses can register here. Once they’re through, they can whitelist employees to build out the tool before offering the service widely. The concept from both Apple and Facebook borrows from what’s already quite popular in Asia’s e-commerce scene on WeChat and LINE, so I’m curious to see whether they can compete in that region once the features inevitably expand overseas.

In his commencement address Friday, Cook told MIT grads and their families that technology without basic human values is worthless. "Technology today is integral to almost all aspects of our lives and most of the time it's a force for good and yet the potential adverse consequences are spreading faster and cutting deeper than ever before," Cook said. "Threats to our security, threats to our privacy, fake news and social media that becomes anti-social. Sometimes the very technology that is meant to connect us, divides us." Alluding to some of the controversies that have dogged the tech world in recent years, he said, "The internet has enabled so much and empowered so many. But it can also be a place where basic rules of decency are suspended and pettiness and negativity thrive. Don't let that noise knock you of course. Don't get caught in the trivial aspects of life. Don't listen to trolls and for God's sake don't become one." Congratulations, @MIT class of 2017! Today, all of humanity has good cause for hope. pic.twitter.com/10g3f7ZbDd— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) June 9, 2017 Cook highlighted ways Apple aims to make products that help people, such as iPhone technology that helps the blind run marathons or an iPad that helps an autistic child connect with the world around them. He said: "Whatever we do at Apple, we must infuse it with the humanity that we are born with." Cook also spoke up in defense of the tech industry's growing commitment to developing artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. While some leaders in the field, including physicist Stephen Hawking and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, have warned about the potential risks of AI, Cook says he's not too concerned. "I'm not worried about artificial intelligence, giving computers the ability to think like humans. I'm more concerned about people thinking like computers, without values or compassion, without concern for common man," he told the MIT grads. Play Video CBSN Tim Cook reaches 5 years as Apple's CEO It's been five years since Tim Cook took over as Apple CEO after Steve Jobs became gravely ill. CNET editor Jeff Bakalar joins CBSN to break down... Cook has been chief executive at Apple since 2011, taking over just a few months before the death of legendary Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. As CEO, he's overseen the rollout of the iPhone 7, Apple Watch and smart home technology like the HomePod speaker. Cook previously served as the company's chief operating officer and headed the Macintosh division. Cook has been vocal in pushing for bolder policies on global warming: he was among many private sector leaders to lobby the White House stick to the Paris Agreement on climate change, a landmark accord to reduce carbon emissions that was signed by 195 nations. The president pulled out anyway, drawing blowback from some prominent tech leaders.  "I think he decided wrong, I think it's not good," Cook said Monday of the president's decision. "It's not in the best interest of the United States." © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

As the clock neared midnight on Thursday, pop music fans around the world readied themselves for Katy Perry's fifth studio album, "Witness." Little did they know that the singer's rival, Taylor Swift, would swoop in at the last moment to steal Perry's thunder by releasing her entire back catalogue on streaming services that same night. Swift's music is now available on Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal, reversing her decision to rebuke major streaming services for not properly compensating artists. "In celebration of '1989' selling over 10 million albums worldwide and the RIAA's 100 million song certification announcement, Taylor wants to thank her fans by making her entire back catalog available to all streaming services tonight at midnight," a statement from the official TaylorNation Instagram read. A post shared by Taylor Nation (@taylornation) on Jun 8, 2017 at 4:22pm PDT Swift pulled her entire catalogue from Spotify and Apple Music in 2014, describing the push toward streaming music online as a "grand experiment" contributing to the perception that music should be free. "I'm not willing to contribute my life's work to an experiment that I don't feel fairly compensates the writers, producers, artists and creators of this music," she told Yahoo about her decision at the time. The singer later came to an agreement with Apple Music after releasing an open letter encouraging the service to pay artists during its free three-month trial period. An Apple executive quickly responded to Swift's plea, and her music ― including her new album at the time, "1989" ― was made available for streaming. Of course, the internet reacted accordingly to the suspicious timing of the singer's return, reigniting the now years-long feud between Swift and Perry and their fandoms. Snake emojis, and fun, were had by all.

Slate Sign In Sign Up These Apple Sneakers Are a Normcore Dream, and They Might Sell for $30,000 These Apple Sneakers Are a Normcore Dream, and They Might Sell for $30,000 Slate Sign In Sign Up Slate Moneybox A blog about business and economics. June 9 2017 2:00 PM These Apple Sneakers Are a Normcore Dream, and They Might Sell for $30,000 By Cleo Levin   Swag. Heritage Auctions In the early 1990s, Apple built prototypes for a pair of blocky, white sneakers, exclusively for Apple employees. With their sateen tongues and vintage rainbow logo, they’re either a normcore dream or the ultimate dad shoe, and they quickly disappeared into obscurity. In 2007, one of these rare items emerged on eBay and sold for $79. Now another is on the market—the only other, according to Heritage Auctions—but it won’t go for a pittance. At Heritage’s streetwear-themed sale on Sunday, the shoes are listed at an opening bid of $15,000—and are estimated to fetch at least $30,000. Why such a large anticipated haul? Because for certain collectors these Apple kicks, which a buyer for the auction house purchased at a garage sale in the San Francisco-Bay Area, are a holy grail—a hot sneaker collectible and a hot Apple nostalgia piece, all in one auction lot. Advertisement Apple has long notched huge resale prices for its products, even before its products were considered techie fetish items. By 1999, Apple I, the first desktop computer, was already a collector’s item, selling for $50,000 at auction. Apple I has continued to prove a reliably desirable product at big auction houses like Sotheby’s and Christie’s. Most notably, in 2014, an Apple I computer—thought to be from the first batch of machines assembled by Steve Wozniak—sold for $905,000. It was auctioned at Bonham’s Auction House to the Henry Ford Foundation for the organization’s museum in Dearborn, Michigan. Get Slate in your inbox. More recently iPods, made obsolete by smartphones, have become collector’s items, too. Almost immediately after Apple discontinued the product in September of 2014, their value markedly rose. That year, a factory-sealed 5GB first-generation iPod Classic fetched $20,000 on eBay. The 4,900 percent price increase in 13 years is yet another example of how quickly Apple products become collectible. Limited edition iPods are selling for even higher prices—a special U2 iPod with the members’ engraved autographs went for $90,000 in 2014. Though Apple’s vintage tech products have clear value, a major auction house taking on these Apple sneakers might represent a new level of collectability for the company’s merchandise. Advertisement Apple-branded merch has primarily only sold on eBay, where there are a variety of pens, sweatshirts, and caps for sale. These items have a decent markup, but there are not many big-ticket pieces. Many of the items for resale were likely originally bought at the Apple Company Store, a brick-and-mortar outlet in Cupertino, California, which is open to the public and dates back to the company’s beginnings. However, these items seem to trade more on ’80s and ’90s nostalgia than serious collector’s value. The most significant merchandise sale to date was a trade sign, manufactured for use at industry shows in the company’s startup years, which sold for $18,000 in 2008. The sign was a one-off, eventually replaced, but saved from the dumpster by an Apple employee who later put it up for auction. Top Comment I hear these sneakers are not compatible with normal laces.  You need to buy a special set of Apple laces which only work with certain model Apple sneakers.  They are a steal as $59.00. Per lace.   More... Join In In the last year, however, the market for Apple merchandise seems to have leaped. In 2016, a lot of Steve Jobs’ personal effects were up for auction, with one of his turtlenecks estimated to sell for up to $3,000. In a separate sale, a well-worn and taped-together pair of Jobs’ Birkenstocks went for $2,750. If Heritage finds the right buyer for these sneakers—someone equal parts tech nerd and kicks enthusiast—it could signify some rare synergy between the nerd and jock market. Give it a decade and maybe an Uber logo-embossed basketball or a Facebook lacrosse stick could go for a similar fortune.

Message icons will appear alongside the names of businesses in Siri, Spotlight searches, and Maps for quick chat with online or offline businesses. News of the launch of Business Chat was first made available earlier this week. Using the iMessage App Framework, businesses integrate iMessage apps into a Business Chat experience to deliver services. Business Chat is an immediate competitor with Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Skype, Twitter, and other messaging apps who want to connect businesses with customers. It will come to iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches in iOS 11 or later. In addition to Business Chat, this week Apple launched HomePod, its answer to smart speakers like the Amazon Echo or Google Home. A range of updates are also on the way for Siri, including additional personalization in native iOS apps and the ability to review your personal finances like checking, debit, or credit card accounts with just your voice. Customers must send the first message to start a Business Chat conversation, but once it begins, a business can schedule appointments, send notifications, make sales, and offer a range of other business services. With Business Chat, predictive text, that gray space above the keyboard where suggestions are served up, will surface personal information the customer can share with the business, like phone number or email address. The Time Picker feature in Business Chat allows customers to select from open appointment times with a business. List Picker lets you select things from a list, like a group of items for sale. Apple Pay can be used to provide payment, shipping, and contact information. A Hide Alerts option will be available to customers to silence notifications from a business. Delete a conversation and the business can no longer reach that customer. To use Business Chat, a business must work with a customer service platform like LivePerson, Nuance, Genesys, or Salesforce.

Samsung will deliver the screens before the end of the year, sources from the “upstream supply chain” told DigiTimes. The remainder of Samsung’s production will be used to supply orders for its own electronics and other smartphone clients. However, Samsung will reportedly keep some flexibility in case Apple asks for more OLED panels.

Photo: Reuters/Regis Duvignau Apple upstream supply chain has reportedly started mass producing components for the iPhone 7S, iPhone 7S Plus and iPhone 8, the report said. The 4.7-inch model and 5.5-inch version will feature a reinforced glass chassis with aluminum metal frame, while the 5.8-inch iPhone will come with an OLED screen and reinforced glass chassis with metal frame. A DigiTimes analyst predicts Apple will ship between 50-55 million iPhone 8 units before the end of the year, but the company will only have about three million to start with when it launches. The analyst also said mass production for the iPhone 8 will probably begin until after mid-September. This could impact the normal release date for iPhones. As for the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus, the analyst predicts Apple will ship a total of 25-30 million units before the end of 2017. The report comes after previous rumors pointed to an Apple-Samsung deal for OLED screen displays. In April, it was reported by DigiTimes that Apple had signed a two-year deal worth $9 billion with the South Korean company. Meanwhile, a previous report by Nikkei said Apple had placed orders for 70 million OLED panels from Samsung. The deal backed up previous rumors that have been circulating for a year pointing to an iPhone 8 with an OLED display.

LG already supplies the dual-lens camera modules on the back of the iPhone 7 Plus. The 3D modules will be used on the front of the iPhone 8. The iPhone 8 is rumored to come with a dual-camera system on the back, but will be placed vertically, unlike the camera system on the current iPhone 7 Plus. The iPhone 8 is also rumored to come with an embedded Touch ID, a True Tone display, which automatically adjusts the color and intensity of the phone’s display based on the environment, and wireless charging.

So, what's that like? What happened when Steve Jobs wanted your company? Adam Cheyer, the co-founder of Siri, knows. Two weeks after Cheyer and his co-founders, Dag Kittlaus and Tom Gruber, launched Siri as an app in the Apple store in February 2010, Jobs called their office — unannounced. "We had no idea. I mean literally he called our CEO's phone," says Cheyer, referring to then CEO Dag Kittlaus. "[Dag] tells this funny story — I don't know if you've ever had the moment where, you know, the phone is ringing and you swipe to answer and it doesn't pick up? And [it says] 'Apple' on [Dag's] phone, and he's swiping and he's trying to get it to answer. And then finally he answers, and there was Steve on the line," says Cheyer, speaking to CNBC. Photo courtesy of Adam Cheyer Adam Cheyer, co-founder of Siri and Viv Labs The conversation was remarkably low key and started with a scheduling snafu. Jobs said, "Hey, it's Steve, come over to my house tomorrow. What'cha you doing?" according to Cheyer. "Our CEO says, 'No, I can't, I'm taking my wife to the to the ballet,'" remembers Cheyer. Luckily, Jobs wasn't easily deterred: "Really? Well you could come over before," said Jobs. "And so we did," says Cheyer. "[Steve Jobs] ... was absolutely filled with passion and a determination and a fire like I've never seen." -Adam Cheyer, co-founder of Siri and Viv Labs In that first meeting, Jobs made it clear that he wanted to buy Siri, but the co-founders declined. "With no hesitation, we said we were flattered but that we weren't looking to sell at that time," says Cheyer. "We had just raised a new round of funding and had gone through a successful launch. We also had large distribution plans ahead, so an acquisition was just not something we were actively seeking or thinking about at the time." A few months later, in April of 2010, the Siri team changed its mind and did sell to Apple for a reported $200 million. "Over multiple discussions, Steve later convinced us that he understood our vision, that he wouldn't just make Siri a tiny feature but something core to Apple's strategy across multiple devices, and that we could impact the world more as part of Apple than as an independent company," says Cheyer. A pre-Siri prototype before the iPhone. In his dealing with Jobs, Cheyer learned that the tech icon never shied away from sharing his opinions. "Even the very first day we got into — not an argument — but he's like, 'Well what would you do in this case?' and I gave an answer, he's like, 'No! No! No! Why?' And so we were going at it on our very first meeting," remembers Cheyer. Though he was insistent on being heard, Jobs would also respect a well-thought out opinion. "If you had the right ideas and foundation to back up your perspective, he was always open to to hearing other ideas and thinking maybe he's not right," says Cheyer. "And that's the thing I love most about him. If you couldn't back up your assertion, he would dismiss you as a fool or something like that, but he was always open to hearing another idea and to learning from that." Siri launched on the iPhone on October 4, 2011. Jobs died the next day. Working with Jobs had an impact on Cheyer. "My impression was that he was absolutely filled with passion, and a determination and a fire like I've never seen. And I remember thinking, he's a billionaire, he's already transformed a few industries — music and movies and computing — you know, he could he could relax a little bit, and there wasn't anything relaxed about him. He was desperate to be right and to advance and to learn and I loved it," says Cheyer.

Boasting few physical advancements from their 2016 specs, it’s what’s on the inside that really counts. Right? According to teardown experts iFixit, little has changed internally, as well. “The larger trackpad. The USB 3 port. The lone microphone jack. Why does this all feel so familiar?” the team said of the 12-inch Apple MacBook. “Can we just use last year’s teardown and call it a day?” One noticeable upgrade is hiding beneath the laptop’s keyboard, where a second-gen butterfly mechanical switch (inherited from the Pro) comes with a new round dome for enhanced typing. MacBook keyboard (via iFixit) Cupertino’s 13-inch Pro, meanwhile, comes with a new finish on its fans. “Looks like the 4K iMac got the real refresh juice this year,” iFixit said. Both systems come with 8GB of RAM (configurable up to 16GB), but differ on storage: Apple’s MacBook features a 256GB SSD, while the Pro has only half that, but can be configured with a 1TB SSD (for an additional $800). Power-hungry users may want to pick up a MacBook Pro, with a 2.3GHz Core i5 processor—faster than the MacBook’s 1.2GHz Intel Core m3 processor (sans fan). Available now in the Apple Store, the pair come in silver or space grey finishes; the 12-inch MacBook—Cupertino’s thinnest laptop—is also on sale in gold or rose gold. Just don’t try any at-home restorations: Both computers earned a measly one-out-of-10 repairability score from iFixit, which complained of soldered-on components and too much battery adhesive. The MacBook’s Retina display “is a fused unit with no separate, protective glass,” the firm said, warning that “if the display is damaged, it’ll be arduous and expensive to repair.” There is one bright spot for Pro owners: The trackpad can be removed without first extracting the battery. That doesn’t quite make up for the machine’s difficult-to-repair Touch Bar and Touch ID sensor.

"> Apple App Store Bans Pepe the Frog Meme News Reviews Features Guides Apple App Store Bans Pepe the Frog Meme By Brad Jones | Jun 9, 2017   Pepe the Frog started out as a relatively innocent character in a little-known web comic, and was ultimately transformed into a meme that became strongly associated with the alt-right. Now, there’s evidence that Apple has banned the amphibian outright, as the company has rejected an app called Pepe Scream. Pepe Scream is an unusual take on the Flappy Bird formula. Much like Dong Nguyen’s runaway hit, it’s about maneuvering a character between tight gaps — but instead of tapping the screen, altitude is maintained by yelling into the iPhone’s microphone. However, the actual gameplay contained within Pepe Scream doesn’t seem to have factored into the app’s rejection. It seems that Apple considers Pepe the Frog to be a breach of its App Store guidelines, having stated to developer Spirit Realm Games that the inclusion of the character amounted to “objectionable content.” Spirit Realm Games claims to have only featured “innocuous” versions of the Pepe meme in its game. However, it’s clear that the app uses the character in an attempt to take advantage of its notoriety — and as of 2017, that notoriety hinges on the fact that it has become a talisman for the alt-right. Apple prides itself on its ability to curate the App Store, in an attempt to ensure that all content available on the service meets a basic level of quality and taste. While some will view these restrictions as censorship, the fact of the matter is that the company is very up front about its expectations for developers signing up to sell apps on its storefront. What’s more, there are other options out there for developers who absolutely, positively need to release an app starring Pepe the Frog — the Google Play Store is much more lax, and has plenty of content featuring the character. It’s worth noting that Apple has enforced a full ban on Pepe, who doesn’t appear in any apps, or iMessage sticker packs themed around memes. Spirit Realm Games plans to re-release the game with a different character as its protagonist, but it remains to be seen if it will be approved by Apple.

"Are they artificial flavourings?" she asked. This is a common problem for people who turn to herbal or fruit teas thinking they are drinking something clean and simple, only to find flavourings listed. Twinings Cranberry and Raspberry. $3.99 for 20 teabags. Ingredients (greatest quantity first): Hibiscus This is hibiscus flower which is in most fruit teas. It provides a tart, cranberry-like taste. It also has a lovely colour and for producers is a cheap ingredient to make up the volume of the teabag. It could also be good for you. I found a 2008 study which found three cups of hibiscus tea can lower blood pressure. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Apple pieces Dried apple gives a sweet flavour to the tea. Many fruit teas will use apple as a base. Rosehips This will be in here mainly for flavour. Rosehip tea has a tart taste and is nutrient rich. Elderflowers These flowers have a reputation for being very good for you as they contain antiseptic and anti-inflammatory benefits. They also provide a nice hit of flavour. Cranberry flavouring (6%) The problem with flavouring is that the substance may taste like cranberry but it may not be cranberry fruit providing that flavour. I contacted Twinings and asked them if there was actually any cranberry or raspberry in this tea. Their response was direct: "No, there is no actual raspberry or cranberry in the blend."

"The flavourings are partly derived from the fruits mentioned." So on the one hand there is no fruit but on the other hand the fruit is used to create flavour. I was confused so emailed them again asking them to explain. And this is what they said: "The natural flavouring components are extracted from the plants using various methods depending on the nature of the component being extracted. These processes selectively separate the flavour components from other parts of the plant which do not contribute to its flavour - an example would be removing the citrus flavours from the peel 'cells' but leaving the fibrous cell material behind. "Twinings generally uses flavouring granules (i.e. solid particles) in its tea bags. These are produced from the flavouring components plus a 'carrier' to protect the flavouring." I would have liked to edit this down into something which makes sense but it was beyond me. Let's just believe that there is a tiny bit of the fruits in there somewhere and at least the flavouring is natural. Liquorice root This is commonly added into herbal and fruit teas to provide a sweet flavour. Raspberry flavouring (4%) As above. My recommendations: To make a genuine cranberry and raspberry tea there would be a lot of mucking around involving frozen berries, hot water, sieves and God knows what else. So have this tea if you want a fruity, sweet concoction which will give you precisely two calories. It may not contain any actual fruit but at least the flavours used are natural. Highlights: • No actual cranberry or raspberry in this tea. • Uses natural flavouring. • Only 2 calories per serve.

LOS ANGELES — Reuters Published Friday, Jun. 09, 2017 1:17PM EDT Last updated Friday, Jun. 09, 2017 1:17PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Taylor Swift got back together with Spotify on Friday, returning her music to streaming services almost three years after complaining publicly they did not pay artists enough, and on the same day rival Katy Perry released a new album. Swift, one of the world's best-selling pop stars, also made her music available on Pandora, Amazon.com and Tidal streaming services, her management team said. Her catalog had previously only been available on Apple Inc's Music service. The pop star's management said the latest decision to return to all streaming services was taken to celebrate her album "1989" selling over 10 million copies worldwide. "Taylor wants to thank her fans by making her entire back catalog available to all streaming services at midnight," her management's Instagram account called Taylor Nation said late on Thursday. The move coincided with the release on Friday of "Witness," a new album by Perry, Swift's pop industry rival with whom she has a long-running personal feud. Swift, 27, has no new album to promote. Swift pulled all her music off Spotify and other streaming services in November 2014 after writing an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal saying that "piracy, file sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically... Valuable things should be paid for. It's my opinion that music should not be free." Six months later she struck a deal with Apple Music for her "1989" album after Apple bowed to pressure and agreed to pay artists during a free trial of its new streaming music service. The announcement by Swift may ramp up rivalry with Perry, 32, who released her new album's first single, "Swish Swish," last month. She told talk show host Jimmy Fallon the song was "a great anthem for people to use whenever somebody's trying to hold you down or bully you." Swift's 2014 single "Bad Blood" has been seen as directed at Perry, and the "Firework" singer admitted recently that the two were not friends. "That's true, there is a situation. Honestly, it's really like she (Swift) started it and it's time for her to finish it," Perry told talk show host James Corden in May. She said the feud stemmed from a disagreement over backup dancers. (Reporting by Jill Serjeant) This content appears as provided to The Globe by the originating wire service.

(AAPL) View All Posts Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is pushing hard in 2017 to win market share from the current graphic card industry leader, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). And Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) just helped it out in a big way. Source: Apple The company is rolling out new GPUs based on its powerful Vega architecture, looking to break Nvidia’s dominance in the PC market. Despite Nvidia announcing Mac drivers for its own new series of graphics cards, Apple chose AMD Radeon cards to provide the graphics firepower for its new iMac computers. And the high-profile new iMac Pro will sport the all-new AMD Radeon Pro Vega graphics card when it launches in December. Apple Equips iMac Lineup With AMD Radeon Apple’s commitment to its Mac computer business — and especially to its creative professional users — has been under question. So when the company unveiled all-new iMac configurations early this week, all eyes were on the components. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) provided its latest 7th generation Core processors for iMac, as the critical reception for AMD’s Ryzen CPUs were unable to budge Intel there. However, Apple chose AMD Radeon GPUs to power its 4K and 5K Retina iMac. In the previous generation, the entry-level model and base 4K iMacs made do with Intel integrated graphics. Now only that base model still uses Intel, and virtually all iMacs have AMD Radeon graphics cards. Apple is pushing the iMac to be a more capable desktop PC, able to edit 3D graphics, and for the first time, take advantage of virtual reality software. Choosing Advanced Micro Devices across the board to meet that goal sends a message. iMac Pro Gets the Latest AMD Radeon Pro Vega The real prize for AMD — at least in terms of bragging rights — was landing the new iMac Pro. This is the most powerful computer Apple has ever offered. It’s in the spotlight not just because of its hefty $4,999 starting price, but also because it’s the computer Apple promised its professional users it would release. An iMac with the horsepower to do whatever they need, from running multiple 5K external monitors to compiling 4K video and editing VR content. There is a lot at stake here, including Apple’s reputation among creative professionals. Nvidia made overtures to that crowd a few months ago, announcing Mac drivers for its new Titan Xp — at the time of its release, considered to be the world’s most powerful graphics card.

The new 10.5-inch model reduces the borders by nearly 40 percent to fit into an incredibly compact package that still weighs just one pound. Combined with powerful new iPad features in iOS 11 coming this fall, like the all-new Files app, customizable Dock, improved multitasking and deeper integration of Apple Pencil, iPad Pro gives users the ability to be even more productive and creative. Customers will be able to order the 10.5-inch iPad Pro and 12.9-inch iPad Pro starting today at www.sprint.com and both models arrive in Sprint stores on Tuesday, June 13. Sprint's overall network reliability continues to beat T-Mobile and performs within 1% of Verizon and AT&T, based on recent data from Nielsen, the world's foremost authority on independent network measurement. [1] With an average of 204MHz of spectrum and more than 160MHz of 2.5GHz spectrum in the top 100 U.S. markets, Sprint has more spectrum than any other carrier across the nation, allowing Sprint to keep adding the capacity and speed needed to serve customers’ increasing demand for unlimited data. iPad Pro's stunning, redesigned Retina display features ProMotion, a new technology that delivers refresh rates up to 120Hz for fluid scrolling, greater responsiveness and smoother motion content. With ProMotion, Apple Pencil is even more responsive with an industry-best, 20-millisecond latency for even more fluid and natural drawing. ProMotion also improves display quality and reduces power consumption by automatically adjusting the display refresh rate to match the movement of the content. The advanced Retina display is Apple's brightest iPad display yet and features antireflective coating. True Tone dynamically adjusts the white balance of the display to match the light around you for a more natural and accurate viewing experience and a wide color gamut enables iPad Pro to deliver digital cinema-standard colors. The powerful new 64-bit A10X Fusion chip provides performance that is faster than most PC laptops shipping today. A six-core CPU and 12-core GPU deliver 30 percent faster CPU performance and 40 percent faster graphics performance than the industry-leading A9X chip, while delivering all-day battery life. iPad Pro features the same advanced front- and back-facing cameras as iPhone 7, including a 12-megapixel camera with optical image stabilization and a 7-megapixel FaceTime HD camera, as well as a four-speaker audio system. Support for LTE Advanced and 802.11ac Wi-Fi, along with an embedded Apple SIM make it easier to stay connected when traveling in more than 180 countries and regions. Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard are available for purchase separately. Advanced sensors in Apple Pencil measure both pressure and tilt for a natural drawing, annotating and note taking. A new full-sized Smart Keyboard has been custom-designed for the 10.5-inch iPad Pro, offering a thin yet durable keyboard that never needs to be charged or paired over Bluetooth and is easily foldable into a protective Smart Cover.

(Reuters) - Apple CEO Tim Cook on Friday warned graduates at MIT, a pioneer in fields like computers and robots, about technology's dehumanizing aspects and urged them to infuse its development with their own values. "I’m not worried about artificial intelligence giving computers the ability to think like humans," Cook said in his commencement speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "I'm more concerned about people thinking like computers, without values or compassion, without concern for consequence." Speaking to thousands of students and their families at MIT's Cambridge, Massachusetts, campus, Cook praised the benefits of new devices and social media. But he also cautioned that the same technologies can divide people through threats to privacy or security, and said technology must be tempered with human knowledge. "Technology is capable of doing great things, but it doesn't want to do great things. It doesn't want anything," the Apple Inc chief executive said. "That part takes all of us." Cook’s speech did not break new ground for him as head of the world's most valuable technology company but added some context around some of his past decisions, such as taking controversial stances to protect privacy rights and investing heavily in green technologies. Cook has criticized President Donald Trump’s policies but offered only a gentle joke at the president's expense on Friday, telling students it is obvious they have taken over Trump’s Twitter account. “I can tell college students are behind it because most of the tweets happen at 3 a.m.,” Cook said. His 15-minute talk stood in contrast to a lengthier graduation speech his predecessor, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, gave at MIT rival Stanford University in 2005, in which Jobs outlined his free-thinking background and told graduates to find work they loved. Cook took a more conventional career path to the top of Apple, where he became CEO in 2011 after stints at IBM and Compaq. Cook, who is openly gay but famously circumspect, gave few details about his own life on Friday except to outline what he described as a frustrating search for meaning until joining Apple. He said at one point he sought guidance in religion and last year met with Pope Francis, who Cook said reinforced his own sense that technology must be harnessed with strong values. He said Francis told him, “Never has humanity had such power over itself, yet nothing ensures that it will be used wisely."

Photo Credit: AP advertisement | advertise on newsday CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - Science is worthless if it isn't motivated by basic human values and the desire to help people, Apple CEO Tim Cook told graduates of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Friday, urging them to use their powers for good. In a commencement address, Cook — who as Apple's chief executive since 2011 has overseen the rollout of the iPhone 7 and the Apple Watch — said his own company is constantly looking for ways to combine tech with a sense of humanity and compassion.

"That responsibility is immense. But so is the opportunity," he said. Cook said Apple wants to make products that help people. As examples, he cited iPhone technology that can help a blind athlete run a marathon, and an iPad that connects an autistic child connect to the world around them.

"I'm more concerned about people thinking like computers without values or compassion or concern for the consequences," he said. "That is what we need you to help us guard against. Because if science is a search in the darkness, then the humanities are a candle that shows us where we have been and the danger that lies ahead." Cook also urged graduates to resist becoming cynical. "The internet enabled so much and empowered so many, but it can also be a place where basic rules of decency are suspended and pettiness and negativity thrive," he said. "Don't let that noise knock you off course. Don't get caught up in the trivial aspects of life. Don't listen to trolls and don't become one. Measure impact in humanity not in the likes, but the lives you touch and the people you serve." Business22 fun facts about Apple Get the Biz Briefing newsletter!

Swift, one of the world's best-selling pop stars, also made her music available on Pandora, Amazon.com and Tidal streaming services, her management team said. Her catalog had previously only been available on Apple Inc's Music service. The pop star's management said the latest decision to return to all streaming services was taken to celebrate her album "1989" selling over 10 million copies worldwide. "Taylor wants to thank her fans by making her entire back catalog available to all streaming services at midnight," her management's Instagram account called Taylor Nation said late on Thursday. The move coincided with the release on Friday of "Witness," a new album by Perry, Swift's pop industry rival with whom she has a long-running personal feud. Swift, 27, has no new album to promote. Swift pulled all her music off Spotify and other streaming services in November 2014 after writing an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal saying that "piracy, file sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically... Valuable things should be paid for. It's my opinion that music should not be free." Six months later she struck a deal with Apple Music for her "1989" album after Apple bowed to pressure and agreed to pay artists during a free trial of its new streaming music service. The announcement by Swift may ramp up rivalry with Perry, 32, who released her new album's first single, "Swish Swish," last month. She told talk show host Jimmy Fallon the song was "a great anthem for people to use whenever somebody's trying to hold you down or bully you." Swift's 2014 single "Bad Blood" has been seen as directed at Perry, and the "Firework" singer admitted recently that the two were not friends. "That's true, there is a situation. Honestly, it's really like she (Swift) started it and it's time for her to finish it," Perry told talk show host James Corden in May. She said the feud stemmed from a disagreement over backup dancers. (This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)

For that reason, developers can never be complacent — if native iOS functionalities are core to a third party app’s business proposition, that provider is in for a rude awakening. One WWDC blink-and-you’ll-miss-it announcement related to the upcoming watchOS4 enabling NFC connectivity to gym equipment for synchronization of workout details. While hardly a radical new feature for iOS users, this marks a somewhat larger shift in attitude from Apple to NFC, which Apple has considered so proprietary that it doesn't even provide an NFC on/off switch in the iPhone's settings.

New iPhone 8 renders have been leaked and this time the images show that the smartphone is running on the recently announced iOS 11 which is due to be launched later this year. The renders have been leaked by iDropNews and the fresh images also show some of the features of iOS 11 like Control Center, Notifications style, Lock Screen, redesigned Apple Music, and more. Apart from these software features, the renders also show the iPhone 8 from all angles. While the images may not be of the final iPhone 8 but it does give us an idea of what to expect from the upcoming smartphone. On analyzing the image, you can see that the alleged iPhone 8 comes with bezel-less design and there is no Home Button in the front. There is a small space at the top edge where the earpiece and front camera sensor is placed. It looks like iPhone 8 will also feature a front laser and infrared sensor that will deliver facial recognition capabilities. Sounds familiar? Well, the tech is present in the recently launched flagship Samsung Galaxy S8. Further, the fingerprint scanner is missing thus it could mean that the Touch ID will be embedded underneath the display. The publication also notes that the iPhone 8 will come embedded with a large pad along with glass back panel that will facilitate wireless charging. The images also show that the smartphone will feature a vertical dual camera setup. It has been said that this arrangement has been made to allow AR features to work in iPhone 8. All in all, the images show that the iPhone 8 will come with a sleek and premium design. More significantly the iPhone 8 will have a completely new design compared to its predecessors. This is what Apple fans have been waiting for. But we must also say that Apple could take on an entirely new design language for the upcoming iPhone. Besides, we still don't know the specific launch date of the iPhone 8 but we know for sure that Apple will release the phone sometime later this year. Till then we can build our excitement with these leaked renders. What do you think of these renders? Do let us know in the comments.

During his visit, Cook offered a brief interview with the MIT Technology Review. Sony A6500 The piece describes Cook’s visit with researchers on campus, including experts in sensors and AI. Cook described the various ways Apple uses machine learning in its products today including optimizing iPhone battery life and recommending Apple Music, but said Apple doesn’t detail what it has planned for years ahead like other companies. “We are not going to go through things we’re going to do in 2019, ’20, ’21. It’s not because we don’t know that. It’s because we don’t want to talk about that.” Cook also cautioned letting technology make decisions in places where human involvement should still be required. “When technological advancement can go up so exponentially I do think there’s a risk of losing sight of the fact that tech should serve humanity, not the other way around.” One of the researchers Cook met was involved in a study to detect depression based on phone activity, but the study doesn’t use iPhones or HealthKit due to privacy and platform limitations. The piece wraps up with a mention of Cook making a note on his iPhone to bring this point up to the team internally.

The reason as to why this could happen is due to Apple’s heated legal dispute with Qualcomm. Carriers in the United States like AT&T, Sprint and Verizon are all expected to introduce a new generation of wireless data later this year, which can deliver speeds as high as a gigabit per second, according to 9To5Mac. This would be around 50 times faster than what's currently available today. Qualcomm, one of Apple’s manufacturers of modems for its iPhones, already offers a modem that can support the new gigabit speed. But due to the two companies already butting heads in legal quandary, Apple has decided to use a mix of modems form both Qualcomm and Intel for the iPhone 8, according to Bloomberg. Apple's iPhone 8 might not support 1 gigabit network speed at launch. Photo: REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson “Cupertino, California-based Apple is embroiled in a bitter legal fight with the chipmaker, accusing the supplier of maintaining an illegal monopoly, and it’s seeking to loosen Qualcomm’s grip on the market for high-end smartphone modems. That’s why Apple will stick with Qualcomm modems for some of its new iPhones while relying on Intel for others.” — Bloomberg Intel is still developing its own modem that can be capable of 1 gigabit speeds. However, Intel’s modem won’t actually be ready for the iPhone 8’s launch. The iPhone 8 is widely believed to launch later this September, and might be available sometime in October. Bloomberg’s source claims Apple might have to limit the capabilities of Qualcomm’s modems that’s in the iPhone 8. Apple might only enable its full capabilities once Intel has developed its own modem that can do the same. Bloomberg’s report also notes Apple is generally slow when it comes to adopting faster wireless data standard. When the first iPhone launched in 2007, it didn’t come with 3G network support and instead, arrive with GPRS and EDGE cellular capabilities. Apple was also late in the game with 4G LTE, only adopting the standard for its 2012 iPhones when Samsung already supported it a year earlier. For this year, it looks like Apple will once again be behind Samsung, as the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus are already equipped with Qualcomm’s modems that can handle the 1 gigabit network speed standard. If having the best and latest network speeds is a big deal to consumers, some Apple fans might have to completely skip the iPhone 8. However, Apple already has a very loyal following, and with the rumors surrounding the iPhone 8, the upcoming handset’s new set of features might just be enough to win them over anyway. The Legal Battle Continues Apple and Qualcomm’s dispute began back in January when Apple sued Qualcomm for $1 billion. The iPhone maker claimed Qualcomm was forcing them to pay unreasonably high fees for its chips.  Apple has now filed a total of three lawsuits against the chip maker, while Qualcomm has already countersued Apple. Qualcomm has also accused Apple of blackmail by instructing its suppliers to withhold royalty payments, and is also allegedly trying to ban the import of iPhones in the United States.

In the first video, a Twitter user asks, "What's sooo great about the Apple Pencil?" Apple responds that its stylus is just like a real pencil and that when users write on an iPad Pro, "there's basically no lag." In the second video, someone on Twitter is asking for a "more powerful computer," so Apple recommends that they try out the all-new iPad Pro and "unleash the fury" of its A10x fusion chip. The new ads are a continuation of Apple's recent Twitter-based campaign, which sources real questions and comments from users on Twitter and uses actors to hold up the signs and do the voiceover work.

I miss the ads that very quickly showed the very diverse and professional uses and iPad could be put to. From data gathering for scientific research to field learning tool to Recording and sharing powerful social messages. By showing all the different uses the devices could be used for, the high prices for the products could be more easily rationalized. The power ad and its focus on gaming may be all and good for kids and parents with too much money on their hands. The reality is, that a less expensive iPad will more than meet the needs of a gaming and media consumption customer. You need to rewatch the power ad. It focuses mostly on a developer using it, not a casual gamer.

Twitter Apple Music’s new reality show Planet of the Apps, which features celebrities like Jessica Alba and Gwyneth Paltrow judging developers’ ideas, has already been criticized as “dull” and “awkward.” But a new ad campaign urging founders to “put everything on the line” has landed the show in the middle of the age-old debate on work-life balance. It all started with this poster, which Planet of the Apps released yesterday as part of its promotional push: How did they not think this would backfire? Twitter The featured developer, Andrew Kemendo, is an Air Force veteran whose app Pair is an “augmented reality commerce platform” that helps users create catalogs. Apple tweeted out Kemendo’s quote, but deleted it after a barrage of social media criticism and accusations that the company was showing off the worst of Silicon Valley: planet of the apps just deleted this tweet but I screenshot it so we can commend his bravery for eternity pic.twitter.com/D5nYfhqYiC — Melanie Ehrenkranz (@MelanieHannah) June 9, 2017 Pathetic… even Apple is promoting workaholism now.

Apple could not be reached for comment. Kemendo may only be considering this “fact” after his newfound notoriety, but it’s a reality many founders—especially female ones—face all the time. Our column She’s the Boss features kickass women entrepreneurs who fight the work-life balance battle on a daily basis. We’ve also talked to women in tech who missed out on investments simply because they were pregnant. Startup culture and the gig economy as a whole have been accused of advocating workaholism. Earlier this year one of our writers faulted Fiverr, a freelance services marketplace aimed at “doers,” for a series of subway ads which advocated sleep deprivation and “eating coffee for lunch.” One of the campaign’s slogans was “Got an idea?

Iran’s top nuclear scientists were being assassinated in a string of similar attacks: Assailants on motorcycles were pulling up to their moving cars, attaching magnetic bombs and detonating them after the motorcyclists had fled the scene. In another seven years, security experts warn, assassins won’t need motorcycles or magnetic bombs. All they’ll need is a laptop and code to send driverless cars careering off a bridge, colliding with a driverless truck or coming to an unexpected stop in the middle of fast-moving traffic. Automakers may call them self-driving cars. But hackers call them computers that travel over 100 mph. “These are no longer cars,” said Marc Rogers, the principal security researcher at the cybersecurity firm CloudFlare. “These are data centers on wheels. Any part of the car that talks to the outside world is a potential inroad for attackers.” Those fears came into focus two years ago when two “white hat” hackers — researchers who look for computer vulnerabilities to spot problems and fix them, rather than to commit a crime or cause problems — successfully gained access to a Jeep Cherokee from their computer miles away. They rendered their crash-test dummy (in this case a nervous reporter) powerless over his vehicle and disabling his transmission in the middle of a highway. Business Channel The hackers, Chris Valasek and Charlie Miller (now security researchers respectively at Uber and Didi, an Uber competitor in China), discovered an electronic route from the Jeep’s entertainment system to its dashboard. From there, they had control of the vehicle’s steering, brakes and transmission — everything they needed to paralyze their crash test dummy in the middle of a highway. “Car hacking makes great headlines, but remember: No one has ever had their car hacked by a bad guy,” Miller wrote on Twitter last Sunday. “It’s only ever been performed by researchers.” Still, the research by Miller and Valasek came at a steep price for Jeep’s manufacturer, Fiat Chrysler, which was forced to recall 1.4 million of its vehicles as a result of the hacking experiment. It is no wonder that Mary Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, called cybersecurity her company’s top priority last year. Now the skills of researchers and so-called white hat hackers are in high demand among automakers and tech companies pushing ahead with driverless car projects. Uber, Tesla, Apple and Didi in China have been actively recruiting white hat hackers like Miller and Valasek from one another as well as from traditional cybersecurity firms and academia. Last year, Tesla poached Aaron Sigel, Apple’s manager of security for its iOS operating system. Uber poached Chris Gates, formerly a white hat hacker at Facebook. Didi poached Miller from Uber, where he had gone to work after the Jeep hack. And security firms have seen dozens of engineers leave their ranks for autonomous-car projects. Miller said he left Uber for Didi, in part, because his new Chinese employer has given him more freedom to discuss his work. “Carmakers seem to be taking the threat of cyberattack more seriously, but I’d still like to see more transparency from them,” Miller wrote on Twitter Saturday. Like a number of big tech companies, Tesla and Fiat Chrysler started paying out rewards to hackers who turn over flaws the hackers discover in their systems. GM has done something similar, though critics say GM’s program is limited when compared with the ones offered by tech companies, and so far no rewards have been paid out. One year after the Jeep hack by Miller and Valasek, they demonstrated all the other ways they could mess with a Jeep driver, including hijacking the vehicle’s cruise control, swerving the steering wheel 180 degrees or slamming on the parking brake in high-speed traffic — all from a computer in the back of the car. (Those exploits ended with their test Jeep in a ditch and calls to a local tow company.) Granted, they had to be in the Jeep to make all that happen. But it was evidence of what is possible. The Jeep penetration was preceded by a 2011 hack by security researchers at the University of Washington and the University of California, San Diego, who were the first to remotely hack a sedan and ultimately control its brakes via Bluetooth. The researchers warned car companies that the more connected cars become, the more likely they are to get hacked. Security researchers have also had their way with Tesla’s software-heavy Model S car. In 2015, Rogers, together with Kevin Mahaffey, the chief technology officer of the cybersecurity company Lookout, found a way to control various Tesla functions from their physically connected laptop. One year later, a team of Chinese researchers at Tencent took their research a step further, hacking a moving Tesla Model S and controlling its brakes from 12 miles away. Unlike Chrysler, Tesla was able to dispatch a remote patch to fix the security holes that made the hacks possible. In all the cases, the car hacks were the work of well meaning, white hat security researchers. But the lesson for all automakers was clear. The motivations to hack vehicles are limitless. When it learned of Rogers’ and Mahaffey’s investigation into Tesla’s Model S, a Chinese app-maker asked Rogers if he would be interested in sharing, or possibly selling, his discovery, he said. (The app maker was looking for a backdoor to secretly install its app on Tesla’s dashboard.) Criminals have not yet shown they have found back doors into connected vehicles, though for years, they have been actively developing, trading and deploying tools that can intercept car key communications. But as more driverless and semiautonomous cars hit the open roads, they will become a more worthy target. Security experts warn that driverless cars present a far more complex, intriguing and vulnerable “attack surface” for hackers. Each new “connected” car feature introduces greater complexity, and with complexity inevitably comes vulnerability. Twenty years ago, cars had, on average, 1 million lines of code. The General Motors 2010 Chevrolet Volt had about 10 million lines of code — more than an F-35 fighter jet. Today, an average car has more than 100 million lines of code. Automakers predict it won’t be long before they have 200 million. When you stop to consider that, on average, there are 15 to 50 defects per 1,000 lines of software code, the potentially exploitable weaknesses add up quickly. The only difference between computer code and driverless car code is that, “Unlike data center enterprise security — where the biggest threat is loss of data — in automotive security, it’s loss of life,” said David Barzilai, a co-founder of Karamba Security, an Israeli startup that is working on addressing automotive security. To truly secure autonomous vehicles, security experts say, automakers will have to address the inevitable vulnerabilities that pop up in new sensors and car computers, address inherent vulnerabilities in the base car itself and, perhaps most challenging of all, bridge the cultural divide between automakers and software companies. “The genie is out of the bottle, and to solve this problem will require a major cultural shift,” said Mahaffey of the cybersecurity company Lookout. “And an automaker that truly values cybersecurity will treat security vulnerabilities the same they would an air-bag recall. We have not seen that industrywide shift yet.” There will be winners and losers, Mahaffey added: “Automakers that transform themselves into software companies will win. Others will get left behind.”    Catch every San Antonio area moment! Click to like mySA on Facebook.

By Carly Ledbetter Sneakerheads, prepare your wallets.  Apple sneakers made exclusively for employees in the ‘90s are currently for sale online at the auction house Heritage Auctions. Two important things you should know if you’re looking to purchase the sneakers: the shoes are a men’s size 9 1/2 and the starting bid is currently $15,000.  Elon Werner, director of communications with Heritage Auctions, told HuffPost that the shoes came from a garage sale in San Francisco. Werner believes the shoes were a promotional item produced by Apple, though not many pairs were made. He’s only seen one other pair of the Apple shoes before in a size 8 1/2.  Heritage Auctions HAcom We have to admit, they're cool. According to Heritage Auctions, the shoes are estimated to go for over $30,000 at the final sale. For that kind of money, these kicks had better come with Steve Jobs’ signature.  Online bidding on the sneakers has already started and a live auction will be held on Heritage Live this Sunday, June 11.  In 2012, images of a similar Apple sneaker popped up on Imgur:  Apple Sneakers Business Insider reports that a pair of Apple sneakers sold on eBay for $79 in 2007.  If you’re just in the mood to buy some expensive sneakers that have a little wear and tear, and you don’t care too much about Apple, Neiman Marcus has you covered. The retailer is currently selling “Future Destroyed High-Top Sneakers” from luxury designer Maison Margiela for a whopping $1,425.

It’ll be available in December. Photo via Apple Editor’s note: This story was originally published in October 2016 and has been updated with the latest information. Since Google launched its smart home hub, the Google Home—joining the Amazon Echo and Apple HomeKit—the dream of the truly smart home has edged ever closer to reality. Even Ikea has jumped in on the action, announcing in May that its line of smart lighting will be compatible with Amazon’s, Google’s, and Apple’s smart home ecosystems. And, earlier this week, Apple announced the HomePod—an all-in-one speaker and smart home hub not unlike the Amazon Echo—that the company hopes will rival the Echo and offer the sound quality of connected audio systems like Sonos’s line of speakers. While that’s great news for tech evangelists, it’s a potential source of more confusion than excitement for your average consumer, whose knowledge of smart home “ecosystems” is often obscured by the increasing number of options out there. That’s where we come in. From price to compatibility and, of course, style, here are the details on the offerings from Apple, Amazon, and Google: how they differ, how much they cost, and all the basics you need to know. Want more info on how to make your home a smart one? Check out our guide to doing just that. Amazon Echo The Amazon Echo Photo via Amazon When Amazon entered the smart home ecosystem fray in November of 2014, it made quite an impression. For one, the Amazon Echo was the first of its kind: a Bluetooth-connected speaker that also plays music from Spotify and Pandora. But Echo went beyond the usual automated-control-of-lights-and-HVAC home tech paradigm with a voice-activated virtual assistant, Alexa, that can turn on the news, set alarms, give users intel on the day’s weather, and answer simple questions like “How many ounces are in a cup?” The Echo hub—a cylindrical, nearly 9.5-inch-tall unit with a black case and blue indicator lights—has a darker, moodier aesthetic than most of the Wall-E-style, white-and-silver home tech products out there, which also helps set it apart. While many consumers want a device that fades into the background, the Echo offers a similarly unobtrusive unit with a different look. Amazon’s Echo Dot Photo via Flickr Amazon announced a more compact version of the Echo, the Echo Dot, in the spring of 2016, and though the smaller device costs a bit less, it still plays music (at lower quality and volume) and can be given voice commands. Who’s it good for? The Echo is a good option for music fans who also want the smart home experience and are down with trying voice-activated smart home interfaces. The brass tacks: The Echo starts at $179.99, and consumers can purchase it online at Amazon.com or at retail stores like Best Buy. The Echo Dot, which is only available for purchase with an Alexa device like the original Echo or Amazon Tap, retails at half the price of its older sibling, for $89.99. There’s an Echo app for both iOS and Android devices. Apple HomeKit Apple’s HomePod will be available in the U.S., U.K. and Australia in December, for $349. Photo via Apple For a while, Apple wasn’t trying to sell consumers on a new, physical hub with its HomeKit ecosystem. There were some benefits there: A user’s existing, iOS 10-equipped device (including iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and Apple TVs) could serve as a nexus for a consumer’s intelligent apartment through Apple’s Home app and with voice commands given to Siri, the company’s longtime virtual assistant. Earlier this week, though, Apple announced the HomePod, a smart speaker meant to challenge Amazon Echo’s grip on the market and present an alternative to the Sonos line of products, which are lauded by many for their music audio quality at that price point. How successful the HomePod will be is, at the moment, up for debate. Who’s it good for? Apple’s HomePod and HomeKit ecosystem are the choice for iPeople—folks who already have iOS 10-equipped or iOS 10-ready mobile devices (and that’s a lot of us). If you primarily use an Android device, HomeKit isn’t the best option for you. A HomePod is going to appeal to Apple fans, of course, and to those who go for audio quality over inexpensiveness: At $349, the HomePod is pricier than its competitors. The brass tacks: The Home app comes standard with iOS 10 on any Apple mobile device. You can purchase Apple HomeKit-compatible devices on the Apple website or at an Apple retail shop, as well as at retailers like Target, Best Buy, and Walmart. The HomePod isn’t yet available, though: Apple is bringing it to U.S., U.K., and Australian stores in December, when it will retail for $349. Google Home Photo via Google Google Home is a direct competitor to Amazon Echo: Home, too, is voice activated (“OK Google”), can play music (from your Google Play, Spotify, YouTube Music, Pandora, or TuneIn accounts), set alarms, spout dictionary definitions, and, of course, control lights and thermostats. For now, Google Home doesn’t work with nearly as many home tech products as Amazon Echo—which supports nearly 300 services—but expanded compatibility is likely to come with time. And, as one Curbed reader points out, integrations with IFTTT opens up a world of possibilities for users who want to get their Google Home units to complete certain tasks for them, like adding calendar reminders. For now, Home works with some of the most prominent smart home companies, like Nest, Philips Hue, and anything SmartThings-branded. And, if you already use a Google Chromecast, you’re good to go there, too. Who’s it good for? Google Home is great for people trying to save money (it retails for $109, compared to Amazon Echo’s $179.99) and folks who dig the customizable, colorful speaker grilles available for each unit. It’s also fine for those who don’t mind the rather limited number of products it’s compatible with—at least for now. Odds are, the average user won’t need more than what’s available. The brass tacks: Google Home is available for purchase online and at retailers like Best Buy, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Williams-Sonoma. It’ll run you about $109, plus tax.

Rafael Reif (left) chatted with Tim Cook during the procession Friday. By Sara Salinas Globe Correspondent  June 09, 2017 CAMBRIDGE — Apple chief executive Tim Cook urged MIT graduates Friday to infuse their work with humanity, cautioning that technology alone is not enough. “If you choose to live your lives at that intersection between technology and the people it serves, if you strive to create the best, give the best, do the best for everyone, not just for some, then today all of humanity has good cause for hope,” Cook told the 2,900 graduates, their families, and guests gathered on Killian Court on the sunny morning. Advertisement Cook drew chuckles from the audience — who greeted him by waving their iPhones in the air — as he recounted his path to the top of the transformative tech company. “I went to grad school at Duke, looking for the answer,” he said of his search for purpose. “I tried meditation. I sought guidance in religion. I read great philosophers and authors. And in a moment of youthful indiscretion, I might even have experimented with a Windows PC.” Get Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Sign up for more newsletters here But after Cook’s search landed him at Apple, he said, he found purpose in a company with a simple mission: serve humanity. View Story Tim Cook made an appearance at the Boylston Street Apple store Apple’s chief executive was spotted at the store after he addressed MIT’s commencement. “And it was in that moment, after 15 years of searching, something clicked. I finally felt aligned,” he said. Cook encouraged the graduates to work for something greater than themselves, and in doing so, find meaning. Advertisement He also advised them: “Don’t listen to trolls, and for God’s sake, don’t become one.” Cook acknowledged that technology designed to connect us can actually divide us. He highlighted threats to security and to privacy, and the antisocial aspects of social media as some of technology’s inherent pitfalls. “I’m more concerned about people thinking like computers — without values or compassion, without concern for consequences,” he said. But technology can often be the solution, he said, and as new alumni of MIT, the graduates were already on track to see that realized. “If we are ever going to solve some of the hardest problems still facing the world today — everything from cancer to climate change to educational inequality — then technology will help us do it,” Cook said. He marveled at the “big ideas” that have already come out of MIT, including trademark student hacks. “I’ll never figure out how MIT students sent that Mars rover to the Kresge Oval, or put a propeller beanie on the Great Dome, or how you’ve obviously taken over the president’s Twitter account,” Cook joked. “I can tell college students are behind it because most of the tweets have been at 3 a.m.” Cook, who took over at Apple in 2011, oversaw the rollout of the iPhone 7 and the Apple Watch. He previously served as chief operating officer and headed the Macintosh division. In his address Friday, he highlighted his company’s products and core values as examples of technology that puts people first. The Apple Watch that can detect a heart condition before it becomes a heart attack, for example, or the iPad that can connect children with autism to the world around them. “When you keep people at the center of what you do, it can have an enormous impact,” he said. Cook spoke at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology just two weeks after Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg delivered the commencement speech at Harvard University. Zuckerberg spoke to Harvard’s graduates as peers within the same generation, setting their sights on achievement. Cook spoke to the MIT graduates as a generation coming up to meet lofty expectations. The responsibility is immense, he said, but so is the opportunity. “I’m optimistic because I believe in your generation, your passion, your journey to serve humanity,” Cook said. “We are all counting on you.” Sara Salinas can be reached at sara.salinas@globe.com.

News provided by Germinder & Associates, Inc. 09 Jun, 2017, 12:19 ET Share this article NEW YORK, June 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- There's always time to give back, and encourage excellence. Following through on #GerminderPR's commitment to PRSA and the public relations profession, Germinder & Associates, Inc., an agency specializing in the $67 billion pet industry, is set to host a select group of students as part of its custom PRSA-NY Big Apple $10,000 Diamond Sponsorship. Hot on the heels of the agency's introduction of GNFP Digital and the strategic move of the Germinder & Associates midtown New York City offices to WeWork/SoHo West, the agency will host students at the PRSA-NY June 12 Big Apple event. The agency has also invited students to interview for internships and professional development sessions following the event. Agency Founder & President Lea-Ann Germinder, APR Fellow PRSA hopes to create a similar sponsorship next year in Kansas City. It's all about encouraging excellence for this past recipient of the PRSA Silver Anvil Award of Excellence, and an opportunity to give back.

Germinder & Associates' Silver Anvil Award for the "Pets Need Dental Care, Too!" campaign. "I've been mentoring and sponsoring students at these types of events for many years, but this is our biggest commitment yet. I know larger agencies can do so much more, but if we can have an impact on just one student to join the public relations profession, and become a star, I've done my job. I began my public relations career largely because I joined PRSSA, became a student leader and developed PRSA contacts. So, to me, the PRSSA students hold a special place in my heart," said Germinder. Germinder hopes the students will learn at the event how public relations has changed and see all the great campaigns from a wide variety of organizations. While Germinder's GNFP Digital is brand-new, she hopes to enter some campaigns next year. GNFP Digital will apply Germinder's well-honed brand of strategic counsel, spokesperson and crisis training expertise in the pet industry coupled with the latest expertise in the digital space.

Titled “A new kind of power” and “The amazing Apple Pencil”, the new videos run sixteen seconds long each and highlight the features of the new 10.5-inch iPad Pro with the thinner side bezels, upgraded display and CPU, Apple Pencil and more. A new kind of power “You could feel the power of the A10x Fusion chip, if your computer was the new iPad Pro.” The amazing Apple Pencil “You could write with basically no lag, if your computer was the new iPad Pro.” The very first ad featuring the 10.5-inch iPad Pro was released on Monday. Like prior “Real problems…answered” ads, the latest ones are based on real tweets from real people. Yesterday, Apple released a new “Shot on iPhone” commercial, titled “Earth”, based on some powerful narration by the late cosmologist and science popularizer Carl Sagan.

In a commencement address, Cook — who as Apple's chief executive since 2011 has overseen the rollout of the iPhone 7 and the Apple Watch — said the company is constantly looking for ways to combine tech with a sense of humanity and compassion.

(AP Photo/Matt Dunham) Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during a commencement address at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Friday, June 9, 2017, in Cambridge, Mass. Cook told MIT graduates and their families that technology without basic human values is worthless. (John Wilcox/The Boston Herald via AP) "Whatever you do in your life, and whatever we do at Apple, we must infuse it with the humanity that we are born with," said Cook, who previously served as chief operating officer and headed the Macintosh division. "That responsibility is immense. But so is the opportunity," he said. Cook said Apple wants to make products that help people. As examples, he cited iPhone technology that can help a blind athlete run a marathon and an iPad that connects an autistic child to the world around them. "When you keep people at the centre of what you do, it can impact," he said. Cook said he isn't worried about artificial intelligence giving computers the ability to think like humans. "I'm more concerned about people thinking like computers without values or compassion or concern for the consequences," he said. "That is what we need you to help us guard against. Because if science is a search in the darkness, then the humanities are a candle that shows us where we have been and the danger that lies ahead." Cook also urged graduates to resist becoming cynical. "The internet enabled so much and empowered so many, but it can also be a place where basic rules of decency are suspended and pettiness and negativity thrive," he said. "Don't let that noise knock you off course. Don't get caught up in the trivial aspects of life. Don't listen to trolls, and don't become one. Measure impact in humanity; not in the likes, but the lives you touch and the people you serve."

A true “dark mode” to change Apple’s mostly light-colored user interface like the option it has for menus and the dock on macOS is still absent. But in iOS 11, we get the next best thing with a new feature called ‘Smart Invert Colors’. For many, this feature will satisfy their dark mode needs until an official feature is introduced. Here’s how to enable it… The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac The feature is an enhanced version of Apple’s old “invert colors” Accessibility feature, a function that inverts all colors on the display for users with vision impairments that either have trouble reading the normal user interface or experience discomfort when staring at the default light color scheme for prolonged periods of time. But some users that want an inverted interface might also want to view their content like photos and graphics in the original format and colors, and that’s where the new Smart mode comes in. Instead of inverting all colors, ‘Smart Invert Colors’ only inverts the UI, meaning things like graphics, images, and app icons are all preserved in their original form. The result is a sort of dark UI or dark mode for iOS 11 with the rest of the content mostly remaining the same. Within Settings → Accessibility you’ll find the new “Smart Invert Colors” option located under ‘Display Accommodations’ (as pictured above). Apple isn’t getting rid of the old invert colors option as some disabled users might prefer it, but it’s changing the name to “Classic Invert” as it introduces the new “Smart” mode. Smart Invert Colors Default iOS Classic Invert Colors For example, the wallpaper and app icons on the Home screen don’t get inverted with the new smart mode, but you’ll notice the dock and other parts of the UI, like the text in the status bar, do. Pictured above we have all three modes to compare, including the default iOS and the new Smart Invert and the old Classic Invert color modes. In the Photos app, for instance, the new Smart Invert mode will give you the original photo content with the rest of the UI inverted. For apps like Clock and Activity that already have a dark UI, Smart Invert Colors will know not to change anything and preserve the dark interface. iOS 11 default colors Classic Invert iOS 11 Smart Invert iOS 11 Smart Invert Above you see the App Store with the new Smart Invert Colors mode compared to the classic invert mode and iOS 11’s default colors (click above for full size). The smart mode is able to detect that there is an image present and maintains its original format while inverting the rest of the UI. And here’s what menus in the Settings app look like with Smart Invert (notice that the graphics for the toggle buttons remain the same unlike with the old invert mode): The new mode isn’t perfect, however. There are occasions where it will not detect a photo and still inverts its colors (like in the Music and App Store apps in our tests), but so far it’s the closest thing yet to a true dark mode on iOS. And we’re still in beta for iOS 11, so it’s likely Apple and third-party devs will make tweaks to improve the new feature further before release this fall.

But that won’t be the case for Apple’s newest iPhones, devices to go on sale later this year, leaving the company’s most important product potentially lagging behind the data performance of rival smartphones. Tell a friend File image The reason stems from the delicate and sometimes complicated way Apple manages the supply of the components embedded in its flagship device in this case, the modems, which handle the connection between a phone and the cellular network. One of Apple’s suppliers, Qualcomm, sells a modem capable of the 1 gigabit download speeds. Another supplier, Intel, is working on a modem with the same capability, but it won’t be ready for the iPhone’s introduction, according to people familiar with Apple’s decision. Read also: Apple launches 'Do Not Disturb While Driving'  Apple could in theory just use Qualcomm’s chips, but it has an aversion to being dependent on a single supplier, and its relationship with San Diego-based Qualcomm is particularly thorny. Cupertino, California-based Apple is embroiled in a bitter legal fight with the chipmaker, accusing the supplier of maintaining an illegal monopoly, and it’s seeking to loosen Qualcomm’s grip on the market for high-end smartphone modems. That’s why Apple will stick with Qualcomm modems for some of its new iPhones while relying on Intel for others. Until Intel is able to offer its chips with matching features, Apple won’t enable some of capabilities of the phones running with Qualcomm modems, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plan isn’t public. Apple, Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment. Apple’s decision clashes with the marketing plans of a cellular industry desperate to show off faster network speeds to grab market share. The top US wireless carriers, Verizon AT&T, T-Mobile US and Sprint have declared 2017 the year of 1 gigabit speeds. Apple used two modem suppliers and the same technique to mask performance disparities for last year’s iPhone 7. But the rise of gigabit wireless networks could make the strategy more risky: iPhone users will have a unified experience, no matter what modem is inside the new device, but it could look even less speedy compared to newer gigabit-ready smartphones from other manufacturers. The carriers will be able to boast about 1 gigabit speeds if customers use other phones. Samsung Electronic’s Galaxy S8, the main rival to the next iPhones, has Qualcomm’s X16 LTE modem and will keep up with the top speeds of the major wireless networks. Sprint sells the gigabit-ready HTC U11 and will have a Motorola Gigabit LTE phone later this year. Apple’s decision to introduce new technology when it wants, rather than chase whatever the market dictates, isn’t new. The original iPhone launched in 2007 without support for 3G networks, and it was still wildly successful. It wasn’t until 2012 that the iPhone supported LTE technology that’s the basis of 4G networks a year after Samsung Electronics added that capability to its smartphones. Still, Apple is dealing with a market that’s crying out for innovation to revive growth. Last year, the company’s revenue from iPhones, which generates more than 60 percent of Apple’s $216 billion annual sales, fell for the first time. Smartphone total market growth was just 2.5 percent, breaking a run of double-digit annual surges, according to industry analyst IDC. Whether Apple’s decision will overshadow the company’s slick new design and features in the phone coming later this year, as well as its customer loyalty, remains to be seen. Achieving 1 gigabit data speeds requires almost lab-like optimal signal conditions that seldom occur in the real world. Nonetheless, the first carrier to claim such network capabilities will get bragging rights and an edge at selling the promise of instantaneous movie downloads and high-quality live video. It’s one area where service providers can’t afford to be seen as laggards. Luring Customers The carriers are already in a fierce price battle for subscribers. As the pool of new customers has declined, most of the user gains are coming at the expense of rivals. Sprint and T-Mobile have been taking customers from AT&T and Verizon by offering cheaper unlimited data at a time when video hungry users seek lower-cost plans to support their habits. The ability to advertise a service that’s 100-times faster may help carriers shifts consumer focus to network performance and away from cut-throat pricing. T-Mobile promised to have the first 1 gigabit data service available in the US this year and has already started making network upgrades, Chief Technology Officer Neville Ray said in February. AT&T has started 1 gigabit mobile service in Austin, Texas, and plans to expand to as many as 20 cities this year. Verizon will begin 5G trials in 11 markets this summer and plans to start mobile testing of 1 gigabit speeds in those cities. Sprint has been one of the most aggressive proponents of 1 gigabit mobile speeds, promising in December that it would offer the fastest service in the industry. Sprint said it will have at least three 1 gigabit capable phones available this year with the exception of iPhones.

Products which display their own pop-up boxes asking you for ratings or reviews will no longer be accepted on Apple's platform. It is offering an official API instead. Apple introduced its own rate and review prompts a few months ago. These let you rate an app from the prompt, without redirecting to the store. This should benefit everyone as users will be able to avoid switching apps, theoretically leading to more people providing a rating. Developers can get feedback from users without having to display multiple pop-ups. Apple is now enforcing its official method as the only way for an app to request feedback. As spotted by 9to5Mac, Apple's revised policies prevent apps from displaying their own review prompts. Developers will have to use the company's API to get iOS to request a rating from the user on their behalf. Once the user has rated the app, they won't ever be prompted again. This puts an end to the successive alerts that many apps display because they don't know if you've taken action. The change has come as a product of another App Store update that means apps won't lose all their ratings and reviews after they are updated. If you choose not to rate an app and decline the prompt instead, iOS will note your response. The app is allowed to display the message again, up to a limit of three times per year. This will stop apps from annoying you with consecutive messages. There's nothing the developer can do to display the prompt again when the limit has been reached. In another option, you can disable app review prompts altogether. A toggle switch in the Settings app under "iTunes & App Store" lets you turn off the feature entirely, ensuring you'll never be bothered by apps that keep pestering you with rating requests. The clamp-down should have a positive net effect on the App Store ecosystem. Users may be more likely to rate an app when the prompts are infrequent and supplied by iOS. Developers will have an increased chance of receiving a rating, providing they respect the user's choice. Inevitably, there have been some initial grumblings though, particularly around the three-per-year limit. This could cause issues if an app is updated and the developer wants to receive feedback on the new version. Under the old system, apps could try to improve ratings after a bug-fixing update by asking users to revise their score. This won't be possible anymore if the user has already rated the app. It's possible Apple could adjust the API to include leniency around updates in a future revision. As the policy is now a part of Apple's App Store guidelines, it's effective immediately. It's likely the company will extend a grace period to developers while they switch to using its new API, so you can expect to keep seeing prompts for a few more months. The company is expected to start enforcing the rule more stringently when the redesigned App Store launches with iOS 11 later this year.

On Tuesday, Apple debuted the first episode of its new ... more Photo: Marcio Jose Sanchez /Associated Press Apple’s first try with online television gets mixed reviews 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Even as Apple sought to wow the public this week by announcing loads of new hardware and software updates, the tech company was preparing for a major new experiment in a very different part of its business: online television. On Tuesday, Apple debuted the first episode of its new reality show featuring Gwyneth Paltrow, will.i.am, Jessica Alba and the entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk as a panel of judges. Known as “Planet of the Apps,” the show places fresh-faced app developers on the spot for a chance at winning funding and a promising future. Contestants have one minute to deliver an “escalator pitch” to the judges on an actual moving walkway; if they survive the round, they may win mentoring from a judge before making another pitch to a venture capital firm. Tech geeks and fans of CNBC’s “Shark Tank” are already warming to the series. But early signs suggest it may prove less accessible to Apple’s more casual viewers. The show, which is available on iTunes as well as Apple Music, gets the iPhone-maker’s feet wet in the increasingly competitive world of streaming media. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Business Channel Companies as diverse as AT&T, Facebook and CBS are all tinkering with ways to attract viewers to their online videos. This exclusive content provides companies with a potentially lucrative ad-revenue stream as more Americans shift their Internet consumption to digital video, particularly on mobile devices. More than half of all mobile Internet consumption is taken up by video today, according to a recent report by the networking company Cisco. That figure is expected to grow to 78 percent by 2021. In addition to “Planet of the Apps,” Apple released a music documentary in December and has plans in August to air new episodes of “Carpool Karaoke,” a show popularized by TV host James Corden in which Corden sings along with his celebrity guests to music while behind the wheel of a car. “Planet of the Apps” reflects a big bet on the future of Apple’s app-driven ecosystem. For years, Apple has touted the popularity of its app store and its role in creating a whole new cottage industry of programmers. By highlighting the nuts and bolts of conceiving and pitching an app, Apple gives new, nascent entrepreneurs a better peek into the industry that helps sustain the company’s profits. (Apple takes a 30 percent cut of every app sold from its App Store, adding up to $28 billion a year in revenue.) But on the show, that obsession with process often comes at the expense of the elements that typically make reality TV click, according to some critics. “The biggest problem with ‘Planet of the Apps’ is that it doesn’t know what it’s selling - which should be the contestants,” wrote Maureen Ryan, Variety’s chief TV critic, in a review. “It should turn them into compelling TV characters and make their quests dramatic, but it does a mediocre-to-poor job on those fronts.” The show’s reviews on iTunes haven’t fared much better. As of Wednesday afternoon, “Planet of the Apps” had a 2.5-star rating out of 5, with five reviewers. One user who goes by the handle “switcher2” said the judges lacked the expertise to evaluate the contestants’ offerings. Others said the moving walkway was a bit of a gimmick. Still, many are willing to give “Planet of the Apps” a chance, particularly those who are part of or already familiar with the tech industry. “As a tech entrepreneur myself, I found it to be super compelling, accurate, and inspiring!” wrote one commenter, Namon Eugene, on Variety’s review. “I think you have to be in the tech world to appreciate the show.” “If you like Shark Tank, you’ll probably enjoy Apple’s ‘Planet of the Apps,’” read one headline on the Next Web. While “Planet of the Apps” may appeal to a niche audience, Apple’s enormous overall fan base is likely to contain enough potential viewers to keep the show going - at least until the company launches its next big move in TV.    Catch every San Antonio area moment!

New, 40 comments by Paul Miller@futurepaul Jun 9, 2017, 12:00pm EDT share tweet Linkedin Apple I was really excited to see Apple talk about VR at WWDC this year. It's a sign that Apple can embrace a market it doesn't entirely control, or possibly even fully understand. Microsoft, Google, and Facebook all now offer some form of AR or VR hardware and software stack, and the ways they're investing in the future of these markets are fairly clear. But I'm still left with a lot of questions about where exactly Apple is headed. First, let's make it clear what was actually announced: Metal 2, an expanded version of Apple's Metal graphics API. Metal 2 now allows developers to bypass the macOS windowing system and render directly to a device — a VR headset, in this case. Super important for low latency. Official support for external GPUs. This means developers with lower-end iMacs, or even MacBooks, can get good enough GPU performance to play back VR, with some caveats. SteamVR and the HTC Vive now work with the Mac. Valve has been working with Apple on this since last summer, which shows a high level of technical and business confidence in Apple's VR efforts. Unreal Engine 4 and Unity, the two most popular development environments for games right now, will support Metal 2 VR development on macOS. Apple also gave a definition of what it believes to be VR: What's lacking here is any sort of clear story for consumers. Apple even specifically stated during its VR deep-dive that the external GPUs are primarily targeted at developers. And Apple's splash page description of its VR-ready iMacs is aimed at content makers, not gamers: VR makes its debut on iMac, with the ability to edit 360° video in apps like Final Cut Pro and create cutting-edge 3D VR content. So I see two main possibilities here. Either Apple merely wants to support developers and artists in VR, while being content to allow the experiences they create to be mostly consumed on third-party platforms like Facebook's Oculus, Google's Daydream, and PCs running SteamVR. Or Apple has a bigger plan for consumers beyond Metal 2 and external GPUs. There’s something a little wrong with the first option: right now it's almost silly to develop VR using Metal 2. It's an Apple-specific API that only works on Macs, iPhones, and iPads. Obviously traditional iOS game development, and other apps that depend on GPU acceleration, can benefit greatly from the improvements in Metal 2. But the return on investment for building a full VR title for macOS using Apple's technology would be minuscule — a sliver of an already small market. A sliver of an already small market If Apple truly wanted to create the best system for cross-platform VR development, it could embrace Vulkan, which is similar to Metal but also works on Windows and Linux. In fact, Valve uses Vulkan for SteamVR on Linux. It's conceivable that developers who make games in OpenGL or Vulkan for Windows and Linux can port their titles to macOS with a small Metal 2 shim, but something written entirely in Metal 2 is stranded on macOS. Of course, a majority of developers won't have to focus too much on these details. If you build something in Unity or Unreal Engine 4, both of which have promised to support Metal 2, most of the work of porting the title to various other platforms is solved for you. And it makes sense for these engines to target Metal 2, even without macOS VR, because iOS games are such a huge market. So maybe I'm reading too much into this. But something tells me this is only Apple's first, developer-focused step into VR, and that the consumer part of the story is still to come. Maybe Apple will release a slide-in VR headset for the upcoming iPhone. Or perhaps something bigger, like standalone AR hardware, is actually in the works. But even if this just means Apple is going to focus on gamers with affordable, VR-friendly computers, I won't be mad.

As usual, however, there are a few more enhancements in HomeKit under the hood beyond what Apple talked about — the first iOS 11 developer preview reveals some nice improvements to HomeKit automation rules that should make the platform considerably more useful for those who have invested in advanced HomeKit environments. Timers Automation rules can now include a timer setting that will automatically reverse the rule after a specified number of minutes. So, for example, you could have a rule that turns on a light when motion is detected, but automatically turns it off after five minutes. Time ranges can be set in minutes from 1 minute up to 60 minutes after the rule is first triggered, and will of course reset each time the rule is triggered. This will be particularly useful for motion sensors that don’t already have “no motion detected” triggers built in, but we can see it also being handy for home comfort devices like fans and air conditioners. Timer-based rules are a new core feature of HomeKit, not just a new option in Apple’s “Home” app, and therefore require a Home Hub — an iPad or Apple TV — that’s also running iOS 11 or tvOS 11. In you haven’t upgraded your Apple TV or iPad to tvOS/iOS 11, the timer option will be greyed out with a note to that effect. For now, timers are a feature unique to the Apple Home app, although we’re fairly confident at least some third-party HomeKit apps will begin offering this option as well by the time iOS 11 is released. Sunrise/Sunset Times The iOS 11 Home app will now allow you to customize your “Sunrise” and “Sunset” settings to trigger rules based on a certain amount of time before or after. When selecting a pre-defined time or time window (such as “Sunrise” or “Only at night”), you can tap the “i” icon at the right to specify the amount of time before or after sunrise and sunset that you want the trigger or condition to apply. Multi-Person Location Triggers One of the biggest limitations of HomeKit’s location triggers is that they’re only applicable to one person — the primary HomeKit user. Rules that turn off the lights and turn down the heat when leaving are very handy for folks who live alone, but chances are that most people don’t want to leave their spouse, kids, or roommates in a dark and cold house just because they happen to be heading out. Fortunately, it appears that iOS 11 will address this by changing the default location rule to apply to “people” leaving or arriving, as opposed to just the primary user. You’ll be able to create HomeKit rules and choose who is included for any given rule, and for obvious reasons you’ll only be able to include those users you’ve invited to share your HomeKit access with. It also appears that your additional HomeKit users will need to be running iOS 11 on at least one of their devices in order to be included. Users can also choose whether or not they can be included in HomeKit rules — a new Share When I’m Home toggle in the main Home settings allows users to opt in or out of being included in location triggers. Further, as this setting implies, multi-person location triggers are currently limited to determining whether people are at home or not; you will still be able to set up rules to trigger based on any location that you happen to arrive at or leave from, but you’ll only be able to include other users when the location is set to “Home.” Occupancy Conditions Similarly, you can now set “occupancy” conditions in HomeKit rules to only trigger actions when people are either home or away. A new “Restrict Location” toggle now appears when setting rule conditions, allowing you to only run the rule if you’re home, not home, if anybody is home, or nobody is home. Speakers During Apple’s WWDC 2017 Keynote, the company announced that support for managing speakers would be coming to HomeKit as well, as part of a new “AirPlay 2” protocol. Although Apple noted that the Apple TV would support AirPlay 2, it’s unclear whether the HomeKit speaker management capabilities would apply in this case. At this point, no AirPlay speakers are appearing as HomeKit devices in the first iOS 11 beta — it’s likely that these features will require HomeKit-specific hardware. It’s a safe bet, however, that Apple’s new HomePod will be among the first devices to provide full AirPlay 2 and HomeKit support. More Open Accessory Support Although we probably won’t see the impact of this for a while, Apple announced during a later developer session at WWDC that the company will be loosening the reins on developing HomeKit accessories, helping developers get started in building them with fewer restrictions, and — most significantly — eliminating the need for a hardware MFi chip to provide authentication and encryption. The latter can now be done through software, meaning that accessory makers will be able to provide firmware upgrades for existing accessories to enable HomeKit support. While this would have been a welcome change two years ago, our take is that it’s better late than never, and to be fair we can’t argue with Apple’s more cautious approach to security when it comes to home automation. However, considering how fast competing platforms such as Amazon Alexa have pulled ahead due to their software-only implementations, this should hopefully help HomeKit catch up both in terms of the number of accessories available and how quickly we see HomeKit support added to newer accessories. So what you do think of these new HomeKit improvements? Are they enough to get your more excited about Apple’s home automation platform, or do you think it’s lagging behind the competition? What else would you like to see in HomeKit? Share your thoughts in our comments!

The software will only operate on 64-bit devices, older models, including the iPhone 5 and 5C, will no longer receive updates for features or security fixes. iOS 11 also removes support for 32-bit apps, which means some of the current applications will stop working once the user performs the upgrade – regardless of smartphone or tablet model.  Apple’s iOS 11 was shown to have a range of new and exciting features, but it has been recently revealed that users with older models of the iPhone and iPad will not get the chance to enjoy them  SHOULD YOU SKIP APPLE'S IOS 11?  Apple's iOS 11 was designed to only operate on 64-bit devices, older models, including the iPhone 5 and 5C, will no longer receive updates for features or security fixes. iOS 11 also removes support for 32-bit apps, which means some of the current applications will stop working once the user performs the upgrade – regardless of smartphone or tablet model. Users can check which of their applications may be affected by going to: Settings > General > About > Applications > App Compatibility.  Apple has been encouraging developers to make the adjustments necessary, but has maintained support for the older 32-bit software until now. A previous version of the iPhone operating system warned 32-bit apps 'may slow down your iPhone'. But a warning was spotted in the iOS 10.3 beta which read: 'This app will not work with future versions of iOS. The developer of this app needs to update it to improve its compatibility.' Users can check which of their applications may be affected by going to: Settings > General > About > Applications > App Compatibility. Because the software will only operate on 64-bit devices, older models, including the iPhone 5 (pictured) and 5C, will no longer receive updates for features or security fixes Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller speaks about the new iPhone 5C on September 10, 2013 in Cupertino.

Siri has also received an upgrade, allowing users to choose from a male or female person, along with a new app that can show users on screen information. And the virtual assistant has been redesigned to translate into different languages. iOS 11 also removes support for 32-bit apps, which means some of the current applications will stop working once the user performs the upgrade – regardless of smartphone or tablet model WHAT'S NEW IN iOS 11?

Her music catalog is now available on other streaming services such as Spotify and Amazon Music Prime. That’s good news for Apple’s streaming music competitors, and it doesn’t necessarily mean the singer had a falling out with the company. Taylor Swift’s music catalog now available on all streaming music services Taylor Swift’s management team shared the news on Twitter saying it was a celebration of her 1989 album selling over 10 million albums worldwide. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ pic.twitter.com/kcpY03qHLp — Taylor Nation (@taylornation13) June 8, 2017 The official proclamation hasn’t stopped speculation that Swift and Apple had some sort of falling out. With bad blood in the mix, she chose to end her exclusive streaming deal with Apple. Taylor Swift versus Apple Music Swift called out Apple in 2015 when Apple Music was launching over artist payment terms. She penned an open letter criticizing the iPhone and iPad maker for not paying royalties for songs streamed during Apple Music’s three-month free trial period that caught the media’s attention, and apparently the attention of Apple’s executive staff, too. Apple reversed course and announced it would pay artists when their songs were streamed even when they’re played during a listener’s free trial period. Eddy Cue, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Internet Services and Software, said her letter was instrumental in the company’s decision to change its royalty payment terms. Swift’s win for artists turned into a win for Apple, too, because her 1989 album became an Apple Music exclusive. She also pulled her library from all other streaming services because they weren’t paying artists for songs streamed on their free tiers, making her all Apple Music all the time. Goodbye Exclusive Apple Music Deal It’s possible Swift ended her exclusive Apple Music deal because she’s locking horns with Apple again over the music industry. She’s had issues with Apple before, so it could happen again. While that would make for an enticing story, I think the reality is much more mundane: Swift’s contract for Apple Music exclusivity ended and it wasn’t worth it to renew the deal. Apple’s competitors now pay royalties for songs on their free streaming levels, killing her reason for going exclusively with Apple Music. As the streaming music market grows, it’s also harder to justify sticking with just one. Appearing on multiple services makes more sense now because it increases visibility and bumps up the potential royalty earnings an artist can make. It makes more sense that Swift’s Apple Music exclusivity ended because her contract expired and it didn’t make financial sense for her or Apple to strike a new deal. In the end, it’s all about the money and not the emotions.

The phone’s overall look was expected to remain the same while internal components, like the processor and cameras, got upgrades. Based on a report from Apple’s parts supply chain, however, that’s not the case. This year’s new iPhones will come with an aluminum frame and glass front and back, they say. The report comes courtesy of supply chain sources speaking with DigiTimes. They’re basing the information on component orders, which isn’t necessarily a clear indication of Apple’s plans. Since supply chain sources have extremely limited information about Apple’s product plans they typically have to offer up what they share with a healthy dose of skepticism. That said, the idea of a significantly redesigned iPhone lineup following the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus is interesting. We’ve been expecting a completely new model this fall in the form of the iPhone 8, but the idea of a complete refresh for the rest of the lineup is new. The iPhone 8 is expected to sport an OLED display that’s about the same size as the 5.5-inch screen in the iPhone 7 Plus, but in a body that’s only slightly larger than the iPhone 7. The screen will run nearly edge-to-edge on the phone’s face with a virtual Home button and Touch ID sensors embedded in the glass. The new model will also include a glass back with wireless charging support, a more powerful A-series processor, and front-facing camera with 3D sensors. If Apple is giving the iPhone 8 a glass back, it’s possible the company is doing the same for the other models it releases this year. If Apple is going down that path, that fits with tossing the usual refresh cycle out the window—which we’re already seeing because the iPhone 8 is a premium phone launching along side the typical annual upgrade. We’ve already seen several big product announcements this week at Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference event in San Jose. Based on what we’re hearing now it looks like several more are in store for this year.

Her first three albums haven’t been available since November 2014, and her October 2014 release 1989 has never been on the service before today. It’s the end of what has inarguably been the biggest, messiest controversy of the paid streaming era, and my colleague Micah Singleton has plenty of thoughts on how it happened and what it means for the music industry. But I’m also interested in what this decision means for Taylor Swift. Not as a pop star or Katy Perry’s nemesis (happy album release day, Katy!) or a lightning rod for controversy — but as Taylor Swift the economist, the moralist, and the vague symbol for artists’ rights. what does this mean for taylor swift the moralist? To put Swift into some context I think is often ignored, she’s not just one of the biggest pop stars in the world: She’s also its most successful, prolific, and recognizable contemporary songwriter. That’s a designation she’s proven she cares about. She can make hundreds of millions touring as an A-list performer, but it still makes sense that a prodigiously talented young woman who was written off for years on the basis of her diaristic songwriting and frivolous interest in glitter would transition into adult pop stardom in part on a platform of business savvy and semi-empowering rhetoric about the value of her own labor. She’s uniquely positioned to speak authoritatively on this issue as a public-facing brand and a behind-the-scenes creative. Though, that doesn’t guarantee that her stance on streaming is logically sound. July 2014: “Valuable things should be paid for” In a now-infamous essay for The Wall Street Journal, Swift wrote: "Music is art, and art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should be paid for. It's my opinion that music should not be free, and my prediction is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an album's price point is." The thrust of this argument takes a few things for granted that weren’t true, even in 2014: For one, that Swift could use her personal situation as a standard by which to gauge the industry’s dealings with artists. More importantly, that music takes its value from being “rare,” and for another, that the concept of a concrete “price point” for an album was still one that made any sense. There is no such thing as “rare” when you’re talking about content that’s distributed primarily via the internet. Album sales, digital and physical, were already plummeting by the time Swift offered up these thoughts, and many of her young fans were more likely to listen to her music on YouTube, paying for the experience with auto-play ads, than they were to have gone to a Target and laid down their $14.99. But the biggest flaw in Taylor Swift’s argument? She’s Taylor Swift. Related Streaming is making the music industry more unequal She, and other top artists, stand to make millions of dollars from streaming no matter what happens, and Spotify and Apple Music even push them further ahead of the crowd by way of recommendation algorithms, featured playlists, and paid exclusives. Nothing she says will ever apply evenly to the people who might really suffer. November 2014: Streaming is “an experiment” Swift’s 1989 was conspicuously missing from Spotify when it was released in October 2014, and Swift yanked the rest of her catalogue a month later. Days later, she explained the decision saying: “[A]ll I can say is that music is changing so quickly, and the landscape of the music industry itself is changing so quickly, that everything new, like Spotify, all feels to me a bit like a grand experiment. And I'm not willing to contribute my life's work to an experiment that I don't feel fairly compensates the writers, producers, artists, and creators of this music. And I just don't agree with perpetuating the perception that music has no value and should be free... I thought, ‘I will try this; I'll see how it feels.’ It didn't feel right to me.” Spotify had as much fun as it could with the controversy at first, writing her a pun-filled public note and promoting a playlist called “What to Play While Taylor’s Away,” so it’s mildly interesting that they’ve refrained from gloating about today’s victory. When reached for comment, a Spotify spokesperson would say only “We can confirm that Taylor Swift’s entire back catalogue is now available on Spotify for her millions of fans to enjoy,” a fact which anyone with internet access can also confirm. The spokesperson also linked to a “This Is: Taylor Swift” playlist, which looks just like the “This Is” playlist for every major artist, and has the simple tagline “She’s back. Stream all of her greatest hits now.” Whether or not Swift’s stance on Spotify made sense, its obviously just glad to have her back, and no longer interested in going toe-to-toe. Or maybe Spotify doesn’t feel the need to point out the obvious: Streaming isn’t an experiment now, it’s just the way things are. Swift doesn’t exactly look like a hypocrite here, but she does look like someone who bet on the wrong horse. March 2015: Tidal is fine For reasons that went unexplained by anyone from Swift’s camp, she decided one spring day to put all of her music except 1989 on Tidal. At the time, the service was available only as a “hi-fi” premium subscription sold for $19.99 per month. Since Swift’s main issue with Spotify was its free, ad-supported tier, it makes sense that she would be more willing to play ball with an all-paid service. But then, why hold back 1989? And, if she had a fundamental moral quibble with the very idea of ad-supported streams, why keep anything on YouTube? Vevo’s royalty payments aren’t anything impressive compared to Spotify or Tidal. A blip in the timeline, this move still muddied Swift’s point. June 2015: Apple Music free trial is “shocking, disappointing” When Apple announced three-month free trials to users willing to give Apple Music a go, and quietly told labels that artists wouldn’t be seeing any royalties for those streams, Swift took to Tumblr to express her displeasure: “I find it to be shocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company. This is not about me. Thankfully I am on my fifth album and can support myself, my band, crew, and entire management team by playing live shows. This is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success. This is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt. This is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create... ...I realize that Apple is working towards a goal of paid streaming. I think that is beautiful progress. We know how astronomically successful Apple has been and we know that this incredible company has the money to pay artists, writers and producers for the 3 month trial period… even if it is free for the fans trying it out. Three months is a long time to go unpaid, and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing. I say this with love, reverence, and admiration for everything else Apple has done. I hope that soon I can join them in the progression towards a streaming model that seems fair to those who create this music. I think this could be the platform that gets it right.” This argument, as opposed to Swift’s first statement in WSJ, acknowledges that Swift is not ever going to be personally affected by the outcome of the streaming wars. It also asks for something specific and points out a policy that’s quite obviously unfair, bringing the plights of producers and songwriters to the forefront. It’s a really strong recalibration for Swift’s message in regards to streaming, in particular because it’s not an argument against the very basic idea. Though, it also spends a weird amount of time on complimenting the richest tech company in the world. June 2015: The first time streaming “felt right” in Taylor’s gut Apple acquiesced to Swift’s demand, and agreed to pay royalties to everyone during its free trial. So the following week, she announced via Twitter that 1989 would stream for the first time on Apple Music (alongside her back catalogue). This is simply the first time it's felt right in my gut to stream my album. Thank you, Apple, for your change of heart.— Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) June 25, 2015 She also took care to note that 1989 was not an Apple Music exclusive in any contractual sense, she just didn’t want to put the album on any other services yet. Again, that’s a bit of a contradiction, considering Tidal was also subscription-only. August 2015: Apple Music has “humility,” Spotify is “a corporate machine” In an interview with Vanity Fair, swift laid out the crucial differences between her two big streaming feuds: “Apple treated me like I was a voice of a creative community that they actually cared about. And I found it really ironic that the multi-billion-dollar company reacted to criticism with humility, and the start-up with no cash flow reacted to criticism like a corporate machine.” This didn’t really go over very well for Swift. She sort of unfairly neglected to acknowledge that her issue with Apple had been one the super-rich company could easily solve with money, and that her fight with Spotify had been a meta-level spat over its very existence and the business model. Pandora co-founder Tom Conrad called it “mostly theater,” pointing out on Twitter that Spotify does pay out artist royalties for its free tier — exactly what Swift demanded Apple do, then thanked them for doing, complimenting their “change of heart.” What exactly is the problem with Spotify’s free tier, if they sustain it with the same system by which Apple would support its free trial? You can argue, of course, that royalties are too low in both cases, but Swift didn’t. She also faced criticism from former One Direction member Zayn Malik, leading to a really funny and hard to follow Twitter spat between Malik and Swift’s then-boyfriend, DJ and producer Calvin Harris. Malik and Swift later recorded a duet for the Fifty Shades Darker soundtrack, so I guess everyone’s over it. December 2015: “A little surprise for you” Swift’s 1989 World Tour Documentary became Apple Music’s first big video exclusive, announced to coincide with her 26th birthday: “Thank you so much for all the birthday wishes. I have a little surprise for you.” Promoting it, she always remembered to tack on an @AppleMusic. Celebrate with us December 20 on @AppleMusic #1989WorldTourLIVE pic.twitter.com/oksxT1q6pM— Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) December 17, 2015 April 2016: An Apple Music ad “based on true events” Swift’s first ad for Apple Music showed her running on (and falling off of) a treadmill while listening to an Apple Music-curated playlist called “#GYMFLOW.” Specifically, she was listening to “Jumpman,” a song off of Drake and Future’s big Apple Music exclusive, What a Time To Be Alive. The ad debuted on Apple’s 40th birthday, on Swift’s personal Twitter account, with the caption “Based on true events.” Related 2016: the year music went ‘exclusive’ Whatever nitpicks Swift might have had with the basic concept of streaming in 2014, they were seemingly all behind her at this point. Not only was she onboard with one streaming service, she was actively promoting it. Today! Swift’s music is also available on Pandora and Google Play Music, and 1989 has finally been added to Tidal. She hasn’t said a single thing about it, beyond her label announcing that it’s a celebration of 1989 selling 10 million copies worldwide. Maybe because there’s nothing to say other than “I had to change my mind eventually?” Swift won her feud with Apple Music because she wanted something very specific, and she took issue with a business practice that was blatantly unfair. Her feud with Spotify was never a feud with Spotify at all — it was a feud with the entire industry, the changing landscape, and the way fans expect to access music now. She was always going to surrender, and dipping her toe in with Apple Music probably helped Spotify in the long run. As a symbol for the rights of artists in the digital age, she’s a watery one at best. Related The armistice between Taylor Swift and Spotify is good for everyone Did she win anything from Spotify? Maybe. Universal Music Group, the parent company for Swift’s Big Machine Records, signed a new deal in April that lets artists opt to keep new albums off of Spotify’s free tier for their first two weeks. Spotify has also been cozying up to songwriters, announcing just this week that it would start a “Secret Genius” program — an awards show, special workshops with A-list talent, and curated playlists in honor of the almighty lyricist. She might see that as a welcome sign of respect. And Swift is famous for lacing her album booklets with riddles and clues about the songs’ meaning. Maybe, with the death of the album insert, Spotify’s new Genius integration is appealing to her? Maybe it really is a Katy Perry thing. Anyway, she’s back.

(Image courtesy of Apple) VIEW PHOTO GALLERY3 photos AA Distracted driving has been a problem since the first motorists slid behind steering wheels. Eating, smoking, talking to friends and flipping through radio stations have caused countless accidents over the years and an untold number of deaths. But the situation has become worse with the rise of mobile phones, which buzz in response to every text, snap and email. This week, one of world's best-known mobile phone manufacturers revealed plans to combat the problem of distracted driving with an upcoming software update. That update was announced at the annual WWDC conference in San Jose, California. It's part of a much, much larger upgrade of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS 11 that promises things like a smarter Siri (a pretty low bar, honestly) and simpler means of logging into friends' wifi networks. In fact, the improvement is so small, you might've missed it, but it could be a real game-changer in combating distracted driving--provided that users activate it. Simply put, it's an enhanced version of iOS's existing "Do Not Disturb" feature. Currently, "Do Not Disturb" lets you silence calls and texts at set hours of the day (for example, overnight when you're likely sleeping) or whenever you activate the feature manually. The enhancement makes use of the iPhone's built in hardware to determine whether you're driving. If the software thinks you are, it'll silence calls and texts and place a notification on your lock screen, indicating that it's in "Do Not Disturb" mode. Exactly how it makes those guesses remains to be seen. We've seen a number of apps over the years that claim to work similarly, but most haven't been very smart, turning on when the iPhone's accelerometer and GPS determine when a person's moving too fast to be walking. That's been a real frustration for folks sitting in the passenger's seat, not to mention those traveling by taxi, bus or train. Hopefully, Apple will be leveraging some of the AI it's been developing for Siri (and its alleged self-driving car) to make better-educated guesses about when iPhone owners are actually driving. Our take Distracted driving is a very real, very deadly problem. In 2015 (the most recent year for which official data is available from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration), 3,477 people died on U.S. roads as a result of distracted driving. That's an increase of 8.8 percent over 2014. Some people might say that adding a "Do Not Disturb" feature for drivers makes America more of a so-called "nanny state," where people aren't held responsible for their own actions. The counterargument would be that: 1. Distracted driving is a public safety hazard because it affects more than just the driver. Anyone who's not paying attention at the wheel puts other people's lives in danger. In such cases, a more aggressive, proactive stance is warranted. 2. It appears that "Do Not Disturb" for drivers will be voluntary (though it might be opt-out instead of opt-in). So, if you truly want to drive distractedly and put yourself, your passengers and others at risk, go ahead--just send out a tweet or something so the rest of us can clear out. No, the question of whether or not Apple ought to be including this feature isn't much of a question to us. The question of why Apple is debuting the feature now, more than 10 years after the first iPhones were sold, is more curious. It may have something to do with a distracted-driving lawsuit filed last year which named Apple as a defendant. (The distracted driver was checking messages on an iPhone when she rammed her truck into an SUV, killing the SUV's driver and paralyzing a child.) Even if Apple is cleared of wrongdoing, it could stain the company's reputation, and further court challenges will likely follow. By adding "Do Not Disturb" for drivers, Apple can say that it's taking steps to address the problem. The question of how the new feature will work is also intriguing. A patent that Apple received in 2008 for just this kind of technology gauges a phone's proximity to the dashboard and the steering wheel to guess whether it belongs to the driver. Will "Do Not Disturb" for drivers work similarly? We'll know more when iOS 11 rolls out this fall. close Trending 1   High school senior lands in the hospital, misses prom, but gets a big surprise 2   Local parents plea for missing daughter to come home 3   Teens charged after off-roading in Thacher Park 4   Gas leak in the middle of RPI campus contained 5   RECALL ALERT: Price Chopper/Market 32 Chicken Cutlets DON'T MISS OUT Stay Connected with WRGB Like Follow © 2016 Sinclair Broadcast Group TermsPrivacyFCC InfoEEO News In Pictures Perp Patrol: Wanted gallery Stolen pickup found impaled on 30 feet of steel guardrail Key quotes from James Comey testimony to Congress Red carpet: American Film Institute Life Achievement Award ShareTweet × Trending 1 High school senior lands in the hospital, misses prom, but gets a big surprise 2 Local parents plea for missing daughter to come home 3 Teens charged after off-roading in Thacher Park 4 Gas leak in the middle of RPI campus contained 5 RECALL ALERT: Price Chopper/Market 32 Chicken Cutlets 6 Capital Pride Singers honor victims of Orlando nightclub shooting almost a year later 7 State Police looking for three in connection to bottle bombs 8 Your Voice, Your Future Town Hall: Guns in New York 9 Albany man found guilty of slashing cat's throat 10 Sheriff: More possible victims have come forward in child porn, exposure investigation

By Ben Patterson PCWorld | Jun 9, 2017 6:00 AM PT Credit: Ben Patterson / IDG More like this 4 easy ways to keep your iCloud password safe Configuring an old iPad for your child 6 ways to lock down your iPhone’s lock screen Video iOS 11: The top features announced Like it or not, little kids love iPhones and iPads. They love to look at them, they love to tap and swipe the screen, they love playing iPhone games, and most of all, they love watching videos on them. (“Curious George” is my daughter’s favorite—for this week at least.) Giving your little ones a hand-me-down iOS device is an easy way to satisfy their desire for a screen of their own—my kid is the proud owner of an iPhone 3GS and a third-generation iPad. That said, you shouldn’t hand over your old iPhone or iPad without doing some kid-proofing first. Read on for five ways to prep an aging iPhone or iPad for your youngster, from wiping your data and setting up a child’s iCloud account to blocking web access and keeping her from racking up in-app charges on your credit card. Wipe your old data Before you hand over your old iPhone to your kids, you’ll want to make sure any and all of your personal data has been wiped clean. The best way to do so is to perform a “factory” reset, which wipes the iPhone’s storage and returns it to its factory settings. Ben Patterson / IDG Make sure to back up and then wipe your data before handing over your old iPhone to your child. Naturally, you should first make sure you’ve backed up any old iPhone or iPad data you want to preserve. You may already have taken care of this step if you’ve previously upgraded to a new iPhone or iPad and restored your data from iCloud. If not, tap Settings, tap your iCloud profile, then tap iCloud > Backup > Back Up Now. You can also back up your old iPhone or iPad by connecting it to your Mac or PC and syncing it with iTunes. Once you’re satisfied that your data is safe and sound, go ahead and wipe the device. Tap Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings. Once the reset is complete, your old iPhone or iPad will return to its factory settings, just like the day it came out of the box. Create a child’s iCloud account While it may seem a little soon to, say, create an Apple ID for a toddler, take it from me: it won’t be long before your onesie-clad cutie is walking, talking and pleading for an iPhone upgrade—and when that happens, it’ll be easier to migrate her data and apps if she already has her own iCloud account. Ben Patterson / IDG Just because your child is under 13 doesn’t mean she can’t have her own iCloud account and Apple ID. Even if your kid is younger than 13 years old, she can still have her own iCloud account and Apple ID. All you need to do is create the account under iOS’s “Family Sharing” umbrella. With her iCloud account, your child will be able to sign in to an old iPhone or iPad, download apps, and even purchase items from the App Store—only with your approval, of course. Also, keep in mind that just because she has an iCloud account, your daughter or son won’t be able to start web surfing, tweeting, or posting selfies on Instagram without your say-so. (More on iOS’s parental controls in a moment.) You can create a child’s iCloud account directly on your own iPhone or iPad. Just tap Settings, tap your iCloud username, then tap Family Sharing > Add Family Member > Create an Apple ID for a child. You’ll need to enter your kid’s birthday, agree to some disclosures and legalese, choose a payment method for App Store purchases (which, again, you can control and/or block), then choose an Apple ID username and password. By default, your kid’s new iCloud account won’t let her make App Store purchases without your consent. To double-check the “Ask to Buy” setting, tap Settings, tap your iCloud account name, then tap Family Sharing and your kid’s name. Control what your kid can—and can’t—do on her iPhone or iPad Once you’ve got your old iPhone or iPad set up with your child’s new iCloud account, it’s time to make some decisions on which iOS features will be fair game for your kid, and which will be off-limits. Ben Patterson / IDG Don’t want your child surfing the web or snapping photos on her hand-me-down iPhone? You can block those activities in iOS’s Restrictions settings. Tap Settings > General > Restrictions > Enable Restrictions, then create a Restrictions passcode. Next, scroll down and disable all the iOS features that you’d rather your kid not mess with. You’ll probably want to disable Safari and the iTunes store right away. You may also want to block your child from installing apps, and if you don’t want your little one snapping a million photos of their crib, you might want to nix the Camera app, too. In the “Allowed Content” section, make sure to disable in-app purchases, as well as block music with explicit music and any grown-up movies, TV shows and books. In the Privacy section, you can control which apps can access location services, contacts, the microphone, and more on your kid’s iPhone. At the bottom of the Restrictions screen, you can also disable access to multiplayer games, friend adding, and screen recording for any Game Center-ready games. Hide Settings, Mail, and other Apple apps Even after you’ve thoroughly managed all of iOS’s Restrictions settings, you may still see some home-screen icons on your kid’s iPhone or iPad that you’d rather she not mess with. For example, the Settings icon should probably stay out of her hands, as well as the Mail app, Game Center, and the App Store. Ben Patterson / IDG You can hide the Mail, App Store, and other Apple apps in a folder, preferably on its own home screen in the back. Here’s what I did before I gave my daughter my old iPhone: I hid all those various Apple apps in a “Hidden” folder in the very last iOS home screen. To create a home screen folder, drag one app icon on top of another, name the folder, then start dragging other app icons into the newly created folder. Naturally, older kids who are a bit more iOS savvy may quickly sniff out the “Hidden” folder. My five-year-old, for example, knows exactly where I’ve tucked away the Settings icon, but she doesn’t really care—probably because tapping Settings won’t get her any closer to Curious George. Turn on Airplane mode One way to make sure your little one doesn’t wander into a grown-up corner of the Internet on her iPhone is to cut off Internet access altogether, and the easiest way to do that is to turn on Airplane mode. (Of course, you can kiss Airplane mode goodbye once your children start clamoring for the streaming PBS Kids video app, which they’ll do once they hit about 3 or so.) Just tap Settings, then flip on the Airplane Mode switch. Ben Patterson / IDG Turning on Airplane mode is an easy way to keep tiny iPhone users off the Internet. If your old iPhone or iPad is running on iOS 6 or later, you may also want to disable home-screen and in-app access to Control Center, the flip-up control panel that includes an Airplane Mode button, To do so, tap Settings > Control Center, then switch off the Access on Lock Screen and Access Within Apps settings. That won’t completely disable Control Center, but at least it’ll make it a tad more challenging to find.

(AP) - Science is worthless if it isn't motivated by basic human values and the desire to help people, Apple CEO Tim Cook told graduates of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Friday, urging them to use their powers for good. In a commencement address, Cook - who as Apple's chief executive since 2011 has overseen the rollout of the iPhone 7 and the Apple Watch - said the company is constantly looking for ways to combine tech with a sense of humanity and compassion. "Whatever you do in your life, and whatever we do at Apple, we must infuse it with the humanity that we are born with," said Cook, who previously served as chief operating officer and headed the Macintosh division.

Cook told MIT graduates and their families that technology without basic human values is worthless. (John Wilcox/The Boston Herald via AP) "That responsibility is immense. But so is the opportunity," he said. Cook said Apple wants to make products that help people. As examples, he cited iPhone technology that can help a blind athlete run a marathon and an iPad that connects an autistic child to the world around them. "When you keep people at the center of what you do, it can impact," he said. Cook said he isn't worried about artificial intelligence giving computers the ability to think like humans. "I'm more concerned about people thinking like computers without values or compassion or concern for the consequences," he said. "That is what we need you to help us guard against. Because if science is a search in the darkness, then the humanities are a candle that shows us where we have been and the danger that lies ahead." Cook also urged graduates to resist becoming cynical. "The internet enabled so much and empowered so many, but it can also be a place where basic rules of decency are suspended and pettiness and negativity thrive," he said. "Don't let that noise knock you off course. Don't get caught up in the trivial aspects of life. Don't listen to trolls, and don't become one. Measure impact in humanity; not in the likes, but the lives you touch and the people you serve."

Pepe Is Banned From the Apple App Store Apple says Pepe is 'objectionable content.' Feels bad, man. The rarest pepe is one found on the iOS App Store, and now we know why: Apple has categorized the meme frog as "objectionable content" and has rejected an app called Pepe Scream, Motherboard confirmed. "Your app contains images and references of Pepe the Frog, which are considered objectionable content," an Apple App Review Board employee named Nicole wrote in a rejection notice to Spirit Realm Games, the developer of Pepe Scream. "It would be appropriate to remove the references and revise the images in your app." Feels bad, man. A screenshot taken by Motherboard of Apple's communications regarding Pepe Scream. Redditor MrSnrhms posted a screenshot of the exchange on r/The_Donald, and Motherboard has verified the screenshots are authentic. MrSnrhms, a developer for Spirit Realm Games, gave Motherboard temporary access to the team's iOS developer account, which showed that Apple did indeed reject the app because it contains Pepe, a cartoon frog that has been increasingly associated with the alt-right. This isn't the first time Pepe has been rejected by Apple—in October, Build the Wall: The Game was rejected on similar grounds. Motherboard also downloaded a test version of the game, which is similar to Flappy Bird. Users control Pepe by screaming into their phone, which makes the green frog float. Pepe Scream was approved by the Google Play Store and is currently available on Android. Google did not return a request for comment. "Why did we make a game about Pepe? We saw some memes featuring Pepe screaming 'REEEEE' and something just 'clicked,'" a developer for Spirit Realm Games told us in an email. "We thought it was a silly and funny idea to just show off to our friends, nothing more, so we built it just for fun." A screenshot of Pepe Scream taken by Motherboard. Pepe Scream was rejected for violating section 1.1 of Apple's App Store Review Guidelines, which stipulates that apps cannot "include content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, or in exceptionally poor taste." Spirit Realm Games appealed the decision, and Apple sent a follow up message identifying Pepe as the problem. Though Spirit Realm Games says it "had only put innocuous versions of Pepe into the app: e.g. 'VR goggles Pepe' or 'Sunglasses Pepe' or 'Golden Pepe,'" it's still something of a dog whistle for places like r/The_Donald. The description, for instance, contains the following poem: On r/The_Donald, MrSnrhms said that the game "combin[es] shitposting with autistic screeching" and that "Apple is full of cucks." In the game itself, you collect "tendies," a 4chan meme that has been widely adopted on r/The_Donald. We've reached out twice to Apple representatives for comment, but didn't hear back before publication. Apple has repeatedly declined to comment on the secretive App Store review process in the past. It is well within Apple's right to reject whatever apps it wants to, but it does appear that the company more or less has adopted a blanket "no Pepe" policy. There are no apps in the App Store with Pepe in the title, and it does not appear in many meme apps and iMessage sticker packs (there are no Pepes in "MemeStickers," for instance). Meanwhile, the Google Play Store has Pepe Snap, Rare Pepe Clicker, Flappy Pepe, and Pepe Button, among several other Pepe apps. Pepes are indeed rare on iOS and can only be found hidden deep within other apps—there are two Pepes on the iMessage "That Feel" sticker pack, and a camera app called Instameme has Pepes as part of an add-on content bundle. We reached out to developers of Android Pepe apps to see if they had attempted to get their apps onto the iOS App Store. Three developers responded, but none of them had tried. "Apple has a higher barrier of entry to their store with their higher publishing fees and more strenuous review process," Jonathan Robins, the developer of Pepe Snap told us. "And because of that they see typically higher quality apps. Google costs less and will sometimes publish your app almost instantaneously as if they didn't even review it. I mean they do review apps but certainly not to the same standard Apple does." "It is quite unhealthy for the developer ecosystem to not more specifically outline what is allowed and not allowed." Robins said he developed his app well before Pepe began to be associated with the alt-right and has professionally distanced himself from it. "It's a bit disappointing to see the image and notoriety it carries now, but that's the point of memes," he said. "They're constantly changing meaning and transforming into something else. I have had to scrub the project from my resume, but I'm still not embarrassed of it or the over 150,000+ downloads it's garnered. I even still have plans to update it again soon with more features." It's possible that Apple chose to reject Pepe Scream and other apps featuring the frog on the grounds that it could be considered a hate symbol. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a nonprofit committed to combating bigotry, considers Pepe to be a symbol of hate, but only in specific contexts. Gameplay in Pepe Scream from a developer's version of the game. "The majority of uses of Pepe the Frog have been, and continue to be non-bigoted," the ADL's entry on Pepe in its Hate Symbols Database reads. "It is important to examine use of the meme only in context." Because the App Store approval process is so opaque, developers often end up blindsided by rejections. "I think it is quite unhealthy for the developer ecosystem to not more specifically outline what is allowed and not allowed," the Spirit Realm Games developer said. "We certainly didn't know Pepe the Frog wasn't allowed." No app is a better example of Apple's murky App Store approval process than Metadata+, a news app which tracks reports of US drone strikes. Apple rejected Metadata+ over a dozen times, finally approved it briefly, then deleted it again, all without explaining its reasoning to the app's developer, Josh Begley. There's no discernible rhyme or reason to why some apps get denied and others approved. Plenty of absurd selections, like Adult Naughty Sounds and Burp and Fart Piano didn't pose problems, for example. Each of the App Store's over two millions apps had to go through a complicated application process to get approved. Countless others have been rejected, for a myriad of different reasons. As for Pepe Scream, it has a future on the App Store, but Pepe must go. "Since we've already paid for the dev license, we plan on changing the character from Pepe to something less 'objectionable' by Apple's standards," Spirit Realm Games said. Update: This post has been updated to note that games have been rejected for using Pepe in the past.

Learn what's trending across POPSUGAR. People these days are already pretty obsessed with sneakers as it is. But when those comfy shoes just so happen to be a super-duper rare pair that pays homage to our favorite tech company, a full-on internet frenzy ensues. That's exactly what happened when people caught wind of a singular pair of Apple (yes, Apple) kicks that are currently being auctioned off. The opening bid is sure to make your jaw hit the floor: a whopping $15,000. Who needs groceries or college tuition when you've got some one-of-a-kind sneakers on your feet, am I right? (Hah, totally kidding.) According to the official listing for the shoes, they're a size 9.5 and were "produced by Apple exclusively for their employees in the early 1990s." To be honest, they kind of look like something the Fresh Prince of Bel Air would've worn back in the day, but we're oddly into them. With the rainbow company logo on the side panel and tongue, they have an undeniable throwback vibe to them, somewhat reminding us of those old-school Nike Air Force 1s that are starting to come back on the scene.

According to President Michael Schriner, "By adding a center slot to our iPad Pedestal base we were able to achieve the elegant look of the Apple store display while offering the added feature of standing up the iPad. This provides a better viewing angle while creating additional space for holding the iPhone or iPod on the tapered surface creating a multi-use base" In addition with their new laser engraving program, businesses can now add their logo's to the clear acrylic surface and create a custom look. By adding this feature newPCgadgets has created a promotional iPad stand that businesses can use to promote their brand. As a work base the new iPad Pedestal is designed to hold the iPad or iPhone at a comfortable 30 degree angle to provide optimum viewing. Non-skid outer silicone rings on both the top and bottom create a secure non-slip surface, just like displays at the Apple store. The center slot on the iPad Pedestal allows users to hold the iPad upright in either the landscape or portrait position making it ideal as a display for business, trade-shows, conferences and much more. For home use, the iPad Pedestal can be used for FaceTime, watching videos or playing games. newPCgadgets iPad Pedestal is constructed from 1 1/2 " clear acrylic. The 6" diameter base and tapered design matches the look and feel of the Apple store displays. The iPad Pedestals works with the original iPad, iPad 2, 3, 4, iPad Air, iPad Pro 9.7 and the new iPad. Schriner goes on to say, "Since Apple does not sell their store displays we thought there would be a large demand for this product. By adding the slot we were able to improve on the functionality." newMacgadgets has priced the iPad Pedestal stand at $39.95 (USD). Visit newPCgadgets for additional details.

Landing somewhere in the middle was the announcement of the Apple HomePod, a compact audio speaker levied by a powerful learning chip designed to optimize output and add a layer of Siri-enhanced intelligence to the home audio experience. The HomePod won’t be available till December, but Apple released specifications ahead of its launch: Upward-facing woofer, paired with the custom A8 chip, enables bass management through real-time software modeling that ensures the speaker delivers the deepest and cleanest bass possible, with low distortion; Custom array of seven beam-forming tweeters, each with its own amplifier, provides well-balanced smooth timbre as well as precise directional control of a multitude of beam shapes and sizes; Apple-designed A8 chip provides the brains behind the advanced audio innovations; Automatic room-sensing technology allows HomePod to quickly learn its position in a room, whether it’s in a corner, on a table or in a bookshelf, and within seconds, is perfectly optimized to deliver an immersive music listening experience wherever it is placed; Six-microphone array with advanced echo cancellation enables Siri to understand people whether they are near the device or standing across the room, even while loud music is playing; Siri waveform appears on the top to indicate when Siri is engaged, and integrated touch controls also allow easy navigation; Automatic detection and balance of two speakers using both direct and reflected audio to deliver amazing audio wirelessly for an even more immersive experience; and Easy setup that is as intuitive as setting up AirPods — simply hold an iPhone next to HomePod and it’s ready to start playing music in seconds. The HomePod’s Siri-enhanced capabilities not only help control Apple Music playback and answer queries regarding music, HomeKit accessories control is baked in for additional smarthome assistance. The top glows colorful with an LED waveform animation when Siri is awakened by touch or voice. HomePod’s squat cylindrical woven basket design will undoubtedly invite comparisons to the likes of the Amazon Echo, Google Home, and Sonos PLAY:3. The voice command features the HomePod shares with its Amazon and Google competition are not remarkably different from one another (yet). Nor are comparisons with Sonos unreasonable, offering similar environment-adaptable, spatially-aware sound in service of a bespoke listening experience (compare this developing trend with traditional audiophile gear requiring adjusting the contents of a room according to the equipment, and the obvious consumer-welcome implications become clear). Where Apple stakes to differentiate itself is by combining all these features with reputed improvements: an expandable wireless multi-speaker system supported by Siri intelligence, six microphones, a 7-tweeter array, with its entirety enhanced by the subjectively desirable design of an Apple-designed product. All hyperbole aside, the Apple HomePod is best considered a TBD product for now. Early reports from WWDC listening demos sing positive about the audio quality in comparison to other similarly sized and featured wireless speakers, noting the HomePod’s audio processing is capable of a notably different and immersive experience from its competition, even in single unit configuration. The real question is whether the HomePod’s Siri-enhanced assistance capabilities can distinguish itself from the likes of Amazon and Google, fulfilling the promise of Apple HomeKit, justifying its higher price in a category increasingly improving with every product cycle by hitting all three marks of sound, design, and smart home utility.

In a change to the App Store rules this week, Apple said it will now enforce hard limits on how review prompts show up and how often users have to see them. The changes were first spotted by 9to5Mac. Under the new rules, developers will no longer be able to display review prompts however and whenever they’d like. Instead, there’ll be two key restrictions that should reduce headaches for everyone: First, apps will be required to use a new Apple-made review prompt, which allows users to leave a rating without exiting an app. That’s a huge convenience that may well get a lot more people to leave ratings. Apple introduced the rating prompt a few months ago, but it’s been optional up until now. This seems like a win-win for developers and users The second restriction is on how often that prompt can show up. An app can only display the prompt three times a year, regardless of how often it’s been updated. And once a user has left a rating, they’ll never see it again. Users also have the option to completely disable app review prompts inside the iOS Settings app, preventing the prompts from annoying them at all. This seems like it should be a win-win for users and developers. People have been annoyed by app review prompts for years, and this update seems to remedy the problem. It may even make people more interested in leaving a review, because it can be done without exiting the app and because it means they’ll be done with the prompt for good. If that results in more reviews — and reviews from users who aren’t annoyed about switching apps — that’s a good thing for developers, too. Part of the reason developers have their apps show review prompts so often is because Apple has always reset an app’s rating after every update, even very minor ones. With the redesigned App Store, developers will have the option to change that, so that their app’s ratings are maintained between updates. That’s likely to become a common choice — for good apps, at least — since users will only be able to get prompted for a rating once. Here’s what the prompt looks like in an app: Request reviews with iOS 10.3’s SKStoreReviewController: https://t.co/HgugUTrN81 pic.twitter.com/gYjVfJu1Xq— Xamarin (@xamarinhq) April 20, 2017 Next Up In Tech Augmented reality company Meta sues former employee for stealing its tech Microsoft might be rethinking how users interact with Cortana iOS 11 is already being used to make AR fidget spinners, BB-8, and Space Invaders Apple’s next iPhones won’t have the fastest possible LTE speeds Here’s how Apple is making iMessage take on Facebook Messenger bots Trump’s social media director broke the law with a tweet Now Trending How to master Google Photos These tips and tricks will help you get the most out of Google’s fantastic Photos app. Watch the first teaser trailer for Black Panther Samsung’s 49-inch ultrawide curved display is basically just half a TV at this point Command Line Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future. email address...

(Photo by Mark Metcalfe/Getty Images) Mark Metcalfe — Getty Images Spotify Taylor Swift and Spotify Get Back Together: Music Catalog Comes Back to Streaming Mathew Ingram Jun 09, 2017 It may not be quite as dramatic as Taylor Swift and Katy Perry burying the hatchet, but for Swift fans, it is likely to be a huge deal. As of midnight Friday, all of the pop star's music is now available on every streaming service, including Spotify. In messages posted on Thursday night to Twitter and Instagram, Swift's management company said the return to streaming was a gift to her loyal fans, in honor of her album selling 10 million copies. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ pic.twitter.com/kcpY03qHLp- Taylor Nation (@taylornation13) June 8, 2017 Swift famously rejected Spotify in 2014, pulling all of her songs from the service because she said it wasn't paying artists enough, and that it didn't give artists enough flexibility on pricing. As she told TIME (which is owned by Time Inc., Fortune's parent company): I tried it and I didn't like the way it felt. I think there should be an inherent value placed on art. I didn't see that happening, perception-wise, when I put my music on Spotify. Losing Swift was a major blow to Spotify because she was not only one of the biggest pop stars in the world, but her album 1989 had just been released and looked to be a massive hit. The company tried to win her back with a specially curated playlist designed to send her a message, but to no avail. The following year, Swift lashed out at Apple as well, after the consumer electronics giant launched its new Apple Music streaming service with a three-month free trial, and told artists that they wouldn't receive any royalties for those three months. "Three months is a long time to ask people to go unpaid, and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing," the artist wrote in an open letter to Apple. "We don’t ask you for free iPhones. Please don’t ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation." Apple quickly changed its policy. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. So why has Swift decided to put her music back on streaming services now? There are a few possible reasons, and one of the major ones is that Spotify changed the way it handles new releases. In April, the streaming service signed a deal with Universal Music Group, one of the largest of the global record labels, which would allow the label's artists (including Swift) to restrict their new albums and songs to paying subscribers for two weeks. As the lack of this kind of "windowing" approach was one of the things that led to Swift leaving Spotify in the first place, the announcement sparked speculation that she might return to the service once it was introduced. Streaming services have also grown to the point where consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers says it expects revenue from streaming to eclipse sales of both CDs and traditional records for the first time this year. Meanwhile, some music fans and industry insiders are whispering about another potential reason why Swift might have chosen to return her music to Spotify and other streaming services now: her long-running feud with fellow pop star Katy Perry. The two have been taking thinly veiled musical potshots at each other since 2014. Perry's new album was just released on Friday, leading some to speculate that Swift timed her return to streaming services in such a way as to steal the spotlight from her musical nemesis. Whatever the rationale, the detente between Swift and the major streaming services seems likely to even further inflate the already massive marketing machine that is Taylor Swift. And for Spotify in particular, it provides a much-needed boost, as the company prepares for a potential stock offering that some analysts expect to hit the market later this year.

Play it now! more GADGET REVIEWS Is this the ultimate party speaker? MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

The Apple CEO told the MIT Technology Review on Thursday that he hopes technology will serve humanity by protecting people's privacy, even when using tools like machine learning to address the ills of humankind. Anita Balakrishnan | @MsABalakrishnan 15 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Apple's Tim Cook delivers MIT commencement speech: Sometimes technology divides us    15 Hours Ago | 01:14 Apple CEO Tim Cook addressed the graduating class of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Friday, where he warned students about the drawbacks of technology. Though Cook helms one of the world's biggest technology companies, he said technology is "not always the solution," and is sometimes part of the problem. He said that shareholders have pushed Apple to focus on return on investment, but that engineers should have the courage to stand by what is right. "Most of the time [technology] is a force for good," Cook said. "But the potential adverse consequences are spreading faster and cutting deeper than ever before. Threats to our security, threats to our privacy, fake news, and social media that sometimes becomes anti-social." Technology must be infused with decency and kindness, Cook said. "I'm not worried about artificial intelligence giving computers the ability to think like humans," he said. "I'm more concerned about people thinking like computers." Brian Snyder | Reuters Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during Commencement Exercises at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, June 9, 2017. He warned graduates that though the internet has empowered many, sometimes the "basic rules of decency are suspended" and pettiness thrives. "I'm optimistic because I believe in your generation," Cook said. "There's so much out there conspiring to make you cynical. ... Don't listen to trolls." Cook was chosen for his role as a "trailblazer" in championing innovation, MIT said in a statement. Cook said joining Apple — under Steve Jobs' strong vision — lifted a "psychological burden," freeing him to indulge in work that served humanity. "How can I serve humanity? This is life's biggest and most important question," Cook said. "The question I hope you will carry from here is, 'How will you serve humanity?'" Cook noted in a statement that Apple employs many MIT graduates. "MIT and Apple share so much. We both love hard problems, we love to search for new ideas, and we especially love finding these ideas — the ones that change the world," Cook said. Tweet: For the second time in a week I'm waiting for @tim_cook to hit the stage! Today at #MIT2017 -- congratulations graduates! The iPhone maker has been a strong advocate of technology education. Apple has pledged $100 million to bring technology and services into 114 underserved schools across the United States, and $40 million to a partnership with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, according to its latest proxy statement. The CEO told the MIT Technology Review on Thursday that he hopes Apple technology will protect people's privacy, even when using tools like machine learning to address the ills of humankind. On a lighter note, Cook joked that MIT's strong history of pranks, or hacks, might be behind President Donald Trump's use of Twitter: "I know college students are behind it, because most of the tweets happen at 3 a.m." — CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.

The software boasts of some exciting new features such as a new Control Center, peer-to-peer payments via Apple Pay, Do No Disturb While Driving, an improved Maps app, a smarter Siri, and revamped Apple Music. The 10th anniversary iPhone 8 will be one of the first devices to run the new operating system. Wondering what an iPhone 8 running iOS 11 would look like? Image Source: iDropNews.com Here’s how iOS 11 looks on iPhone 8 Folks at iDropNews have released iPhone 8 renders running Apple’s new mobile operating system. The renders show the 10th anniversary iPhone with a nearly bezel-less display. There is a cutout housing the front camera, ear speaker, laser sensor and infrared sensor to support facial recognition and iris scanner. It contradicts some reports that the selfie camera would sit under the front display. Image Source: iDropNews.com If Apple includes a cutout for the front camera and other sensors, there would be the screen on both sides of the cutout. It means app developers will have to optimize their apps to ensure that the cutout does not affect navigation or user experience. Another option is to black out or white out the portions of the display separated by the cutout and use that space for battery, signal strength, time and other icons. Image Source: iDropNews.com The renders show what the iOS 11 would feel like on a device with bezel-less display and no physical home button. A couple of weeks ago, iDropNews had posted iPhone 8 renders based on information obtained from factory workers. Days later, a Foxconn insider said in a Reddit thread that the render was an almost accurate depiction of the actual device. Vertical dual camera on the back, Touch ID on the front The latest iPhone 8 renders have a vertically aligned dual camera system. The LED flash is placed between the two camera lenses. The vertical arrangement would help support augmented reality features. The back panel is made using composite glass to enable wireless charging. iDropNews claims the 10th-anniversary device will have a “large pad” on the inside to facilitate wireless charging through the glass panel. Image Source: iDropNews.com Where will the fingerprint sensor be placed on the iPhone 8? The renders have the Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the OLED display. Some reports have claimed that Apple would relocate the Touch ID to the rear panel. According to the Foxconn insider who spilled the beans on iPhone 8, Apple had tested multiple prototypes. Some had the Touch ID embedded in the display while others had the feature on the back. While the in-display solution suffered from yield and manufacturing issues, Apple would not opt for the rear Touch ID. ARKit has made Apple’s intent clear Augmented reality will be a big part of the iPhone 8 upgrade. Apple has made a new set of tools called ARKit available to third-party developers. The ARKit would help developers build augmented reality experiences into their apps. The anniversary iPhone will have built-in hardware components and sensors to take full advantage of the AR games and applications. The Foxconn insider has confirmed that facial recognition and retina scanner would be included in the “front facing camera modules.” The iPhone 8 is said to feature 3GB RAM and 128GB/256GB of internal storage. Unlike the iPhone 8, the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus would retain the aluminum unibody design. It means they are unlikely to offer wireless charging. Will OLED panel cause a delay in iPhone 8 launch? Korean site The Investor reported earlier this week that Samsung would start mass production of OLED panels “later this month” as Apple has approved the prototype panels. Samsung Display will be supplying 10 million OLED panels every month for the iPhone 8 this year. ValueWalk reported in April that Apple had inked a deal with Samsung Display for the supply of at least 70 million OLED screens. The other component suppliers have also started scaling up production, said The Investor. TSMC, which is responsible for the supply of A11 chips, started producing Apple’s custom processors last month. A11 is said to power not only the iPhone 8 but also the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus. TSMC aims to have at least 50 million units of the chip ready by July-end. The Foxconn insider told Reddit users that iPhone 8 production has indeed been delayed, confirming past rumors. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also said that the 10th anniversary iPhone wouldn’t hit the store shelves until October/November. Earlier this week, RBC Capital analysts said in a note to investors that volume production of OLED panels has been delayed by 1-2 months. RBC Capital says there is still a chance that the iPhone 8 would hit the stores alongside the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus in September, but it will see only “limited availability.” Supply would improve only in mid-October/November timeframe. The research firm noted that the delay would not “change the demand dynamics for iPhones.” The iPhone 8 is expected to cost $999 for the 128GB model and $1099 for the 256GB storage variant.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology CyberSecurity Apple Macs CAN get viruses as security myth busted by experts It's not widespread, but experts warn Apple devices open to malware and ransomware. By Jason Murdock June 9, 2017 16:05 BST Mac user? Security experts warn you are not as safe online as you thinkReuters If you own an Apple device – be it a Macbook or iPhone – you are instantly safe from malware and viruses, right? After all, these are not Windows devices, they are not actually at risk from botnets or ransomware or massive Trojans, correct? Wrong, experts warn. "There's a myth among Mac users that you don't need anti-virus because there's no malware because St. Steve Jobs, wherever he is, will keep us safe forever," Paul Ducklin, a Sophos cybersecurity researcher, said during a keynote at Infosecurity 2017 this week (7 June). Ducklin took the stage to present a demonstration showing every segment of a known Mac exploit chain. Using a strain of malware known as Eleanor, impacting OSX, Ducklin revealed how hackers could use it to run commands, take screenshots and infiltrate core systems. When found in 2016, the malware was posing as a file converter. Once downloaded onto a Mac it would fail to function, leading the victim to swiftly delete it. However the damage had already been done: it had connected to the criminals, via Tor, and malicious tools were stealthily installed on the computer. It emerged last year as the latest in a long line of Mac-based malware toolsets. Other splashes have been caused by iPhone-tampering software "X-Agent", ransomware "KeRanger" and a "YiSpecter", a highly-concerning exploit that could target Apple devices that were not jailbroken. Malwarebytes, a cybersecurity firm, said in a report this year that the first quarter of 2017 had seen "quite a few new pieces of Mac malware, nearly equalling the number that appeared in all of 2016" and claimed most of the threats were "backdoors", varying in capability and sophistication. So why is it that many Apple Mac users still act as if their systems are immune to infection? "The quantity of Mac malware traditionally has been very small but there is Mac malware and, unfortunately, even though there's a small quantity the quality and nature of it pretty much copies what's happening on Windows – such as bots and tools that use Tor," Ducklin said. "Whatever has worked on Windows, that kind of malware can be written for the Mac. We think the crooks maybe haven't really figured out how to monetise it on the Mac yet, or maybe they don't really need to because they are making so much money off Windows. "But there are plenty of them who are trying. Rik Ferguson, during a separate keynote panel on the same day, largely echoed Ducklin's position, saying "the first ever virus was targeted at Apple systems and malware for Apple devices has been ongoing since then." He mentioned botnets, ransomware and Trojans – the usual culprits. "All of those targeted at Apple were of course far lower in volume than we have seen target the WinTel platform," he continued. "That's not because it's inherently more secure but because historically you will get less return on your criminal investment." Ferguson, who has long worked as a researcher for cybersecurity firm Trend Micro and is an active advisor to EU law enforcement, said most interest in Apple exploits is traditionally from those buying or selling major vulnerabilities found in operating systems like OSX and iOS. Pictured (L/R) Moderator: Peter Wood, James Lyne, Rik Ferguson at Infosecurity Europe 2017Infosecurity Europe "Most often that's people at a nation-state or corporate espionage level," he said. "The most valuable vulnerabilities and/or exploits out there are the ones aimed at iOS and that could be weaponised and used against those kinds of devices. "I guess because they are perceived to be higher value targets. Probably also because Apple has done a comparatively good job of keeping the app store clean of malicious software. It's not 100% spotless, but by and large, it's a significantly better job that has been done [on] Google Play. Ultimately, the researchers agreed it was largely a myth that Mac users are not actively targeted by hackers and cybercriminals. Of course, other cybercrime techniques are platform agnostic. Phishing, for example, remains one of the top digital threats and occurs regardless of OS. And, for now at least, the quantities involved lag behind its Windows counterpart. "The bottom line is there isn't a lot of Mac malware," Ducklin admitted. "I'm not trying to say 'Whoa, what happened with WannaCry is going to happen with Macs in three and a half weeks' time." Ferguson, talking Apple's reputation, was harsher. "It's a position of trust, unearned," he asserted.
