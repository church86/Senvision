Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Business Steve Jobs thought the Genius Bar should be called ‘Geek Bar’ at first Chris Mills @chrisfmills March 6th, 2017 at 6:41 PM Share Tweet The Genius Bar is the Apple Store’s defining feature these days. Without waiting in line for an hour to have your MacBook checked out, behind a dude arguing furiously that there’s NO WAY his iPhone got wet, going to an Apple Store just wouldn’t be the same. But according to a new interview with the founder of the Genius Bar, it wasn’t always destined to be this way. Steve Jobs hated the idea at first, because he thought anyone geeky enough to understand computers wouldn’t have the people skills to talk to normal human beings. Don't Miss: New report reaffirms the most exciting new iPhone 8 feature On the Recode Decode podcast, former Apple retail guru Ron Johnson explains how the Apple Stores and their iconic Genius Bar came to be: “I remember the day I came in and told Steve about the Genius Bar idea and he says, ‘That’s so idiotic! It’ll never work!’” Johnson said. “He said, ‘Ron, you might have the right idea, but here’s the big gap: I’ve never met someone who knows technology who knows how to connect with people. They’re all geeks! You can call it the Geek Bar.’” “And I said, ‘Steve, kids who are in their 20s today grew up in a very different world. They all know technology, and that’s who’s going to work in the store.’” The Genius Bar became one of the centerpieces of Job’s vision for Apple stores, which were originally meant to be about far more than just retail. When Jobs unveiled the first store, he was keen that it wasn’t just a place to buy stuff; the idea was that Apple customers would spend time there, take classes there, and generally view the store as more than just another shrine to consumerism. Last year, Apple kicked off a revamping of its Apple retail stores with the unveiling of a new flagship in San Francisco, which replaces aisles and counters with forums and groves. It also ushered in the first iteration of the “Genius Grove,” which is basically Johnson’s Genius Bar but with more trees.

Claims firm has met with Paramount and Sony to hammer out a 'transformative acquisition' Sources revealed Apple held meetings with Paramount and Sony TV Suggests Apple is looking to buy a studio, instead of just TV shows Robert Kondrk, Eddy Cue, Jimmy Iovine are among those involved in meetings It's been rumored for months that Apple was looking to expand original content By Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.com Published: 18:29 EST, 6 March 2017 | Updated: 19:19 EST, 6 March 2017 e-mail 14 shares 9 View comments Apple could be the next big name in show business. The tech giant has been rumored to be expanding its original content, but the lasted speculation has suggested that the firm 'is looking for a transformative acquisition'. Sources have revealed to The New York Post that Apple executives met with Paramount Pictures and Sony TV in order to 'prepare something bigger' than purchasing shows - it could buy a studio. Scroll down for video  Apple wants to be seen as more than just an electronics maker. The tech giant has been rumored to be expanding its original content, but the lasted speculation has suggested that the firm 'is looking for a transformative acquisition'.  APPLE'S TV PLANS  It has been rumored since last month that Apple was expanding its original content.  The firm has made it known that it is working on episodes for 'Planet of the Apps' and 'Carpool Karaoke', which will be available to users who pay the monthly fee for Apple Music. Now, sources told The New York Post that Apple has held meetings with Paramount and Sony TV. Believe these meetings are to discuss a transformative acquisition - purchasing a studio.  According sources, it is believed that numerous Apple senior executives, such as Eddy Cue and Jimmy Iovine have been attending these meetings as well. The sources were not clear about the reason for these meetings – some say it was to hire a seasoned executive to run a TV and/or movie venture. And the others speculated that Apple was looking to conduct an acquisition to get their original programming started.   The latest move comes as Apple's iPhone sales have begun to slump and the firm is looking into other markets that could create an additional revenue stream for them. News about Apple heading to Hollywood was first revealed in January when The Wall Street Journal revealed the firm was talking to 'veteran producers' about producing its own to take on amazon and Netflix as well as traditional studios. It was also speculated in the same report that Apple will bundle the shows and movies with its music streaming service, Apple Music, and the first shows could hit screens by the end of 2017. And the firm has made it known that it is working on episodes for 'Planet of the Apps' and 'Carpool Karaoke', which will be available to users who pay the monthly fee for Apple Music. However, sources told The New York Post that Apple is looking beyond just buying shows. 'They talked to Sony and Paramount last week,' explained the anonymous source. 'They are preparing something big'. According to sources, it is believed that numerous Apple senior executives, such as Eddy Cue and Jimmy Iovine have been attending these meetings as well. The sources were not clear about the reason for these meetings – some say it was to hire a seasoned executive to run a TV and/or movie venture. And the others speculated that Apple was looking to conduct an acquisition to get their original programming started.

Share this article Share 14 shares 'Robert Kondrk, Eddy Cue, Jimmy Iovine, everyone is trying to be the person,' one insider told The Post. 'They each want to be the guy, and they're telling people, don't deal with the other one.' According sources, it is believed that numerous Apple senior executives, such as Eddy Cue (left) and Jimmy Iovine (right) have been attending these meetings as well. The sources were not clear about the reason for these meetings – some say it was to hire a seasoned executive to run a TV and/or movie venture and others say Apple was looking to conduct an acquisition 'Eddy is talking to some people. Jimmy is talking to others,' noted a second insider. 'They just haven't figured it out.' A third Hollywood insider, familiar with Apple's thinking, told The Post he didn't know 'if Apple is fully committed … I don't see them doing this as a startup. It's too small. It's too hard. I see them buying something first.' Apple seems to now understand that the public wants more than just short stories about musicians and could release content that is comparable to HBO's 'Westworld' or Netflix's 'Stranger Things', sources revealed to The Washington Post in January. Netflix and Amazon Prime may be the two firms to beat in this industry, but The Journal reports Apple isn't looking compete with these streaming giant. Instead, the Cupertino company has its sights set on Spotify. CARPOOL KARAOKE ON APPLE James Corden announced in January that he will be appearing 'at some point this year' on the show, which has been sold to Apple as a 16 part standalone show.  James Corden presides over his late-night show's 'Carpool Karaoke' segment, but the series spin-off will have a succession of hosts. It'S believed that the content will be available for users who pay a $10-a-month fee to stream music from Apple Music, according to people familiar with the matter. The firm already offers these users access to 'Carpool Karakoke', which it bought last year Celebrity pairs including Alicia Keys and John Legend, Ariana Grande and Seth MacFarlane, and Blake Shelton and Chelsea Handler will be featured on the 16-episode series to be released weekly on Apple Music. A debut date has yet to be announced, but E! has reported that it will be later this year. Corden, who will appear with Will Smith on one episode, said he was proud The Late Late Show has created a segment that works so well it will stand on its own. Apple, which revolutionized music consumption when it launched iTunes in 2001, in 2015 made a concerted push into the booming area of streaming through Apple Music. The company says the service has drawn over 15 million subscribers but it still trails leader Spotify, which said it had 28 million paying subscribers at the end of 2015. If the allegations are true, this move could put Apple in the lead, as it would offer much more content than Spotify. Apple has already signed a deal with CBS Television Studios and Fulwell 73 in July 2016 that turned 'Carpool Karaoke' into a full-blown series. Sources have revealed to The New York Post that Apple executives met with Paramount Pictures and Sony TV in order to 'prepare something bigger' than purchasing shows - it could buy a studio. Apple could release content that is comparable to HBO's 'Westworld' (pictured) This new series will only available for subscribers to the iPhone maker's music streaming app and E! has reported fans will be able to watch it sometime later this year. And just a few days before announcing the purchase of 'Carpool Karaoke', the firm revealed details of an original TV series called 'Planet of the Apps'.

Owens of MasterChef Junior fame. Will.i.am will also be involved, and contestant will compete for funding of up to $10m. The casting call in July was looking for app creators who have a vision to 'shape the future, solve real problems, and inspire change within our daily lives.' The firm is apparently in talks with producers, marketers and other networks about the content. Apple has tested the waters with original content and is still working on release its 'Planet of the Apps' 'Over 2 million apps are available on the App Store, with new apps published every day,' said Silverman and Owens, Co-CEOs of Propagate. 'Planet of the Apps will give app creators the chance to break through and share their ideas with the world. 'This is an exciting format that taps into what is driving culture today. Developers who make it to the final round of the show will also meet with venture capitalists who will be investing up to $10 million, though Apple says developers are not required to take the money or give up any equity in their apps. Apps featured in the show will also receive prime placement in the App Store.    Read more: Apple Sets Its Sights on Hollywood With Plans for Original Content - WSJ Apple execs vying for original movie, TV deals | New York Post Apple News on iPhone, iPad and Macbooks | Daily Mail Online Share or comment on this article e-mail 14 shares Most watched News videos Leopards attack giant Rock Python in Kruger National Park The Walking Dead: New strain of spice turns homeless into zombies Woman stops car to beat passenger senseless on the road Louis Tomlinson challenges photographer before taking out fan Shocking video shows moment teenager is stabbed in South Norwood Droning on!: Neighbour tries to shoot down spying drone Violent brawl breaks out after man is savagely headbutted to floor Shocking video shows why Coke Zero really is better for you Dash cam captures close drive-By shooting in Kansas Avalanche crashes down mountain at Russian ski resort Clever dog says 'I love you' to its owner to get treat Sickening mass brawl at fight event after man leaps into ring PIERS MORGAN: Sorry Emma, but you haven’t done yourself...

Eric Jhonsa Mar 6, 2017 4:50 PM EST This article originally appeared on Real Money on March 3, 2017. As much as Amazon's (AMZN) Echo home speaker/voice assistant has turned into a surprise hit and yielded a blizzard of positive media attention, the Alexa voice assistant powering Echo hardware is still in key respects at a strategic disadvantage compared to rival offerings from Alphabet/Google (GOOGL) , Apple (AAPL) , and Microsoft's (MSFT) . Google and Apple's assistants each shipped with hundreds of millions of mobile devices last year, and Microsoft's on perhaps close to 200 million PCs. By contrast, Echo sales (judging by estimates) were likely only in the seven figures. In theory, that would leave Google/Apple much better-positioned to create powerful third-party ecosystems for their assistants, as well as to optimize them in response to user voice commands. In practice, however, Amazon's all-out push to both improve Alexa and place it within as many devices as possible is making for a very interesting battle. Earlier this week, Lenovo's Motorola Mobility unit announced it plans to bundle Alexa with "most" of its phones going forward. Since then, Re/code has reported Amazon plans to launch one or two Alexa devices this year that will "allow people to initiate phone calls by voice," as well as let multiple devices function as a home or office's intercom system. And Amazon hardware news site AFTVnews has come across an image on Amazon's site that suggests the company plans to launch a home security camera with Alexa built in. All of this comes less than two months after dozens of Alexa-powered devices were shown off at CES by companies not named Amazon. These included Alexa-powered speakers, robots, refrigerators, TV sets and alarm clocks, as well as a Huawei Android phone. In addition, dozens of home electronics and appliance makers announced that their latest products can be controlled via Alexa. That last fact underscores just how successful Amazon has been at creating a giant hardware, app and Internet service ecosystem for Alexa. At CES, Amazon announced Alexa now supports over 7,000 third-party "skills," up from just 1,000 last June. They cover everything from playing games to ordering Uber rides and Domino's pizzas to controlling home lights and thermostats to hearing sports scores and news stories.

Speaking to Recode, former Apple Store chief Ron Johnson says Jobs called the idea ‘idiotic’ and blasted tech enthusiasts as ‘geeks’ lacking people skills. Recalling the story, Johnson explains Jobs’ reaction after he presented his vision for a tech support experience that would offer in-store tuition, troubleshooting and repairs. Related: Apple's 0% offer makes everything look cheaper Johnson said: “I remember the day I came in and told Steve about the Genius Bar idea and he says, ‘That’s so idiotic! It’ll never work!’” He said Jobs asserted: ”I’ve never met someone who knows technology who knows how to connect with people. They’re all geeks! You can call it the Geek Bar.’ “And I said ‘Steve, kids who are in their 20s today grew up in a very different world. They all know technology, and that’s who’s going to work in the store.” Obviously, Johnson was able to convince the then chief executive as the next day, Jobs called Apple lawyers to trademark the term ‘Genius Bar.’ You can listen to the full Recode interview at the source link.

 Spotify isn't turning a profit, but it’s still keeping Apple Music at arm’s length Jeff Dunn Mar. 6, 2017, 5:09 PM 2,147 facebook linkedin twitter email print More Charts   Last week marked a new milestone for Spotify, as the music streaming service announced on Twitter that it had reached 50 million paid subscribers. That’s good news for Spotify, given that it’s the fastest amount of time in which the Swedish company has added 10 million paying listeners. But it’s particularly encouraging when you consider how Apple has had it directly in its crosshairs for the past two years. As this chart from Statista shows, despite Apple fast-tracking Apple Music to every iPhone owner, Spotify has managed to grow right alongside its chief rival every step of the way. As of last December, Apple Music has 20 million paid users — though it wouldn’t be surprising to see Apple flaunt another milestone sometime soon. While Spotify seems to be doing a good job of corralling the many music streaming converts, it’s worth noting that the streaming service still isn’t profitable. The company could turn that around in the near-future, but it won’t be a problem for Apple anytime soon.

Why that could also drive Apple revenue. By Emily Bary March 6, 2017 3:30 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Apple’s “services” revenue could get a bump from folks who are buying second-hand iPhones. Illustration: Agence France-Presse/Getty Images There’s a good deal of pressure on the iPhone 8. After disappointing upgrade cycles following the iPhone 6S and iPhone 7 launches, there are a lot of old phones out there. Investors are hoping that this fall’s new models will prompt a “supercycle” of upgrades, especially because some could cost more than $1,000. More from Barron’s Next What Warren Buffett Learned About the iPhone at Dairy Queen Here Comes The iPhone ‘Supercycle’ Get Ready for the $1,000 iPhone Of the 715 million iPhones currently in use -- the number of phones making up Apple’s “installed base” -- 31% will have gone “un-upgraded” for more than two years by the time the new iPhone comes out in September, according to BMO Capital Markets. That’s up from 25% at the time of the iPhone 7 launch. The flagship iPhone 8 is rumored to have an edge-to-edge screen, meaning no physical home button, and it might have more available screen space than the current iPhone 7 Plus does. Changes to the look and feel of the iPhone are what drove a big upgrade wave in 2014, when the larger screen iPhone 6 was launched. New device sales aren’t the only way Apple gets more users. When people get new phones, they’re being increasingly encouraged to trade in their old devices, and those can be wiped and re-sold, often by third-party retailers. The number of second-hand iPhones might increase to 300 million in 2018 from 228 million at the end of 2016, BMO analyst Tim Long predicts, as people switch from “mass-market Android phones.” Of course, Apple doesn’t usually get money upfront when this happens, but it does increase the number of users who could spend money on its “services” -- things like iCloud and the App Store. And when it comes to “services,” it doesn’t matter so much what model of iPhone people use. Big Picture: Wall Street is focused on predicting iPhone 8 sales, but sales of second-hand iPhones could also help Apple in a way, according to one analyst.

By Sam Forgione NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc , told CNBC on Monday that his conglomerate had purchased "70 million plus" shares of Apple Inc in 2017 and that U.S. stocks were not in "bubble territory." "Apple strikes me as having quite a sticky product and an enormously useful product to people that use it, not that I do," Buffett said. He said Berkshire's Apple stake, at 133 million shares, was worth about $17 billion and amounted to Berkshire's second-biggest holding. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook had done a "terrific job," Buffett said, but added he had not bought shares since the company's earnings report. Berkshire revealed in its annual report on Saturday that its massive stake in Apple stock, as of Dec. 31, had risen to 61.2 million shares for a total of $6.75 billion. Buffett, who told the cable television network that Berkshire had spent about $20 billion on stocks since just before the Nov. 8 U.S. election, also said the U.S. stock market was cheap with interest rates at current levels. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last yielded 2.333 percent in morning U.S. trading. The billionaire investor said it was extremely difficult to attempt to find a floor in stock prices and that he did not know what would happen in the near term in the equity market. He said U.S. shares could conceivably "go down 20 percent tomorrow." Buffett said Berkshire's positions in airlines remained unchanged. He said pricing shares of airlines has historically been a "very tough game" and he had never met the chief executives of the four airlines in which Berkshire holds stakes. Berkshire reported a $9.3 billion airline stake at the end of Dec. 31, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, with investments topping $2.1 billion in each of American Airlines Group Inc , Delta Air Lines Inc , Southwest Airlines Co and United Continental Holdings Inc . Buffett, who was a vocal supporter of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, said he would judge U.S. President Donald Trump based on how safe the country is in four years. He said he would also judge the Republican president according to how the U.S. economy performs overall and how wide participation in a better economy extends. Despite his disagreement with some of Trump's policies, Buffett said the U.S. economy would be better off in four years under any president. He said that U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made "a lot of sense." On Kraft Heinz's snubbed bid for Unilever , Buffett said it was never intended to be a hostile offer and that there was not a "backup deal." Berkshire is a key investor in Kraft Heinz. "Will there be another deal at Kraft Heinz some day? My guess is yes, but who knows when, I mean, there's no backup deal, and again, it would have to be friendly and frankly, the prices in that field make it very, very, very tough to make an intelligent deal." Asked about Berkshire's $86 billion cash pile, he said the conglomerate was "always looking" for acquisitions but that there was "nothing close." Buffett said it was enormously important for the U.S. economy to have 30-year government-guaranteed mortgages, but that mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not necessary in order to accomplish that. On 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds, Buffett said: "It absolutely baffles me who buys the 30-year bond" and that doing so was not sensible at current yields. U.S. 30-year government bonds last yielded 2.964 percent. Buffett reiterated that Americans are better off buying plain-vanilla index funds than committing money to active managers. He added that the hedge fund industry's standard fee structure of 2 percent of assets and 20 percent of investment gains "borders on obscene." In an annual letter to shareholders on Saturday, Buffett slammed fee-hungry investment managers: "When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients." Buffett praised Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos as possibly the best manager he had ever seen and said Berkshire "missed big time" by not purchasing Amazon shares early on. Buffett said the U.S. economy was doing "terrific," even at just 2 percent growth per year.

Best iPhone, iPad, & Apple TV game controllers According to the report, regulators in the country from the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) over the weekend confirmed they’ve granted the first round of approvals to banks for Apple Pay. Among the banks are “Taipei Fubon Commercial Bank, Cathay United Bank, E. Sun Commercial Bank, Taishin International Bank, CTBC Bank, First Commercial Bank, and Union Bank of Taiwan.” Earlier this year Apple confirmed that Taiwan would be one of its next launch countries with a number of partners listed including Cathay United Bank, CTBC Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, E. Sun Commercial Bank, Taishin International Bank, Taipei Fubon Commercial Bank, and Union Bank of Taiwan. Of the banks with approvals from the FSC, First Bank is the only one left out from Apple’s list. The launch will make Taiwan the 14th region to accept the payment service following the US, Australia, Canada, France, Russia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Australia, Mainland China, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore, Japan, and Spain. In addition, Apple recently hinted that a launch for Germany and Italy could also be coming soon. While the banks now have approval to support Apple Pay, the report notes that regulators from the Financial Supervisory Commission said it’s unclear when Apple will actually launch the service.

 Apple’s most iconic store saved a property Trump couldn’t lease for years Kif Leswing Mar. 6, 2017, 4:31 PM 7,278 facebook linkedin twitter email print The "glass cube" Apple StoreGetty The 5th Avenue Apple store in New York is one of the company's most famous locations and has become a tourist attraction. Turns out, Apple got a deal on the location, because its past owners, including President Donald Trump, couldn't figure out a use for the property before Apple decided to lease it, according to former Apple retail boss Ron Johnson in an interview with Recode.  The store, lovingly nicknamed the "glass cube," is almost entirely underground. To enter, customers descend a glass staircase in a glass cube in the middle of a plaza.  "The glass cube was a really big deal. We wanted to put a store on 5th Ave. It’s the greatest shopping street in the world, and we looked for years and years," Johnson explained. "Finally, our real estate guy came back and says 'I’ve got a brilliant idea. We’re going to take a spot that Donald Trump couldn’t lease for 7 years, it’s been unoccupied, and we get a hole in the ground.'" The landlord wasn't able to find anyone who wanted to rent the space because of the restrictions on above-ground space.  That's when Apple came up with the idea to put the store underground, with only a 900 square foot footprint above ground.  Google Maps That hole in the ground eventually became the flagship Apple store in New York. And Apple got a deal on it — Johnson says Apple's rent was 1/8 of what it was two blocks away. (Two blocks away is Trump Tower, where retailers like Gucci and Tiffany have their flagship stores.) The plaza was built as part of the General Motors building, which was owned at one point by President Donald Trump, and even had T-R-U-M-P signage, according to the New York Times. " I love building great buildings. I own the General Motors building," Trump said in 1999.  Trump sold the building in 2003 to developer Harry Macklowe, who became Apple's landlord in 2006 when the store opened for the first time. (Macklowe was forced to sell the property in 2008.) "Donald owned the General Motors building, for a number of years, then he sold it to a guy named Harry Macklowe, who was our landlord," Johnson said. "We rented from Harry. This spot had been unrentable for 7 years, nobody wanted it, Donald’s a smart guy, but that’s where I give Steve [Jobs] so much credit, he could’ve said, 'Apple’s at the top of the world, we should have a big building like Louis Vuitton,' but he understood that doing something beautiful and simple, giving back to the community, could have more power."

The "cube" is located in the middle of a New York plaza, which means it's public space.  "We convinced the city to let us put in this physical presence, we said look, we’re going to take 5% [of the plaza space] for our door, and we’re going to redo the plaza for the City of New York, we’re going to put in Wi-Fi. And the city said OK, and that became the Apple Store," Johnson said.  Now the 5th Avenue Apple store faces issues dealing with traffic in the neighborhood. Police have set up barriers around Trump Tower, which has reduced the pedestrian traffic Apple has benefitted from in the past.  Currently, the 5th Avenue Apple store is closed. Apple has temporarily moved into a space nearby, and plans to double the space available at the underground store. The expansion of the location is expected to finish late next year, according to Bloomberg. Still, people continue to flock to the glass cube and photograph it, even while it's closed. "A few years later, the Apple Store is the 5th most photographed thing in New York," Johnson said.  Listen to the entire interview with Ron Johnson here.  The view from underground, in the 5th ave Apple storeGetty SEE ALSO: Bill Gates once stayed up until 4 a.m. to write a game that Apple thought was 'embarrassing' NOW WATCH: Tesla will begin selling its Solar Roof this year — here's everything you need to know Loading video...

Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Mar 6, 2017 at 4:30PM Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) launch of its Spotify-like streaming music service in 2015 was an important move for the tech giant. Not only did it bolster Apple's services business with a new subscription offering, but it strengthened the overall integrated ecosystem of Apple-branded hardware, software, and services that help customers stay locked into Apple's products. But is Apple's music service failing to live up to its potential? Spotify's rapid growth since Apple Music's launch suggests Apple's new music service may not be resonating with customers the way investors hoped it would. Image source: Spotify. Spotify vs. Apple Music: By the numbers Apple Music recently made headlines when Apple Internet Software and Products Vice President Eddy Cue told Billboard that the music service had surpassed 20 million subscribers. Cue also took the opportunity to give the world a glimpse of Apple's ambition with the service, noting that the company went from zero subscribers in June 2015 to 20 million in December 2016. "[O]f course we want more and we want it to go faster -- we're hungry!" Cue told Billboard. But despite Apple Music hitting the 20-million subscriber milestone, Spotify's March 2 announcement that it just hit 50 million subscribers shows how its service is growing significantly faster than Apple Music recently. Spotify's reported 50 million paid subscribers is up from 40 million in the middle of September. This represents a growth rate of about 1.8 million paid users a month. Apple's most recent milestone of 20 million was up about 3 million users in three months compared to its last update on its paid users for Apple Music, representing a growth rate of about 1 million per month. Maybe Spotify is a bit hungrier than Apple? There's no excuse for Apple Music's underperformance Ahead of Apple Music's launch, everything lined up for the music service to quickly grow to rival Spotify, or at least to hit a point where it can sustain Spotify's growth rates. After all, Apple was already a music juggernaut with its iTunes. With Apple reporting in 2014 it had 800 million credit card numbers linked to iTunes, the service easily has over a billion credit cards on file in 2017. Adding to the growing list of reasons for Apple Music to be a smashing hit, Apple even redesigned Apple Music "from the ground up" this summer in an effort to accelerate demand for the service. Apple Music should have easily built on this strong foundation and catapulted the new music service to a level that threatened Spotify's dominance. Apple Music. Image source: Apple. What's even more concerning is that Spotify's meteoric growth only highlights how unfortunate it is that Apple hasn't built a streaming music service compelling enough to keep up with Spotify's stronger ability to attract new customers. Growing from 30 million paid subscribers last March to 40 million about three months ago to about 50 million now, Spotify is putting the spotlight on the strength of the streaming music market. On the other hand, with Spotify's growth continuing to outpace Apple Music's, this new milestone for Spotify could potentially serve as a wake-up call for Apple management to begin investing more aggressively in its streaming music offering. And given Apple's $50 billion-plus in annual free cash flow, its resources to invest in its music service are virtually unlimited compared to Spotify's business model, which has yet to achieve profitability. But given Spotify's ability to outperform Apple Music so far, Apple investors shouldn't count on Apple Music catching up to Spotify. Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple.

Mac Anytime Soon An analysis of Intel's three-year financial guidance suggests that it expects to stay in Apple's notebook computers over that time frame. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 6, 2017 at 3:30PM Rumors are swirling that microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) may be on the verge of losing its spot as the supplier of the processors that power Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iMac desktop and MacBook notebook products. Hypotheses range from Apple's designing its own chip for the Mac to speculation that Apple will use chips from alternative processor vendors. However, I believe that based on Intel's recent commentary at its Feb. 9 investor day, it is unlikely that the company is going to lose these orders. Image source: Apple. Intel's CCG financial guidance If Intel were to lose some -- or all -- of the Mac processor orders, this would manifest as a reduction in the company's Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue and operating profits. If we estimate that Apple pays an average of $200 for Intel processors and related components, then that's $4 billion in revenue that could potentially be at risk. Put another way, if that $4 billion were to disappear (or drop significantly), then Intel could potentially see more than 10% of its CCG revenue vanish. That wouldn't be the end of the world, but it's the sort of thing that would sting. At its investor day, Intel said that it expects its revenue in CCG to decline at a "low-single-digits" pace -- or an average of 1%-3% annually over the next three years. If we compound the low and high ends of that range, Intel is planning for between a 3% and a 9% decline in CCG revenue from 2016 levels by the end of 2019. Here's a translation to hard dollar figures: Intel is planning for CCG revenue to drop by a total of between $1 billion and $3 billion in that three-year period -- $2 billion at the midpoint. At the same time, CEO Brian Krzanich said in his investor meeting presentation that he expects the PC processor total addressable market to be worth around $30 billion in 2021 -- $2 billion down from where the company pegged the total addressable market in 2016. Putting the numbers together If Intel expects the PC processor total addressable market to drop by around $2 billion by 2021 and is planning for "low-single-digit" declines in CCG through 2019 (a $2 billion decline at the midpoint), then it doesn't look to me like the company is guiding for significant personal-computer processor revenue share loss. Now, it's worth noting that forecasts this long out aren't going to be perfect, but Intel likely has visibility into the personal-computer design win pipelines at its various customers, including Apple. If Apple were preparing to shift away from Intel processors for Macs released over the next couple of years, then Intel would likely be aware of that imminent shift and should have included that expectation in its multi-year forecast. Based on this analysis, I don't think Intel investors ought to worry too much about Apple's switching away from Intel processors anytime soon in its MacBook or iMac products. Over the long term, however, anything is possible, so Intel will have to make sure that it has an increasingly compelling product pipeline to keep Apple interested. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

This new drone video is unique in that it does not feature any text overlays, focusing instead on offering a detailed look at every angle of the new campus… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case The video shows work still being performed around the campus ahead of its opening next month. The center of the spaceship campus is still being filled in, while other areas are starting to take shape at a rapid pace. The newly-named Steve Jobs Theatre can be seen, while work is also continuing on the underground parking facility. Furthermore, work continues on the solar panel roof, as well as the tree and gardening design of the campus. The new 4K drone video is absolutely beautiful, offering a simply flyover of Apple Park and providing peaks at the main building and other subsidiary buildings. There are no text overlays, allowing for some really high-quality and enjoyable footage. Two weeks ago, Apple announced a handful of new details about its upcoming campus redesign, including the official name of Apple Park.  Apple also announced that the auditorium will be named after the company’s late CEO and founder, Steve Jobs Theater. Apple Park is set to open next month, which is when employees and executives begin to make the transfer. “Steve was exhilarated, and inspired, by the California landscape, by its light and its expansiveness. It was his favorite setting for thought. Apple Park captures his spirit uncannily well,” said Laurene Powell Jobs. “He would have flourished, as the people of Apple surely will, on this luminously designed campus.” You can see past progress on our timeline of drone footage, aerial photos and more. More interior details also recently emerged, including polished concrete ceilings, iPhone-like elevator buttons and flat doorways. Apple previously shared a number of photos of the interior, but many questions remained unanswered about the interior design at this point. What do you think of Apple’s new campus thus far?

The report reiterates the fact that Apple will introduce a new 5.8-inch OLED iPhone, as well as two new smaller devices with LCD panels. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case The report is more notable, however, considering Nikkei had previously resisted rumors that Apple was planning a larger-screened iPhone and reported that Apple would instead introduce new 4.7-inch, 5-inch, and 5.5-inch iPhones. The upcoming iPhone, to be launched this fall, will come in three configurations — two with liquid crystal displays and one with a 5.8-inch organic light-emitting diode display. It’s still unclear as to the fate of the rumored 5-inch iPhone. A recent investor note from KGI stated that while the iPhone 8 will feature a 5.8-inch display, there will be “function area” at the bottom, which would make for a roughly 5.15-inches of usable screen pace. For this reason, it’s unclear how Apple will market the iPhone 8 in terms of screen size. Today’s report goes to note of the effect of the higher priced iPhone 8. Nikkei specifically notes that the Chinese smartphone market is continuing to slow, thus causing customers to be less likely to shell out even more money for the top of the line device. A report last week claimed that Apple may have to push the release of the flagship iPhone model back due to supply constraints. The report explained that Apple isn’t on track to begin iPhone 8 production until September of this year, thus meaning the new device won’t be available for purchase in September like it normally is. It is believed that the biggest reason for the delay is because of supply constrained OLED display part. Several different reports have highlighted Apple’s search for a supplier in that area. Other rumored iPhone 8 changes include new biometric technologies, a new all-glass design, and Touch ID integrated into the display. Apple is also said to be prepping two more iterative updates with the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. These devices are said to enter production in July of this year.

In addition to receiving a free ticket to the event — which would otherwise cost $1,599 — this year it appears that Apple is offering WWDC Scholarship recipients free lodging in the form of shared accommodations. Applicants with extenuating circumstances may also be eligible for travel assistance. To be eligible for a WWDC scholarship, applicants must be 13 years or older, registered with Apple as an Apple developer, and enrolled part-time or full-time in a course of study or be a member of alumni of a STEM organization. The application process includes submitting relevant personal information, school or STEM membership information, a resume/CV, a “Beyond WWDC” essay, and creating and uploading “a visually interactive scene in a Swift playground that can be experienced within three minutes.” A team within Apple will judge applications based on technical accomplishment, creativity of ideas, and content of written responses. Applications will be accepted beginning at 10:00 a.m. PT on Mar. 27 until 5:00 p.m. PT on Apr. 2, and those selected to receive a scholarship will be notified on Apr. 21. Apple is offering up to 350 scholarships, although not all scholarships may be awarded.

Here's how to find the one that's right for you. Wearable Tech by Scott Stein March 6, 2017 12:02 PM PST @jetscott by Dan Graziano March 6, 2017 12:02 PM PST @DanGraziano Sarah Tew/CNET If you're shopping for a piece of wearable tech in 2017, you're facing compromises. Smartwatches and fitness trackers aren't really the must-have devices many companies hoped they would be. And no, you don't really need one. But if you're looking for a piece of tech for your wrist, here are the best choices right now, followed by a list of what you need to consider. The best smartwatches and fitness trackers right now The best smartwatches right now For the iPhone: Apple Watch Series 1 (but see below about the Series 2) For Android: Samsung Gear S3 For most people, The Apple Watch Series 1 is all you'd need. But if you want to swim or use GPS away from your phone, the Series 2 is the one to get. (And note: If you have an original Apple Watch, there's not a huge need to upgrade to the Series 2 unless you really need that swim-proofing or GPS tracking.) But the Apple Watch wins mainly because it's well hooked-in to iOS, and functions as a great wrist-remote. The Apple Watch isn't perfect by any means, but its feature set is ahead of the competition. The decision gets harder for Android users. Android Wear is the most hooked-in platform that connects to Google's apps and services (including Google Assistant), and Android Wear 2.0 is a big improvement. But there aren't any truly great watches for Android Wear yet. LG's Watch Sport and Watch Style, the first to have the updated software, are full of limitations. Sarah Tew/CNET The best watch hardware isn't Android Wear at all: it's the Samsung Gear S3. Samsung's large smartwatch has deep features and decent fitness tracking modes, plus use-anywhere Samsung Pay (which requires Android). But it requires a separate set of Samsung Gear apps and syncs to Samsung S-Health for fitness. This requires more conduits and app plug-ins than you might have patience for. It's not as seamless an experience, and sometimes feels too removed from core Android functions. If you have an Android phone and you're absolutely sold on getting a smartwatch, the Samsung Gear S3 is the best option right now, but that could change once older Android Wear watches are updated to Android Wear 2.0. We're also waiting for Fitbit, Misfit and other companies to release their smartwatches in 2017. 10 The smartwatches and fitness trackers we can't wait to see in 2017 The best fitness trackers A Fitbit is the right choice for most people. The whole range can track the basics like steps, distance, calories burned and sleep, and some can even measure heart rate and include guided breathing sessions. One of the reasons we recommend Fitbit is for the app. If one of your friends owns a fitness tracker, there's a good chance it's a Fitbit -- the company has the largest user base. The benefit of this is being able to compete with friends and family members in a variety of competitions, which helps keep you motivated and more likely to reach your goal. The app also integrates a number of third-party devices and services. For most people, the Fitbit Charge 2 is the tracker to get. (Note: The just-announced Fitbit Alta HR should be considered as well.) For a more basic (and swim-proof) tracker, we recommend the Fitbit Flex 2. Looking for a fitness smartwatch? The Fitbit Blaze is worth a look. Sarah Tew/CNET The best non-Fitbit tracker A reason to skip the Fitbit would be if you're already invested in an ecosystem like Withings or Garmin. In that case, it's best to get one of their trackers. The Garmin Vivomove is our favorite tracker that doesn't look like a tracker. The Garmin Vivosmart HR (or HR+ for GPS) is our favorite traditional Garmin fitness tracker. The Withings Steel HR is our favorite Withings tracker. The best GPS watches Athletes and outdoor enthusiasts are better off with a GPS watch to accurately measure pace, distance, speed and other metrics. For casual and serious runners, our favorite is the Garmin Forerunner 235. For casual multisport athletes it's the Garmin Vivoactive HR. Serious triathletes should check out the Forerunner 735XT. For the ultimate multisport and outdoor watch, there's the Garmin Fenix 3 HR , but it will soon be replaced by the newly announced Fenix 5. All of these watches are waterproof down to at least 50 meters, include multiple sport profiles, can track daily fitness metrics like steps, sleep and heart rate, and can display notifications from an iPhone and Android phone. Sarah Tew/CNET The best GPS bike computers Cyclists should consider a GPS bike computer for measuring distance and speed. These devices can also connect with other sensors on your bike to measure additional metrics like cadence and power. For beginners, we recommend the Polar M450. More serious riders should check out the Garmin Edge 520. Shopping for wearables: What you need to know The wearable market is getting smaller. Fitbit bought Pebble, Jawbone has pivoted away from consumer trackers, and other companies (such as Motorola) have put their smartwatch plans on hold. But there's still a wide variety of smartwatches and trackers to choose from. Here's how to find the right one. Android or iPhone? That still matters, to a degree. The Apple Watch works with iPhones -- and only iPhones. Android phones work with Android Wear. Samsung's Gear S2 and S3 watches work with Android phones, too. Both Android Wear and Samsung watches pair with iPhones, but in a more limited way that is nowhere as good as what the Apple Watch offers. Fitness bands tend to work cross-platform, but not always. Does charging a watch annoy you? Many premium smartwatches still have battery life of two days or less between charges. The Apple Watch, Google's Android Wear watches, and Samsung's Gear S2 and S3 are high-maintenance, and need daily or every-other-day charging. Are you ready to live with that? If so, the Apple Watch, Samsung Gear S3 or an updated Android Wear 2.0 watch might be worth a try. Pebble's long-battery smartwatches still exist, but Pebble's sale to Fitbit and Pebble's uncertain watch future as a platform means we don't recommend current models anymore. Sarah Tew/CNET Do you want a great fitness tracker? Most wearable bands and watches aim for fitness tracking, but some are better than others. The best pure overall fitness tracker is still the Fitbit Charge 2. Garmin also makes several good alternatives, and good running watches. Full-featured smartwatches like the Apple Watch and Android Wear 2.0 watches can track activities and work with many third-party fitness apps, but connect mainly to Apple Health and Google Fit for synced data. Do you want to swim with it? Many wearables are water resistant to at least wash-your-hands or quick-dunk-in-a-sink level, but the list of real swim-proof trackers and watches is short. You want to look for 3ATM or 5ATM, or anything that suggests meters of water resistance. The Apple Watch Series 2, Fitbit Flex 2, Withings Steel HR, Misfit Ray, Garmin Vivoactive HR and Garmin Forerunner 235 are some of our favorite swim-friendly wearables. The Pebble 2, Pebble Time and Time Steel are swim-friendly, too. But they don't all do swim tracking. For swim tracking, look into the Garmin Vivoactive HR, Garmin Fenix 3 HR, Garmin Forerunner 735XT, Apple Watch Series 2, Misfit Ray, Withings Steel HR and Fitbit Flex 2. Sarah Tew/CNET Watches with built-in phones aren't great, but they exist Some smartwatches come with phone service inside. The Samsung Gear S3 Frontier, LG Watch Sport and Verizon's upcoming Wear24 work with SIM cards and can function as independent phones. Samsung and LG's watches work with T-Mobile and AT&T, while Verizon's Wear24 is, well, Verizon. Phone service can be useful in case of emergency, but it drains battery life on the watch and requires an extra monthly payment (currently $5 a month on T-Mobile, $10 a month on AT&T) to use. AT&T allows phone-number syncing across devices. You can pay for things with your watch Lots of smartwatches support mobile payments now. They mostly work the same way. Apple Watches have Apple Pay. Samsung's Gear S2 and S3 watches can use Samsung Pay. It adds an extra wrinkle on the S3 model with MST, a technology that works at regular credit card terminals as well as tap-to-pay ones. Android Wear 2.0-updated watches will work with Android Pay as long as the watch has NFC. Not all Android Wear watches do. Right now, in fact, the only Android Pay-enabled watch is the LG Watch Sport.

However, the company reportedly will use OLED display screens for all iPhone models by 2019, sources in Apple’s supply chain told Korean news site The Bell. Apple is expected to implement OLED panels on 60 million units of the iPhone 8 this year, about 40 percent of its total manufacturing number, the report said. Next year, Apple will double its adoption of OLED displays to 80 percent, and go up to 100 percent in 2019. Meanwhile, Samsung and Interflex have invested in equipment to prepare for flexible printed circuit boards (FPCB) for Apple iPhones. Samsung has begun expanding its plant in Vietnam, the report said. Apple is expected to release two iPhones with LCD panels this year and the iPhone 8 (or iPhone X) with an OLED panel which could stretch across the entire front of the device, meaning the iPhone might be priced at more than $1,000. As for casing material, Apple is rumored to release the 4.7-inch iPhone 7S with aluminum casing and a 5.8-inch iPhone 8 with a glass casing reinforced with a stainless steel frame, according to a February DigiTimes report. The casing for the 5.5-inch iPhone has not been confirmed as of yet. Other rumored features include face recognition, improved 3D Touch, and dual lens cameras on the 5.5-inch and 5.8-inch models.

It’ll never work!’ The longtime Apple CEO had to be convinced that tech support could connect with customers. by Eric Johnson@HeyHeyESJ Mar 6, 2017, 11:00am EST tweet share Linkedin Asa Mathat In 2000, when Apple hired Ron Johnson to create and run its first retail stores, Johnson got a crash course in working with Steve Jobs. The two men “clicked from Day One,” Johnson recalled on the latest Recode Decode, hosted by Kara Swisher, and when he was interviewing for the position, Jobs gave him some homework. “He said to me, ‘It’s Thanksgiving weekend coming up. Why don’t you write down what you would do? How would you approach retail? Tell me about it,’” Johnson said. “So I went back and I wrote this 10-page thesis of why Apple should do stores, what they should be like, blah blah blah.” “I get the call, ‘Hey, can you come back?’” he added. “I walk in, he [Jobs] goes, ‘Hey, thanks for coming back.’ I said, ‘So what’d you think of my thesis?’ And he goes, ‘Well, I didn’t like it very much, but that’s okay. Let’s talk!’ That’s Steve. He offered me the job that day.” Arguably the centerpiece of what became the Apple Store is the Genius Bar, one of Johnson’s ideas. Customers can take private lessons in how to use their new Apple products, or take existing products in for tech support and repairs. Jobs hated the idea. “I remember the day I came in and told Steve about the Genius Bar idea and he says, ‘That’s so idiotic! It’ll never work!’” Johnson said. “He said, ‘Ron, you might have the right idea, but here’s the big gap: I’ve never met someone who knows technology who knows how to connect with people. They’re all geeks! You can call it the Geek Bar.’” “And I said, ‘Steve, kids who are in their 20s today grew up in a very different world. They all know technology, and that’s who’s going to work in the store.’” The next day, Steve called Apple’s general counsel to trademark the phrase “Genius Bar.” You can listen to Recode Decode in the audio player above, or subscribe on iTunes, Google Play Music, TuneIn, Stitcher and SoundCloud.

The team weighs in on the incredible rally markets have enjoyed since Donald Trump's controversial election victory in November. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Mar 6, 2017 at 3:19PM In this episode of Market Foolery, Mac Greer is joined by David Kretzmann and Matt Argersinger as they consider the incredible gains major indexes have enjoyed since Trump won the election and his administration officially took the reins -- the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq have all traded up at least 10% in that period The cast also looks at the latest news and results from Lowe's (NYSE:LOW), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), and Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) before turning their attention to the premiere of YouTube TV, the latest combatant to appear on the entertainment battlefield. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on March 1, 2016. Mac Greer: It's Wednesday, March 1st. Welcome to Market Foolery. I'm Mac Greer, and joining me in studio we have Matt Argersinger from Motley Fool Million Dollar Portfolio and David Kretzmann from Motley Fool Supernova. Guys, welcome! David Kretzmann: Hey! Matt Argersinger: Hey, Mac! Greer: Guys, let's begin with what's being called the Trump rally. The market opening up big on Wednesday after President Trump's address to Congress on Tuesday. Matt, the stock market keeps hitting new highs, we have talked of corporate tax reform, free and fair trade, big increases in defense and infrastructure spending, we have healthcare talk about reform and repeal and replace. What does it all mean for investors? Argersinger: Well, it's all stuff investors should love. I'm keying in on, mainly, the $1 trillion public and private infrastructure spending, which, I think, realistic or not, that could boost a lot of spending, bring a lot of cash out into the market into corporation coffers. We love to hear this, and as investors, it's really exciting. We have to really dial back our enthusiasm a little bit. As much as all this sounds great, it's a lot of luster, and in reality, whether it's Trump or any other president, only about a fraction of these things will probably get done, and certainly not to the level that we think they could get done in the speech. So, when I see the Dow hitting 21,000 today, and it feels like just a while ago we had 20,000, so it's remarkable, we have to understand that this is not, as an investor, a rally I want to chase. I didn't listen to the speech last night and say, "Gosh, I have to go out and buy stocks." The stock market is already at a high, it's at new highs, and I would say there's so much enthusiasm for what Trump and the administration want to do, you have to realize that so little of that is going to get done. I think we heard so many great speeches from President Obama over the years, or even Bush before him, about these really impressive in the sky figures, numbers, projects, ideas. In reality, it's hard to get things done, and I think Trump is probably going to realize that, and at some point, the market might realize, investors might realize, all those promises, getting the corporate tax rate to 15%, getting $1 trillion in spending, we didn't get quite what we expected. Kretzmann: Yeah, in general, I think you want to be careful investing based on what a politician says or doesn't say. You want to take it with a grain of salt. Like Matt said, you don't really know what will actually get done and to what degree. But, when we're talking about tax reform, I think another thing in the back of investor's minds is repatriation, the ability for some of these global businesses like Apple or Priceline to have a tax holiday and bring the billions of dollars in cash they have overseas back to the U.S., where they can buy back stock, issue dividends, make acquisitions. I think that's another piece. I haven't had a chance to watch the speech yet, I was in D.C. watching the Warriors game. I'll have to catch up. Argersinger: Probably a better use of time. Kretzmann: Maybe. I was in D.C., I was close enough. But, along those lines, I think it's interesting that even with the market hitting new highs since the election, you have Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway really being net buyers of stocks to a pretty large degree. Warren Buffett, in an interview on CNBC on Monday, following his shareholder letter over the weekend, he mentioned that he had doubled Berkshire's holding in Apple in January, and that was as the market was hitting new highs. Now, Buffett and Berkshire own $18 billion plus of Apple, which has been a solid investment. I know we talked about this last week on Market Foolery, Berkshire and Buffett, we see them as value investors. So, I think it's interesting to see them finding what they see as good opportunities even as the market is hitting new highs. That's primarily been with Apple and airlines in the case of Berkshire, but I think that's something worth noting. Argersinger: Yeah, I thought it was a good point Buffett made, too. Becky Quick asked him what he thinks about the stock market and the valuation of the market, and he said he didn't really see a bubble in the market, because at all times you have to compare the valuation of the market to the level of interest rates. As we know, interest rates are still near historical lows. I would argue -- and this is just me putting my economist nerd hat on -- all the stuff that Trump talked about last night, if even half of that came to fruition, we're talking about a lot of increased investment spending and inflation, because of the nature of the velocity of money that we're talking about. Usually, in periods like that, we see rising interest rates. The Fed is probably going to raise rates this month. Again, I'm not trying to be the wet blanket here, but dial down the enthusiasm. Kretzmann: I agree with that. Here at the Fool, we focus on individual businesses. I think regardless of who's in power, you want to invest in businesses that you're comfortable owning for many years, regardless of which president or political party is in power. So, that tends to be the focus we take, looking at individual businesses. I think investors can still find opportunities even as the market is rising. But yeah, you want to take it with a grain of salt when politics enters the equation. Greer: And let's talk about two of those individual businesses, two retailers headed in very different directions, guys. Lowe's up big on Wednesday after the home improvement retailer reported better-than-expected earnings. Matt, Best Buy down on earnings. Argersinger: Yeah, it is the tale of two retailers. We talk about all the time, what kind of big box retailers, in this era of e-commerce, can thrive? And company like Lowe's and Home Depot, as well, the home improvement space of the market has been so impressive and held up so well. You just can't replicate that experience online. I know this for a fact because I spent a lot of time going to Home Depot and Lowe's going to do things. It makes sense. Lowe's quarterly sales were up 19%, very impressive. Comparable store sales up 5%. Contrast that with Best Buy. Revenue was down 1%, comparable store sales were down 7%, and they're guiding for comps to fall even faster in the current quarter, and that's because, again, a company like Best Buy, and with Target earlier this week, is very vulnerable to the convenience factor that customers are now placing on their time and money. And that's capital that's flowing to e-commerce, Amazon and elsewhere. Greer: I will say that the Best Buy in store experience, I think, has gotten a lot better. And I've been skeptical about Best Buy. But the problem is -- Kretzmann: Amazon's best showroom, right? Greer: That's right, that's the problem, it's Amazon. Matt and I were having this discussion this morning, about which retailers are truly Amazon-proof. I think we agree that Lowe's and Home Depot are probably Amazon-proof, right? Kretzmann: I would say so. If I had to pick one of the two, I would pick Home Depot. Since the Great Recession, when you look at metrics like profit margin, return on equity, inventory turnover, return on invested capital, Home Depot and Lowe's right before the recession and through the recession, they're about neck and neck with all those metrics. But over the past eight years or so, Home Depot has just far and away outperformed Lowe's in all those categories. The stocks really haven't performed all that differently. They have both been great performers. But I think just, long-term, given that Home Depot has generated those superior metrics, I would stick with them. But both of them have been really strong performers, as Matt mentioned.  Greer: Anyone else on your Amazon-proof list? Kretzmann: I think you have one that you would like to share. Greer: I do. We had a spirited debate, because I think Costco, for now, is Amazon-proof. I think you go to Costco for the treasure hunt, this idea that you're going to find something that you didn't expect to find, and also for the food. The food, I think, is incredibly underrated. If you want grilled salmon or to cook out or cook a steak, you go the day of. Now, Amazon, if they build these bricks and mortar grocery stores and that becomes more convenient, then maybe that's a game changer. But for now, I'm going to go with Costco, Lowe's, Home Depot. I think those three are Amazon-proof. Argersinger: The one thing I'll say about Costco, I know that they announced they were going to raise the membership fee, I would say that's a dangerous game to play. It's getting more dangerous. Greer: No. I would pay three times as much for my fee. In walnuts alone, I make up that membership fee and buy one bag of walnuts. Argersinger: I just think the value proposition of Amazon Prime, comparatively, is so much greater if you're a person who doesn't value the food element -- Greer: It's coffee and tea. They can co-exist. Argersinger: I just, as a person who hates to drive and park and shop anywhere, especially somewhere that's so crowded as Costco, to me, Amazon, my household, they're just winning, it's dominating. I don't think there's room for Costco, especially given a higher membership fee. Greer: I'm sorry, I'm hung up on the statement "as a person who hates to drive, park, and shop anywhere." Do you go out? You don't like going out? Argersinger: I do a lot of walking in my neighborhood. Greer: Maybe you are not the target market. Argersinger: Probably not. Greer: "As a guy who hates to leave his house," that's what I hear. OK. Argersinger: Speaking of not leaving your house. Greer: Yes, speaking of the company that might not be Amazon-proof, Etsy. If you don't know Etsy, it's a retailer of online crafts and all sorts of homemade good stuff, and other stuff that's not as good. Shares of Etsy -- down big on Wednesday after reporting a greater than expected loss. David, Etsy is adding users and growing revenue, but Wall Street doesn't really seem to be buying the story. Kretzmann: Yeah, I was actually surprised to see the market's reaction here. I think Etsy might actually be Amazon-proof. Amazon, eBay, and Alibaba have all tried to replicate what Etsy is doing, and none of them have really succeeded. At last count, Handmade by Amazon, which is something that Amazon launched about a year ago, had about 400,000 items listed on the platform. Etsy has over 40 million on its platform. So, Etsy far and away exceeds Amazon. Ebay shut down their thing, Alibaba shut down their efforts. So, Etsy, in this corner, active sellers grew 12%, active buyers up 19%, sales up 25%. The company is free cash flow positive. They are generating cash. They have $270 million in net cash. I think the issue here, they had some wonkiness with their guidance. They actually reiterated the upper end of their guidance for the next three years or so, through 2018. They're expecting revenue to grow at an annualized pace between 23% to 25% through 2018. But for 2017, they're only expecting sales to grow 20% to 22%. So, for whatever reason, management is being a little bit softer on guidance this year, and they're essentially implying that their growth will re-accelerate in 2018. I think that's probably making Wall Street a little bit nervous. But I do like the long-term story here. What Etsy is doing, with their base of sellers, they're targeting a group that none of these other retailers are doing a good job of targeting. The majority of sellers on Etsy's platform are women who work from home, and half of them don't sell anywhere else other than Etsy, and the ones who do sell somewhere else are usually just going to craft fairs. So, when you go to Etsy, you're not really going there for something that you would otherwise be able to find on Amazon or Ebay. So I think they are carving out a sustainable niche in e-commerce. But quarter to quarter numbers will be a little bit jittery here. Greer: I've had one Etsy experience, and it was incredibly positive. A few years ago, we went out to CES for Supernova, and a few weeks before we left, one of our copywriters said, "I need Motley Fool jester caps that have a Supernova starry theme." Where do you go for that? I go to Etsy, and sure enough, there's a woman who makes jester caps, and she did an amazing job and turned it around in a week. Kretzmann: That's awesome. Greer: Now, I'm not sure there's a business there.  Kretzmann: Well, maybe not jester caps specifically. The Fool can keep that seller in business. But I think that highlights the dominance, or the advantage for Etsy. You're going to Etsy for a personalizable, customizable thing. When you go to eBay or Amazon, you're usually going for the mass-produced stuff. That's their bread and butter. You have Amazon fulfillment centers, they're just trying to churn things out as inexpensively as they can. You go to Etsy for that handmade touch. So, I think that's where they are carving out that niche. That's why I think they're here to stay. And they are generating, like I said, positive cash flow, and they have a strong balance sheet. I like the vision for the company. They're also, in April, rolling out Etsy Studio, which is focused on the makers and a DIY do-it-yourself audience. So, you'll be able to go there, you have all the listings for yarn and thread and all this stuff to make crafts on your own. They'll also have tutorial videos and things like that. What Etsy is doing, Amazon and eBay and Alibaba, like I said, they have tried to replicate it but they haven't had a whole lot of success matching Etsy's success. Greer: So, when you say they're here to stay, do you think they're here to stay as a stand-alone company? Or, if I'm an investor in Etsy or considering Etsy, do I really have to hope that they're going to be acquired? Kretzmann: I mean, it's a small company, so theoretically, it could be an acquisition. There haven't really been a whole lot of buyout rumors that I have come across. But I own a small position in Etsy, and I would prefer -- it is a recommendation at Rule Breakers -- it'd stay independent, because I think they can succeed as an independent company over the next three to five years. We will have volatile quarter-to-quarter results, but I think as far as that e-commerce category grows, I see Etsy being the craft fair moving online. And that's something that none of the other behemoths in e-commerce have done a good job replicating. I hope Etsy stays independent, but they are small enough that one of these companies could snap them up without a whole lot of trouble. Greers: Guys, for our final story, let's talk television. On Tuesday, YouTube introduced YouTube TV. For $35 a month, you get around 40 streaming channels. That includes the major networks -- ESPN, Fox News, MSNBC. David, YouTube is also partnered with local TV stations, so you could get local sports and news. Now, what you do not get is CNN, HBO, AMC, A&E, Comedy Central. So, there are some channels missing there. A lot of competition in this space. I guess the phrase that pays is "skinny bundle". There are a lot of skinny bundles with Sling and the like. What do you make of YouTube? Kretzmann: I think the two advantages that YouTube has here, potentially, and they say that they are negotiating with other content partners, so hopefully they can get some of those other partners on board onto this package, but the two things that stick out to me that YouTube can do probably better than anyone else, especially with the current players, they're offering unlimited cloud-based DVR storage. Essentially, you'll be able to record up to nine months of content on YouTube. So, they're leveraging the dominant Google Cloud infrastructure in business that Alphabet has built up over the years. That's something you can't do with Sling TV. With Sling TV, you can only watch it live. You can't record something, you can't set up to record something ahead of time. You either watch it live or you miss it. I think that unlimited cloud-based DVR aspect, that's a really user-friendly aspect that tears into the traditional linear TV model. I think it makes the skinny bundle model, or that online streaming model, much more appealing and attractive for users. The other thing that sticks out to me that YouTube could probably do really well down the road is advertising. You could essentially, what Google could offer advertisers is say, "We know this individual, they search for these products, they have these search terms on Google, they have these viewing habits on YouTube." I think Google could arguably do a better job than anyone else of really personalizing and targeting individual ads to users. So, your live TV ads would be different from Matt's, so to speak. I don't know if that's necessarily the plan right now right off the bat, but I think down the road, that is something that could really play to YouTube's advantage. Argersinger: It's fascinating to watch the evolution of the TV digital streaming market, whatever you want to call it. But in a way, I almost feel like we're coming full circle. If you think about it, when I learned that YouTube was going to have ESPN, I thought, that's huge, that's very compelling. But then, I say, wait, I still want CNN, I like AMC, I still want HBO. So, I start to think to myself, wait, I'm probably going to need two or three skinny bundles. Plus HBO Now, plus Netflix. Then all of the sudden I'm paying over $100 a month anyway, and then it's like, why don't I just stick with my cable subscription? Greer: I need a keyboard to go with my iPad. Argersinger: It's interesting. I think, if you really ask a consumer what they want, they want the true à la carte service. Just give me the 15 channels I want plus HBO and plus Netflix. That's what I want. And I'll pay a fee for that. But the bundling continues, and that's something that cable companies have done successfully for decades now. So, it seems like we're coming full circle with the TV market. Greers: Guys, this really also seems like kind of a play for the future. Piper Jaffray had a recent report that said 26% of teens watch YouTube every day. As those teens get older, and as they make more and more purchasing decisions, maybe YouTube TV becomes their television. Argersinger: It's already a tremendous brand. If you think about, amazingly, if you think about the Mount Rushmore of online properties, YouTube is absolutely there right next to Google which acquired, brilliantly, YouTube some 10 years ago now. Amazing. Kretzmann: Yeah, and the Wall Street Journal just reported that the amount of content viewed on YouTube each day is now a billion hours a day. That's up 10 times since 2012. So, the level of engagement that is on YouTube already is staggering. I think this TV offering, I think this is one of the more attractive TV offerings, aside from those properties that aren't included in this initial bundle. But I think with that cloud storage, that makes it very appealing, especially to younger viewers who don't necessarily want to sit down and watch a live show from eight to nine at night. They want to watch it whenever they want. They don't want to watch commercials. So, with that cloud storage, you can watch it when you want, you can skip the commercials. From a user experience perspective, I just think that's far and away above live TV, whether it's through a traditional cable package or online streaming. People just want to watch things on their own terms. I think this skinny bundle offering with YouTube is moving closer to that direction. But like Matt said, it's still not true a la carte. I think, ideally, people would pay $5 for CNN, $10 for ESPN, they'd be able to just pick -- Argersinger: $20 for the NFL games that I want to watch this month. Kretzmann: Right. And potentially just paying for a game. Maybe I'm not an NFL fan, but I'll pay to watch the Superbowl, or something like that. I think it'll be interesting to see if we move in that direction. I think from a user experience perspective, that's probably what most people would like. But whether or not the cable companies let that happen, they'll certainly be resistant to moving in that direction. Greer: How about, best thing you have watched recently, as we close? Argersinger: Let's see ... I watched this show called Travelers on Netflix. I don't know if you've seen it, it's one of those Netflix original series. Really well done. It's a slow starter, as a lot of these series are. But by the fourth or fifth episode, I was addicted, and I think my wife and I binged in like three nights. It was good stuff. Kretzmann: I recently watched Sneaky Pete -- Greer: Solid. Kretzmann: -- which is one of the most recent Amazon Originals. Also, The People vs OJ Simpson, that was on Netflix, that was great. As someone who was born in 1992, I missed the OJ story, and now I get it, I get why people are obsessed with it. It's a great story. Argersinger: I can't believe that. Kretzmann: I'm catching up on my history. Argersinger: I watched the white Bronco live with my dad. Greer: Speaking of catching up, I watched Dumb and Dumber for the first time with my kids. Argersinger: For the first time? Wow. Greer: Yes, I have never seen it. Father of the year. My eleven year old loved it. As did my eight year old. Kretzmann: Quality entertainment. Greer: Yeah, it's high brow. On a slightly more serious note, there's a new HBO show called Crashing, which is really good. I'm two episodes in. The producer is Judd Apatow. It's very well done. Shout out to that. David, Matt, we'll end it there, thanks for joining me today. Kretzmann: Thanks, Mac! Argersinger: Thanks, Mac! Greer: As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

 There's already a rumor about the 2019 iPhones claiming they'll all have beautiful new screens Antonio Villas-Boas Mar. 6, 2017, 2:46 PM 16,992 facebook linkedin twitter email print If you've been keeping up with the rumors surrounding Apple's next iPhone, you'll know that Apple could be announcing three new iPhones this year. That could include the two S models of the iPhone 7, as well as a brand-new third option, which is said to be an "ultra-premium" and more expensive model with a fresh design and special features, one of which could be an OLED display. A concept of what Apple's "ultra-premium" iPhone would look like. YouTube/ConceptsiPhone The Japanese news site Nikkei recently claimed with confidence that Apple's third "ultra-premium" model would come with an OLED display. But when will those fancy new screens become the norm? The latest iPhone rumor suggests that all the iPhones that Apple will release in 2019 will have OLED displays, according to the Korean news site TheBell, citing sources in Apple's supply chain. A concept of the "ultra-premium" iPhone Apple would supposedly announce this year. YouTube/ConceptsiPhone iPhones with OLED screens are an exciting prospect. For one, OLED screens display richer colors, better contrast, and better brightness than LCD screens to make anything on the screen look very good. Secondly, OLED screens are also more power-efficient than their LCD counterparts, which could lead to better battery life. That's because OLED screens turn off parts of the screen that are displaying the color black, whereas LCD screens are always on, even when displaying black. The iPhone's LCD screen, left, shows an image of the color black with all the pixels turned on, which results in more of a gray color. Samsung's OLED display, right, is showing the same image, but its pixels are all turned off (save for the blue line to show that the phone is not in sleep mode). Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider The good news for iPhone fans is that they wouldn't have to shell out as much cash for an OLED iPhone in 2019. Meanwhile, Samsung and other Android smartphone fans have enjoyed some form of OLED displays for quite some time now. The first Galaxy S smartphone, for example, which was released in 2010, had a Super AMOLED display. Remember to refrain from taking these rumors as fact. Every detail about the upcoming iPhones is only a rumor so far. We'll know the details only when Apple announces its iPhone during its event in September — and as for the 2019 iPhone lineup, we're still two years away.

Submissions will be accepted from Monday, March 27 at 10am PDT until Sunday, April 2 at 5pm PDT. All applicants will be notified of their status by Friday, April 21, 2017. To be eligible to apply for a WWDC Scholarship, developers must be 13 years of age or older, registered for free with Apple as a developer or a member of a paid Apple Developer Program and enrolled part-time or full-time in a course of study, or be a member or alumni of a STEM organization. While eligibility has not changed from prior years, the application process has and now revolves around Swift Playgrounds, Apple’s iPad app aimed at teaching young developers and kids how to code. Applicants are required to upload a visually interactive scene in a Swift Playground that can be experienced within three minutes. “If you need inspiration, start with templates in Swift Playgrounds for a head start on more advanced creations. Get inventive and make them your own by adding graphics, audio, and more,” according to Apple. In addition to a Swift playground project, applicants must post a 500-word description about the features and technologies used in their project and write an essay on how they’ve considered sharing their “coding knowledge and enthusiasm for computer science with others.” Submissions must follow all requirements in the official WWDC Scholarship Terms. Applications will be judged on technical accomplishment, creativity of ideas and content of applicants’ written responses. WWDC 2017 is scheduled to kick off with a keynote on June 5. The five-day conference will be held at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, the site of the original WWDC and located just minutes from the new Apple Park headquarters in Cupertino, slated to open next month. The conference will focus on all platforms—macOS, tvOS, watchOS and iOS—and will be live-streamed through the Apple Developer website and on the WWDC app for iPhone, iPad and Apple TV.

Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell Almost since its inception, Apple has had a strong presence in education. In the 1980s, schools weaned kids on the Apple IIe, including mine. From the 1990s on, it became all about Macs. You've probably seen the infamous picture of a classroom at the University of Missouri's Columbia School of Journalism with all the kids sitting with their MacBooks open. But that is changing, with use of iPads and MacBooks in U.S. schools hitting a new low last year, according to market research company Futuresource Consulting. The firm sad that in 2016 the number of iOS and MacOS devices in American classrooms fell to third place behind both Google- and Windows-powered devices. Of the 12.6 million mobile devices shipped to primary and secondary schools in the U.S. in 2016, 58% were Chromebooks, up from 50% in 2015. Windows devices held steady at 22%, while iPads and Mac laptops fell from 25% in 2015 to just 19% last year. This is showing up in Apple's education revenue stream. According to IDC, Apple's share of the $7.35 billion in education spending in 2016 was $2.8 billion, down from $3.2 billion in 2015. Futuresource cited a strong combination of productivity tools via G-Suite, easy integration with third party platforms/tools, task management/distribution via Google Classroom and easy device management for the reasons Chromebooks are doing so well. The pricing also helped, with Chromebook prices reaching as low as $120 on certain projects. Despite its share remaining the same, Microsoft has made significant strides in the education market in recent months. This includes the launch of Microsoft Classroom, the cloud-based School Data Sync and a large number of integrations with popular third-party solutions. Microsoft also announced InTune for Education, a tool that effectively replicates the Google Management Console and allows IT admins to easily provision and set up large numbers of student devices remotely. On the hardware side, Microsoft recently announced partner devices that would be priced at $189 to target Chromebooks. "Microsoft has made huge strides in developing its education ecosystem offering in the past year, with major announcements on both the devices and platform side. To date however, these developments have not stopped Google's momentum within the U.S. K-12 market. Microsoft continues to face challenges to win back end-user mindshare," said Mike Fisher, associate director of education at Futuresource Consulting in a statement. Apple has not been sitting still. Last year it announced its Classroom app, Swift Playgrounds, and a number of other major education-focused feature updates in iOS 9.3, including the ability to share iPads. Futuresource predicts that 2-in-1 devices will be the next big trend in education, something Apple doesn't offer. Both Microsoft and Google and their respective OEM partners have announced a wide range of 2-in-1 products designed specifically for education and are expected to sell for under $300.

Although I’ve had it for less than a year, I’ll be swapping it for the second generation as soon as I’m able to order one.   This is one of the first Android Wear 2 watches and one of the first to use Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 2100 chipset.   Now, I still think this entire category needs to be rethought if it is ever to reach its true potential, but this second-generation Smartwatch from Huawei is a better watch than Apple has yet made, and it should lead the class when it comes to market in April.    What is a Watch? If I were to ask you back in 2000 or most anytime in the last century what a watch looked like, you’d point to something like a mechanical Rolex or Timex.  You’d likely argue that a watch is first and foremost a timepiece and designed with a circular case preferred by most buyers because it properly displays a fast to read analog watch face.  Yes, we’ve had digital watches, but the market has largely remained, particularly at the high end, one tied to the traditional look of a watch.  This is one of the areas where I think Apple screwed up because it created something closer to a wearable iPod, and it owned that brand, yet it named its product the Apple Watch, creating a discord because it doesn’t really look like a watch.  That doesn’t mean it isn’t useful, only that it just doesn’t fit our idea of what a watch should look like.   In addition, thanks largely to Apple’s iPhone, millennials had largely decided that a watch was redundant to their phones, so Apple’s product had to fight two waves: a bad name and a trend it largely created against the entire watch class.  The one counter trend was fitness bands, which mostly didn’t look like watches, led by Fitbit, that were more of an iPod-like product in that they did far fewer things but did them well.  That was one of the defining features of the iPod; it was very simple and easy to use.  With a lot of heavy lifting in terms of marketing dollars and the loyalist installed base on the planet, Apple does have strong market share with over 50 percent of the market, but with a tiny fraction of the sales volume of the iPhone it connects to, and that share is dropping thanks to the success of competing Android offerings.  Huawei Watch This starts out looking like a watch and it is more of a blend of watch functionality with a fitness band than a fully functional tablet-like platform.  The watch face actually looks like a watch in default mode and, depending on the face selected, shows other critical data like heartrate, steps, music being played, battery life remaining and date.   One thing I found annoying with the first generation of Android Wear was that social media alerts tended to obscure the face, detracting from the appearance of the product, and that has been addressed in this second generation.  Also addressed is the need to connect to a smartphone as this newer watch supports LTE connectivity and can make and receive calls as well as stream music without any secondary device nearby.  Image via Hauwei This is critical for both a watch and a fitness band because carrying a phone all the time, particularly while exercising, is annoying and sometimes even dangerous. But leaving the phone behind could mean the difference between life and death if you were injured or had a heart attack.  One other unique benefit of this product not yet shared with fitness bands or other watches is the ability to measure oxygen absorption; this could be critical for those trying to optimize their workout.  Finally, the watch has a ceramic bezel which should better protect the Gorilla Glass lens and resist scratching better than metal; this is important because we tend to hit stuff with our watches a bit.  Granted, this makes the Huawei Watch 2 bigger than an Apple Watch, but if you hold it up next to most of the current trend of high end watches like the Invicta watches I have, it is actually smaller and lighter.  It is likely too large for most women, but I don’t see a lot of women wearing the Apple Watch either.  For women I expect the new Fitbit Alta HR to be preferred, largely due to size and fashion options, over any current generation Smartwatch (it is due out at the end of this month).    Wrapping Up The Huawei Watch 2, shipping in April for a price expected to start around $350, is a better Smartwatch than the Apple Watch.  It looks more like a watch, it better embraces the fitness band level of functionality, and it isn’t tied to an iPhone. It not only works with Android phones, but is also able to work completely independently from any phone, a critical safety feature for many of us at risk (I’d like to see a single button call 911 feature).   But this is a very fluid market and there are an increasing number of vendors in the hunt.  I still wonder, though, if we shouldn’t step away from the watch metaphor altogether and instead create something that would do a better job of replacing the smartphone with something that is both wearable and less distracting than a smartphone currently is.  I expect we’ll eventually get there but, until then, the Huawei Watch 2 likely sets the bar for what a smartwatch should be.   Edited by Alicia Young Author Info Rob Enderle President and Principal Analyst, Enderle Group Click here to read full bio SHARE THIS ARTICLE Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Related Articles Meineke Goes IoT to Build Customer Loyalty, Data Value By: Doug Mohney    3/6/2017 Meineke's dive into connected cars and the Internet of Things was drowned out in the noise of bigger TVs, Alexa everywhere and the emergence of home r… Read More Why the Huawei Watch 2 is Better than the Apple Watch By: Rob Enderle    3/6/2017 The Huawei Watch 2, shipping in April for a price expected to start around $350, is a better Smartwatch than the Apple Watch.

Did you know these six things about the biggest wearables maker in the world? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Mar 6, 2017 at 1:10PM The meteoric rise and epic fall of fitness tracker maker Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) occurred in less than two years. Fitbit went public in June 2015 at $20 per share, surged to nearly $50 the following month, then plummeted to about $6 today. Investors might recall the bullet points in that story: demand initially surged as the public embraced fitness tracking devices and apps, but the market was quickly saturated with cheaper devices that crushed Fitbit's top and bottom line growth. However, investors might not know these six lesser-known facts about the company. Fitbit's Charge 2. Image source: Fitbit. 1. The founders were inspired by the Nintendo Wii Fitbit CEO James Park and CTO Eric Friedman co-founded Fitbit in 2007, after noticing how Nintendo's (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) Wii combined motion sensors with software to gamify personal fitness. Park, who felt out of shape at the time, wanted to create a fitness-tracking device priced between basic $25 pedometers and pricier sports watches. The idea initially secured $400,000 in funding from the founders' family and friends, and raised tens of millions more via official funding rounds, but the company almost failed seven times before it filed for an IPO in 2015. 2. Park and Friedman sold their previous start-up to CNET After dropping out of Harvard, Park worked at Morgan Stanley for a year. He subsequently co-founded software firm Epesi Technologies, where Friedman served as the founding engineer. Park and Friedman subsequently co-founded Windup Labs, a digital photo sharing service which they sold to CNET in 2005. 3. It recently stopped suing Jawbone Fitbit's first serious competitor emerged in 2011, when Jawbone launched its UP activity tracker. In 2015, Jawbone sued Fitbit for allegedly infringing its patents and stealing trade secrets by hiring its employees. The legal clashes resulted in several patents being invalidated, then revalidated, and Fitbit gradually gained the upper hand against Jawbone. But last December, Fitbit abruptly dropped a key ITC lawsuit against Jawbone, claiming that a victory would be worthless because Jawbone was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. 4. Why Apple really booted it from its stores As competition from Jawbone faded, a bigger threat emerged when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced the Apple Watch in late 2014. Shortly after the announcement, Apple stopped selling Fitbit devices at its brick-and-mortar and online stores. Image source: Apple. Many consumers probably think that Apple did that to reduce direct competition for the Apple Watch, but that was only partly true. The main reason was actually Fitbit's refusal to sync its devices to Apple's HealthKit platform, which pulls data from multiple devices and apps to a unified dashboard -- similar to Google Fit. Fitbit wanted to grow its own digital ecosystem without Apple pulling away its users, but the decision greatly reduced its exposure to Apple's customers. 5. Doctors have questioned the accuracy of its devices A major criticism which has plagued Fitbit since its earliest days is that it isn't a certified medical device. In late 2015, oncologist Dr. Andrew Trister, who works at Sage Bionetworks, noted that many patients brought Excel spreadsheets full of fitness tracker data, but that he and other doctors had "no idea" what to do with the information since they weren't collected from certified medical devices. In a Jan. 2016 article at iMedicalApps, Dr. Satish Misra -- a Cardiology Fellow at Johns Hopkins -- stated that he couldn't "help but wonder about risks when recommending specific, unvalidated devices" (like Fitbit trackers), and that it "would be prudent to stick to validated devices that at least have solid evidence behind them." These arguments cast serious doubts on the growth of Fitbit's corporate wellness programs, but Fitbit's recent partnership with medical device giant Medtronic to monitor diabetic patients could boost its credibility among medical professionals. 6. It will likely buy up more wearable tech As Fitbit runs out of room to grow, it's looking toward inorganic growth to boost its top line growth again. Over the past year, it acquired mobile payments company Coin, the assets of smartwatch maker Pebble, and high-end smartwatch maker Vector. Vector's Luna and Meridian smartwatches. Image source: Vector. These moves all indicate that Fitbit wants to diversify its portfolio and create more technically advanced smartwatches. However, doing so could send it on a collision course with Apple and Android Wear device makers in the high-end market -- which are all battling it out to dominate a relatively small niche market. It could also "diworsify" Fitbit's core business and cause its margins to contract -- which could be devastating to its long-term growth. Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

 In the eternal battle of Windows versus Mac, the tide is turning in Microsoft's favor Matt Weinberger Mar. 6, 2017, 2:04 PM 20,815 facebook linkedin twitter email print At his first Macworld keynote in 1997, Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced that he had accepted an investment from Microsoft to keep Apple afloat. Bill Gates appeared on a huge screen via satellite uplink. The audience booed.Jim Bourg/Reuters For decades, Microsoft Windows users were locked in a seemingly eternal debate with fans of Apple's Macs over who had the superior platform — a conflict spurred by the very public rivalry between Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. Around the mid-aughts, things settled into kind of a stable duopoly, as Apple found its niche as the maker of premium hardware for the culture-conscious, and Windows PCs earned a rep as the computer of the mainstream, especially for gamers and office workers. Apple opened the door for users to install Windows on Macs, and Microsoft made truckloads of cash selling Office and its associated services on iPhone and iPad. It was all quiet on the PC front as the battle moved to the smartphone. But now, after years of stability, change is on the horizon in the PC market. Former Apple lovers, including myself, are starting to reconsider Windows. And hardware like the Microsoft Surface Studio PC, Eve V laptop/tablet hybrid, and Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 are getting people excited about computers again. It's a huge renaissance for Windows, coming at a time when Apple fans feel like the company is treating the Mac like an afterthought. Don't just take my word for it: Over the weekend, my friend Owen Williams wrote a piece titled "Why I left Mac for Windows: Apple has given up," which really says it all. Microsoft Surface Studio.Microsoft And on Monday morning, The Verge's Dan Seifert published a story called "The desktop PC is finally cool," in light of the great strides that companies like Dell and HP have made in building interesting, extremely cool, nonportable PCs. Recently, Microsoft hinted that it's winning over high-end Apple customers, too. A window closes, a window opens The changing perception speaks to the great strides that Microsoft has made under CEO Satya Nadella. Windows 10 is considered one of Microsoft's best operating-system updates in years, with a strong focus on versatility and ease of use in both touch-screen and traditional PC modes. And Microsoft promises to keep updating Windows 10, constantly refining the operating system with cool new forthcoming features like the video-game-improving Game Mode. The OS was pretty good to start with, and it's just getting better. Apple, by contrast, has yet to ship a Mac with a full touch screen and is instead positioning the iPad Pro tablet as a laptop replacement (which is ironic, since the iPad Pro was clearly inspired by Microsoft's Surface Pro tablet). For Mac users who want a touch screen, Apple gave a consolation prize of sorts with the Touch Bar, a strip of controls above the new MacBook Pro's keyboard that has received mixed reviews. There's still no Mac with a touch screen, and only the newest MacBook Pro laptops with the Touch Bar feature.Hollis Johnson/Business Insider Some Apple fans are also getting annoyed because the new MacBooks are focused on slimness and battery life rather than the processing power or the device ports they need to get work done. Whether this change in focus will pay off for Apple is still up in the air, but it's definitely alienating die-hards. Apple is far from doomed, but there is a sense that the tide is turning: Macs are no longer the unimpeachable gold standard in computing. And Microsoft and its partners are exploiting that vulnerability to great effect.

Apple’s WWDC Scholarships program makes it possible for students and new developers to apply for a chance to attend the conference with most expenses covered. This year WWDC is moving from San Francisco to San Jose, and the WWDC Scholarships program has a new application process as well. Sony A6500 Apple detailed the new rules and this year’s deadlines on its developer website today. Submissions will run Monday, March 27 at 10 am PDT to Sunday, April 2 at 5 pm PDT. Winners will be notified on Friday, April 21 ahead of the conference kickoff on Monday, June 5. WWDC Scholarship eligibility is like previous years: 13 years of age or older; Registered for free with Apple as an Apple developer or a member of a paid Apple Developer Program; and Enrolled part-time or full-time in a course of study, or be a member or alumni of a STEM organization. What has changed this year is the application process which Apple details here. Apple has modified the application process over the years, but this year is very different with a focus on Swift Playgrounds. From steps 3 and 4 from the new process: Upload your Swift playground. Create a visually interactive scene in a Swift playground that can be experienced within three minutes. Be creative. You can use Swift Playgrounds on iPad or Xcode on macOS. If you need inspiration, start with templates in Swift Playgrounds for a head start on more advanced creations. Get inventive and make them your own by adding graphics, audio, and more. Describe your Swift playground. Tell us about the features and technologies that you used in your Swift playground, in 500 words or less. Apple also requires a 500 word or less essay that includes “how you’ve considered sharing your coding knowledge and enthusiasm for computer science with others.” Back in 2014 and 2015, Apple asked applicants to create iOS apps about themselves as part of the process. Last year Apple modified the process and allowed applicants to submit any App Store app they developed or were developing in addition to multiple essays. This year removes the app submission requirement which should encourage a wider group of applicants and instead focuses on Apple’s Swift Playgrounds app. Apple has similarly promoted Swift Playgrounds in Apple Stores during the recent Hour of Code event for students after introducing the iPad app at WWDC 2016. Full details including Swift Playground requirements can be found on Apple’s developer website.

For 2017, Apple will begin accepting scholarship submissions on March 27, as is outlined on an updated scholarship website Apple shared today. Submissions will be accepted from March 27 at 10:00 a.m. until April 2 at 5:00 p.m. Winning applicants will be notified of their status on Friday, April 21. Scholarships traditionally offer free tickets to WWDC, a huge benefit as a ticket is normally priced at $1,599. Flights and accommodations are not typically included, but starting this year, Apple is providing free lodging. WWDC scholarship applicants must be at least 13 years old, registered as an Apple developer, and enrolled in a part-time or full-time course of study. Members and alumni of a STEM organization are also eligible. Apple instructs prospective scholarship attendees to share a visually interactive scene created in Swift Playgrounds that can be experienced in three minutes. Swift Playgrounds for iPad or Xcode on macOS must be used, and Apple will judge applications on technical accomplishment, creativity of ideas, and the content of written responses. Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference will take place from June 5 to June 9 at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, California. It is the first WWDC that hasn't been held in San Francisco since 2003. While the conference is designed to allow developers to interact with Apple engineers and employees, Apple will hold a keynote event on June 5 to announce new software updates, including iOS 11 and macOS 10.13.

By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | March 6, 2017 -- 18:30 GMT (10:30 PST) | Topic: Amazon Amazon Echo Amazon has been quietly, and with very little fuss or fanfare, building an ecosystem right under Apple's nose, and now it could pose a real risk to one of its key devices. Must read: Learn to become a Google Chrome power user what's hot on zdnet Why Raspberry Pi is the future of computing devices Eight obstacles to overcome in your digital transformation journey Ford to trial Stratasys system to use 3D printing of one-piece auto parts IBM, Maersk aim to speed up shipping with blockchain technology Rumors are circulating that Amazon is working on Alexa-powered devices that support voice calls and intercom functionality. Evidence also emerged that Amazon is also working on an indoor video camera, which could be either for home security or video conferencing. Now, while new devices are interesting, they don't automatically give much cause for concern for the folks over at Apple HQ. After all, Amazon is not a new entry into the consumer electronics market (it all started with the Kindle e-reader back in 2007), and Amazon's not immune to failures (remember the Fire Phone that was released in July 2014 and discontinued a year later?). But what should worry Apple is where Amazon is likely to take this technology. Take the Amazon Fire range of tablets (tablets that saw a phenomenal 99.4 percent annual growth during 2016). It's always struck me that while the Fire tablets have a front-facing camera, Amazon's never really done anything with it. Given that Amazon has already retrofitted its Alexa voice assistant to work on the Fire tablets, it follows that if Amazon is working on some system to rival Apple's FaceTime offering, then pushing it to the millions of Fire Tablets out there makes a lot of sense. And why stop at Fire tablets? What about those millions of Echo, Echo Dot, and Echo Tap devices that Amazon has shipped? They don't have a camera, but they've all got a Wi-Fi connection and an excellent speaker and microphone setup, and they could all become "telephones" in whatever system Amazon is developing. And Amazon could easily expand this even further by developing an app for other platforms -- including iOS -- to support such a feature. OK, but how does any of this pose a risk to the iPad? Well, let's begin with the fact that the iPad is in big trouble, with sales in free fall. Apple CEO Tim Cook claims to be bullish about the future of the iPad, but the truth is he's hardly going to come out and say that it's a dying product, is he? If you've been watching the iPad's evolution as carefully as I have, you will have noticed how Apple has tried to reinvent it several times. It started out life as an iOS alternative to the wave of Android tablets hitting the market, and it was a pretty big hit. But as sales waned, Apple shifted focus and tried to market it to business users, and then with the iPad Pro and the Apple Pencil, it marketed the iPad as a tool for creative types. But beyond that initial big thrust of sales to consumers willing to take a gamble on the product, Apple has not succeeded in pulling the device out of its death spiral, even temporarily. And, worse still, the release of iOS 10, which made some 40 percent of all iPads in use obsolete, hasn't triggered a much-anticipated upgrade cycle. One of the factors working against the iPad is price. The cheapest iPad, currently the iPad mini 2, retails for $269, while a new 9.7-inch iPad Pro starts at a lofty $599, and a top-end 256GB 12.9-inch iPad Pro with cellular costs a staggering $1,129. Compare this to the Fire line. You can pick up a Fire tablet for $50, with the top-end 10.1-inch Fire HD 10 costing only $230 (and it features a microSD card slot that supports cards up to 200GB, so the 16GB of built-in storage isn't going to be a problem). Oh, and don't forget to throw into the equation the fact that Amazon's Alexa voice assistant is far superior to Apple's Siri. If Amazon can pull the Fire tablets and Echo devices together to create a communications platform along the lines of FaceTime or Skype, and continue to keep the pressure on Apple on both the price and Alexa features front, then this could very well be the end of the iPad. Before I go, let me anticipate a question I'm bound to get: "Won't the pro/creative/enterprise market be the thing that saves the iPad?" In a word, no. Well, these markets aren't saving the iPad now, are they? So, what's going to change? Apple keeps dabbling in these markets, but all signs point to Apple slowly retreating from the anything that isn't mass market and ultimately aimed at consumers. It keeps dumbing down its pro software (think Final Cut Pro). It is letting its high-end Mac Pro workstation wither and die from a lack of attention, and its forays into pro markets haven't really paid off with the iPad. Apple understands that anything outside of mainstream consumer electronics is a niche market, and for a company pulling in billions of dollars every quarter from a mainstream smartphone, these markets are nothing more than a distraction. The only thing that can save the iPad is people buying it, and that's not happening, and it doesn't seem that Apple is willing to do what is needed to reinvigorate sales (one of those things being slash prices).

AmazonBasics Nylon Braided Lightning Cable A highlight from the interview includes Johnson’s discussion on creating the famous Apple Store experience. Johnson was reached out to by Jobs to help start Apple stores in a time where Gateway was closing theirs. Jobs wanted to let Johnson design and develop Apple’s retail strategy. Johnson recounts the story as Jobs asking him, “Why don’t you write down what you would do? How would you approach retail?” Even though Jobs didn’t like the thesis very much, he invited Johnson back to talk. Regardless of his thoughts, Jobs hired him that day. Johnson believed that Apple’s central thesis for the stores should be bold and different, even matching well-known store sizes to help push that idea. By showcasing the product lines directly on the tables, Johnson wanted to have sections of what you could do with the Mac. “We had movie sections and music sections, and photography.” With the help of Jony Ive and even Steve Jobs, the team put together the table and glass stairway designs seen in so many stores today. The idea behind the Genius Bar came from the fact that Johnson wanted getting help to be a center stage experience for Apple customers. “Create a place that is really friendly…that they just dispense advice.” The first day he approached Jobs with the idea was met with strong criticism. Johnson recalls, “I remember the day I came in and told Steve about the Genius Bar idea and he says, ‘That’s so idiotic! It’ll never work!’” Jobs’ reply was,”I’ve never met someone who knows technology who knows how to connect with people. They’re all geeks! You can call it the Geek Bar.” A day later, Jobs was already working on getting the ‘Genius Bar’ trademark. Be sure to catch the whole interview here to learn how Johnson’s vision crafted the Apple experience we know today.

I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Apple is joining the likes of Netflix and Amazon and making its own TV shows for distribution on the Apple TV, and it is likely that you will be able to start streaming Apple's shows this spring, as long as you subscribe to Apple Music for £9.99 a month. Apple's head of internet software and services Eddy Cue unveiled two trailer for two shows at Recode's Code Media conference in February. You can watch these trailers below. The shows will be distributed via the £9.99 a month Apple Music subscription service. Apple Music head Jimmy Iovine confirmed that Apple has plans to offer original video content via its Apple Music service back in January 2017. Speaking at a Television Critics Association event, Irvine said that Apple is working towards creating "an entire cultural, pop cultural experience, and that happens to include audio and video," via the Apple Music service. Updated 6 March to include claims that Apple is meeting with execs from Sony and Paramount. What TV shows is Apple making? The Wall Street Journal reported in January that Apple has been talking to producers about creating premium programming and movies, but so far we know that the following programmes are being made for Apple's streaming service: Carpool Karaoke A popular spot on CBS's The Late Late Show and staring James Corden, 16 episodes of Carpool Karaoke will be available to stream via Apple Music. Apple head of internet software and services Eddy Cue unveiled a trailer for the show at Recode's Code Media conference in February. The show will start streaming in April. Planet of the Apps Hosted by Will.i.am this is a sort of Dragon's Den for App developers. It will feature celebrities including Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Alba mentoring app developers. App developers have the length of a escalator ride to pitch their apps. As yet a date hasn't been revealed but it is expected that the show may be made available in June coinciding with Apple's Worldwide Developers conference. Apple posted this trailer: Vital Signs Backed by Apple, Dr Dre's semi-autobiographical six-part series was rumoured to be in production in February 2016. However, little has been revealed about this show since those reports appeared regarding it. Podcast: Apple's TV plans The UK Tech Weekly Podcast team discuss Apple TV-streaming plans in episode 52, starting at 24 minutes. Will Apple's shows only be about music and apps? Apparently Apple doesn't intend to limit content. The programmes won't be limited to music or app themes, according to Apple Music head Jimmy Iovine. "If South Park walks into my office, I am not going to say you're not musicians, you know?" he said, as reported by the Hollywood Reporter. When will I be able to watch Apple's TV shows in the UK? We expect that the programmes will be available on Apple Music in the UK at the same time as they go live on Apple Music in the US, so expect to be able to watch Carpool Karaoke in April. How can I watch Apple's TV shows? The shows will be available for Apple Music subscribers for £9.99 a month. As of February 2017 there are 20 million paid subscribers to the service. Subscribers will be able to stream the shows on their Apple devices including the newest Apple TV model, the iPhone and iPad. Will Apple stream shows for free? It is thought that the shows will only be available to Apple Music subscribers, so it is unlikely that you will be able to watch the shows without paying for an Apple Music subscription. Apple is unlikely to offer an commercial based model in order to cut the cost to consumers, speaking at Recode in February, Apple's Eddy Cue said of such models: "I'm not saying we'll never do it.. I don't think it's the direction we should be going. I don't think that's what our customers are asking for." There is no indication that the shows will be made available to purchase separately on iTunes either. However if you don't yet have an Apple Music subscription you could take advantage of the three month free trial to watch the new shows when they come out. Is Apple trying to take on Netflix with an Apple Streaming service? There have been rumours for years that Apple planed to work with the networks to distribute content via its own streaming service. Back in 2015 Apple was said to be negotiating deals with networks. At the time, ESPN's boss John Skipper confirmed that he was working on a deal with Apple for its rumoured streaming service, but revealed that Apple was having more trouble convincing other networks to join in. However, it appears Apple hit a bit of a brick wall with the negotiations because by August 2015 talks with CBS, Fox, and NBC were said to have stalled. And then, in December 2015 it was claimed that Apple was putting its plans for the streaming service on hold because the cable companies and networks were proving too resistant to the idea. By February 2016 CBS CEO Les Moonves had confirmed that talks with Apple had stopped following months of conversations with content providers: "We had conversations awhile back, and we haven't had recent conversations with them," Moonves said.  Why did Apple fail to come to an agreement in these negotiations? One report claimed that Apple was looking to collect a 30% fee from all subscriptions and the network operators weren't happy about this. Having failed to negotiate content deals will Apple instead seek to acquire companies that have content available for distribution? There are claims that the company could buy Disney, for example, more on that below. For now the company seems to be distancing itself from the idea. Speaking at Recode, Apple's Eddy Cue said that Apple isn't "trying to buy a bunch of shows," indicating that Apple isn't planning to make any content acquisitions, and back in June 2016 Apple's Eddy Cue said that Apple wasn't interested in becoming a Netflix competitor. Is Apple going to launch a television? The short answer: no. Rumours that Apple would launch a TV were circulating for some time, spurred by the fact that Apple's co-founder Steve Jobs seemed to hint in his biography that he intended to reinvent television. This spurred a long running rumour that Apple would launch an actual television set. Jobs told his biographer Walter Isaacson: "I'd like to create an integrated television set that is completely easy to use… It will have the simplest use interface you could imagine. I finally cracked it." Apple CEO Tim Cook seemed to share Jobs' TV dreams. Over the years he has suggested both that the TV experience needed to be bought up to date, and that Apple might revolutionise television. He stated back in September 2014: "Think how much your life has changed, and all the things around you that have changed, and yet TV, when you go into the living room to watch TV or wherever it may be, it almost feels like you're rewinding the clock and you've entered a time capsule and you're going backwards. The interface is terrible, I mean it's awful. You watch things when they come on unless you remember to record them." Analyst Gene Munster was probably the most vocal in his predictions that Apple would launch an actual TV, he may even have been correct, as there were reports that Apple did have a team working on an actual TV, but it appears that the company eventually ditched the idea. Instead of launching an actual television, the company launched Apple's tvOS and the re-imagined Apple TV in 2016, both of which could be seen as the culmination of Steve Jobs vision for TV. However, those who were hoping for the reinvention of television, with a fancy TV set and a Netflix-style streaming service were disappointed. Read our review of the 2015 Apple TV here: Apple TV (fourth-gen, 2015) review. Will Apple buy Sony, Paramount... Apple CEO Tim Cook and senior vice president Eddy Cue have been talking with TV and film producers in Hollywood. The New York Post source told the paper that Apple "Is looking for a transformative acquisition and not just a deal to buy TV shows". The Apple execs have met with execs Paramount Pictures and with Sony TV and film. Could Apple buy Disney? Apple could probably buy a whole country if it wanted to, it has so much money in the bank. As to whether it might buy Disney, there are reasons to think that such a deal wouldn't be completely surprising: to do so would bring content, excellent co-branding potential, and a 30% share of Hulu. There is also the fact that Steve Jobs was Disney's biggest shareholder following his sale of Pixar to the company, and the fact that Disney CEO Bob Iger sits on Apple's board. With all that in mind, it's hardly surprising that the rumour has been circulating. However it would make Apple a conglomerate and we don't think that becoming such a diverse organisation would fit  with Apple's DNA. Could Apple buy Netflix? Another rumour doing the rounds is that Apple could buy Netflix. However, Apple's Eddy Cue has quashed that rumour by saying that Apple isn't looking to buy a content company: "We might be better buying somebody or doing that, but that's not what we're trying to do," Cue said at the Recode conference in February 2017. Could Apple buy HBO? Time Warner? There was a rumour that Apple was considering buying HBO, the home of Game of Thrones as part of an acquisition deal with Time Warner. Back in early 2016 a New York Post report even claimed that Apple might even buy Time Warner, Inc. That purchase would include HBO, CNN, HLN, TNT, TBS and the Cartoon Network. However, no such deal emerged. Tags: Apple , Rumour , Apple TV Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too.

Analyst estimates 715 million and counting By Rex Crum / March 6, 2017 at 9:40 AM So, just how many iPhones are being used around the world? It’s commonly accepted that the Apple iPhone is the most popular smartphone in history. Apple itself has said it has sold more than 1 billion iPhones since the device made its debut in 2007. And with Apple selling 78.3 million iPhones in its most recent business quarter, demand for the iPhone still looks strong, to say the least. In a research note he put out Sunday, BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long said that the installed base of iPhones — or, iPhones that are actually in use — reached 715 million in December 2016. Long said that figure rose by 20 percent from the numbers of iPhones in use in 2015, and he estimates the installed base will grow by 13 percent this year, and another 9 percent in 2018. Sure, there’s a discrepancy between the number of iPhones Apple says it has sold, and the number actually in use. But keep in mind, the first iPhone came out 10 years ago. The odds are pretty good that someone who bought one of those original iPhones has upgraded and bought one or two more over the past decade. Long estimates that of those people who have held on to their iPhones for, say two or more years, a big upgrade cycle could be in the works, and give a push to not just iPhone sales, but also sales of Apple’s growing services business. And with the next iPhone set to come out this fall — call it the iPhone 8, iPhone X, or iPhone (Insert Your Guess Here) — Apple is hoping that the 10th anniversary of the iPhone spurs a wave a new buying, and new customers in a few months.

But if it today's consumers won't bring it into their homes, tomorrow's might find it already there. By Ross Rubin | March 6, 2017 -- 17:46 GMT (09:46 PST) | Topic: Internet of Things Apple's Home app. (Image: Apple) Following mixed results in turning watches and TV into platforms, and statements from Tim Cook that the smartphone-sized opportunity of augmented reality is more of a core technology than a product, and rumors that its self-driving car efforts have been stalled, does Apple have a next killer product? And if there isn't one per se, does Apple have a strategy for the Internet of Things? Read this IoT security under scrutiny as Apple looks at smart home system Internet of Things security is under scrutiny as Apple moves to introduce its smart home system and Google works to expand its suite of web-enabled home devices. Read More It does not, at least in the vein of a communication platform from ambitious cross-industry bodies such as the Open Connectivity Forum, which hatched from two rival industry standards groups driven by chip giants Intel and Qualcomm, or an operating system such as Android Things, the latest IoT evolution from its main ecosystem competitor. But what Apple does have is HomeKit. It's here. It works. It's well thought-out. And as far as consumers go, it may be enough. The software developer kit, which lets developers of objects communicate with Apple products, received a consumer face with the launch of the Apple Home app. And Apple recently launched a new website to make it easier for consumers to learn more about it and navigate what can be a complex functionality. With its supported devices, HomeKit delivers just about everything a digitally controlled and communicating home might want -- from the basics of door locks and thermostats to blinds that react to motion sensors and other triggers. For example, one can have the lights come on and the temperature rise when the door lock is opened, and we can expect to see all kinds of standalone buttons and gesture detectors that plug into the technology. A recent addition is support for cameras such as those from D-Link. HomeKit has also woven other elements of its technology platform into the picture. Chief among these is Siri, which is vying with Amazon's Alexa to be the premiere voice interface for object control. Apple here is staying true to its reputation for detail and security. Siri will not ask you to blurt out a password to authenticate, and it's using radio-free, camera-based code scanning to avoid "man in the middle" attacks. The company also works closely with vendors of products such as the Philips Hue to best interpret a wide range of spoken options for its bulbs that can display millions of colors. Of course, the Home app on iOS brings the iPad and iPhone into the mix. And Apple TV can act as a scheduling agent when those devices aren't within range to turn products on and off. And really any product hosting Siri becomes a complement for CarPlay and Apple Watch, Siri's homes in the car and on the wrist. One recently opened Apple technology that isn't get playing into HomeKit is iMessage. It promises to be a key play for Apple should we begin having conversations with inanimate objects even if the bloom is starting to fade from the chatbot rose. However, much like extended Siri conversations, these would likely be limited to a follow-up question or two for clarification rather than having to feign empathy for your refrigerator emotionally blubbering out its latest bout with frost build-up. Another critical part of the Apple success formula that hasn't been fully leveraged for HomeKit is the Apple stores. Sure, they sell a number of HomeKit-compatible products, but it's difficult to demonstrate them live without, say, the lights in the store flashing on and off as they might under the fingers of a curious five year old The dream of home automation is an old one. Former PC Magazine editor and now Ziff Brothers investment analyst Mark Miller once told me that the first article he ever published was on home automation. That was in 1979. The upending of home automation from holistic security-derived systems to app-enabled smartphone accessories on open standards has surely allowed more people to experiment with elements of home control. This has encouraged traditional security vendors such as ADT and Vivint to begin supporting products like the Echo. But Apple may not even need to sell to customers directly. Much as it has worked with automakers to preinstall CarPlay support, it is now working with home builders to install a stub of HomeKit-enabled devices, say, a door lock, thermostat, and lights, into new homes so that future homeowners will find a series of companion products waiting for them to control when they are given the keys. Or, rather, the Wi-Fi passcode that will let them remotely control the door locks. HomeKit represents an Apple in transition. It is a company that is still focusing on its own products and their attendant operating systems to be sure. But it is also looking at opportunities to become a platform provider beyond its own app store. That may not make Apple an infrastructure company, but it continues to serve its customer and build loyalty while competitors are still at the starting gate.

However, a Korean supply-chain report claims that Apple will be moving its entire iPhone lineup to OLED displays in 2019. The report (via Patently Apple) says that Apple will rely on three Korean suppliers for flexible circuit boards for the iPhone 8, and that at least one of these have claimed the move to OLED. Apple is expected to adopt OLED for about 60 million units […] and double the adoption next year. It aims to use OLED for all its new iPhones by 2019. With Apple’s supply chain being so complex, it’s hard to believe that one supplier has the details on future product information, so please take this report with a grain of salt. However, it would make sense for Apple to move to an OLED display on all of its iPhone products if they’re truly launching an OLED iPhone this year.

Ease Of Use Mobile 0 0 0 March 5, 2017 Huawei P10 Plus Vs. iPhone 7 Plus Camera Shootout: Pro Controls Vs. Ease Of Use Simon Alvarez The Huawei P10 Plus is a flagship smartphone that is aimed at mobile photography. Boasting two Leica-branded lenses, the Chinese manufacturer’s latest halo device is designed to take the best photos possible with a smartphone. However, compared to the iPhone 7 Plus, which arguably is equipped with the best mobile sensors in the market today, how do the Huawei P10 Plus and its Leica-branded lenses stack up? In a lot of ways, it appears that Huawei was channeling Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus when it designed the Huawei P10 Plus. A Trusted Reviews report stated that from the side, the two devices look almost identical, down to the P10 Plus’s curved sides and antenna lines. Specs-wise, the P10 is no joke, boasting a 5.5-inch Quad-HD IPS display, 4GB of RAM (6GB in some regions), 64GB of storage (128GB in selected regions), and a pretty hefty 3,750 mAh battery. A powerful HiSilicon Kirin 960 processor rounds up the specs of the Chinese manufacturer’s latest flagship device. Compared to the iPhone 7 Plus’ 5.5-inch 1080p IPS display, 3GB of RAM, and 2,900 mAh battery, it appears that the Huawei P10 Plus completely outguns its Apple rival. However, inasmuch as the iPhone 7 Plus is a bit underwhelming when it comes to raw specs, its primary camera, comprised of two 12MP sensors, is the best in its class. Combined with iOS 10’s Portrait mode, the iPhone 7 Plus is capable of producing almost professional-grade photographs with the iconic “bokeh” effect, according to a Digital Photography Review report. #MWC2017 goers took one last chance to get hands-on with the award-winning #HuaweiP10 today. Next stop…  https://t.co/bl89FlrdoZ pic.twitter.com/YcPFabAh3w — Huawei Mobile (@HuaweiMobile) March 2, 2017 The Huawei P10 Plus’ cameras are equally formidable on their own, however. Partnering with Leica once more, the P10 Plus’ dual sensors are extremely high-quality. The device’s front camera alone, which features an 8MP selfie sensor with f/1.9 aperture, is capable of producing premium portrait shots with multiple effects. At the rear of the device, however, is where the magic of the P10 Plus really happens. The Huawei P10 Plus is equipped with two Leica-branded sensors, one 20MP monochrome camera, and another 12MP RGB sensor. The 10MP monochrome sensor is designed to give the P10 Plus’ photographs more detail and brightness, while the 12MP camera is designed to capture natural colors. Both lenses feature a f/1.8 aperture. Just like the front camera, the rear sensors are also equipped with a Portrait mode capable of producing shots with a bokeh effect, much like the photos produced by the iPhone 7 Plus. An Engadget report has taken the Huawei P10 Plus on a real-world test of the flagship device’s photographic capabilities. While the P10 Plus’ sensors were indeed exceptional, the report stated that the photographs produced by the smartphone were almost identical in quality to the ones that were taken by the Huawei P9, the P10 Plus’ predecessor. Apart from this, Engadget‘s real-world test of the P10 Plus also concluded that the device’s Auto mode is a bit moody, taking great shots at some points and taking substandard images in others. Night will see beautiful light in contrast and detail. #HuaweiP10 #HuaweiP10Plus #OO #MakeItPossible pic.twitter.com/sy86Si1JNh — Huawei Mobile MY (@HuaweiMobileMY) March 2, 2017 The Huawei P10 Plus’s dual sensors, however, are truly formidable when shifted to Pro mode. In this configuration, users of the device would be able to access and modify the dual cameras’ ISO, shutter speed, and other settings. This particular feature, notably, is not present in the iPhone 7 Plus, which relies more on the device’s own algorithms to determine which settings to utilize when taking pictures. Overall, the Huawei P10 Plus’ cameras are among the best sensors currently available in the market. Coupled with its Pro mode, the device’s Leica-branded lenses really do shine. However, the nature of the P10 Plus’ cameras requires its users to have some form of knowledge about basic photography. Thus, while exceptional in its own way, the P10’s dual-cameras are not for everyone. The iPhone 7 Plus, on the other hand, follows a far easier point-and-shoot system, and thus, it could be adequately manipulated by users with absolutely no knowledge about photography concepts. Overall, the Huawei P10 Plus’s cameras are best for those who love control with their photographs, while the iPhone 7 Plus remains the champion for everyday, casual mobile photography.

Mobile 1 0 0 March 5, 2017 iPhone’s Quiet Launch: Do You Know About the Cheaper Model Yet? Cecil Smith Since Steve Jobs’ first few years in the company, Apple has been known for its majestic and theatrical launches. That is why every year, the tech industry is on the lookout for its massive launches. However, this 2017, Apple did an unusual, quiet launch. According to BGR, it has been spotted that Taiwan Mobile, the only Apple retail platform for the new phone, has been pushing its marketing for the gold version of the 32GB iPhone 6. When the iPhone 6 launched, it was only introduced in 16/64/128GB versions. Then, they moved up the base storage for iPhones to 32GB. The other interesting concept of this quiet launch is the exclusivity to Taiwan Mobile. Though iPhone 6 and iPhone SE have both been launched in China, nationwide, the 32GB iPhone 6 is only available in Taiwan Mobile’s online platform. It is even being sold as the “cheapest iPhone ever.” “Adding a 32GB iPhone 6 option for the low-end is a confusing move for Apple. The iPhone SE is meant to fill the niche for a cheap(er) iPhone, and making the storage on the 6 bigger than the SE might cannibalize sales for Apple.” iPhone SE seemed to mimic the design style of older iPhones, but if they are going to follow the update cycle of the smartphones, the iPhone SE may get some spec bump in the next few months. iPhone Color Schemes [Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] The iPhone SE has already been a huge success, being the third-best-selling smartphone in the U.S. in September last year, according to 9to5Mac. That is why it is even more unusual for Apple to offer another cheaper version of the iPhone 6. However, it is possible that the Chinese or the Taiwanese market simply is more attracted to the measurement of the iPhone 6 and the 4.7 inch model of the iPhone SE is not enough. Why Is It On Sale? Is Apple Losing Money? The move for launching a cheaper version of the iPhone 6 is still unknown. Because of the downturn of the Samsung launch late last year, the iPhone 7 has been seen in a better light. Apple has been criticized of not innovating their products for the past years. Though the sales have been quite stale, the Apple company in the stock market is on the rise. iPhone SE Launch [Image by Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images] According to Yahoo, Apple is this year’s best-performing stock in the Dow. Apple shares have had a 52-week high and gained 2.3 percent to close the market last week. The stocks ended up at $139.78. There are already rumors for the iPhone 8, and this might be the cause of the spike in the market. The curved display and wireless charging capabilities have been the top highlight of the rumors. As mentioned above, Apple has been under scrutiny during the past years for their failure to innovate their products far enough. However, if Apple has already found a way to introduce their version of the curved smartphone, which has been pre-introduced by companies like Lenovo, they might have a fighting chance to survive. At the same time, there are rumors of the cheaper 9.7-inch iPad launch. Apple seems to be tapping on the mid-range market to expand their sales options. The cheaper iPad is set at $299. As Apple tries to compete with manufacturers who continue to introduce cheaper Android-based smartphones, they also try to struggle to stay on top. Even though they have a good performance during the start of the year, Apple has still failed to stay on top of Google and Microsoft. Both of these two other companies produce their own smartphones and this year will just be another battle of the fittest.

Technology 5 0 0 March 5, 2017 iMac 2017 Updates: AMD RYZEN 7 Chips To Beat Out Intel’s Kaby Lake Chips? Simon Alvarez There is probably no other product in Apple’s lineup that is in dire need of an update than the iMac. With marginal upgrades being rolled out for years, the time is high for the tech giant to focus its efforts on making its iconic all-in-one desktop computer competitive once more. Considering the rumors about the 2017 iMac, however, it appears that Apple might finally be putting some real effort on improving and updating its excellent, albeit neglected machine. Speculations are high that the iMac 2017 would feature Intel’s 7th-generation Kaby Lake processors, which would give Apple’s all-in-one enough horsepower to make it extremely competitive in the market. However, AMD’s recent launch of its top-tier RYZEN 7 chips might put a damper on Intel and Apple’s partnership, according to a report from Architosh. This is due to the AMD RYZEN 7 series’ formidable performance per watt, with the chipmaker’s RYZEN 7 1800X setting a new record in benchmark tests. What was particularly remarkable, however, was how powerful AMD’s chip was per watt, which means that the RYZEN 7 was not only a capable processor, it was highly efficient as well. This particular combination of power and efficiency, in turn, makes the RYZEN 7 chips perfect for Apple’s computers. https://t.co/ZMcF2n9ErK : #iMac2017 #Apple – iMac 2017 Definitely On Apple's Cards; Here's Why It Should Be Worth….. pic.twitter.com/BWySGScbKg — TREND GIZMO (@TrendGizmo) January 27, 2017 The RYZEN 7 1800X chip that AMD tested was compared to Intel’s top-tier Core i7 processor, which is a formidable chip in its own right. While Intel’s Core i7 chip featured a TDP (thermal design point) of 140W, AMD’s RYZEN 7 1800X consumed a measly 95W. Compared to Intel’s chip, AMD’s processor was more than 30 percent more power-efficient while delivering even slightly better performance. This is not all, however, as the AMD RYZEN 7 1800X processor that was tested was only being sold by the chipmaker for a very reasonable price of $499, far less than the $1,089 demanded by Intel’s Core i7 chip. With its lower price, better performance and far better power efficiency in mind, there is a pretty good chance that Apple would break away from tradition and partner up with AMD for the iMac 2017’s processors instead. After all, being an all-in-one desktop computer, the iMac 2017 would benefit from low power consumption. Of course, these are but speculations for now, especially since Apple is yet to announce which processor it would utilize in the iMac 2017. Thus, it is best to take these speculations with a grain of salt. For now, however, it appears than AMD’s RYZEN 7 series is the best bet for the Cupertino-based tech giant. https://t.co/iOu7lgdAXp : #iMac2017 #Apple – iMac 2017: Apple Hard At Work To Deliver Unparalleled Desktop With Performance; Q1 2017 … pic.twitter.com/EYpmP4w3yL — TREND GIZMO (@TrendGizmo) January 12, 2017 Overall, rumors about the iMac 2017 are abounding, with speculations stating that the upcoming all-in-one would feature powerful internals that could rival the best in the industry. A PC Advisor report even stated that a Best Buy leak from last year has teased the specs of the iMac 2017 through a mistaken listing. Though the information displayed by Best Buy might have just been an honest mistake from the retailer, there is a good chance that some of the information featured in the listing are accurate. The Best Buy iMac leak listed the next-generation device as a powerhouse machine with 32GB of RAM and a 2TB Fusion Drive. Coupled with a 27-inch 5K display, the iMac that was teased in the leak was pretty much a monster. The price of the device, listed at $3,199, also seemed to be in line with previous pricing conventions followed by the Cupertino-based tech giant. Official details about the iMac 2017 remain scarce, with Apple being highly secretive about the updated all-in-one’s progress. Nevertheless, expectations are high for the next iteration of the iconic machine. After all, with Apple seemingly preparing to retire its ubiquitous Mac Pro, there is a need for a powerful iMac 2017 to take its place. If rumors prove true about the upcoming all-in-one, the iMac 2017 might just be this year’s desktop computer to beat.

Today, with insane imaging capabilities being equipped in everyday devices such as smartphones, the world of mobile photography has become a lot bigger. This year is set to play host to a number of notable devices that would, at least according to rumors, play a significant role in pushing mobile photography forward. Here then, is a list of the top five smartphones for 2017 that photography aficionados should watch out for. Take note, however, that this list is arranged in no particular order. Apple iPhone 8 This is pretty much a no-brainer. After the dominating performance of the dual-sensors found in the iPhone 7 Plus, speculations are high that Apple’s 10th-anniversary handset, the iPhone 8, would feature even more powerful imaging capabilities. Rumors about the specs of the iPhone 8’s cameras are pretty scarce, though a MacRumors report stated that notable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is expecting a dual-camera system with OIS to be featured in the tech giant’s upcoming flagship device. While it remains to be seen if the iPhone 8 would be a powerful handset in terms of raw specs, its imaging capabilities would most likely be formidable. Samsung Galaxy S8: Full image leak shows new smartphone's 'infinity' screen – The Independent https://t.co/M3dSii1F8d #Samsung #GalaxyS8 pic.twitter.com/Vv0tX3WlqL — Samsung Galaxy S8 (@GalaxyS8News) March 1, 2017 Samsung Galaxy S8 The Galaxy S8 is Samsung’s first flagship device for 2017, and from what could be determined from rumors so far, the device would feature a set of revolutionary imaging sensors. A single-lens sensor is rumored for the device, with speculations stating that the Galaxy S8 would feature a premium 12MP rear camera with f/1.7 aperture and larger pixels, according to a TechRadar report. The Galaxy S series has always featured high-quality sensors, and though their megapixel counts are lower than most flagships, the quality of photos taken with devices such as the Galaxy S7 have been no less than stellar. This, of course, is expected to continue with the Galaxy S8. #Xperia XZ Premium has officially been crowned 'Best New Smartphone at MWC 2017' #SonyMWC https://t.co/e5aYEW7XCI pic.twitter.com/jj9kNuPFdP — Sony Xperia (@sonyxperia) March 2, 2017 Sony Xperia XZ Premium Sony smartphones have always boasted powerful cameras, and the Xperia XZ Premium is no exception. Together with the device’s stunning 5.5-inch 4K display, the smartphone’s 19-megapixel main sensor with 19 percent larger pixels is among the best in the market, enabling the device to capture excellent photographs even in low-light environments. Couple this with the Xperia XZ Premium’s capability to shoot slow-motion videos at an unprecedented 960fps, and Sony’s upcoming flagship gets even more attractive in the imaging department. LG V30 to Come with Snapdragon 835 and 6GB of RAM – Geeky Gadgets https://t.co/nNsyZ08eCd pic.twitter.com/XruHpehsON — StubMash (@StubMash) March 2, 2017 LG V30 LG’s previous flagship phablet, the V20, featured an impressive dual-camera system. For this year’s flagship, the upcoming LG V30, the South Korean tech giant is expected to step up its game with the device’s imaging capabilities. Far outgunning every smartphone on this list, the LG V30 is rumored to pack a never-before-seen four-camera system, enabling users to capture excellent selfies. Considering the raw power in the LG V30’s cameras, the upcoming phablet might very well be one of the best smartphones in the imaging category this year.

While the flagship devices did not employ fancy tricks such as a dual-camera system, the Pixel and the Pixel XL shone in the imaging department through the sheer quality of its sensors alone. With the Pixel 2, Google is expected to turn things up a notch, with rumors stating that the upcoming flagship would feature an even better sensor than its predecessor. Considering that the current Pixel is already the best in its class, the Pixel 2’s cameras would most likely be nothing short of a monster. The world of mobile photography is set to move forward this year, with the introduction of smartphones such as the iPhone 8 and the Galaxy S8. With contenders such as the Xperia XZ Premium, LG V30 and the Google Pixel 2 coming soon, however, the mobile market would most likely be saturated with a number of devices that might have what it takes to change the smartphone photography game forever.

Google Evan Selleck Contributing Editor | March 6, 2017 10 shares 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0               Apple took its time entering the smartphone market. They waited until they had a product that they believed would revolutionize the way people used their phones, and there isn't any denying that they accomplished that goal. Smartphones changed forever after the release of the iPhone. I think it's safe to say that we're all pretty happy with the results these days. I will admit that I'm looking forward to seeing some changes when it comes to the design of our daily drivers. Whether that's just a reduction of bezels, like Samsung is already promoting with its upcoming Galaxy S8, or maybe something even more eye-catching in the future. But, in the grand scheme of things, I'm happy with smartphones these days. They may not twist or look like communicators from popular science-fiction shows, but they offer so many other features that they've become indispensable for so many people all over the globe. And each year, we get something new. Something that's (hopefully) exciting all over again. Whether it's due to a hardware change, or because a company has shoved in a ton of new features in the software, there's typically something added to the mix from one year to the next. Companies like Apple, Samsung, HTC, and others would love if you invested a yearly purchase into their smartphone lineup. Apple wants you to buy a new iPhone every September. Samsung wants you to buy a new Galaxy S (or Galaxy Note for that matter) every year. HTC, LG, Motorola, and others all have the same goal. Recently it was reported that the Google Pixel will have a successor, and that it will be a "premium device." Neither one of these details are surprising. I think everyone expected Google to follow suit with its own gameplay from the Nexus days, and with every other major competitor out there. A new smartphone every year. And, as near as anyone can tell the Google Pixel and Pixel XL are success stories for Google. If nothing else, a great start to their new ambitious smartphone plans. So, yeah, it'll have a sequel. It has me wondering, though: Is a new smartphone such a foregone conclusion for as many consumers as it used to be? I know that if we look at Apple's sales, it would seem at least that demographic is certainly buying phones on the regular (with a sizable hiccup last year), but even then I know quite a few iPhone 6s owners out there right now, waiting to see what Apple launches later this year. Moreover, some analysts have speculated that quite a few owners of older model iPhones are also waiting to see if it's worth the upgrade this year. Apple has to convince those customers with aging devices to make the jump, while also putting enough "new stuff" in the upcoming flagship device to convince people who bought an iPhone 7 at the end of 2016 to fork over money again at the end of 2017. So, I'm curious to know if you buy a new smartphone every year. It doesn't necessarily have to be a flagship, high-end device, either. Do you refresh your daily driver on a yearly basis? Or do you hold off for a couple of years, or longer? If you own an older model iPhone right now, waiting to see what Apple announces in a few months, which model do you have, and how long have you had it? Let me know!

Sarah Tew/CNET Laptops by David Carnoy March 6, 2017 9:00 AM PST @DavidCarnoy Best Buy frequently offers discounts on Apple products, but its "Deal of the Day" for March 6 caught my attention because it's the first time I've seen the latest MacBook Pros on sale. The caveat here is that the $175 discount is for Apple's entry-level $1,500 13-inch MacBook Pro, which is missing the step-up models' Touch Bar. It also has a slower processor (2.0GHz dual-core Intel Core i5) and integrated Intel Graphics chip (Intel Iris Graphics 540). That $1,325 price tag is still pretty expensive -- Best Buy's open box deals are better -- but if you're in the market for a MacBook Pro, it's worth a look. The deal is for today only but I suspect we'll see this model on sale again in the coming months. It's also worth mentioning that Apple will price match up to 10 percent in its own stores, so you should be able to get that same notebook for $150 off in an Apple Store if you show the Apple sales people the Best Buy ad.

My answer is always ‘soon I hope’, and watchOS 4 seems like the next opportunity to introduce it. But there are already third-party apps that let you try it now. The problem for me is finding the right time to recharge my Apple Watch when I wear it overnight. Sony A6500 My normal Apple Watch routine usually consists of waking up between 5 and 7 am and putting it on immediately for all-day fitness tracking, at least a 30-minute workout at some point every day, and dropping it on the charger just before bed around 9 and 11 pm. Apple Watch Series 2 running the latest watchOS version usually gets me to around 50% battery life by the end of the day. Third-party apps including AutoSleep ($2.99) and Sleep++ (free) work best when you charge during the day and wear Apple Watch overnight. (You can use AutoSleep without Apple Watch, but then you’re not really sleep tracking with Apple Watch are you?) I usually hit my activity goals before 8 pm so charging Apple Watch after that time is usually possible without missing health and fitness data. I put this routine to the test last week and quickly discovered that charging any time other than overnight is still too disruptive for me. Changing around 9 pm with about 50% battery took until around 11 pm to reach 100%; sleep tracking for 6 hours only used about 3% battery Charging Apple Watch Series 2 from 50% to 100% takes about two hours so starting at 8 pm will end around 10 pm. That’s a bit longer than what I expected and I found myself needing to stay up a bit later than normal while I waited for charging to complete. On another night, I traveled out-of-town and skipped charging in the evening altogether. I still wore Apple Watch to bed for sleep tracking, but I needed to recharge around noon the next day which took over two hours since I was starting from much less than 50% battery. What I found for me is that sleep tracking with Apple Watch for now can actually disrupt my sleep schedule when the goal is really to find patterns and insights and hopefully improve it. The problem that I identify is lengthy charging times. I could use less battery during the day so topping off in the evening would take less time, but I don’t want to change how I use Apple Watch. One thing I discovered that is not a problem: wearing Apple Watch overnight only used about 3% battery. Ideally, I could routinely recharge while showering as I don’t typically wear Apple Watch in the shower. I’d need to go from whatever percent to 100% in about 30 minutes for this to work, however, and the numbers just aren’t there yet. Somehow extending battery life for future versions of Apple Watch as rumored could help. If I was topping off from 80% or 90% each time, charging time would be less of an issue. The other solution would be somehow managing faster charging methods. I’m not sure which is easier, but I imagine the former is more likely. I do think Apple must be working on this problem. Sleep is prominently featured as one of four main categories in Apple’s Health app (alongside Activity, Nutrition, and Mindfulness), but the iPhone Clock app’s Bedtime feature only tracks in-bed time and not asleep time; dedicated sleep trackers can do both. For now, hardware-based sleep monitors are probably ideal for most people. Apple recommends the Beddit 3 Sleep Tracker ($149.95) and you can find the previous version for much cheaper on Amazon. Withings Aura is another hardware option (I think Apple used to sell these until a certain lawsuit). S+ By ResMed ($50) is another choice I’ve seen but haven’t personally tested yet. I’ve also thought about repurposing my old Jawbone Up24 fitness tracker as a dedicated sleep tracker, but it’s one more thing to charge and remember to use so I haven’t made it routine. For now I’m probably sticking with the Bedtime mode feature in Apple’s Clock app on iOS 10. I like seeing how many hours of sleep are projected based on adjusting bedtime and wake time, but I’m not sure there are any perfect solutions yet. Based on my own feelings and what I often hear from family and readers, people do want to do automatic sleep tracking from Apple Watch. Theater Mode coming in watchOS 3.2 certainly helps with easily preventing the display from lighting up at night. Hopefully we see something in watchOS 4 at WWDC in June (or with new hardware possibly later in the year).

We round up rumours of a new 12-inch MacBook for 2017, and cover its likely design, tech specs, new features and UK pricing by Lewis Painter | 06 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments When will the new 12-inch MacBook for 2017 be released? What can I expect from the next 12-inch MacBook in terms of tech specs? How much will the 2017 12-inch MacBook cost? Will the 12-inch MacBook replace the MacBook Air range? Apple released the 2016 variant of the 12in MacBook back in April 2016, and almost a year on, we're looking to the future and what we could expect from this year's model, the 2017 12in MacBook. Here, we sift through the latest rumours surrounding the 2017 MacBook and also our personal predictions. Those of you that want to find out more about the current 12in MacBook released in April 2016 can take a look at our 12in MacBook review, which covers everything from pricing to performance and design, sprinkled with our personal opinions of Apple's latest MacBook. Apple didn't update the MacBook or MacBook Air line during its October 2016 event, which saw the launch of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. Following that event Apple discontinued the 11in MacBook Air, a move that suggests that the 12-inch MacBook may soon replace the Air line-up as Apple's consumer-oriented Mac laptops, although the models are likely to see a price cut before that would happen.

When will Apple release the next-generation 12in MacBook for 2017? Will it launch at a spring Apple event? Apple launched the 2015 version of the 12in MacBook at a spring event that year, but that is no indication that Apple will do the same in 2017. The 2016 MacBook wasn't unveiled at Apple's 2016 spring event (which saw Apple reveal the iPhone SE, a 9.7in iPad Pro and new Apple Watch straps). Instead, Apple quietly introduced the new MacBook a few weeks later in April 2016. We anticipate that the 2017 MacBook will see a similarly quiet launch. Nor do we expect to see a refreshed range in April to mark the current model's one year anniversary. We don't expect to see a 12-inch MacBook until the summer (June, or maybe July to coincide with WWDC). If Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is correct (as reported by MacRumors in January 2017) in his prediction that a new 12in MacBook is set to go into production in early Q2 2017 - April or thereabouts, a June or July launch could be feasible.  New MacBook 2017 release date UK: Will the 12in MacBook replace the MacBook Air? It certainly looks like the MacBook Air's days are numbered. After its October 2016 event Apple removed the 11in MacBook Air from sale along with the legacy MacBook Pro with SuperDrive, which had been lurking in the Apple Store for some years. While the 13in MacBook Air remains, it hasn't been significantly updated since March 2015, apart from Apple's decision to offer as standard, 8GB RAM for all MacBook Air models (given that the range was so hampered by its 4GB RAM that we recommended anyone purchasing the computer to upgrade the RAM at point of purchase, this update was rightfully celebrated and long overdue). Another reason we may soon see the demise of the MacBook Air is that Apple's MacBook Air design is not as groundbreaking now as it was eight years ago when it launched. When the MacBook Air first arrived, its biggest selling point was its thin and light design, hence the name, but the MacBook and MacBook Pro now outshine it in those areas. Plus, for those looking for ultimate portability there's the new iPad Pro with a 12.9in screen. In terms of weight the MacBook Air weighs 1.35kg while the MacBook Pro now weighs only a fraction more at 1.37kg and the MacBook weighs just 0.92kg. If Apple continues to sell the MacBook Air maybe it should drop Air from it's name. It's not all bad though. The MacBook Air is both more powerful and £300 cheaper than the MacBook. It is the only Mac laptop that is available for less than £1000. For that reason we do still recommend it, although you might do better buying a refurbished MacBook Pro if you need a Mac that costs less than £1000. Given that the MacBook Air is Apple's lowest cost Mac laptop you'd think it would be its most popular model, and yet, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (back in 2015), the 12in MacBook is Apple's best-selling computer, closely followed by the 13in MacBook Pro. See more MacBook Air rumours here. So we think that the 13in MacBook Air will be replaced, but we don't think that will happen before the price of the MacBook and potentially the entry-level MacBook Pro, is reduced. History indicates that this will be the case: the last time there was a Mac laptop that had more advanced specs than a more expensive model was when the MacBook Air launched alongside the old white and black MacBooks. Those models were eventually discontinued and the price of the MacBook Air reduced. We hope that the same will happen, with new 12in MacBook models being priced lower than they are currently and replacing the 13in MacBook Air as the entry level MacBook, while the more advanced specs will be provided by the 13in MacBook Pro. Here's why it doesn't matter that the MacBook is expensive and underpowered. New MacBook 2017 release date UK: Price While we're still some way ahead of the official announcement of the 2017 MacBook, we can already speculate about the pricing as Apple rarely changes the price of its range from generation to generation, unless it's a fairly hefty upgrade. Currently the base MacBook sells for £1,249. However, there is a possibility that Apple will reduce the price of the MacBook in 2017, especially if it discontinues the MacBook Air. With the demise of the 11in MacBook Air came a hike to the point of entry for consumers wishing to buy a Mac laptop. The entry price of Apple's MacBook Air laptop is now £949 (thanks in part to Apple's post-Brexit £100 increase, the model had previously cost £849). Before Apple discontinued it, an 11in MacBook Air had been priced at £749. In comparison, the entry-level MacBook Pro, with 2.0GHz dual-core processor and 256GB SSD costs £1,449, while the entry-level 12in MacBook with 1.1GHz m3 chip is £1,249. There is certainly a place for a lower cost Mac laptop and it would seem that for now the MacBook Air will fulfil that role. However, a reduction in price for the MacBook is possible, bringing it into line with the price of the MacBook Air currently. It's interesting to note here that the US prices, less influenced by currency fluctuations, are as follows:  12in MacBook - from $1,299 (£1,249) 13in MacBook Air - from $999 (£949) 13in MacBook Pro - from $1,499  (£1,449) If you ignore the somewhat confusing currently translations (it's not entirely fair to convert dollars to pounds as there is also VAT to add to the US prices, and there are other 'costs of doing business' to take account of - at least that's Apple's excuse) the price differences are roughly the same, with the MacBook being £300/$300 more than the Air, and the Pro being £200/$200 more than the MacBook. Reduce the MacBook price by £300/$300 and you have a new entry-level price that's below the magic £1000/$1000 mark. We don't expect Apple to drop the MacBook Air from the line up until it is willing to shave this much off the price of the MacBook. If it was to do so expect the entry-level MacBook to offer much slower processors and probably less storage than it does currently. New MacBook 2017 release date UK: Processors The new MacBooks are likely to have Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors. Kaby Lake is the generation of chips after Skylake, and it offers support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. There is another interesting possibility with regards to processors. Back in September 2016 Dutch-language site Techtastic spotted a reference in the kernel of macOS Sierra to "ARM HURRICANE" being supported. The discovery was thought to indicate that Apple might be about to put ARM chips in its MacBooks. As it happens that's exactly what it did a month later with the launch of the MacBook Pro. In that case the chip powers the Touch Bar, but future ARM chips are being developed to look after other functions. The rumours continue: a Bloomberg report from February 2017 claims that Apple is working on a chip, codenamed T310, that will handle the "Power Nap"  functionality and improve the battery life of MacBooks. Whether this chip will end up in the MacBook remains to be seen. We think it's unlikely to make its debut on the next model as Apple is likely to save it for the next model of MacBook Pro. Image courtesy of Techtastic New MacBook 2017 release date UK: RAM Currently the MacBook ships with 8GB RAM as standard. There is no option to increase RAM at point of sale, and the Mac is not user upgradable. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts that the new MacBooks will offer a 16GB of RAM option, up from 8GB of RAM in the 2016 models. Apple could upgrade the two current models to 16GB RAM and keep a 8GB option as a lower-priced model. New MacBook 2017 release date UK: Design Looking at the change in design from the 2015 MacBook to the 2016 MacBook, it suggests that we won't be seeing huge physical changes in 2017. In fact, the only change in design from the original MacBook and the 2016 MacBook was the addition of a new colour option, Rose Gold, to sit alongside the Gold, Silver and Space Grey options. Apple seems intent on marketing the MacBook alongside the iPhone and iPad, given the matching colour choices. Aside from that, the design hasn't changed for the MacBook. It's incredibly thin at 13.1mm, and it weighs just 0.9kg, making it 24 percent thinner than the MacBook Air, and we don't expect that to change dramatically in future. New MacBook 2017 release date UK: Bigger Screen One possible change that we might see concerns the screen size. At present the MacBook is available in one size: 12 inches, but analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has suggested that a 15-inch model will be unveiled later this year. In a research note Kuo mentions a 15in MacBook that he believes will go into production in quarter four of 2017. However, this model is likely to be a MacBook Pro as it is said to feature 32GB RAM, so is definitely not the MacBook. Nevertheless, adding a bigger model to the range would make sense if Apple is planning to phase out the MacBook Air. Then Apple would offer 13in and 15in MacBook Pro models as well as 12in and 15in MacBook models (or perhaps 12in and 14in MacBook models as it used to do). New MacBook 2017 release date UK: Ports Will the new MacBook support Thunderbolt? When the MacBook launched in 2015 it featured USB Type-C and little else. While USB Type-C now supports Thunderbolt type 3 (which as exactly the same port), this early port didn't. Described by many as the one port to rule them all, the USB Type-C port and the Thunderbolt 3 port is identical, so any device using either standard can be plugged into it. Rather than suggesting that USB-C means death to Thunderbolt, it rather suggests that the standard has been given new life, indeed, now in addition to the MacBook Pro, many PCs support Thunderbolt too. There's good reason to support Thunderbolt 3. The standard allows for connection speeds up to 40Gbps, double the speed of Thunderbolt 2 (and it's backwards compatible with Thunderbolt 2). Whether a MacBook user really needs Thunderbolt is another question though, with it being a standard utilised in video production and other high power applications.  Nevertheless, we expect that the new MacBook will feature the new USB Type-C port and therefore it will support Thunderbolt 3. Given Apple's efforts to convince the industry to adopt it since Thunderbolt's introduction in 2011 it is unlikely to fall out of favour with the company. However, Apple also promoted FireWire to the industry and eventually removed that from its Macs. Another reason Apple could turn it's back on Thunderbolt is if it stopped using Intel processors in its Macs. Intel is the company behind Thunderbolt and it requires an Intel processor to work... It's not a completely crazy idea, there have been rumours that Apple could ditch Intel in favour of its own chip production. Indeed, the company is already said to be working on its own chips with ARM, these chips would take care of certain functions, just like the Apple T1 chip in the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar does. New MacBook 2017 release date UK: LTE Will the 2017 MacBook have LTE connectivity? It seems that sharing your iPhone's cellular connection with your MacBook wasn't enough for Apple, if this patent approval is anything to go by. The patent, as described by the US Patent and Trademark Office, will allow the company to embed LTE hardware in the 2017 MacBook, making it the first cellular-enabled Mac in Apple's range, past or present.  As well as LTE connectivity, the patent describes the use of Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth and satellite connectivity, and mentions ways to boost the signal without interference from the metal body of the MacBook. It's worth mentioning that this idea isn't new, though - it was originally filed on June 8 2015, and there was also talk of a 3G-enabled MacBook Pro back in 2008, but the idea was eventually rejected by Steve Jobs as he felt it would tie the user down to a particular carrier.  New MacBook 2017 release date UK: Keyboard Will the 2017 MacBook have a Force Touch keyboard? According to a 9to5Mac report in October 2016, Apple has been in talks with the Foxconn startup, Sonder - a company that uses E Ink technology to display its keys (see a video here). This allows a way of customising keys and even adding symbols which would not be possible on a regular keyboard. It's rumoured that Apple will use this technology in their next MacBook. Back in autumn 2015, it emerged that Apple had filed a patent that appeared to show its design for a Force Touch capable keyboard. Along with the 2015 MacBook Pro, the 2015 MacBook has a Force Touch trackpad, which gave electric pulses that feel like clicks, but is a glass plate that doesn't actually move. Like on the iPhone 6s, you can press harder for a deeper click to access menus and options within certain apps. The new MacBook also has keys unlike any other Mac, which have very little travel in order to make the chassis ultra-thin. The newly discovered patent shows what seems to be a whole keyboard and trackpad area fit to house this technology. As this shows, the whole keyboard and trackpad, plus areas to the left and right of the pad, could theoretically be customised to the user's tastes and, for the first time, not have a physical keyboard. However, we have seen Apple file patents in the past that are to bookmark ideas for the future. It'd be amazing if this technology were included in the new MacBook, but we feel this is one for the coming years. It would potentially allow you to have several language keyboards saved and switch between them on the adaptable display. Imagine typing on a surface that felt like a keyboard, but was actually electric feedback telling your brain you're pressing keys? If this is Force Touch's future, we are excited. New MacBook 2017 release date UK: Trackpad Will the 2017 MacBook feature an Apple Pencil-compatible trackpad? It's not the only new addition to the MacBook either, if another patent approval is anything to go by. According to a patent filed by Apple which was approved in May 2016, an upcoming Mac could boast compatibility with the Apple Pencil - although the Apple Pencil depicted in the patent is far more advanced than the one on sale at the moment. The Pencil in question features a number of sensors that could detect movement, orientation and depth and, according to the patent, could be used with a Mac as an 'air mouse' or possibly even a joystick for gaming. The patent reads: "Inertial sensor input may be gathered when operating the stylus in one or more inertial sensor input modes such as an air mouse mode, a rotational controller mode, a joystick mode, and/or other inertial sensor input modes." It doesn't end there, either - apparently an upcoming Mac trackpad will feature Apple Pencil support, allowing users to use and draw directly onto the trackpad with the precision of the iPad Pro. While the patent doesn't mention whether the trackpad will be built into a MacBook or offered as a standalone Mac trackpad. Thinking of buying a Mac? Read our Which Mac? Best Mac buyers guide.

Ending a months-long legal battle, a tax tribunal in London has ruled that the straps are "pieces of plastic" and an "accessory", not part of the technology.   For years Apple has insisted the plastic straps, sold with its smartwatch but imported separately, are an integral part of the electronic product. Products imported into the UK are subject to import duties between 0pc and 17pc, with electronics generally being duty free. Apple doesn't currently pay import taxes on its smartwatches and smartphones. The decision, which ratifies HM Revenue and Customs' classification of the strap as an "other plastic", means Apple could lose its import tax exemption, with HM Revenue and Customs being able to levy duties of 6.5pc on the £49 sport wristband.   At a glance | Apple Watch Series 2 "It seems to us that the essential characteristic of the band was that it was a piece of plastic," said Judge Guy Brannon, who viewed the case in the First-tier tax tribunal. "The band is not essential to the electrical and mechanical operation of the Apple watch.  Judge Brannon added that the watch is a "self-contained, fully functional electrical machine" and that it could be used without the strap, "however unsatisfactory that may be".  Apple denied this, claiming that the watch's sensors, including the heart rate monitor and accelerometer, wouldn't work without the strap.  "The Apple Watch falls into an ever-increasing range of products that fall into the category of wearable technology," said Stephen Cock, Apple's barrister. "Such products are specifically designed to be worn by the user in order to provide for a variety of roles.  "Without the band the Apple watch cannot be worn and so it cannot fulfill its designed role."  The ruling only applies to the plastic sports watch straps, and doesn't affect patented bands.

It is believed that the iPhone 8 will boast a massive 5.8-inch OLED display, but with smaller top and bottom bezels in order to shrink the size of the device. Although the smartphone will have the largest display of any iPhone, rumors have suggested that it will also be the most expensive. Scroll down for video  It is believed that the iPhone 8 (artists impression) will boast a 5.8in OLED display, but with smaller top and bottom bezels to shrink the size of the device. Although it will have the largest display of any iPhone, rumors have suggested that it will also be the most expensive LATEST RUMORS   The latest rumors were revealed by  Nikkei Asian Review. Revealed Apple is set to launch three iPhone handsets this year. Two of which are upgrades to the iPhone 7 family - iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. These will have 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays. The third handset will be Apple's 10th-anniversary model, which will boast a 5.8-inch OLED display. It will also have smaller top and bottom bezels in order to shrink the size of the phone - it will be smaller than the iPhone 7 Plus. However, the large screen will come with a hefty price tag.  The new report comes from Nikkei Asian Review, which has revealed the upcoming iPhone will launch in three variants. Two are set to have liquid crystal displays and the other will be designed with a 5.8-inch organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen. Earlier reports have suggested that the two other smartphones, known as the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will be designed with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays. ‘By adding more large-screen options to the lineup to meet grousing demand for BIG, Apple intends to raise the average iPhone price, which has already gone up by about 10% in the past three years to nearly $700,’ Nikkei reported. Previous rumors have already identified an increase in price. Earlier this month it was revealed by Fast Company that the so-called iPhone 8 will costs more than $1,000 (£800) – making it the most expensive handset the firm has ever produced. However, it is said that users will receive more cutting-edge technology and a sleeker design – a handset that is sure to impress.

Share this article Share 1.2k shares In addition to costing users more, it is believed that Apple may not release the iPhone 8 until October. It is believed that the iPhone will not go into mass production until September, which has suggested that iOS users will not get their hands on one until October. Previous rumors have already identified an increase in price. Earlier this month it was revealed that the so-called iPhone 8 (artist impression) will costs more than $1,000 (£800) – making it the most expensive handset the firm has ever produced The latest rumor regarding Apple’s flagship smartphone may send some fans into an uproar. It is believed that the iPhone will not go into mass production until September, which has suggested that iOS users will not get their hands on one until October (artist impressions) The delay is a result of Apple’s custom fingerprint sensor that is set to replace the TouchID – the firm is building its own system and needs more time for manufacturing, reported DigitTimes. It is suggested that Apple has passed over both the Synaptic’s Natural ID touch fingerprint sensor and Qualcomm’s Sense ID for the iPhone. The firm is, however, going with its own technology for a fingerprint recognition solution – Authentec algorithm combined with Privaris glass identification technology. ‘Apple's in-house developed fingerprint ID solution will be fabricated at TSMC's 12-inch line using 65nm process technology, sources told DigitTimes. The firm is going with its own technology for a fingerprint recognition solution – Authentec algorithm combined with Privaris glass identification technology. It is speculated that this component will use biometric technologies The sources also said this move will push production for the OLED iPhone back until September, which means the handset will not go on sale until October. However, it may be worth the wait, as this technology will allow for a bezel-less design because the component will be a ‘built-in’ sensor integrated into the display, reports 9to5Mac.  IPHONE 8 RUMORS   Several rumors have been circulating about the iPhone 8, and suggest the next device may have:  - Dual-lens 3D camera - Augmented reality to generate real-time views of surroundings  - Curved glass casing - Plastic OLED screen - Wireless charging - A folding element  - New 5 inch (12.7 centimeter) and 5.8 inch (14.7 centimeter) model, which will have a wraparound OLED screen  - 5.8 inch will be designed with the Touch ID finger print sensor 'under the glass and in the active display area' - A new 'pure white' model - Aluminum back will be replaced with two reinforced glass panes and a metal frame in the middle  - Facial recognition It is speculated that this component will use biometric technologies, instead of the traditional capacitive sensors found in Touch ID. And these rumors stated that the technology will be positioned in the ‘function area’ region of the display. Although the delay could be a disappointment, Apple is one to stick close to a timeline when it comes to launching its devices, which is usually in September. And the last time the firm released a handset in October was the iPhone 4s.   Read more: Here's Why Apple's 10th Anniversary iPhone Will Likely Cost More Than $1,000 | Fast Company | Business + Innovation Apple News on iPhone, iPad and Macbooks | Daily Mail Online Report: iPhone 8 to start mass production in September, featuring Apple-custom ¿built-in¿ fingerprint sensor | 9to5Mac Apple redesigns fingerprint ID solution for OLED iPhone, say sources iPhone addiction bites -- to Apple's benefit- Nikkei Asian Review Share or comment on this article e-mail 1.2k shares Most watched News videos Leopards attack giant Rock Python in Kruger National Park The Walking Dead: New strain of spice turns homeless into zombies Woman stops car to beat passenger senseless on the road Louis Tomlinson challenges photographer before taking out fan Shocking video shows moment teenager is stabbed in South Norwood Droning on!: Neighbour tries to shoot down spying drone Violent brawl breaks out after man is savagely headbutted to floor Shocking video shows why Coke Zero really is better for you The Manly ferry tackles huge swells over the weekend Dash cam captures close drive-By shooting in Kansas Avalanche crashes down mountain at Russian ski resort Clever dog says 'I love you' to its owner to get treat PIERS MORGAN: Sorry Emma, but you haven’t done yourself...

Staff This home on Fallawater Street is the second home to be constructed at Apple Acres. DAG Custom homes is the construction company, and Dave Gross with Independence Realty will list the home when it gets closer to completion. Gross anticipates the home will be finished by mid-April. Staff By By Penny Stine Monday, March 6, 2017 Inventory is tight in the Grand Junction real estate market, especially for homes that are under $300,000. Builders who are are scrambling to add more new homes in the lower price range will find welcome help at Apple Acres, a 25-lot subdivision off E Road and 30 Road, where Julie Somerville with Joe Hicks Real Estate is listing lots that are ready for construction. Several lots have already sold to builders in the neighborhood, and two homes are currently under construction. Nathan Rinderle with Upland Companies built the first one at 488 Teco, which was recently completed and is available for sale. “We’ve had good activity on the house, but no offers,” said Ron Sechrist with Bray Real Estate, who is listing the home for $223,900. The home sits on a corner lot, which made it possible to include both a three-car garage and RV parking. Some of the other lots in the subdivision may accommodate both, but all homes in the subdivision are required to have at least a two-car garage per the covenants. The exterior of the home is stucco and stone, which is also required by the covenants for the subdivision. Outside, the home is landscaped in front, with gravel already laid in the RV parking area. The backyard is fenced, and there is concrete curbing and underground sprinklers to all planting areas. “That (landscape) seems to be a good way to go in that price range,” Sechrist said. Inside, the home has a split floor plan, with three bedrooms and two baths in almost 1,400 square feet. Tile flooring in the entryway, baths and kitchen dresses up the interior, while the granite-lookalike laminate countertops in both the kitchen and the bathroom help keep the house affordable. There are ceiling fans in both the living room and the master bedroom, as well as plenty of windows to let in the natural light. The subdivision is centrally located, with easy access to other parts of the Grand Valley. It’s less than half a mile to I-70 B, and is also close to Riverside Parkway and the 29 Road Bridge to Orchard Mesa. The Colorado Riverfront Trail system is also nearby. Lots in the subdivision are manageable, ranging in size from just under 7,000 square feet to almost 10,000 square feet. There is no irrigation water available, but the convenient size of the yard means that even if homeowners choose to have grass in either the front or the back, it won’t break the bank to keep it watered using domestic water. There is a vinyl perimeter fence around the entire subdivision, which helps to keep it more private. Clifton sewer and Clifton water service the development, which also has Grand Valley Power for electricity an Xcel for natural gas. Schools for the neighborhood include Pear Park Elementary, Grand Mesa Middle School and Central High School. Although the first few lots in the neighborhood are sold, Somerville has plenty of lots still available for builders or for individuals who want to bring their own builder. Lot prices range from $39,000 to $45,000. SHARE More Check out most popular special sections!

The best sleep tracking apps for Apple Watch and iPhone The top stories of the week on iDB LiberTV jailbreak for Apple TV 4 running tvOS 9.1-10.1 released   skip to main content skip to main menu     iPhone 8 could release later than September By Christian Zibreg, Mar 6, 2017 Tweet 6 Comments As you know, iPhone 5, iPhone 6 and iPhone 7 models were each released in September of 2012, 2014 and 2016, respectively. This year, Apple is expected to release a pair of iterative updates in the form of LCD-based iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus models along with an all-new model based on power-saving organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen and other technological perks. Based on recent reports, however, it doesn’t look like iPhone 8 will be ready in time for a September launch, creating a unique situation where Apple could pre-announce the new flagship in September before its arrival later in the year. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a note to clients dated February 24 that Apple is struggling to get iPhone 8 ready in time due to time constraints related to the handset’s advanced augmented reality 3D camera system. “Unless production of the OLED iPhone (expected to begin in September) gets pushed back, there is virtually no time to make changes to the 3D camera system, either on a parts or module level, given the lengthy review and recertification processes that would be required,” reads the note. Kuo estimates Apple spent 1-2 years on related-component research and development for iPhone 8’s proprietary 3D camera system, which must be calibrated precisely via active alignment. Piggy-backing on Kuo’s report, Taiwanese trade publication DigiTimes reported last Friday that iPhone 8 won’t be entering mass production before September. “Production for the new OLED iPhone is unlikely to start until September,” wrote DigiTimes. The publication attributes the potential delay to Apple’s redesigned fingerprint ID solution which is widely expected to be embedded into the display. Both reports imply that Apple’s high-end iPhone model may not go on sale in September, as has been the case for years. The last iPhone that did not launch in September was iPhone 4s, which arrived in October. For the sake of completeness, publications like DigiTimes and analysts like Kuo agree that Apple’s iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus updates, which should retain liquid crystal panels, will be entering volume production in July, like prior iPhone models. A Korean report stated this morning that all iPhone models will adopt OLEDs in 2019. As mentioned, iPhone 8 should have a power-sipping OLED screen and pack in a bunch of advanced technologies, such as optional wireless charging with fast charging via Lightning, a new form of two-step biometric authentication via facial recognition and a fingerprint reader embedded into the display and much more. Such perks could potentially send the price of the unlocked device north of $1,000. According to Kuo, all 2017 iPhone models may support fast charging by the adoption of the USB Type-C Power Delivery standard while still retaining the Lightning port. “A key technical challenge lies with ensuring product safety and stable data transmission during a fast charge,” he said. Here’s a nicely done conceptual video of how the rumored function area at the bottom of the OLED-based iPhone 8’s display might work, put together by Tech Driven Times. Kuo heard Apple will adopt Texas Instrument’s power management and Cypress’s Power Delivery chip solutions for 2017 iPhones. iPhone 8 may feature even faster charging thanks to its two-cell L-shaped battery pack design, he added. “The USB Power Delivery Specification enables the maximum functionality of USB by providing more flexible power delivery along with data over a single cable,” according to USB Implementers Forum, creators of USB technology. As we explained, with the right cable (Lightning on one end and Type-A or Type-B on the other end), new iPhones should support faster charging without switching Lightning connectors for USB-C as The Wall Street Journal confusingly asserted last week. If Apple unveils all three iPhones in September but releases only iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus shortly thereafter, would you be willing to wait for the premium iPhone 8 model? iPhone 8 concept via Daniel Csonth.

They sound decent and last longer than most Bluetooth wireless earbuds thanks to the W1 chip inside. The included carrying case doubles as a battery backup and charges the earbuds when not in use giving users long battery life. We want to show users how to get the most out of their Apple AirPods with these ten power tips. These tips will help you get more battery life, work with Siri and even hook them up to non-Apple devices. Pair Apple AirPods with Every Apple Device Most people think about the iPhone as the primary device people will use with their AirPods. Apple introduced the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus at the same time they revealed their new Bluetooth headphones. Apple removed the headphone jack from the latest iPhone making Bluetooth earbuds more useful. Some people thought Apple removed the headphone jack to push buyers into buying accessories like the AirPods or the new Beats headphones. Apple’s AirPods work great with the following Apple devices: All iPhones from iPhone 5 and newer All iPads from the iPad mini 2 or the iPad Air and newer The 6th generation iPod Touch Macs that support Apple’s handsoff technology Apple Watch On these devices the user can use their Apple AirPods following our useful How To on pairing with these devices. In fact, once the user pairs with an iPhone, they’re already paired with these other devices thanks to iCloud’s syncing feature. Switch Between Apple Devices Since iCloud syncs AirPods pairing with an iPhone to the other devices connected to that iCloud account, the user can quickly connect to the other devices. Open the iPhone or iPad control Center by swiping up from the bottom of the screen. Swipe up to show Control Center. Swipe to left to show player controls. Tap on AirPods to connect. Swipe to show the Control Center’s media player controls by swiping left. At the bottom of the screen there’s a drop down arrow. Tap it to show the devices connected to the iPhone. You should see the AirPods on the list. Tap it to connect. If it’s not listed, then open the case and put at least one AirPod in your ear. Most won’t need to do that. The same thing works on an iPad or iPod Touch. On a Mac, click the Bluetooth icon from the menu bar and the drop down list should show the AirPods. If you don’t see the Bluetooth menu bar icon, you will need to turn it on. Click and hold on the Dock System Preferences icon and wait for the list of settings to show up. Click Bluetooth and put a check mark in the box labelled Show Bluetooth in menu bar. From now on you can select your AirPods from the Bluetooth menu, as shown above, and connect to them. Once connected you can use the Sound icon’s drop down menu to switch from your computer speakers to the headphones paired with the Mac. To use your AirPods with an Apple TV or non-Apple devices you will need to follow the pairing guide in the next section. You might need to turn off Bluetooth on nearby Apple devices to switch to those non-Apple devices. Pair Apple AirPods with non-Apple Devices It surprises some AirPod owners that the Bluetooth earbuds also hook up to non-Apple devices. See this How To  for the steps to connect AirPods with Android phones, tablets, computers and other Bluetooth enabled devices. It’s as simple as turning on the Bluetooth feature in that device and then pressing and holding the button on the back of the AirPods carrying/charging case. They will show up as a traditional Bluetooth device in the Bluetooth pairing screen on the non-Apple device. The above screenshot shows what it looks like in Android on a Google Pixel XL phone. Charge AirPods with iPhone Lightning Docks Do you own an iPhone or iPad dock with a lightning connector. Any Lightning charging cable or dock will charge your earbuds. I own a dock/alarm clock that has two lightning connectors. I charge my iPhone on one of them and my AirPods on the other. This charges the case and the AirPods themselves. Check Battery Life Open the Apple AirPods container and the left screen appears. Tap connect and the right screen appears. It’s simple to check the battery life. Open the carrying/charging case with your iPhone in hand. When the lid opens a pop-up shows their battery level. You can also swipe down from the top of the iPhone to show the notification area. Swipe to the right to see the battery level indicator. It shows the phone’s level, the AirPods and if you own it, an Apple Watch. On an iPad Pro, it will also show the battery level of an Apple Pencil. To see the level on a Mac, look at the Bluetooth menu bar item and it will show the battery level. On an Apple Watch, swipe up and tap on the battery indicator. It will show their battery life at the bottom of the screen. Use Siri to Listen to Music with AirPods To use Siri, double tap the AirPod just above the spot where the long cylinder connects to the part that fits in your ears. This engages Siri on the phone and the phone listens for your commands or questions through the AirPod mic. This works with either the left or right earbud. Users can also change the settings to make it play or pause music instead. See instructions below to change this setting. Here’s a list of some useful commands that you might want to use while listening to music. Play “song name” or “podcast name” Play “playlist names” Lower or Raise volume 10% (or any percent you like) Skip back/forward/to the next song Skip back/forward 10 seconds or any number of seconds you want Make Phone Calls with AirPods If you’re working and want to make phone calls without taking out your phone, then you can use the same double-tap control above. When you receive a call, double-tap to answer. Then hang up the call using the same control. Some people would rather get an announcement telling them who’s calling. To do this, go into the phone’s Settings app and choose Phone. Under the CALLS section, find Announce Calls. Tap it to show the options. You can choose… Always. Headphones & Car to only do it while connected to Bluetooth headphones or you Bluetooth car system. Headphones Only Never Double tap the AirPods to engage Siri and use the same commands for making calls that you use on the phone. For example, “Call my wife” will call a contact with the nickname “my wife” entered in the contact’s “assistant” field. You can also use a contact’s name. “Text Michael” will start a text message to a contact named Michael. Name Your AirPods Maybe you don’t like that the Apple default name uses your first name and AirPods (Kevin’s AirPods in my case). Change the name by first connecting them to an iPhone. Then open Settings and choose Bluetooth. Tap on info button, a lower case i inside a circle, next to the name of the AirPods from the list of connected devices. Here you’ll see all sorts of settings. Find the name and tap it. Type in a new name and tap Done. Change Other AirPods Settings While looking at the screen for the AirPods settings, consider changing the others listed. You’ll find the following: Disconnect – you can disconnect them without deleting them from the list of paired Bluetooth devices Forget This Device – this unpairs the AirPods so you can’t reconnect without pairing them again. Name – explained above. Double Tap On AirPods – chooses what happens when you double tap. It’s set by default to control Siri, but you can change it to Play/Pause media or turn this feature off. Automatic Ear Detection – they can tell if they’re in your ears. Turn this off if you prefer not to automatically connect the audio from the iPhone to the AirPods when you put them in your ears. Microphone – three options include: Automatically Switch AirPods – uses either left or right based on which one the system senses will give you best quality Always Left AirPod Always Right AirPod Get the Most Battery Life Using One at a Time The user doesn’t need to use both AirPods at the same time. If they set the above microphone setting to Automatically Switch AirPods, they can then use either the left or the right AirPod. This will extend the length of time the user can go between charges. Use the right AirPod until it runs out of battery life. Then switch to the left AirPod. Put the right one back in the charging box to charge it back up to 100%.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

Part of this is due to laptop hybrid devices such as Microsoft’s Surface Pro gaining relevance. It’s also due to smartphones, such as the iPhone 7 Plus, becoming very large, thus defeating the purpose of a tablet. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro was released at the end of 2015. [Image by Eric Risberg/AP Images] However, Apple keeps releasing new iPads. At the end of 2015, Apple released the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. A couple of months later, they released the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, which Apple said could replace your laptop. However, David Pierce of Wired stressed that the iPad Pro was not a laptop replacement, despite Apple claiming it could be. “For those of us who still cling to laptops and desktops, the iPad Pro just doesn’t feel like a serious machine for serious work. We need our keyboard shortcuts and our mice, our apps that work just how we like them. We need our accessories. A touch-first interface just doesn’t feel right, and the iPad Pro can’t overthrow our existing workflows and tools.” Even Ben Sin of Forbes refuted Apple’s claims. “But for me, and probably most people whose work requires a computer — that’s a heck of lot of jobs — the iPad Pro in its current form simply comes nowhere close to replacing an actual computer, be it powerful desktop or even budget laptops,” Sin pointed out, adding that the iPad Pro behaves like a tablet and even runs tablet software. Apple will release a new iPad Pro within the next couple of months. [Image by Daryl Deino] Despite lower sales than expected, Apple is still pushing the iPad Pro as much a possible. According to Mac Rumors, the Cupertino company has just released two new ads. “Apple today continued on with its latest iPad Pro campaign, today sharing two new Twitter-based video ads highlighting features like the Apple Pencil, the built-in camera, and recording functions.” The article adds that the first ad shows off the note-taking capabilities of the Pro, explaining that it’s easier for students to take notes with the Apple Pencil and even use the Pro’s recording capabilities during lectures. The second video makes the claim — once again — that the iPad Pro is better than a computer. Many in the comments section aren’t big fans of the ads. “My goodness, those ads are abysmal,” says Aaronhead14. “I’m just surprised these got approved by the proper channels,” states OneBagTravel. However, Twitter is more impressed with the new iPad Pro marketing campaign. Tor Myhren and team are nailing it with the recent iPad Pro ads. — Steven Aquino (@steven_aquino) March 4, 2017 Perhaps all the commercials signify that a new iPad Pro is about to arrive. According to Forbes, the next iPad Pro will likely be redesigned to have a 10.5-inch screen, which would fall in between the 9.7-inch iPad Pro and its larger 12.9-inch sibling. However, the overall size of the device won’t be larger than the current 9.7-inch iPad Pro since the bezels will be reduced in size. Forbes points out that Apple could also release a new budget 9.7-inch iPad in the near future as well. The entry level price for this iPad could be $399, whereas the entry level price for the Pro version will likely be $599. The year 2017 is set to be a busy one for Apple, who is also preparing to release at least two versions of the iPhone 8 in September. The new iPhone series is said to be a significant upgrade that offers an edge-to-edge display, an OLED screen, and wireless charging capabilities. Last year may have been a mixed bag for Apple, but 2017 looks to see the company back on top. [Featured Image by Daryl Deino] Now Read This: Microsoft Surface Pro 5: Where Is It?

Since then we've seen Apple, Samsung, and a host of other companies launch their own "truly wireless" headphones, prompting Bragi to give the market another pop with "The Headphone" ($149), a less expensive, more awkwardly named variant of its original cord-free buds. Announced last September two days before the Apple iPhone 7 event, The Headphone only began shipping in January, so Bragi has had plenty of time to iron out any last-minute kinks. Not that there should be any. The Headphone buds are a lot less ambitious than the Dash. They don't have touch-sensitive controls, for one. Bragi has also done away with the internal music player, heart-rate monitoring and fitness tracking features found in the company's original wireless buds. Are they susceptible to the same connection problems that initially befell the Dash? And how do they compare against Apple's AirPods? Let's find out. Design and Features Bragi has chosen to go with a more minimal packaging style for its latest audio product when compared to the Dash. These come in a compact rectangular cardboard box about the size of a cigarette packet, with a top that levers up for you to slide out an inner compartment. Tucked inside is a black carry case connected to a lanyard, a micro-USB to USB-A charging cable, two pairs of FitTips (small, medium), a pair of large Comply foam eartips, a quick start guide, warranty information, and some stickers. A quick look at the documentation seems to confirm there's no accompanying Bragi app for these buds and no obvious way to update the firmware. The carry case is all-plastic (as opposed to the metal Dash case) and despite being significantly bulkier and less pocketable than Apple's AirPods case, it actually feels slightly lighter in the hand. There's a good reason for that, though – unlike the Dash and AirPods, The Headphone case packs zero on-the-go charging capability. Another thing that distinguishes The Headphone from the Dash buds and AirPods is its lack of waterproofing. Fortunately the buds are splash-resistant though, so they'll be fine for sweaty ears and running in the rain. The earpieces don't look very "premium" at first glance, but a closer look reveals a neat ergonomic curvature, with a little arm emerging from the body of each bud where the eartip and driver are located. Overall they feel robust, yet lightweight and well balanced in the hand, despite all the button controls being located on the right earpiece. Using the three physical buttons, you can skip through tracks, take calls, make voice commands via Siri, and activate audio transparency (more on that later). The only feature on the left bud is a small raised Bragi logo on its back. The buds line up with gold charging contacts and magnets in the case, and snap back in easily, but they don't automatically turn off once they're inside, so don't get caught out if you're used to a case with a built-in battery charging feature. With the buds in the case and the case attached to a power source via the USB cable, the LEDs on both earpieces blink until fully charged, then stay illuminated. Performance Pairing The Headphone is pretty straightforward. Pressing and holding down the power button sets off a flashing arc of light on the right bud, the Near Field Magnetic Induction kicks in and connects the pair of them together, and they show up in your Bluetooth settings as a single headset. Using the large Comply tips, the buds fit inside the hollow of my ears nice and snugly – maybe too snugly. The buds never threatened to work themselves loose while I was out on a run, or pop from my lugs during circuit training exercises, but the drawback to this level of security turned out to be my sense of relief upon removing them. The earbuds aren't uncomfortable to wear exactly, but after wearing loose-fitting AirPods for an extended period, The Headphone buds' embedded seal feels a tad constricting. This sensation isn't really diminished by using the smaller FitTips, either. On the upside, The Headphone buds are much easier to hide or disguise than AirPods, if that's a concern, and they do a heck of a better job at blocking out ambient noise than Apple's wireless buds, which sort of blithely hang in the hollows of your ears and let in any old commotion going on around you. The Bluetooth connection between my iPhone and The Headphone was also very reliable during runs, even with my phone secured against the small of my back in a waistband. The connection even remained firm while I tottered between two adjacent rooms indoors, so it's safe to say they have at least one up on the original Dash. The audio transparency feature is meant to let in ambient noise when you want to hear it. A long press on the volume up/down buttons turns the feature on/off. I didn't get much out of it, to be honest. The noises it allowed through were in the high-pitch range, and didn't significantly increase my awareness of my surroundings; it just made the sounds around me more distracting. With the original Dash headphones, swipes and taps on the buds' touch panels controlled music playback, while gestures let users nod or shake their heads to accept or reject phone calls, all of which could work haphazardly or feel too sensitive in practice. With physical buttons and no gestures, none of those issues are present with The Headphone buds and they respond a lot better as a result, although the buttons aren't very "clicky" and you can end up pushing the earpieces further into your ears when you press them, which isn't a nice sensation. The buttons' positioning takes a bit of getting used to once the buds are in, but removing them pauses your music and putting them back in resumes playback, so presumably there's a sensor tucked away inside them, which came as a neat surprise. The original Bragi Dash have a measly three hours' battery life; The Headphone managed around five and a half hours in my tests, just shy of the stated six. That's marginally more than Apple's wireless buds, but the difference is nullified by the AirPods' carry case, which can hold an extra 24 hours of charge and fast-charge the pods in 15 minutes for an extra 2 hours of juice. Once you lose that convenience, you quickly miss it. In terms of sound quality, The Headphone's bass was a bit too much for my liking, and seemed to overpower other aspects of certain music types. Hip-hop and dance sounded okay, but instrumental and jazz sounded awful, and there was some faint distortion in the upper end. I definitely prefer the clarity and openness of the AirPods. Taking calls through them, on the other hand, was fine. Speech sounded clear enough, and I was told my voice came through loud and clear. The buds' integrated mic isn't quite good enough to dictate text messages accurately, but it works fine for making calls in a moderately quiet environment. Bottom Line They may lack Apple features like W1 seamless device pairing and an on-the-go charging case, but at $10 less than the AirPods, The Headphone by Bragi is a viable, discreet option for anyone interested in going "truly wireless" but isn't convinced by what Apple's offering. The sound quality isn't amazing by any stretch, but these are relatively inexpensive isolating Bluetooth buds and should satisfy most users as long as they accept that they're buying into an audio compromise for the convenience of not having to worry about wires. Pros Inconspicuous in the ears Extremely secure fit Strong Bluetooth connection Decent battery life Cons Sound quality is so-so Case doesn't hold any backup charge Audio transparency feature needs fine tuning In-ear button pressing can be a faff How to Buy The Headphone by Bragi costs $149 and can be ordered from the company's website. Note: Bragi supplied The Headphone to MacRumors for the purposes of this review. No other compensation was received.

As far as a black color, that's guaranteed to happen with Apple exoanding The line.

Um, BT headsets have been mainstream for a dozen years. Rating: 1 Votes BvizioN 15 hours ago at 09:58 am I have used both. The main advantages of the Headphone are noise isolation (with optional passthrough via the "transparency" feature) and controls to start/stop/skip songs and adjust the volume. They have different strengths. The Airpods are almost useless in noisy environments such as airplanes, but they are more comfortable and "airy" when it's reasonably quiet around you. The Airpods are also very good for phone calls. The lack of an easy way to adjust the volume on the Airpods is a serious drawback IMO. The Headphone has a more secure fit when doing vigorous exercising or similar. The volume controls and skip/play dies not bother me at all because i use Apple watch and much better /easier in my opinion but for someone who does not have AW it can be an issue. Also the noise reduction is not an issue for me. I don't like to have my hearing totally isolated from outside when I am listening music.

According to a fresh report from the Nikkei Asian Review, Apple later this year will release three brand new iPhone models, with two being incremental iPhone 7s updates and the third being the highly anticipated iPhone 8. Don't Miss: 10 reasons why not even the best Android phones can get iPhone users to switch While the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will undoubtedly feature improved camera technology and welcome hardware improvements underneath the hood, there’s no denying that the real star of the show will be Apple’s next-gen iPhone 8. Said to come packed with improved battery life and an edgeless OLED display, Nikkei’s sources relay that the iPhone 8 will sport a 5.8-inch display. The upcoming iPhone, to be launched this fall, will come in three configurations — two with liquid crystal displays and one with a 5.8-inch organic light-emitting diode display. By adding more large-screen options to the lineup to meet growing demand for BIG, Apple intends to raise the average iPhone price, which has already gone up by about 10% in the past three years to nearly $700. Nikkei’s note is worth highlighting because it clears up any existing confusion regarding the size of Apple’s iPhone 8. If you recall, the publication just a few months ago relayed that the iPhone 8 might feature a 5.5-inch display. Of course, given Apple’s tendency to test multiple prototypes before deciding on a final form factor, it’s not the least bit surprising that we saw some minor inconsistencies about the iPhone 8 design from various analysts and supply chain sources. Likely to shatter all existing sales records, the iPhone 8 will mark the first new iPhone form factor since Apple released the iPhone 6 nearly three years ago. Specifically, the device will feature extremely subtle bezels, enabling Apple to fit a display with 5.15-inches of usable space into a device that’s about the same size as Apple’s 4.7-inch iPhone 7. As a quick illustration of what Apple has planned, reputed KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo published the following image about two weeks ago. Aside from a nearly edgeless display, it will be interesting to see what Apple plans to do with the “Function area” pictured above. While this particular aspect of the iPhone 8 remains hazy, it stands to reason that the Function area will be similar in operation to the TouchBar Apple introduced on the MacBook Pro. We’ve also seen indications that the Function area will feature Touch ID-esque functionality embedded right into the display itself, thereby allowing Apple to remove the home button as we currently know it. As we highlighted last week, an industry report relays that Apple has figured out a way to embed a sensor into the iPhone 8 display that relies upon ultrasound instead of a user’s fingerprint for user identification purposes. Additionally, it will be interesting to see if Apple relies upon facial recognition technology tocompliment whatever type of finger-based verification system it’s working on. Hardly a well-kept secret, Apple over the past few months has been bolstering its facial recognition IP, most recently acquiring Realface, an Israeli technology company with facial recognition software so reliable and sophisticated that it can purportedly be used as a foundation for mobile-based biometric authentication. Coupled with many of the iPhone 8 rumors we’ve seen regarding augmented reality functionality, it’s becoming increasingly clear that Apple’s next flagship iPhone may be far more advanced than most people realize.

Kimbrough, left, and Zavonnti Glasker have been charged with felony burglary and two counts of felony identity theft, police say. (Lake County Sheriff's Office photo) News-Sun Privacy Policy A man and a woman from Detroit were arrested over the weekend, the latest to be accused of crimes connected to an Apple store in Deer Park, authorities said. Sterling L. Kimbrough, 21, and Zavonnti Glasker, 22, each were charged with felony burglary and two counts of felony identity theft, the Lake County sheriff's office said in a news release Monday morning. Since last summer, there have been more than a dozen arrests related to the store, in the Deer Park Town Center, authorities said. Sheriff's deputies responded about 7:15 p.m. Saturday to the store for a report of two individuals attempting to open Apple accounts fraudulently. After an investigation, detectives determined Kimbrough and Glasker were attempting to use the identities of unsuspecting individuals to open fraudulent accounts and obtain Apple merchandise, according to the news release. Kimbrough and Glasker were arrested and charged. Bail for both was set at $150,000. The two remain in the County Jail with March 8 court dates. Last week, two other people were arrested following a traffic stop near the store. Police allege they were going from Apple store to Apple store across the country returning old cellphones for new ones. They used fake names to exchange the phones, police said. Theft charges against 2 men at Deer Park Apple Store total 12 cases since July Frank Abderholden The latest arrest in connection with traveling scams in Lake County centers around two men who were going from Apple store to Apple store across the country returning old cellphones for new ones, but a traffic stop near the Deer Park store this week tripped them up, according to the Lake County... The latest arrest in connection with traveling scams in Lake County centers around two men who were going from Apple store to Apple store across the country returning old cellphones for new ones, but a traffic stop near the Deer Park store this week tripped them up, according to the Lake County... (Frank Abderholden) "The phones they would exchange would be so severely damaged, and in some cases SuperGlued to prevent staff from seeing the serial number to determine if the phone were stolen," said sheriff's office spokesman Sgt. Christopher Covelli. "They would then get a new refurbished phone, which they would sell for significant profit." The driver of the car, Mohammed Hosein, 23, of Detroit, said he and his passenger, Wen Jie Qin, 21, of San Francisco, just left the Apple Store in Deer Park after exchanging broken iPhones. Covelli said they were pulled over for a traffic infraction and the driver had a suspended driver's license. Hosein was charged with felony charges of burglary and retail theft along with traffic-related offenses, Covelli said. Qin also was charged with felony charges of burglary and retail theft, according to Covelli. Seven New York state suspects were arrested over a three-day period in late July for allegedly using stolen identities and stolen credit card numbers of victims throughout the country to make purchases across the Chicago area, according to police. Three suspects charged with identity theft at Deer Park Apple store Just a day after sheriff detectives arrested two people at the Deer Park Apple Store for unauthorized purchases, a third out-of-state suspect was arrested Saturday night, according to Sgt.

John Michael Johnson, 18, of Ferndale, Mich., was...Read the story At the time, Covelli said the suspects would fly into O'Hare International Airport, rent a car and go to Apple stores to attempt to make purchases. Beside those seven, three other people, two from Michigan and one from New York state, were arrested at the end of January for making unauthorized purchases, and they were charged with burglary and identity theft, according to police. In August 2016, a Las Vegas couple was arrested after a clerk at the Deer Park Apple store recognized the couple from a corporate alert that they were wanted for theft from Chicago area stores in Schaumburg and Oak Brook, and in the states of California and Nevada. Two stolen Apple drones were found inside the vehicle, according to police. In Gurnee at the end of January, police arrested three people from Orlando, Fla., who had flown into Chicago and rented a car for a $20,000 shopping spree in the village using fraudulent credit cards. Gurnee police said that on Jan.11, they received several calls from businesses that had been victims of credit card fraud totaling approximately $20,000, according to police. The suspects' descriptions were similar, and one of the victims got a description of their vehicle, which was registered to a rental car company. According to police, they searched hotels in the area and found the rental car, learned what hotel room the suspects were in and made the arrests without incident. An earlier online version incorrectly said two men had been arrested. Also, the photos of the two people initially were misidentified.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Mar 6, 2017 at 9:23AM The problem of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) cash balance is a "first-world problem" in the most literal sense of the phrase. Slightly larger than the annual economic output of Chile, Apple's cash and marketable securities stockpile lies largely overseas. As of the company's most recent earnings report, $230 billion of Apple's $246 billion, roughly 93%, was held in accounts controlled by Apple's international subsidiaries. Apple has caused quite a stir thanks to its controversial decision to park its foreign profits abroad rather than pay what it argues are onerous and unfair repatriation taxes. However, the whiff of tax policy overhaul percolating on Capitol Hill means this dynamic could soon change. In anticipation of such a scenario -- and in part because it's just fun to consider -- here are three realistic ways Apple could deploy its billions in the bank in the years ahead. Image source: Apple. Idea 1: Major acquisition Apple being a mature company, you often see investors float the idea of the Mac maker using its cash to fund a major acquisition whenever this discussion appears. The idea isn't without merit, either, although it is more complex than it might seem on the surface for a few reasons. The first hurdle lies in correctly identifying a large company that jives with Apple's plans for its own future. In terms of companies that I (subjectively) think could conceivably pair well with Apple, only a handful of plausible candidates come to mind. Among them are Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (NASDAQ: CMCSK), three legitimately viable options among publicly traded companies. We know Apple is interested in -- or possibly in the midst of -- developing an electric vehicle from the many leaks about its Project Titan, though we don't know much more than that. Tesla makes the most sense among automakers for a few reasons. Much like Apple, Tesla's mission is to fundamentally alter the industries in which it operates. Its headquarters in California would make working together simpler than coordinating across the country with Detroit. In a similar vein, Comcast and Netflix both cater to Apple's long-held desire to launch its own content streaming service. Apple's ability to secure content rights from major producers has been the main thorn in its side. Both Netflix and Comcast control considerable content rights, though Netflix is newer to this game. As such, owning either Comcast or Netflix could supply Apple with the negotiating leverage it needs to finally bring the required parties to the table. Unfortunately, acquiring any of these companies would require Apple pay a significant premium to their current prices, which could be particularly troubling for already-expensive stocks like Netflix and Tesla. There are also integration, cultural, and regulatory considerations that could make such a maneuver highly complex for Apple, though the idea isn't entirely without merit. Idea 2: More capital return? This comes from the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" school of thought since Apple has thus far used its cash reserves to finance its dividends and share buybacks. To do so, Apple has cleverly used its overseas riches as collateral to borrow against to fund its massive capital return program to great effect. Apple has paid out a whopping $201 billion of its current $250 billion capital return program as of its most recent earnings report, including $15 billion in dividends and buybacks in its latest quarter (Q1 FY 2017). Apple generated $27 billion in operating cash flow last year, and its capex requirements are minimal -- $3 billion last quarter. This makes the status quo seem sustainable, although the recent rally in Apple stock makes this option increasingly less appealing. AAPL PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts. Stock buybacks become less effective as a company's valuation increases, so Apple's dramatic multiple expansion has made this tactic less attractive than it was a year ago. However, with Apple still trading at a discount to the market, and its cash balance rising, there's certainly a fair case to be made that further buybacks and dividends remain a worthy use of Apple's riches. Idea 3: Finance important capex? If Project Titan is indeed real, I think the chances of Apple implementing this third idea are quite strong. One of the most important questions Apple must answer along the way is how will it manufacture the electric vehicle? As I have noted in the past, automobile manufacturing is a capital-intensive, low-margin business. This leaves Apple facing a potential catch-22 with Project Titan, driving meaningful sales growth while also dramatically eroding its now-cushy profit margins in the process. Perhaps the best solution to this problem is to follow a tactic similar to Apple's contract manufacturing arrangements with Asian assembly specialists Foxconn. Apple designs products and maintains quality control, but it hands over the actual widget-making, the low-margin part of the process, to someone else. This is how the majority of Apple's consumer electronics get made today. The key speed bump with this idea is that there are no large-scale automotive contract manufacturers that exist today to provide this service to Apple, and that's where Apple's mountains of money come into play. Assuming it finds a willing and capable partner to build Project Titan, Apple could use its cash to finance the construction of the factory infrastructure necessary to bring Project Titan to life. In fact, Apple has pursued a similar strategy in the past. It partnered with the now-defunct GT Advanced Technologies to finance the construction of a factory that GT Advanced planned to use to produce commercial sapphire for Apple's fingerprint scanners. If it does so, Apple will want to take great care to avoid past mistakes, like bankrupting GT Advanced under the onerous terms of its financing deal. Regardless, this idea is sound as long as Apple's auto ambitions are indeed as real as portrayed in the media. Cash is king Of course, this only scratches the surface in terms of possible uses of Apple's cash. U.S. tax policy overhaul will also have a significant influence on Apple's options, so interested investors will want to stay in tune with the national discussion around it in the coming months. At the end of the day, though, Apple's billions in the bank provide it with unparalleled flexibility to pursue any number of possible actions, and that's something in which Apple investors can and should find great comfort.

LIKE   TWEET   SHARE   PIN   SHARE   POST MAIL MORE Posted 18 hours ago by iClarified · 2774 views · Translate Apple is planning to switch to OLED displays for all its iPhone models by 2019, according to a report from The Bell. The site says that Samsung Electro-Mechanics and Interflex are investing heavily in equipment to make the flexible printed circuit boards (FPCB) which will be needed for the OLED iPhone. Samsung Electro-Mechanics has already started to expand its Vietnam plant in the second half of the 100 billion won range, and Interflex is considering investing 100 billion won in the second half of this year. Despite the expansion, the shortage of FPCBs is expected to continue due to the massive demand from Apple. The company will allegedly switch all its iPhone models to OLED by 2019. Even if SEMCO and Interflex are going to expand capacity, the industry expects that the shortage will continue rather than oversupply due to the huge demand from Apple. Apple plans to introduce OLED panels to all iPhone models by 2019. This year's introduction accounted for only 40%, but next year it is expected to double to 80% and 100% next year. This year Apple is expected unveil a new 5.8-inch OLED iPhone and updated 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch LCD iPhones. Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

What makes the iPhone so special? April 1, 2014 Cam Bunton 23 Comments In 2007, Apple released what the world called “The Jesus Phone”. If Steve Jobs wanted to “put a dent in the universe”, this was the product that really did it. No product before or since had as big impact on the consumer market as the iPhone did when it was released in 2007. Unlike everything else on the scene before, it had no buttons, except one. It had a multitouch display that worked incredibly well. It had a full web browser that was far more powerful and efficient than anything Windows Mobile, BlackBerry or Palm devices had. It had a great email app. It was unbelievable. Since then, it’s been unable to shake off its Messiah complex. Every generation swings by, and each generation brings in more sales, more revenue, and more profit for Apple. Until last year, there was a crazy statistic: Each and every generation of iPhone launches brought in more sales than all of the previous generation launches combined. That is – quite frankly – insane. Samsung may be leading the way in terms of overall handset sales globally, and Android may have a much larger portion of the smartphone market, but there’s still no single flagship smartphone that outsells the iPhone. And Apple still rakes in the majority of the mobile industry’s profits. . “North Star” If you listen to any interviews with Tim Cook from the past year or so, you’ll hear several mentions of Apple’s focus and drive. Its “North Star”. The company knows exactly where it’s heading with its hardware and software development. Probably for the next 5 years, if not more. It has a clear target, and it will not deviate from it. Market trends won’t push it off course, and certainly don’t affect its decisions or cause any knee-jerk reactions. It hasn’t made a phablet yet, despite Samsung having had three generations of its popular Note series already. The iPhone still only has a 4-inch screen, which is tiny compared to almost every smartphone on the market nowadays. Do people complain? Not much. At least, not the general consumers. It’s all us tech-heads doing the complaining. Will the iPhone have a bigger display eventually? Probably. But it won’t be a rushed product manufactured out of sheer panic that it’s losing market share. If Apple is going to release a bigger iPhone, it’s because it’s planned, developed, built and tested and found it to be a great experience. As much as I hanker after a bigger screen, I know my complaints, or anyone else’s, aren’t going to sway Apple. But it’s more than that even. Cupertino’s designers, unlike most other smartphone makers, only have to focus on one new design every 1-2 years. Last year was the first time since 2009 that we got a brand new design 12 months after the previous one. Ive&Co. can take their time, considering each chamfered edge, the exact color of the glass panels or anodized finish on the back. It can perfect, hone and develop it with great attention to detail. . All in-house Another element of Apple’s success with the iPhone is that it’s built entirely in-house. Software and hardware are designed together simultaneously to create an experience that’s refined. The fact that it can design its own processors, displays and connectors goes a long way to ensuring the all-round experience is first class. A small, but obvious, example is the Lightning connector. It’s durable, easy to use, and because it’s got an authentication chip built in, it’s hard to copy without the iPhone/iPad picking up that you’re using a fake/Chinese clone. Being able to design the chips and the OS itself, means it can be streamlined to be efficient. Android devices – for example – now use Quad-Core processors to power them and make them super-fast. iPhone’s still on dual-core, and that’s predominantly because Siri requires one of those cores. With software and hardware all being designed in-house, it’s a great device. But when you add those two elements to Apple’s amazing ecosystem of apps, movies, music and books through iTunes, you get something incredible. Any music in my iTunes library is on my phone, any movies I purchase on my Apple TV are viewable from my iPhone. Any apps on the App Store have to meet Apple’s guidelines, to ensure that not to much trash gets through. Yes, it’s a “walled garden” some may feel to be too constricting. But, for most people using the device, they don’t notice the walls are even there because they’re too busy staring at all the flowers and plant-life. I mean, what’s better: a perfectly tendered garden with all kinds of wondrous beauty, or a completely free, wide-open public park covered in dog business, empty beer bottles and graffiti? . It’s so good, faults are major news As far as I can remember, there’s not been one iPhone that’s been so bad as to get a mediocre or poor review. Each one is billed as the “top smartphone” by tech critics. Even the iPhone 5c has been well received. Almost every aspect works fantastically, and is in tune with the rest of the components and functions. So much so, that when a fault shows up, it makes the news. If Apple’s Maps app starts making mistakes, or has poor data, it’s all over the web within a couple of days. If the antenna doesn’t pick up signal when you cover one of the gaps that helps it to work, it’s branded “Antennagate”. If there’s a purple lens flare when you point your camera directly at the sun, you’ve got “Purplegate”. If iMessage or iCloud goes down, the webosphere hurls itself in to a manic state of bewilderment. . Developers Apple loves developers. And developers love Apple (mostly). Since its inception, the iPhone has only ever had two screen sizes. Between 2007 and 2010, it had one screen size with one resolution to develop for. Developers didn’t have to test for varying resolutions and form factors. iPhone 4 was released, with twice the resolution, but in the same size screen and the same ratio. Adapting apps for that was easy enough. iPhone 5 was launched, it had the same pixel density and the same width as the previous displays, but was slightly longer. Again, not too much trouble. And apps not optimized for iPhone 5 didn’t look too bad on its longer display. Almost 6 years after the App Store launched there are now over 1 million apps on the App Store, and a huge number of devoted developers. But it’s not just the quantity that’s impressive. iOS gives developers the platform to really build some fantastic programs that look and work great. And they don’t have to try a hundred different screens to optimize the app. With millions of people using the same iPhone screen, app developers can do some really great work, and know that the experience for every user is going to be exactly the same. It’s hard to believe that third party apps weren’t available until the iPhone 3G. But deciding to launch the App Store was perhaps the greatest thing Apple ever did. For everyone. . Is it really special? I think what I love about the iPhone is that it shows what a company can achieve by not panicking, and by staying true to its principles. It believes in great design, in simplicity, in making your life better through technology. It’s not just going to release a gigantic monstrosity capable of teleporting you to the moon, back in time and with a giant 4k screen a 16-core processor. Experience comes first. Is it special still? Yes, I think so. I think we’re reaching a lull now that we always seem to reach when a design approaches the two year mark. I remember reading stories and comments about how old, and out of date the iPhone 4s was compared to competition in 2012. Then months later, iPhone 5 was announced, and suddenly Apple was back in the game (not that it was ever really out of it).  iPhone 5s is about the potential of two key things: Touch ID and 64-bit processing. They may not be wowing us now, but in a couple of years time, when not having them both will seem unthinkable, we’ll look back at the iPhone 5s as the device that kick-started them. When the iPhone originally launched in 2007, not many people bought it. Nowhere near as many as bought the 3G or 3GS in the following years. It was expensive, couldn’t send MMS, record video or download third party programs. Does that stop it from being a special device? What do you think? Is the iPhone still special?

I tell this exact same thing to Apple-haters. I explain to them how the hardware and software are made for each other, unlike Windows and Android. Very few will argue with me, and the die-hard haters will simply sneer and change the subject. Christopher APPLE-Haters are self proclaimed smart people who have no idea what is going on at chip level. Patrick there are actually one MILLION apps, not billion… nonetheless impressive Cam Bunton Tru dat.. eek. donnybee Great article Cam! TBN27 One thing that you forgot to mention is that the iPhone is well supported and long lasting. An iPhone user will get updates no matter which version owned up to what it is capable of running, and that same iPhone can last a long time without failure. Also if one invests in apple care, you have a worry free smartphone for 3 years. Ever since switching over from android, I have never been so satisfied and not in need of upgrading. This will also be the first smartphone I have owned that is well on its way to being around for two years. I would go for 3 but T-Mobile US is upgrading their network and the next iPhone I predict will have the new radio bands for the LTE Additions, and quite frankly I am digging Touch ID. roopull Cam, I don’t think the lull you refer to is unique to the iPhone. The challenge in the market at this point is to do anything that has a substantive difference on user experience. I cannot fathom much that you could put in one of these devices that has not been done already – and done quite well. The iPhone still has a few things it can do, but they’ll only be firsts for the iPhone, not for the smartphone market as a whole. RedGeminiPA You missed the whole moral of the article. Enrike Montemayor That even with those “insane” sales, it’s loosing market share to Android, even in USA where there’s a lot of iSheeps… (That God complex of iSheeps is unbelievable) Greg I don’t think thats a fair comparison. Yes, there are more devices running Android framework, but thats counting EVERYTHING running Android, not just phones. iPhone is just phones. Also there are 7 iPhones, and thousands of Androids. So if a company with 7 devices can even get close to competing with a company with hundreds, thats something worth noting. Jack That’s what I try to tell people. An Apple iPhone with iOS 5, 6 or 7 pitted against how many phones with Android OS? LG, HTC, Lumia, Nokia, Samsung, Kyocera, etc. I say Apple’s doing pretty well against the competition. devesh Just yesterday I was checking out s5 and m8 videos,,, these devices just don’t have the UNIFORMITY in their behavior!! ,, m8 is all jerky, and s5 is still a tad second slower in launching almost every other app,,, as Steve jobs had quoted,, if ur obsessed with your software,, better design your hardware!!! Greg This is the problem with comments I saw a video and it was shaky and s5 is a sec slower. Lame comment. I have a galaxy note gt-n7000 nearly 3 years old now. Not 1 problem. I went to our telco and actually used a htc m8 for 30mins connected to wi fi. I’m buying it and upgrading. I didn’t watch a video I didn’t read comments. I personally went out and tried it. Sense I will get used to. I do things I want to do in life I don’t awatch videos and slam something i haven’t tried. I also like useing something every tom dick and harry has, I have never followed the crowd, and I’m so glad I did this years ago as I’m not scared to try new tecnology. Can’t say the same for most people who just can’t get past 2007 devesh Sorry for the “LAME COMMENT” but video was all I could watch until the phone comes in hands,, I ain’t some ass watching videos and commenting, my first cell was galaxy ace followed by note 1 , then s4 and last note 3′, I use note 3 simultaneously with iPhone 5s ,, I’m speaking by experience, for now s5 seems to be same as note 3 and s4 in stutters here and there devesh And seriously who on this earth with normal human reflexes didn’t notice the freezes on note1 and it’s subsequent death with each update,, the last jellybean nearly killed the device!!! If u didn’t have a problem with note 1 in 3 years ,,,, I’m sorry for you,, donnybee In all respects, I feel Android users are following the crowd more at this point than iPhone users are. iPhone has quality: Build quality, app quality, and guaranteed support in the future. So why WOULDN’T someone choose iPhone? It’s because it’s cool to hate Apple now. We have a new herd of sheep in town and they’re all carrying Samsung, HTC, ZTE, LG, Sony, etc etc etc. I love the reference to the open park full of garbage. Essentially, that’s what Android is. I’ve gone back and forth and iPhone always comes out ahead. The ecosystem is more stable for devs too.. Do you realize how EASY it is to pirate an app on Android? If I was a developer, I wouldn’t ever develop an app for Android, unless it had only in-app purchases. Android phones are a dime-a-dozen and sure perform like they are too. Anon No one wants to pay $700 for a new iPhone every year. People have androids because you can get them for $100 and they basically do the same thing. Cool to hate iphones? I think you mean it’s cool and in style to have an iphone. Rick Rudge Another good posting, Cam. I remember when Steve Jobs first introduced the iPhone. He said that he would be happy with 5 percent of the mobile phone market. I think that the iPhone exceeded all expectations. As far as the Apple-Haters, they’ve been with us for a long time, and I happily try to ignore them. I noticed in sales ads for Android phones that they seem to have different versions of Android OS for each phone. Does this mean that this is the version of Android that comes with the phone, or are you only able to update to that version of Android OS on this phone? It’s kind of confusing. I have an older iPhone and am amazed that I can still upgrade to the latest iOS. If people are happy with Android, that’s fine with me, but it seems like many of them just have to put down iPhone users, for some strange reason. Tyler iDevices are so overrated… Apple just cookie cuts every device they make. I love their computers and os but god all mighty I utterly hate the i-series because – for example the iphone 6 is coming soon and the specs are just sad. All they really did was make it larger. I expeded a nice phone with a 18mp camera and a 2k screen but no, boring 720p retina. – they make a big deal about being lighter and the size of the phone. – An android or windows phone can do all of the things an iphone can do. Hell, I could put iOS on an Android if I felt like it. – they honestly are just posh excesories… Rubbish. ClubDoug I’ve been using a 5s for a year now, and to be perfectly honest, it is the only mobile I have ever hated! Before this I had an Android for 2 years (only 1 Android) and proprietry OS’s before that (I only ever update my phone every 2 years). I have missed so many calls, messages, emails on IOS, it seems to only notify you of some things and not others, so I constantly have to go into my email app, messenger app, etc etc to actually see what I have missed! (even though I have every notification option turned on). Missing timely email notifications alone has cost me far more than this phone is worth. The volume is also either so quiet that I can’t hear the phone ring, or I believe it actually just decides not to audibly ring sometimes to piss me off. The brightness also seems to have a mind of it’s own. The interface, despite what everyone says, I find to be ridiculously slow and laggy. Yes it’s smooth, but it’s like there is no “buffer”, ie if I press ahead of what the screen has caught up to, my presses are just lost, unlike the Android phone I previously had, where yes the phone wasn’t the smoothest, but at least I could press a series/sequence of positions on the screen that I had gotten used to, and knew for sure that even if the screen hadn’t caught up to me, that they would register. Plus the phone seems to have a mind of its own in terms of how it responds to certain things you try to use it for (ie literally every day there’ll be something mundane I’m trying to do with it and then it responds with something to me that is totally random and I’m thinking why the f*** would you think that that’s what I wanted to do!) The build quality also seems far inferior – damages easily (aluminium body) and sounds cheap (flick the screen with your fingernail and it just sounds plasticy and hollow, not solid). Don’t drop it or it’s game over! This one phone has put me off Apple forever sorry (as this is the only Apple product I have ever purchased). I wasn’t an “Apple hater” before buying this as it’s my first Apple product. I’m still not an “Apple hater”, but am certainly an iphone hater now! jazmine what do you think about I phones? jazmine what do you think about i phones Sipho van de Merwe I always tell apple-haters that, you wot understand until you own one..

Oil giant Saudi Aramco is expected to have a market capitalization of $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion when it sells shares to the public next year, a survey of fund managers and institutional investors by regional investment bank EFG Hermes showed on Monday. That means the market value of Aramco, the world’s biggest oil firm, could potentially double Apple’s current market cap of about $734 billion when it starts trading. Indeed, the high end of the survey’s range still falls short of a target of at least $2 trillion set by Saudi Arabia’s Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who oversees the kingdom’s economic policy. The valuation of Aramco has been the focus of intense speculation since the Saudi government last year announced plans to sell up to 5 percent of it and list the shares in Riyadh and at least one foreign stock exchange. The EFG Hermes survey, conducted at an investment conference organized by the bank in Dubai, found 39 percent of respondents predicted the market would value Aramco at between $1 trillion and $1.5 trillion. Thirty-six percent expect a valuation below $1 trillion, and 24 percent a figure above $1.5 trillion, the bank said. The company’s ultimate valuation will depend on decisions that are expected to be made by Saudi authorities in coming months, including the tax rate that Aramco will pay as a public company, and the portion of Aramco’s huge and diverse array of assets that is included in the listed entity. Saudi officials have given no concrete indication of how they will decide these questions, so any estimate of Aramco’s value remains tentative. The EFG Hermes survey suggests a higher valuation than some estimates by private analysts. Last year Foreign Reports, a Washington-based oil industry consultancy, calculated Aramco could have a market value of $250-460 billion, excluding the value of refining assets and guaranteed access to oil and gas.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple to reportedly use 3 Korean Flexible Printed Circuit Board Suppliers for iPhone 8 and Shift all iPhones to OLED in 2019 | Main March 06, 2017 Equipment for Forming 3D Features in a Device & Testing the Strength of Sapphire Revealed in Apple Patents   It's always fun to read about new consumer oriented inventions like a wireless charging device that shows a user that charging has begun by levitating an Apple device like an iPhone – or to discover that Apple has begun researching new form factors like a scrollable iPhone. But for some of us, learning about some of the behind the scenes processes that Apple is working on to perfect future products is just as fascinating. Last week the U.S. Patent Office revealed two interesting inventions by Apple. The first covers a new testing device for artificially grown corundum to form sapphire parts and housings while the second invention involves forming recessed features in a ceramic or sapphire component for an electronic device like logos or device housing textures.   Flexural Testing Apparatus   The first patent in this report relates generally to a material testing apparatus and, more particularly, to a flexural testing apparatus designed to stress a material to analyze physical and/or mechanical properties of the stressed material and a method of testing the material.   Apple notes that in order to ensure all sapphire material used to form components of the electronic device meet quality control standards and/or will function substantially similar between each individual device, the sapphire material may undergo conventional material testing processes. Such material testing processes may include ring-on-ring material testing or ball-on-ring material testing. These tests may apply a force to the sapphire material until the material flexes or breaks.   However, because of the unique chemical or physical characteristics of sapphire material and/or the discrepancies that may form in the material, conventional material testing processes may be inadequate. For example, the ring-on-ring and ball-on-ring material testing processes may only form a contact area on the tested sapphire material where the ring or ball contact the material. As such, the ring or ball may only apply a force in the contact area of the sapphire material during the test. This may result in inaccurate measurements of force required to flex and/or break the sapphire; during testing, the ring or ball may not contact areas of the sapphire in which faults or flaws exist and so the effect of such faults or flaws may not be determined by conventional tests.   Apple's patent FIG. 1 noted below shows us an illustrative perspective view of a sapphire structure #100 that may be a wafer of artificially grown corundum to be further processed and used in an electronic device.   The artificially grown corundum used to form the sapphire structure may be grown using any conventional growth process including, but not limited to: hydrothermal growth; vertical horizontal gradient freezing ("VHGF"); edge-defined film-fed growth ("EFG"); horizontal moving growth (e.g., Bridgman growth); and Kyropoulos growth.   The sapphire structure may be singulated or otherwise formed into individual pieces or components that may be utilized as a variety of components of many, distinct electronic devices. In non-limiting examples, processed components formed from the sapphire structure may include cover glasses, buttons, caps, housings or enclosures and the like for an electronic device.   The sample electronic devices whose housing may use sapphire take the form of a tablet computing device, phone, personal digital assistant, computer, wearable electronic device (e.g., smart watch), digital music player and so on.   Apple's patent FIG. 8 noted above depicts a stress-graph illustrating the actual stress experienced by the sapphire structure of FIG. 1 to deflect the sapphire structure to a maximum, calculated flexion point.   It appears that Apple is determined to continue their work with artificially grown corundum / sapphire despite ending their relationship with GT Advanced Technologies. Other patents surfacing after the GTAT breakup include laser polishing ceramic and sapphire and a laser system to color sapphire materials for a future iPhone.   Apple's patent application was filed back in Q3 2015. To review the details about this invention, click here. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time. The inventors on this patent are Dale Memering, Manager of Product Design Materials and product design engineer Victor Luzzato.   Method for Forming a 3D Feature in a Cover Surface   Materials such as metal or glass, sapphire, or other ceramics may be finished using a variety of different abrading or other material removal processes. For example, polishing may rub a surface of a part using a tool (such as a bristle brush) to achieve a particular surface finish. In many cases, polishing is performed on flat or planar surfaces using flat rotatory brushes. Such a process may work well for polishing flat surfaces, but may not create as uniform a polished finish for three-dimensional features.   Apple's invention relates to finishing three-dimensional features using abrading and/or other processes that remove material. More particularly, the present embodiments relate to forming recessed features in a ceramic component for an electronic device.   A three-dimensional feature may be formed in a surface of a component. Material may be removed from the component by rotating an abrading tool about a first axis. While the abrading tool is rotated, the component may be rotated on a second axis. The second axis may be transverse to the first axis and may run through a center of the three-dimensional feature. The abrading tool may correspond to the three-dimensional feature.   For example, the abrading tool may be configured to contact an entirety of an exterior of the three-dimensional feature during the removal operation, fill the three-dimensional feature during the removal operation, and/or have a shape that corresponds to the shape of the three-dimensional feature in two planes that are normal to each other. In this way, material may be removed from portions of the three-dimensional feature in a first direction and subsequently material may be removed from the same portions in one or more additional directions. This may prevent, reduce, and/or ameliorate streaks, brush lines or other artifacts related to the material removal.   In some examples, the operation of removing the material may form the three-dimensional feature in a flat area of the surface. In various examples, the three-dimensional feature may have a concave dome shape and the abrading tool may have a convex shape matching the concave dome shape. In some examples, the three-dimensional feature may be a dish.   Apple's patent application was originally filed on September 2, 2015. To review the details behind Apple's invention, click here. The inventors listed for this invention are Jeremy Franklin, Product Design Manager who came from MIT, and Kristina Babiarz, Product Design Engineer.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

Apple and John Deere Say No Monday, March 6, 2017 at 7:29AM There are corn and soy fields as far as the eye can see around Kyle Schwarting’s home in Ceresco, Nebraska. The 36-year-old farmer lives on a small plot of land peppered with large agricultural machines including tractors, planters and a combine harvester. Parked up in front of his house is a bright red 27-ton Case tractor which has tracks instead of wheels. It’s worth about $250,000, and there’s a problem with it: an in-cab alarm sounds at ten-minute intervals to alert him to a faulty hydraulic connector he never needs to use. Because farm machinery is now so high-tech, the only way to silence the error message is by plugging in a special diagnostic tool – essentially computer loaded with troubleshooting software that connects to a port inside the tractor – to identify and resolve the problem. Only manufacturers and authorized dealers are allowed that tool, and they charge hundreds of dollars in call-out fees to use it. For a fifth-generation farmer in an increasingly squeezed industry, whose family has spent decades fixing the equipment they paid for, it’s a tough pill to swallow. He’s coped with the intermittent alarm sound for almost a year. “I can’t turn the alarm off. If I had the literature and capability to diagnose and fix it, it would already be done. I changed the mechanical switch and wire, but now I’m down to the programming,” he said Wednesday. Kyle is one of many farmers in the US fighting for the right to repair their equipment. He and others are getting behind Nebraska’s “Fair Repair” bill, which would require companies to provide consumers and independent repair shops access to service manuals, diagnostic tools and parts so they aren’t limited to a single supplier. They have an unlikely ally: repair shops for electronic items like iPhones, tablets and laptops who struggle to find official components and information to fix broken devices. This means the bill could benefit not just farmers but anyone who owns electronic goods. There’s also a benefit to the environment, as it would allow for more refurbishment and recycling instead of landfill. Nebraska is one of eight states in the US – including Minnesota, New York, Massachusetts, Illinois, Wyoming, Tennessee and Kansas – seeking to pass “right to repair” legislation. All eyes will be on the “cornhusker state” when the bill has its public hearing on 9 March, because its unique “unicameral legislature” (it’s the only state to have a single parliamentary chamber) means laws can be enacted swiftly. If this bill, officially named LB67, gets through, it may lead to a domino effect through the rest of the US, as happened with a similar battle over the right to repair cars. These Nebraska farmers are fighting for all of us. Big Agriculture and Big Tech – including John Deere, Apple and AT&T – are lobbying hard against the bill, and have sent representatives to the Capitol in Lincoln, Nebraska, to spend hours talking to senators, citing safety, security and intellectual property concerns. John Deere has gone as far as to claim that farmers don’t own the tractors they pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for, but instead receive a “license to operate the vehicle”. They lock users into license agreements that forbid them from even looking at the software running the tractor or the signals it generates. Squaring up to the corporates are grass roots activists like Kevin Kenney, 52, who has spent months educating fellow farmers and pounding the corridors of the Capitol building to counter the lobbyists’ fear-mongering. Kenney argues farmers are effectively being held to ransom when their machinery breaks down. “Before software, there wasn’t anything you couldn’t work on. It was all book and tools. Now it’s book and tools and software,” he said. Opening up the equipment will allow Nebraska’s farmers to expand their skills into computer science, allowing for ag-tech innovation in “Silicon Prairie”. The combination of the agricultural repair with electronic goods repair makes Kenney nervous: he thinks it’s going to be a harder fight with the attention and lobbying clout of technology giants. “Apple is going to throw too much money at it,” he said. State senator Lydia Brasch, who sponsored the bill, described a meeting with Apple lobbyist Steve Kester and colleague, who flew in from Austin, Texas. “Apple said we would be the only state that would pass this, and that we would become the mecca for bad actors,” she said. The Cupertino-headquartered company also argued there was a safety risk associated having untrained people installing unofficial components, particularly lithium ion batteries – as demonstrated by Samsung’s Note 7 debacle. Apple also told Brasch that there are plenty of authorized repair shops to choose from. The state of Nebraska, which covers 77,000 sq miles (roughly the size of England and Scotland combined) has just one Apple Store. It’s an 80-mile journey for Brasch to get there, and it can take weeks to get a Genius Bar appointment. “It’s disruptive and inconvenient,” she said. It’s the same for authorized repair shops of agricultural equipment. Long waits for engineers can lead to costly downtime at critical weather-sensitive parts in the farming cycle, such as planting or harvesting. Brasch, who works as a software consultant and is married to a farmer, said that in her seven years in office, she’s never experienced lobbying like it – even when she introduced a pro-life bill, which she recognizes is a “controversial issue”. Jason DeWater, 36, is a the former principal horn at the Omaha symphony orchestra, who founded a chain of repair shops in the city, called iFixOmaha. He and a team of skilled technicians repair smartphones – mostly iPhones – as well as tablets and laptops. He scoffs at the idea that independent repair shops are somehow unsafe; his staff go through several months of OSHA-certified training before they can even touch a customer’s phone. “We take full liability for our customers’ devices. If we make a mistake we buy them a replacement device. In addition, our products are backed with a lifetime warranty,” he said. “Apple can’t even say that.” Not having official diagnostic and disassembly tools make their job difficult, particularly as companies such as HTC design their products to make them tricky to even open without specific proprietary tools. He even went as far as contacting Apple to ask about the authorization process, but the company then looked at his website and told him he was engaged in “fraudulent activity”. By signing up with Apple he would not be permitted to mention any other smartphone manufacturer on his website nor would he be allowed to replace modular parts or remove screens. Instead, he’d have to send devices to an Apple service center, leaving customers without them for weeks instead of hours. “If we signed up, they would dictate the pricing and terms of service. We’d end up being a post office for Apple,” DeWater said. All he wants is the the ability to buy official components from Apple and others and the diagnostic software. “We’re not looking to access personal data. We’re certainly not trying to reverse engineer Apple’s products. All we’re trying to do is fix customers’ devices.” Apple declined to comment, but emphasized that using authorized channels is the only way to ensure you’re getting genuine Apple parts and that the repair is done to the right specifications. John Deere declined to be interviewed but sent a lengthy statement outlining its concerns. The company doesn’t want people altering its copyright-protected code because, said director of public relations Ken Golden, “changes could lead to the unsafe operation of products, disruption of machine capabilities and performance, changes to emissions controls, voiding of warranties and lack of transparency to the changes when the equipment is sold to another user”. Despite the intense lobbying, farmers, electronic repair shops and state senators remain largely united, and frame the issue as one of corporate greed. “They see someone trying to share the sandbox and they don’t want anybody else to play in it,” said Brasch. “In my view that’s not how our country was built. We are all about free enterprise and competition. That’s what makes us strong.” Editor | Print Article | Post a Comment | Share Article View Printer Friendly Version Email Article to Friend Reader Comments There are no comments for this journal entry.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile New report reaffirms the most exciting new iPhone 8 feature Yoni Heisler @edibleapple March 6th, 2017 at 9:27 AM Share Tweet With 2017 already in full swing, the makeup of Apple’s 2017 iPhone lineup is finally starting to crystallize. According to a fresh report from the Nikkei Asian Review, Apple later this year will release three brand new iPhone models, with two being incremental iPhone 7s updates and the third being the highly anticipated iPhone 8. Don't Miss: 10 reasons why not even the best Android phones can get iPhone users to switch While the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will undoubtedly feature improved camera technology and welcome hardware improvements underneath the hood, there’s no denying that the real star of the show will be Apple’s next-gen iPhone 8. Said to come packed with improved battery life and an edgeless OLED display, Nikkei’s sources relay that the iPhone 8 will sport a 5.8-inch display. The upcoming iPhone, to be launched this fall, will come in three configurations — two with liquid crystal displays and one with a 5.8-inch organic light-emitting diode display. By adding more large-screen options to the lineup to meet growing demand for BIG, Apple intends to raise the average iPhone price, which has already gone up by about 10% in the past three years to nearly $700. Nikkei’s note is worth highlighting because it clears up any existing confusion regarding the size of Apple’s iPhone 8. If you recall, the publication just a few months ago relayed that the iPhone 8 might feature a 5.5-inch display. Of course, given Apple’s tendency to test multiple prototypes before deciding on a final form factor, it’s not the least bit surprising that we saw some minor inconsistencies about the iPhone 8 design from various analysts and supply chain sources. Likely to shatter all existing sales records, the iPhone 8 will mark the first new iPhone form factor since Apple released the iPhone 6 nearly three years ago. Specifically, the device will feature extremely subtle bezels, enabling Apple to fit a display with 5.15-inches of usable space into a device that’s about the same size as Apple’s 4.7-inch iPhone 7. As a quick illustration of what Apple has planned, reputed KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo published the following image about two weeks ago. Aside from a nearly edgeless display, it will be interesting to see what Apple plans to do with the “Function area” pictured above. While this particular aspect of the iPhone 8 remains hazy, it stands to reason that the Function area will be similar in operation to the TouchBar Apple introduced on the MacBook Pro. We’ve also seen indications that the Function area will feature Touch ID-esque functionality embedded right into the display itself, thereby allowing Apple to remove the home button as we currently know it. As we highlighted last week, an industry report relays that Apple has figured out a way to embed a sensor into the iPhone 8 display that relies upon ultrasound instead of a user’s fingerprint for user identification purposes. Additionally, it will be interesting to see if Apple relies upon facial recognition technology tocompliment whatever type of finger-based verification system it’s working on. Hardly a well-kept secret, Apple over the past few months has been bolstering its facial recognition IP, most recently acquiring Realface, an Israeli technology company with facial recognition software so reliable and sophisticated that it can purportedly be used as a foundation for mobile-based biometric authentication. Coupled with many of the iPhone 8 rumors we’ve seen regarding augmented reality functionality, it’s becoming increasingly clear that Apple’s next flagship iPhone may be far more advanced than most people realize.

(Read our list of the Best cheap iPhone 7 deals.) Which gives us some pretty strong hints about when to expect the iPhone 7s. Ever since the launch of the iPhone 4s, Apple has consistently updated its iPhones once a year, in autumn (with one exception: the smaller iPhone SE was launched in March 2016), so we're expecting the iPhone 7s to appear some time in September 2017. Here are our predictions of upcoming iPhone release dates over the next few years: Mar 2017: iPhone SE 2 Sept 2017: iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus Mar 2018: iPhone SE 3 Sept 2018: iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus Mind you, it's possible that Apple might bring the iPhone 8 forward... as we discuss later in this article. iPhone 7s production 'to start earlier than expected' According to analysts at BlueFin Research Partners, quoted by Barron's Tech Trader Daily, Apple is likely to start production of the late-2017 iPhone models earlier than is customary. "The most intriguing data points that we have uncovered suggests that AAPL is ramping the next-generation iPhones earlier than historical norms," write John Donovan and Steve Mullane. "Interestingly, our present reads suggest a 300 percent increase in iPhone 8/X builds in the June quarter, now sitting at 9M. As a result, overall June quarter builds have increased from 45M to 48M, with the sharp increase in iPhone 8 offset somewhat by modest declines in legacy models. In the past, builds of upcoming releases began in earnest early in the September quarter, so this is a departure from AAPL’s normal build cadence." The researchers play down any suggestions that this indicates an earlier launch date, however, so we are left to wonder why the company feels it needs longer to produce the iPhones. Are they going to be technically more demanding to manufacture, or is it a question of volume? iPhone 7s release date rumours: Donald Trump 'pressuring Apple to build iPhone 7s in the US' As part of his recent presidential campaign, Donald Trump complained about Apple's offshore manufacturing operations, and boasted that he would make the company build its iPhones in the US (and employ a bunch of Americans in the process). Now, as president, he's trying to make his promises a reality. Speaking to the New York Times, Trump described a call he had with Tim Cook about the issue, and appeared to think he had been extremely persuasive. "I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, 'Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.' He said, 'I understand that.'" Read next: Where are Apple products made? Apple has its reasons for building its smartphones in Asia, where labour costs are lower (and the relevant skills are more plentiful, according to Cook). But Trump thinks he can sweeten the deal with tax cuts and changes to regulations. "I said: 'I think we'll create the incentives for you, and I think you're going to do it. We're going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you'll be happy about.'" What Trump did not claim is that Cook actually agreed to any of this, even in principle. And Tim Cook doesn't strike us as someone who could easily be cowed into taking a course of action that isn't in the best interests of Apple and its shareholders. More of this sort of vague thing has emerged since then. Trump stated in an interview with Axios that Tim Cook has his "eyes open" to the idea of building iPhones in the US, and that he "really believes [Cook] loves this country and I think he'd like to do something major here", whatever that means.  To be frank, these statements read less like an update on the progress of negotiations and more like a public blackmail campaign, but it might just work. Trump has been underestimated before. Other Apple products made in the US The idea of US manufacture isn't totally alien to Apple, although it is unusual and restricted to far lower-volume products than the iPhone. It has made a lot out of its US Mac Pro assembly, but this is a niche product - a flagship niche product, to be sure, but one that is made in comparatively low numbers. In January 2017 - a couple of weeks ahead of Trump's inauguration - Apple applied to expand the use of a manufacturing facility it owns in Arizona. (The plant was originally going to be used for sapphire screens, but that fell through.) It was understood, rather boringly, that Apple would be building data server cabinets for its own internal use, but the company has since stated that it will merely be receiving, configuring and distributing servers from this hub rather than building any products. Any increase in the company's US manufacturing footprint, no matter how seemingly unrelated to the iPhone, will add to speculation that Donald Trump's very public pressure is beginning to have an effect. (The President is quite canny at taking credit for things that are unrelated to - and sometimes precede - the actions he claims to have caused them, as the US automotive industry is currently discovering.) iPhone 7s release date rumours UK: Name Apple habitually follows what is known as a 'tick-tock' release cycle with its iPhones. One year it will release a full-number upgrade, featuring a significant physical redesign (iPhone 4, iPhone 5, iPhone 6); then the next year it will release an 'S' upgrade which has the same physical design as its predecessor but adds new features and spec boosts (iPhone 4s, iPhone 5s, iPhone 6s). For this reason many Apple fans choose to upgrade their phones once every two years. Given that the iPhone 7 appeared in 2016, the obvious conclusion is that Apple will unveil an iPhone 7s (and accompanying iPhone 7s Plus) in autumn 2017. But there have been increasingly widespread murmurs that it's about time for Apple to retire its tick-tock cycle, which deprecates the importance of its S releases and discourages regular updates. What's more, 2017 is the iPhone's 10th-anniversary year, and the iPhone 7 had a surprisingly similar physical design to the iPhone 6 and 6s (headphone port aside). For these reasons, quite a few of us suspect that Apple will go all-out with a blockbuster release, branded as the iPhone 8, next year. Indeed, a little extra weight was added to the 'iPhone 8 in 2017' theory in early October 2016. Business Insider reports that an Apple employee in Israel who solders components spoke to them about the next iPhone and referred to it as the iPhone 8 "unprompted in our conversation". iPhone X Timothy Arcuri, an analyst at the research firm Cowen and Company, has sent out a client note predicting among other things that the late-2017 iPhone update will be branded as iPhone X - the letter X in this case evidently signifying the Roman numeral for 10, since the iPhone is celebrating its 10th birthday in 2017. It's rather leftfield, and we'll count it as unlikely until we hear evidence to back it up, but it's actually not the worst idea in the world: those relentlessly rising model numbers draw attention to quite how long Apple has been churning out iPhones, and make each one seem like merely the latest update in a long line of identikit devices. This would be a statement of intent, a declaration that this one is different. We'll talk a bit about Timothy Arcuri's other predictions later in this article. Macworld poll: What will Apple call the next iPhone? iPhone 7s release date rumours UK: Design What physical changes can we expect in the iPhone 7s? Logically, an S upgrade would imply a lack of a physical redesign, but Apple has kept largely the same chassis for three iPhones in a row now and we'd be shocked if the company doesn't pull some kind of major revamp out of the bag. iPhone 7s design: Edge-to-edge screen, with no Home button Some while back Piper Jaffrey analyst Gene Munster suggested the iPhone 7 wouldn't have a Home button, reasoning that the new 3D Touch technology introduced with the iPhone 6s could largely take its place and allow Apple to use the space to make the screen bigger or the device smaller. (A corollary of Munster's theory is that the Touch ID fingerprint scanner would need to move - perhaps being built into the screen itself.) Munster's speculation about the iPhone 7 didn't prove to be true - indeed, Munster has made a few famously misjudged predictions in the past, along with some decent calls - but may yet happen on the iPhone 7s. Technology that could help with this development was announced by a biometric R&D company, Sonavation. Its tech would enable Apple to run the screen vertically edge-to-edge, with no cut-out for the Home button. The Home button could occupy the same position but appear only when needed, much like the software keyboard; and the technology for Touch ID would be bonded to the underside of the screen at the appropriate point. Funnily enough, Apple filed a patent that seems relevant to this concept. Patent application number 20150036065, for "a fingerprint sensor... incorporated in a display stack in an electronic device", was filed in April 2014 and published recently. Here are some of the illustrations: (The illustration in Fig. 1 above appears to show an iPhone that still has a Home button, and therefore doesn't increase the amount of screen area - what would be the point of that, you might wonder. But remember that this is to illustrate the concept itself, not to show what it would look like in practice or the way other elements of the product would change to adapt to it.) What's more, Apple has been granted another patent that also refers to a fingerprint sensor that can work through a screen. Patent 9,460,332 describes a "Capacitive fingerprint sensor including an electrostatic lens": more pertinently to this discussion, it states that "one or more other device components, such as a display stack and/or a touchscreen may be interposed between the contact surface of dielectric structure 202 and array 206 of capacitive sensing elements". In January 2017 yet another patent was added to the pile of evidence that Apple is plotting the use of an edge-to-edge screen. Patent 9,543,364, granted on 10 January, refers to "Electronic devices having displays with openings", and appears to cover various means by which Apple would be able to hide cameras, sensors and controls behind the screen and still allow the user to access them, thanks to small (and in most cases tiny) holes in the screen. This in turn means Apple can expand the screen outwards to cover the full face of the device, since it doesn't need to leave space around the edge for the various apertures and controls we've grown used to. The holes could be filled in with a material that doesn't block radio signals, for instance, although in many cases they will be so small that the user wouldn't notice them. Then, in February 2017, another patent appeared detailing another method of embedding a Touch ID sensor within the display of the iPhone - although this one is a little different. Rather than featuring ultrasonic- or electric field differences to scan your fingerprint, the latest patent suggests using infrared emitters and sensors placed along the RGB LEDs in an OLED display. Interestingly, the requirement of an OLED display suggests that the option may only be available on the high-end 2017 iPhone.  No physical buttons at all A February 2017 report by Fast Company, which made headlines primarily for its prediction that an iPhone could top the thousand-dollar mark for the first time, also raised the possibility that the late-2017 iPhone might not have any physical buttons at all. "Apple has been working to remove the physical Home button from the iPhone," says the site, basing its comments on a source with knowledge of Apple’s plans. "It would become a button to touch, not press. There's even a chance that the physical buttons on the sides of the iPhone may go away, our source says, replaced by touch-sensitive inlays in the metal." Read Fast Company's full report for more juicy details - there's lots of good stuff. iPhone 7s design: Larger screen Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri, who we quoted earlier, has also made some predictions about the screen to be included in what he predicted will be called the 'iPhone X'. There will be three models, Arcuri says: 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch phones, to match the existing iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and a new 5.8-inch iPhone - the biggest ever iPhone screen. This latter, clearly flagship model, will have an OLED screen and a "wraparound" design with the Touch ID fingerprint sensor integrated under the glass, with no separate Home button. Incidentally, The Investor reports that Samsung will be making LED panels for the late-2017 iPhone. A new deal struck between Apple and subsidiary company Samsung Display is worth 5 trillion won, or about £3.5m, and involves the supply of 60 million units. (Apple will need more than that - the company sold 78.29 million iPhones in Q1 2017 - and usually makes deals with multiple screen suppliers.) Further weight has been added to the theory that one of the new iPhone models to be unveiled this autumn will have a bigger screen than ever before: a whopping 5.8 inches, if a report from Nikkei is to be believed. "The upcoming iPhone, to be launched this fall, will come in three configurations - two with liquid crystal displays and one with a 5.8-inch organic light-emitting diode display," the site predicts. "By adding more large-screen options to the lineup to meet growing demand for BIG, Apple intends to raise the average iPhone price, which has already gone up by about 10% in the past three years to nearly $700." iPhone 7s design: Curved/flexible screen There have been consistent rumours, stretching back years, that Apple is going to make an iPhone with a curved or flexible screen - although flexible might be a misleading word to use here. Very few people imagine that an iPhone in the near future will actually be able to 'flex' in any meaningful way (being folded in half to fit in a pocket, for example); most pundits just mean that it will have curved edges so that the screen continues a little way down the sides, like the Samsung S7 Edge. Some relatively firm evidence was added to this theory in January 2017, when the screen maker Japan Display, which already works with Apple, confirmed [paywall article] that it is ready to start building flexible displays. (Again, this is understood to mean 'curved' rather than 'actively bendable by the user'.) While the company didn't mention Apple by name, it did say it is building the screens for hardware partners, and analysts are understandably putting two and two together. iPhone 7s design: Glass front and back 9to5Mac cites a report, from the generally reliable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, that predicts - based on the popularity of the (scratch-prone) Jet Black iPhone 7 - that the next iPhone will have a glass front and back that mimic that device's glossy looks but are better able to resist scratch damage. "If Apple does follow through with what KGI suggests," the site predicts, "an all-glass design could extend the glossy finish to all colours of the iPhone lineup depending on how Apple handles the design." iPhone 7s design: Stainless steel chassis DigiTimes (a Chinese-language site which Apple Insider describes as a "hit-or-miss publication", with polite savagery), is predicting that the chassis of the iPhone 7s will be made of stainless steel and supplied by Jabil rather than favoured manufacturing partner Foxconn, citing the usual anonymous sources in the supply chain. This would be a surprise, to be honest, given Apple's overwhelming recent preference for aluminium; the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s were designed with steel bands around a glass body, but it's been all aluminium for the iPhone line ever since. And we're given to understand that the engineering method will be different this time around: whereas the iPhone 4-gen handsets were milled, the iPhone 7 metalwork will be forged, a technique that creates stronger components. iPhone 7s design: Colour options The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are available in five colour options: silver, gold, Rose Gold (pink), (matt) black and Jet Black. The iPhone 7s will probably be available in the same colours, but it's believed that there will be a sixth red option as well. The (generally pretty reliable) Japanese-language site Macotakara has posted a report that cites a source in the Taiwanese supply chain and says it is highly probably red will be added to the colour line-up. (A slight complication here is that Apple has historically made red products as part of the Product Red HIV/AIDS charity, rather than as a cosmetic preference. Macotakara doesn't comment on whether this will be tied in with that charity.) Mockup illustration courtesy of Macotakara Before the launch of the iPhone 7 there were rumours about a Deep Blue colour option, but we've not heard much about that since then. iPhone 7s release date rumours UK: New features Pundits are increasingly looking ahead to 2017 for a big iPhone launch. Making predictions about the upcoming performance of Apple stock, analysts at Credit Suisse forecast that the 10th-anniversary iPhone released in 2017 (which they predict will be called iPhone 8 in recognition of its major updates, incidentally) will feature "significant innovations" such as a full-glass OLED screen, new and upgraded haptic feedback features, wireless charging and numerous major specs improvements including the camera and processor. Here are some more features we could see in the iPhone 7s. Read next: Best 3D Touch shortcuts iPhone 7s new features: 3D-sensing camera After the dual-lens camera and associated Portrait Mode offered in the late-2016 iPhone generation (on the iPhone 7 Plus only, of course), many pundits believe Apple will again try to lead on a headline camera feature for the iPhone 7s, this time focusing on the front-facing camera. Ever-quotable analyst Ming Chi Kuo predicts a "revolutionary" front camera in this year's iPhones, including an infrared component (transmitter and receiver) that "can sense the 3D space in front of it", in the words of 9to5Mac. Infrared signals are beamed from the phone, and then detected when they bounce back. Having the ability to map out the 3D space in front of an iPhone has numerous possible applications but two are most obvious: 3D selfies, and games. Kuo believes that Apple will upgrade to rear-facing 3D sensors in future if the front-facing version goes down well. Apple's iPhone updates have an enormous effect on the company's bottom line, and accordingly numerous Wall Street analyst firms have dissected the state of augmented reality technology and the likely nature and impact of a mooted 3D camera/scanner appearing in the late-2017 iPhone. Stephen Milunovich of UBS strikes an optimistic note, predicting that "investors could be surprised at how AR could reinvigorate the iPhone/iPad and possibly result in new products" and citing Apple's hardware expertise and large coherent user base as reasons why it can make AR work. Morgan Stanley's researchers are less convinced, raising doubts over widespread consumer appeal (noting the rapid drop-off in interest seen even by Pokemon Go) and questioning whether smartphones will have sufficient processing power to deliver the concept satisfactorily. And KGI's famed Apple expert Ming Chi Kuo thinks that developing successful AR applications will enable Apple to redefine currently popular products such as the iPhone, boost low-takeup products such as the Apple Watch and move into new areas such as car tech. For more detail on analysts' take on the mooted iPhone 3D scanner, we recommend Business Insider's comprehensive review of the material. iPhone 7s new features: Wireless charging Wireless charging didn't arrive with the iPhone 7 as some had predicted (it has also been predicted for previous iPhone models stretching back some years), but was introduced to the Apple Watch in the form of inductive charging... and this is significant. As iMore's Rene Ritchie points out, inductive charging hasn't been practical for the iPhone in previous years because the technology available at the time didn't work through an aluminium backplate - but the Apple Watch can offer wireless charging because it has a ceramic back. In July 2015 Qualcomm announced a wireless charging breakthrough that does work through metal. This came too late for the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, but the technology may appear in the 7s generation. Foxconn, a huge iPhone manufacturer, is reported to be testing wireless charging modules that will be included in some or all of the 2017 iPhones. (Apple likes to have at least one major feature that sets the Plus model apart, and so it would makes a certain sense to limit this to the large model only.) The questions at this point relate to yield rate and profitability: Foxconn is exploring the practicality of producing large batches of the component to a satisfactory standard. In November 2016, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted in a report that Apple will indeed bring wireless charging capabilities to the autumn 2017 iPhone handsets, thanks to the all-glass design, but warned that the firm may bundle the wireless charger with more expensive models only. The firm envisions a wireless pad for charging the phones, somewhat like the inductive charger that comes with the various Apple Watch models. Perhaps the iPhone 7s Plus will offer wireless charging out of the box, while iPhone 7s buyers will need to purchase the charging pad separately (in this scenario, obviously the phones would need to be chargeable via conventional means too); or it might be the lower storage capacity units that miss out on the bundled wireless charger. That's another accessory to put on your shopping list, then. Business Insider offers a little more detail from Ming-Chi Kuo's report on wireless charging; one aspect it mentions - which appears to contradict earlier rumours that Foxconn was leading the way in this area - is that Pegatron will be the exclusive supplier of this component. Despite the suggestion that wireless charging will come to all three models of the 2017 iPhone, a new report from Macotakara citing sources inside Apple's Asian operations claims otherwise. The site's source claims that wireless charging will only be made available on the most expensive iPhone 8, and you'll also need to buy an adaptor on top of the initial cost of the phone. However, while some may be initially shocked by the news that you'll have to buy the accessories separately, this is commonplace amongst Android smartphones that offer wireless charging capabilities. If you thought that was bad, the latest counter rumour suggests that we could be waiting yet another year for Apple to introduce wireless charging on the iPhone. Anonymous 9to5Mac sources claim that while Apple is looking into wireless charging, the company might wait until 2018 to introduce it - although we're not so sure about that. With so many sources, including Ming-Chi Kuo who has an impeccable record when it comes to Apple leaks, suggesting that it will make an appearance on the 2017 iPhone, we're inclined to believe it. While it seems that analyst and anonymous sources can't decide on whether wireless charging will appear on one- or three 2017 iPhones, what we do know for sure is that Apple is seriously considering the technology. Why? Apple recently joined the Wireless Power Consortium, the group behind the Qi wireless charging standard, to rub shoulders with the likes of Samsung, Lenovo and others, all of which offer wireless charging solutions for their smartphones. iPhone 7s new features: Augmented reality and VR According to a source cited by Business Insider (described only as "a person familiar with the matter"), Apple is currently working on a new augmented reality feature for the 2017 iPhone update. "By adding AR technology into the iPhone's camera software, Apple wants consumers to be able to point the phone at a real-world object and have it be recognised," said the site. "Another early feature for Apple's AR integration into the camera app could be to recognise and manipulate people's faces." This fits with earlier predictions raised in a far-ranging and fascinating Facebook post by Robert Scoble which discussed the way VR and augmented reality will figure in Apple's upcoming iPhones. "Really amazing VR/AR/mixed reality is coming... and coming by the end of 2017," Scoble writes. "Apple's entrance into this new world is like when IBM came into the personal computing world. It is that important." He discusses the impact that a mixed-reality iPhone could have on the market, and predicts that users will "pop [the new iPhone] into a headset which has eye sensors on it, which enables the next iPhone to have a higher apparent frame rate and polygon count than a PC with a Nvidia 1080 card in it... The clear iPhone will put holograms on top of the real world like Microsoft HoloLens does. "You'll look through the glass in mixed reality modes (think of a new kind of Pokemon game) either in the headset, or in your hand." Read more: Apple VR and augmented reality rumours iPhone 7s new features: New 3D Touch AppleInsider is predicting that the late-2017 iPhone will feature second-gen 3D Touch with greater sensitivity and greater gesture versatility than the current version, thanks to changes in the underlying design. According to a research note from the respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo seen by the site, the next iPhone will have 3D Touch based around thin film instead of flexible printed circuit boards. While this would improve the way the technology works, it would create design headaches; for one thing, thin film sensors don't incorporate the metal conductive plate that protects the current screen from deformation, so Apple would have to add a passive metal backplate or risk a repeat of the Bendgate scenario. The development would also add to manufacturing costs, and with UK prices already up to account for the weakness of the pound, Apple hasn't got much room for manoeuvre if it wants to protect its profit margin. Read next: Best 3D Touch shortcuts iPhone 7s release date rumours UK: Price We think the iPhone 7s will start at a little over £600 in the UK. Here are the prices of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which are already higher than the previous generation were at launch after Apple's wide UK price increases. It's likely that the iPhone 7s will be priced at a similar point. iPhone 7 (32GB): £599 iPhone 7 (128GB): £699 iPhone 7 (256GB): £799 iPhone 7 Plus (32GB): £719 iPhone 7 Plus (128GB): £819 iPhone 7 Plus (256GB): £919 But it's felt that there will be another price jump, even if only a small one. One theory holds that the next iPhone will break the thousand-dollar barrier in the US for the first time (this is according to Fast Company, citing a source "with knowledge of Apple's plans"). A thousand-dollar US price tag would most likely translate to a UK price of £940 or so, although obviously that would be the top-end model. For comparison, in the US the 128GB cellular-equipped edition of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro costs $1,029; in the UK this model costs £939. The iPhone 7 Plus with 256GB of storage costs £919, or $969 in the US. iPhone 7s release date rumours UK: Leaked photos and concept illustrations It's a little early to expect leaked photos from Apple's supply chain - we'd imagine the iPhone 7s is still in the design stages - we have seen our first concept illustrations. These are imaginative images created by talented artists and design illustrators with ideas about what they'd like to see in the next generation of Apple's smartphone. Thadeu Brandao has come up with some lovely, minimalist concepts for the iPhone 7s: Brandao described his thought process as "mixing the design of iPhone 4 and 7", and you'll note the lack of a headphone port once again, and the Home button integrated into the screen. Brandao also worked on the following concept video posted by the YouTube channel ConceptsiPhone: On the next page: Everything you need to know about 2016's iPhone 7 launch >> >> Read on… Pages 1 2 3 Tags: iPhone , Rumour , iPhone 6 , iOS 9 , iPhone 6s , iPhone 7 Share this article Share Tweet   Comments Comments Advertisement Nintendo Switch review: Portable power and versatile design let down by expensive accessories and… 1995-2015: How technology has changed the world in 20 years The 20 artists creating 'digital graffiti' on the white walls of a Florida coastal town Best Mac web browser 2017 | What's the best internet browser software for Mac: 8 best alternatives… Apple News Apple Reviews Apple How To Macworld Magazine Apple Deals Mac Forums Apple Mac iPhone Reviews iPad Reviews Mac Downloads About Macworld Contact Site Map Information for advertisers Privacy Policy Terms & Conditions Cookies UK Tech Weekly Podcast:Soundcloud/ iTunes Follow Macworld on Twitter Follow Macworld on Facebook © Copyright 2017 IDG UK.

Credit: Apple More like this How Apple iCloud Drive works and how to use it Apple’s iOS 10.3 is a very, very, important upgrade Get to know the Premier 100 Class of 2017 Video Mingis on Tech: Self-driving cars, wireless charging -- and Wi-Fi lightbulbs? A report claims Apple is combining its services teams within one campus at its first Cupertino campus as it strives to improve iCloud. It needs to. A Brand Keys report ranks the company last in the file storage category. Head in the iCloud Baked inside every Apple product, Apple’s iCloud services offer a range of useful features, not least the ability to seamlessly share files across devices. It also saves device backups, image libraries and much more. Indeed, it does so much that it should be obvious to anybody that Apple’s free 5GB storage is inadequate, given how deeply connected its cloud storage system is to its products. I’m not the only one who thinks this, a recent 63-person poll revealed that over half of those who voted think Apple should offer more than 5GB free storage, while just 26 percent of voters seem positive about current iCloud prices. With Dropbox, Google, Box and others offering far more generous free storage capabilities, it seems self-evident that Apple should cut iCloud storage prices. But what else can it do to improve its service? Go Pro Apple knows that its iOS devices are gaining great traction across the enterprise. Ultra-secure, its platforms are in vogue with big firms choosing to use them. These big firms are engaged in a rapid transition to Industry 4.0, in which automation and collaboration are becoming critical to future success. Addressing the latter need you have high-end collaboration services, ranging from team-focused solutions like Slack all the way to Microsoft Lync and bespoke services from Cisco and beyond. Apple’s response has been to reach deals with Deloitte, Cisco, SAP, IBM and others to open-up the iOS enterprise. But it has done nothing for iCloud. iCloud needs to be an industry-ready service consumers can also use. It needs to provide the best possible combination of utility, machine intelligence and security to augment the lives of both consumer and enterprise users. Developers, developers, developers It seems weird to me that when I want to share a Dropbox file it’s easy and flexible, yet it is nowhere near as easy and flexible to share files through iCloud. Why am I unable to define who can open files, for example? What about the data created in such sessions? Why am I unable to track when files are looked at by other people, and if they have been shared? What about collaborative features? I don’t think everybody needs features like these, but it makes sense for Apple to think about how iCloud can integrate with solutions that do provide them. That is why I think Apple should provide extensive Developer API’s. Third party developers should be able to use iCloud as the core for highly sophisticated file storage solutions for high-end users. Online everything I do sometimes wonder what will happen to my music collection if my circumstances change and I am no longer able to afford new hardware with which to access that collection. I also wonder why I can’t share Maps data on a website, or use a Web interface for Messages. I know Apple recognizes these needs – why else does it offer iWork online? While I think there’s an element of the traditional walled-garden model at play here, enabling cross-platform access to Apple’s services online would do a lot for brand loyalty, and would help dispel some people’s conviction that Apple is in some way “too controlling”. It would also make sense to let users selectively decide which data they want to restore to their devices. Simple problem solving I consider myself quite familiar with Apple products, but I still become confused when working with some iCloud services. I have been using Apple’s services for a very long time, which means I have, .Me, .Mac, and iCloud addresses, and while these all work as an Apple login, I’d like a way to easily tell if I’ve used the same authorization on all my devices. When it comes to photos, I’d like to be able to tell which album is where, and use of an online tool to help show me which settings to change and on which devices to combine all the images from multiple collections. I’d like a flow-chart based troubleshooting and management system to help people make better decisions when setting up iCloud. “If you do this, then you should also do that. Here are the optimal settings for each of your authorized devices.” Many people seem to want to use multiple Apple IDs with their account, particularly those who had a separate iTunes account at some point. Performance and reliability There are occasional complaints about iCloud sync efficiency and speed. The Amazon Web Services outage last week underlined how Apple’s services can be limited by its use of that supplier. Fortunately, a VentureBeat report last year confirms the company is developing its own infrastructure to lessen its reliance on others. “Apple isn’t happy with the fact AWS is not able to very quickly load photos and videos onto users’ iOS devices,” that report said. It remains to be seen if Apple’s teams can deliver the kind of performance and reliability customers expect from its service.

By Rene Ritchie Friday, Mar 3, 2017 at 11:01 am EST 18 Comments Rene Ritchie has been covering the personal technology industry for almost a decade. Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa are taking different paths towards the virtual interface, but is there a benefit in walking them both? I've been thinking about getting something that runs Alexa. Probably an Echo. It's not properly supported where I live, which I'll get to later, but it's interesting technology and I'd like to test it out. What interests me most is how radically, almost diametrically opposed Amazon's strategy has been compared to Apple and Siri. The two companies, and others, are all racing towards the same finish line — a voice-interface good and ubiquitous enough to become the primary interface for certain tasks — but in very different ways. Then vs. Now Siri launched in 2011 alongside iPhone 4s. Previously and app from the App Store, Apple acquired it and turned it into the flagship feature for that year's release. It shipped with fewer partner features that it had as an app, but has added several of them back over the years. Alexa launched in 2014 alongside the the home hub, Echo. A product of Amazon's Lab123, it was inspired by the science-fiction style voice interfaces made famous by Star Trek. Recently, it even added "Computer!" as a trigger word. Which is brilliant. Pocket vs. Home Because Apple launched Siri as part of iPhone, it started off life in your pocket. That led to some compromises, like mobile power limitations, small microphones, and a susceptibility to the vagaries of cellular networking. But it also meant Siri was — and is — with you everywhere. If you forget to turn off your lights at home, you don't have to run back to be within shouting distance of your living room. You can trigger a shut-off from across town or around the world. Because of longstanding issues, Siri hasn't earned the cliché "the best assistant is the one you have with you", but there is some convince to it. (I can't count the number of times I've walked out of my house only to whisper a command to my Apple Watch on my way to the car.) Alexa began as a box in your living room. That meant it couldn't come with you everywhere — it was a stay-at-home-assistant only. But it also meant it lived on AC power, could have multiple, beam-forming mics, and could rely on fast, stable Wi-Fi for networking. You may not be able to toggle your plug from the mall or the airport, but if you yelled from the kitchen, and Alexa heard you, you could be damn sure it'd get it right. Forms as factors From iPhone, Siri spread to Apple's other devices. Over the years, in successions quick and slow, Siri came to iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and as of last year, the Mac. That's great for ubiquity, since it means Siri isn't just in your pocket, it's on your lap, it's on your wrist, and yes, it's in your living room and on your desk. It's not consistent, though. Different devices offer different features, which means you can't yet count on Siri doing what you want regardless of which version you ask. That's not due to the optimizations, which make sense, but simply to some services missing on some devices. Alexa's initial movement didn't move it very far — from Echo to Dot. In other words, it stuck to the home. More recently, though, Amazon has been liberating Alexa. That includes the Alexa Voice Service and Amazon Lex. This way, other manufacturers could choose to integrate Alexa into their own devices, from smart fridges to smart phones. It puts Amazon head-to-head with Google's Assistant. There are almost 30 supported devices now, but only a few are brands as recognizable as Ford, LG, or Lenovo. That's good and bad. It means Alexa will become more ubiquitous and more mobile, but it also means it will face stronger competition for that ubiquity. In other words, if you get Apple, you get Siri. If you want Alexa, you'll have to navigate your way past Google, Samsung, and others. Language sets vs. Skill Sets Apple made Siri international almost immediately. Not at large scale, but enough that you could use it in a few countries and in a few languages. But they kept going and growing from there, adding Siri support to host of places and dialects. Siri now speaks 21 languages, including Hebrew, Arabic, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Malay. And it does it in some 42 countries. Apple TV is even doing multiple concurrent languages now, so you can ask in French for a movie with an English title. Not all languages, countries, and devices have all features, though. Conversely, Apple's been slow in adding third party support. It took until 2016 to launch SiriKit, the first public API, and even then it offered only a handful of "domains" — types of apps that it could interface with. Apple's approach was to start small but add robust support, meaning less syntax dependence and greater flexibility in the recognition of intent. In theory, that should mean better support but also less support, at least at first. Amazon has been much more conservative when it comes to languages and regions. From a singularly American start, it's since began moving out to the U.K., Germany, and now internationally. It's only official language support, though, is English and German. What Alexa lacks in linguistics it more than makes up for in integration. I can't even begin to count how many services offer "Skill Sets" for Alexa, and popular ones too. You may have to follow more verbal formulas to properly communicate with them, but that you can communicate with them in vast volume is the attraction. More support, if more rigid at first. Siri vs. and Alexa I try to get every new Google phone every year just so I have a point of reference. What it does better I want Apple to learn from and improve on, and what it does worse reminds me that no matter how annoyed I get at Apple sometimes, the grass on the other side has as many barren patches as green spots. I'm making it a point to do the same with other important technologies. And voice-as-interface is an important technology. Just like I want to feel what the Nintendo JoyCon controllers do with tactile, I want to hear what Amazon does with speech. I absolutely detest that I'm going to have to hack my way around Amazon not providing Echo support in Canada yet, despite this being 2017 and our being America's comfy winter hat, but I'll figure it out. What I'm most interested in seeing is how, if at all, the two services compliment each other. Unless and until Apple releases my dream home hub with multi-personal Siri, could there be greater value in having and using both? If you've got experience using Siri and Alexa together, let me know how it's working for you. And if you have an Alexa product you'd recommend I try out, let me know! Like us!

I use Siri on the complete suite of Apple products, iPhone, iPad, TV & Watch. I use Alexa on an Echo and an Echo dot. The Echo in the Kitchen is used for questions and timers. The Dot in the BR is used for questions. We use Siri for questions. We have a significant number of HomeKit devices. Siri and Alexa are both used to control them. Siri control of the devices is much more comprehensive than Alexa's Some examples on the Lutron bridge, Siri does shades Alexa does not. On the Phillips bridge, Siri does color, Alexa does not.

Here voting my brother (can't stand Siri lol). We are both total Apple, Mac, AppleTV's, iPhone households and I'm tech support. One of my things to do was set up an Alexa her received as a gift a couple of months ago. So I download the Alexa app, setup the unit. Start off easy and ask the weather. Alexa gives weather. The he asks it to play music, he says play Blake Shelton - Alexa doesn't understand, we laugh. He asks another question, I forget and Alexa didn't get it. He turns to me and says, so it's just like Siri. We both laughed. He gives Siri a D, it never works for him. I give Siri a C. And Alexa is sitting in a corner. Brother is really upset it can't do movies and play it on the Samsung Smart TV he has. For me Siri is one of Apples biggest embarrassments. Oh yeah, Alexa did answer on an order delivery from Amazon question today though. "It's coming today". They all have a long way to go it be all that helpful. 0 3 days ago Reply DannyJJK I don't think Siri is one of Apple's biggest embarrassments, I use it daily and it's really useful for me, but it seems to greatly vary in quality from person to person. I guess the biggest problem with voice recognition is everyone speaks differently and there's tons of different languages and dialects, so it works great for some but terrible for others. I'm sure Apple is working heavily on getting it working better for everyone, though 1 3 days ago Reply rchapman80 I will agree more with JustMeWhoElse. I've used three of the four major virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google) and I have found that Siri never understands me, can't answer my questions, constantly gives me directions to the wrong place etc. What good is having a virtual assistant with you at all times when they never work right. I never use her or try any more. I WOULDN'T call Siri Apple's biggest embarrassment but I also beleive that it isn't anything for Apple to be extremely proud of. In my opinion, in much less time Alexa has surpassed Siri in just about anything. Alexa from almost day one supported all my home automation (Wink, Nest, Z-Wave). She can access many more apps or music lists such as Spotify, Tunein, pandora etc. not just open them. She is by no means perfect! As Rene stated, I can't take her with me. Sometimes when watching TV or just talking to me wife she will go off. My daughters name sounds very similar to Alexa (Eliza) and sometimes when using her name it would go off. Obviously we changed my daughters name (just kidding). Alexa now goes by Amazon. We do enjoy Siri on our Apple Tv but overall I'm disappointed with Apple's implementation for my use case.

Siri is last which isn't even surprise and Apple should be ashamed that they put their users thru the crap that Siri is. Alexa and Google are both great, Google more because they have more contextual data and be more useful. But man Amazon is putting a lot of effort on Alexa skills. But I still believe in Google and Apple eventually to take this forward. Google because they are Google and great at everything, and Apple because they have such a rich ecosystem and I believe they will eventually make Siri more intelligent and atleast do 90% of what others do. Cortana is good as well but they have the disadvantage of not being a first party voice app on mobile platform.

Apple Plans to Adopt OLED Displays Across All iPhones by 2019 GO A report says that upcoming iPhones will have OLED screens Mar 6, 2017 14:00 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Apple is expected to feature a 5.8-inch OLED display on its upcoming iPhone 8, while the other two phones set to launch this year will have IPS LCD screens. A new report from Patently Apple says that the company plans to use OLED displays in all iPhones by 2019. Reportedly, Apple will use three Korean suppliers for flexible circuit boards for the iPhone 8. Apple is expected to equip about 60 million iPhones with OLED screens and double the adoption next year. It also intends to use OLED for all of its new iPhones by 2019. This would mean that the upcoming iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will be the last iPhones to feature IPS LCD displays, before Apple switches to OLED completely. However, the report should be taken with a grain of salt, considering that the source is an individual supplier and Apple doesn’t disclose long-term strategies to supply partners. iPhone 8 will have a 5.8-inch OLED display Multiple recent reports have pointed to the fact that the upcoming iPhone 8 will have the largest display out of the three Apple phones expected to be announced this year. The iPhone 8 will be the first to feature an OLED display and will ditch the physical home button. There’s also information that it might feature a function area for replacing the home button and accommodating an edge-to-edge screen on the new phone. The actual usable screen will be about 5.15 inches, while the rest will be represented by the function area. The iPhone 7s will have a 4.7-inch LCD display, while the iPhone 7s Plus will be slightly larger at 5.5 inches. Apple’s iPhone 8 will also feature a revolutionary front-facing camera capable of producing 3D selfies and providing face recognition features for unlocking the phone. The camera sensor will replace the Touch ID, while a fingerprint scanner is expected to be built into the display. #Apple#iPhone 8#OLED display#LCD screen#iPhone 7s subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple iPhone 8 to Feature a Redesigned Fingerprint Sensor Apple's 2017 iPhones to Feature Lightning Ports, Not USB Type-C Apple’s Next iPhone Could Come with AR Features - Report Fingerprint Wars: iPhone 8 Makes More Sense than the Galaxy S8 in So Many Ways Third-Party Windows Updates Kind of Risky, Security Expert Says Google May Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jacks on Next Pixel Phones AMD Rolls Out Its New Crimson ReLive Graphics Driver - Get Version 17.3.1 Google Play Celebrates Five Years, Here Are the Most Downloaded Games and Apps Samsung Confirms Delay of Android Nougat Update to Galaxy S6 and S6 edge Third-Party Windows Updates Kind of Risky, Security Expert Says Google May Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jacks on Next Pixel Phones AMD Rolls Out Its New Crimson ReLive Graphics Driver - Get Version 17.3.1    iPhone 8 concept new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments New Noncombustible Battery with Three Times More Power Is Under Development more on: Battery i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Cook is telling his employees to â€œkeep moving forward.â€ (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) By Ethan Baron | ebaron@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: March 6, 2017 at 5:00 am | UPDATED: March 6, 2017 at 1:18 pm That shiny new iPhone may say “assembled in China” on the back, but its origins are scattered around the world: wafers from Taiwan, modem chips and batteries from South Korea, displays from Japan, components from Europe and raw materials from Africa, Asia, Europe and the U.S. Now that complicated supply chain may put Apple — the world’s most valuable company — in the bull’s eye as President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans consider sweeping import tariffs or a comprehensive border tax on incoming products, components and raw materials. But while Apple has been singled out by Trump before, the administration’s actions would affect a who’s who of the Bay Area’s big name tech companies — which could see sales, revenue and access to global talent take a hit from new fees and the trade wars that could follow. “It’s a real mess,” said Marcus Noland, senior vice president at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington, D.C., think tank that supports free trade. Only two months into the Trump administration, it’s difficult to discern how an import tariff or border tax might take shape, but the president has said he wants to punish U.S. companies that make goods overseas to sell back home. Imposing new costs on imports would encourage domestic manufacturing and create jobs, Trump has argued. While campaigning, Trump mentioned a 45 percent import tariff on goods from China and 35 percent on imports from Mexico. More recent reports suggested the Trump transition team was looking at a 10 percent fee. House Republicans, meanwhile, have proposed a 20 percent “border adjustment tax” covering all imports from all countries. The list of firms with the most to lose from an aggressive new tariff or tax regime includes the valley’s biggest names: Google, Tesla, Oracle, HP, Cisco, Intel, Seagate, Western Digital, Nvidia, Marvell Semiconductor and more. Also standing to lose? Consumers who will inevitably have the increased costs from import tariffs or a tax passed on to them, according to experts. “You and I are going to pay for it,” said Georgia Tech professor John Vande Vate, who studies supply chains. However, others believe imposing higher import costs would deliver significant benefits. Northwestern University law professor Steven Calabresi last week said the proposed 20 percent border adjustment tax would “encourage Americans to buy American products” and “promote good jobs here in the United States” while raising $1 trillion over 10 years. “It will allow us to cut income taxes, which discourage people from working. It is smart to discourage a little bit of the buying of foreign goods if you can then cut income taxes and get people back into the workplace or get them to work harder,” he said Thursday in an op-ed in The Hill. var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([’embed’]); Still, tariffs or a tax would also hit countries like China that export to the U.S., potentially leading to trade wars with nations whose markets and raw materials are critical to tech companies. “If we decide to impose tariffs or high barriers to trade on our trading partners we should expect reciprocal trade barriers, which of course is not good for our industries, it’s not good for prices, and the whole thing spirals downward,” said Renee Bowen, a Stanford University Graduate School of Business professor who studies international trade. Generally, when tariffs drive prices up, sales go down, said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a tech-focused think tank. The tech industry has long depended on a complex global network of suppliers, workers and materials. Apple, for example, noted in its most recent quarterly report that its manufacturing is concentrated among a small number of suppliers in Asia. “Everything that is in our products comes from overseas,” Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman told CNBC in February. “That supply chain has taken 30 years to set up. So when all those components come in and are taxed, it’s not going to be good. This does not create jobs. It actually lowers the number of jobs for many, many companies.” HP makes printers and PCs in China, while Cisco, Seagate and Western Digital manufacture products there and in Thailand, according to analyst Handel Jones of International Business Strategies in Los Gatos. Google’s new Pixel phones are made by HTC in Taiwan, where Santa Clara’s Nvidia and Marvell Semiconductor buy chips that power products sold in the U.S. The Home virtual-assistance device by Google is made in China, and the company relies on Taiwanese firm Quanta to supply the servers that make it a cloud-services titan. Facebook also buys servers from Quanta, according to analysis firm Moor Insights & Strategy. Intel has fabrication and assembly plants in China, and assembly facilities in Malaysia and Vietnam. It’s not just companies making tangible products that are at risk. Even a software-and-services company like Oracle is vulnerable to tariff-related retaliation, because it has invested heavily in providing IT services in China, where its clients include state-owned enterprises. The Chinese government, on top of potentially responding tit for tat to tariffs or taxes, could bar state-owned companies from doing business with U.S. firms, said the Peterson Institute’s Noland. Companies that make some products in the U.S. won’t escape, either. They too would be vulnerable to an all encompassing import levy, such as the proposed border adjustment tax, because they use materials or parts from other countries. While only Congress can levy across-the-board tariffs, a U.S. president has “limited authority” to impose tariffs in response to “special circumstances involving discrimination against U.S. exports or other unfair trade practices,” said John Veroneau, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who served as deputy U.S. trade representative under President George W. Bush. Trump has complained that other countries make the U.S. pay high tariffs and taxes on American products shipped overseas. The president’s focus on China and Mexico targets two nations that play critical roles in the supply chains for major U.S. electronics firms, so high import tariffs aimed at those countries would “immediately disturb the supply networks,” Noland said. Retaliatory tariffs would mean American companies could be faced with added costs for shipping high-end, U.S.-made components to China or Mexico for final assembly, before getting hit again when they import the assembled products back into the U.S., Noland said. A full-blown trade battle with China could lead to a “supply chain war” in which the Asian nation bans exports to the U.S. of the metallic elements used in electronics manufacturing, which would “hurt U.S. electronics firms,” a September report from the Peterson Institute said. China could potentially ban the sale of specific American tech products, claiming security issues and saying, for example, “You can’t sell Apple phones in China, because we’re worried about — and then they’d make something up,” Georgia Tech’s Vande Vate said. Conflict between the U.S. and China over trade could spread to other areas, potentially affecting American firms’ access to Chinese talent, Noland said. “A trade war that started with products,” Noland said, “could spill into things like visas and immigration issues, which would disadvantage the entire high tech sector.” ___________________________________________________________ Other threatened companies and their products Tesla has a long-term contract to buy lithium mined in Mexico for the batteries it makes domestically. Cisco announced last year it was expanding manufacturing in Mexico, where it has operated since 1993. HP has production facilities in Mexico, according to market-intelligence firm BNamericas. Bay Area companies SanDisk and Intel are among semiconductor companies make chips domestically that are sent to Asia to be wired up for installation onto circuit boards that are imported back to the U.S., according to Georgia Tech professor John Vande Vate.   Tags:  Apple Cisco Donald Trump Google tariff Technology Ethan Baron Ethan Baron is a business reporter at The Mercury News, and a native of Silicon Valley before it was Silicon Valley.

The best sleep tracking apps for Apple Watch and iPhone The top stories of the week on iDB LiberTV jailbreak for Apple TV 4 running tvOS 9.1-10.1 released   skip to main content skip to main menu     The best sleep tracking apps for Apple Watch and iPhone By Steffen Reich, Mar 6, 2017 Tweet 13 Comments Tracking your sleep routine can often lead to insights into all sorts of habits or quirks detrimental to a good night’s sleep. Before Apple Watch, apps promising to analyze your nightly resting patterns and devise remedies to improve on them were already plentiful. Yet after the release of the wrist-worn gadget, a new surge in the category ensued for its ease of use on watch and enhanced precision in measuring body movements at night. In order to single out the creme de la creme of applications, we have put through their paces both standalone sleep trackers on iPhone and an array of apps requiring the assistance of Apple Watch. No matter if you rock iPhone and Apple Watch together or solo, find out below which sleep trackers are worthwhile your time and money. The best sleep trackers for iPhone To cover all the bases we have contrived two sections: the first one is going to be dedicated to iPhone only applications whereas the subsequent one will revolve around all sleep trackers harnessing the power of iPhone and Apple Watch. If you’re here for Watch apps and don’t regard the first half as exhaustive, do make sure to read on as many of the watch compatible apps also function on their own. Sleep Cycle Alarm Clock Sleep Cycle Alarm Clock is one of the most comprehensive apps in the field, posing an effective merger of alarm clock and sleep tracker. Notwithstanding their ultimate goal to get you hooked on the premium subscription service, the basic offer is available entirely free of charge to you, and that one alone is conceptualised well enough to make the cut. Sleep Cycle Alarm Clock not only looks elegant but also houses a bevy of features such as intelligent alarms (so as not to rattle you when you are in a deep sleep phase) in the morning. The flagship feature however is the sleep tracking, for which Sleep Cycle Alarm Clock in fact offers two different methods of motion detection: your iPhone’s accelerometer or the microphone. This in itself is pretty unique since most iPhone apps are designed exclusively around the device’s accelerometer, a trend bucked by Sleep Cycle Alarm Clock who claim to have pioneered a microphone based technology that obtains more precise results. On top of that, it is also advertised as superior to the accelerometer in a double bed environment. UI wise the colors and animations are chosen well and when activated at night, your iPhone’s wake screen fades in and out softly and very easy on the eye. Some of the more elaborate statistics are sadly hidden behind the premium subscription fee ($29 a year), but your arm isn’t twisted too badly by the developers at Northcube as the free ones sure enough fulfil their job. If you’re in the market for a sleep tracker that does not have to sit in the corner of your mattress while you sleep, this is one of the best out there. Device support: iPhone, iPad Notable features: Microphone motion detection, intelligent alarms, sleep quality and activity analytics (Premium) Cost: Free (in-app subscription service at $29 per year) Good Morning Alarm Clock Good Morning Alarm Clock’s offering closely mirrors what has already been discussed, however with two interesting points of difference that make for a slightly different flavor at large. For one, the home screen comprises an alarm clock and a weather extension, making the hub of the app somewhat more informative. Upside number two comes in the form of an under the hood feature that should be regarded indispensable by anyone (but unfortunately is not): HealthKit integration. On the flip side, there is a sizeable amount of in-app ads clogging the free version of Good Morning Alarm Clock (the App Store has a paid-for pendant if you grow fond of it) and the only viable method to detect your nightly motions is by way of your iPhone’s accelerator. I’m not slating the technique, it’s just nice to have choices. Device support: iPhone, iPad Notable features: HealthKit Integration, Weather extension, Intelligent alarms Cost: Free By and large you have two solid options in Sleep Cycle Alarm Clock and Good Morning Alarm Clock, two apps that are similar enough to be mentioned in the same breath but at the same time different enough for two seperate entries. Honorable Mention Stock Clock App: Bedtime Despite the somehow differing value proposition, we can’t brush past this one without at least mentioning it. Since the introduction of iOS 10, Apple has seriously ramped up their own efforts at providing guidance for healthy sleeping habits. As a consequence, the bedtime feature inside your stock Clock app now boasts smart bedtime alerts and morning alarms based on your desired sleep duration. It also has a tentative go at sleep analytics, which tie nicely into your Health app. If you’re satisfied with an assistant that pushes you towards a healthier sleep cycle this could be up your alley, but don’t expect it to supplant a refined sleep tracker app. Find out more about Bedtime here. The best sleep trackers for Apple Watch With Apple Watch, the days of carefully planting your iPhone on the mattress are over. In fact in many cases your iPhone is no longer required at all, until you want a closer look or breakdown of your accrued sleep stats that is. Such being the case, here are the best trackers available on both iOS and watchOS that work in tandem to shoulder the workload intelligently. Sleep++ Condensed in one word, Sleep++ is minimalist. This is a good thing in a sea of apps clamoring for your details, your money or even third party tracking devices that exclusively work with the sleep tracker you just downloaded. Sleep++ does away with all the clutter and delivers an experience stripped to the bare minimum, but in doing so, fashions a reliable symbiosis between watch and iPhone plus easy to read statistics. If you are quick to worry about your watch’s battery life, you will appreciate the fact that Sleep++ launches and tracks completely disconnected from your iPhone, meaning you can toggle on Airplane Mode before starting your snooze and your watch will emerge relatively undrained in the morning. Start and finish your sleeping session on your wrist and at the next opportunity, your watch will transmit the data recorded to your iPhone for a pretty simplistic but sufficient visualization of your night. The implications of minimalist in this instance are no weekly analytics or trends, no heartbeat monitoring and also no notifications or widgets on your iPhone. It does however tie nicely into HealthKit, which is the minimum bar to clear considering Apple’s push for Health in iOS 10. Provided you feel as if you can forego some fancier metrics and chiefly care for an assessment on how steady a sleeper you are, this is a perfect starting point at no cost. If you want to support the developer and purge the app of (fairly minor) ads, you can flick that switch for $1.99. Device support: iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch Notable features: HealthKit integration, lets you use Airplane Mode on watch Cost: Free (in-app purchase $1.99) Sleep Diary In terms of feature density, Sleep Diary is a whole different animal. While the mechanics of the tracking process remain the same (start and stop your bedtime manually on your watch), the core function is embedded in a slew of complementary features ranging from dispensable to pretty quintessential. On the negligible end of the scale we can find stuff like a bedtime countdown widget for your iPhone, which will strike most as a little gimmicky, then again on the other end of the aisle, Sleep Diary boasts sage settings such as wake up and bedtime alerts (pushed to your wrist) based on your set sleep duration and a box for ‘sleep onset latency’ – because most people don’t fall asleep without delay. Most importantly though, the watch is capable of capturing your heartbeat data in addition to the movement tracking, which makes for another enticing layer of data to analyze in the statistics. Sudden spikes in your heart rate at night can be indicative of various circumstances or conditions, and the ability to monitor that is hands down a big plus. Once on your wrist, the app also operates entirely disconnected from your iPhone. Whenever connected next, it will feed the app and HealthKit with the intel. There is very little to gripe about here, so let’s not grasp at straws just for the sake of it, especially considering Sleep Diary is available to download for free. If you want a comprehensive tracker that also helps you maintain a healthy sleep rhythm, by all means give this one a go. Device support: iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch Notable features: HealthKit integration, use Airplane Mode on watch Cost: Free Sleep Tracker (SleepMatic) Dipping our toes into sleep trackers hiding behind a paywall, SleepMatic ($1.99) sticks out for two defining reasons. Interestingly, these are features hard to find amongst the freebies hence if you can pony up the money equivalent to a cup of coffee, this investment will undoubtedly be the more wholesome one for your sleep. As far as hitting the ground running, paid-for apps are generally unmatched in their experience in that the minute they are downloaded, you are good to go. This holds true for SleepMatic too, which will not pry into your personal details or data but is ready to serve from the get-go. This positive aside, the two standout features here are automatic sleep tracking (meaning no manual start and stop sleep button on watch) and a movement sensitivity lever to better tailor the recorded data to your sleeping type for improved measuring accuracy. Both of these treats make SleepMatic a more effortless tracker in their own way: the perks of not having to remember enabling and disabling sleep tracking every night and morning respectively are self-evident, while scrubbing the sensitivity scale up and down can retrospectively edit results for the better or worse to precisely capture your sleep quality. To give you one example of how this works, when the app detected me waking up seven times (because I like to toss, turn and kick in my sleep) but I only recall two incidents, I can dial down sensitivity until that count has shrunken accordingly. This allows for continuous adjustments until you have found a sensitivity level that reconciles data and real life experience, something that will give you great confidence in future results. In addition to the showpiece features, SleepMatic keeps tabs on your heart rate as well. Furthermore it boasts a neat widget on your iPhone, bedtime alerts, works untethered on your watch (which displays a great deal of information) and of course also features seamless integration with HealthKit. Device support: iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch Notable features: Automatic sleep tracking, sensitivity settings, HealthKit integration, lets you use Airplane mode on watch Cost: $1.99 Pillow Pillow is visually stunning on both iOS and your Apple Watch, but it is more than just a pretty facade. Under the hood, Pillow offers solid sleep and heart rate tracking (however manually initiated every evening) and on top of that, an audio layer to record snoring or other anomalies at night. The utility of such feature strongly hinges on the type of sleeper, even so it can prove vital for users (unknowingly) suffering from pesky conditions like sleep apnea or less grave issues. Having this additional layer and the option to correlate noise spikes with your heart rate or sleep phases is straight up terrific. Next to noise recordings and the neat looks, Pillow promotes sleep goals and derives smart bed and wakeup times from it. Laudably, it bolsters a function called ‘sleep aid’ that will play calming sounds from your iPhone until your watch determines you have fallen asleep. By the same token, ‘smart wakeup’ functions conversely, ensuring the alarm will not go off before you have ascended from a deep sleep phase and entered the territory of light sleep. There are more whistles and bells (a sleep lab, power-nap mode, in-depth statistics, etc) available for an in-app purchase valued at $4.99 – yet the basic outfit of Pillow is more than serviceable on its own. As always, the service interlocks hassle-free with HealthKit and iCloud synchronisation is offered to relay your data to the even larger screen of your iPad. In turn, it passes on a widget for your iOS devices, which is not a major loss in our book as most apps haven’t been able to provide additional value through that window anyway. If you are not religiously opposed to creating a profile with Pillow (the downside of free apps) and want form over function, this one is absolutely worth a shot. Device support: iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch Notable features: Noise recording, sleep aid and smart alarm, HealthKit integration, Airplane mode on watch, power nap (premium). Cost: Free (in-app purchase $4.99) Honorable Mentions Sleep Watch ($4.99) Like SleepMatic, Sleep Watch does a great job at tracking and archiving your sleep all week around, and like SleepMatic it is going to cost you a little bit of money upfront. In this case we are talking about five bucks, which is why it took a back seat to the comparatively cheaper SleepMatic. Make no mistake though, this one is slick and if you’re unperturbed by the cost of it, you get the extremely convenient auto sleep detection feature (meaning no on/off switching every day), notifications on how you’re faring throughout the week and a neat watch face complication to round it off. Sleep Watch turns your Apple Watch into a very capable sleep tracker and should be worth a thought or two if you are serious about your sleeping habits. Cost: $4.99 SleepRate – Sleep Therapy (free)  At the onset, SleepRate was a sure candidate for the winners’ list, but during the time of testing, it occasionally failed to transfer data to the iPhone in the morning, which is naturally extremely frustrating. Whenever it works, the data provided on iPhone is great and offers a refreshing twist in that before and after starting the tracking on Apple Watch, you will have to answer a couple of questions on iPhone about naps and fatigue throughout the day and sleep quality after your night. This data is subsequently taken into account in the evaluation of your watch records and overall sleep ratings – a clever means to make the data more reliable and personal. Regrettably, your patience might start wearing thin if the data transmission fails repeatedly in the morning. If you’re a risk taker, try your luck. Cost: Free It ain’t over till the fat lady sings! The App Store has become a vessel filled to the brim with sleep related applications, some good, some absolute duds. The ones compiled above obviously only make for a small selection of apps – but at least we can vouch for their quality. With all that said, if you are counting on an app not discussed above or want to throw your support behind a particular one, let us know in the comments: what do you think is the best app to track your sleep? Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend Review: boost your sleep analysis with much improved Sleep++ 2.0 The best iMessage games The best flight tracker apps for iPhone The best exercise apps for Apple Watch Related Topics App Store Apps, Apple Watch, Apps, Best Apps, iPhone, Review, Sleep iBanks I’ve tried majority of these apps and the one not mentioned works best for me. App is kinda all over the place at trying to understand your data. Just needs an cleaner interface but no interaction needed to track sleeping. AutoSleep by Tantsissa. Chang in Charge I haven’t tried all of these just sleep cycle Alarm Clock but I’m also an AutoSleep user and I love the app. Interface definitely needs some work and the settings could be better explained. DD™ I currently use AutoSleep as well. It works well after a few tweaks, but you’re right, it could use a better UI. Calion Do any of these apps show the elapsed sleep time on the Sleep screen? I often wake up and wonder how much sleep I’ve had, and whether I should try to go back to sleep. Steffen Reich none of the iPhone apps tested provide you with a timer (I would assume for a reason) – plenty on the watch however do. Basically any app that requires you to manually flick the start/stop switch will. DT I prefer Heart Watch. DD™ Apple needs to develop a sleep app for the Apple Watch that is easy to use and “Just Works”. Anonymouse Apple won’t do it so long as the current battery life is an abysmal fail. Something current owners are not willing to accept/admit. Firedomain My watch (series 2) lasts me 2 days & 1 night! Although I use it less intensely than a lot of others. DD™ My Apple Watch battery last for well over a day, which is plenty unless traveling. Just bring a charger. Charges up super fast as well. So……. Apple needs to make a sleep app for the watch. Steffen Reich Agreed. Would be a nice to have. syldd Add AutoSleep to this list. You don’t even need to toggle anything to tell the app you’re asleep. It’s amazing, especially when paired with HeartWatch. Bertus Please add combination HeartWatch-Autosleep. It really works great but il would like a comparison between these other sleep trackers.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines These wire-free earbuds are an affordable AirPod alternative Daily Deals: 15% off iTunes gift cards, $75 Withings smart scale, and more Apple shares details about WWDC 2017 Scholarships Steve Jobs originally thought Genius Bar would never work iPhone 8 could release later than September   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: ClearBadges3DTouch10, HideMeX, LockGlyphX, & more… ByeByeHUD is another attempt to improve the iPhone volume HUD FolderUsage: see how much storage space is being used by apps within folders This tweak brings a touch of Android Nougat to your iPhone LockGlyphX puts a nice twist on your Touch ID unlocking experience iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2017.

Apple fans have been speculating about a historic model which will mark the tenth anniversary of the Apple’s phones. 3 This image shows some of the previous iPhone models Apple was expected to release the iPhone 8 in September 2017, in keeping with its annual autumn launch of major new products. It has three models, two successors to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus, as per tradition. But a third, pricier, anniversary device is believed to be on the cards too. The delay is down to its new fingerprint sensor, experts in the manufacturing world have revealed.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish All iPhones Rumored To Use OLED Screens In 2019 By Tyler Lee on 03/06/2017 05:16 PST We know that it is rather exciting to hear that after years, Apple will be finally making the shift to OLED screens for 2017’s iPhone. However the popular rumor right now is that only one model of the iPhone will use OLED this year, and that is the rumored 5.8-inch iPhone that will apparently sport a curved display as well. So does that mean that come 2018 we can expect Apple to make the full transition? Apparently not because according to a report from Patently Apple (via 9to5Mac) who cites a South Korean report, it seems that Apple will only be making the shift to use OLEDs for all of its iPhones in the year 2019, which means that next year we might still be seeing a mix of LCD and OLED iPhones from the Cupertino company. The report reads, “Apple is expected to adopt OLED for about 60 million units or 40 percent of the iPhone 8 this year and double the adoption next year. It aims to use OLED for all its new iPhones by 2019.” We have heard rumors dating back to 2015 that Apple might make the complete shift to OLED in 2018, but if this report is accurate, it seems that we might have to wait an additional year. However either way this doesn’t change the fact that we might still expect LCD iPhones this year that will be part of Apple’s “normal” lineup, with the OLED 5.8-inch iPhone expected to be part of the 10th anniversary iPhone, but until we hear from Apple officially, take it with a grain of salt for now.

The devices have proven to be quite a hit for the smartphone manufacturer, helping it reclaim its position as the top smartphone manufacturer in the world as of the beginning of February. We round up all the latest news about the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus so you can keep on top of everything happening in the Apple-verse.

Not only that, Get Reading has suggested it could be launching later this month at an as yet unannounced Apple event that could also see the release of a new iPad Pro and a higher capacity iPhone SE. This would be in keeping with Apple's usual March announcement, which is the only time it tends to launch new products apart from September. A red iteration of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus would be in support of Bono and Bobby Shriver's HIV/AIDS campaign, under the (RED) banner. Apple has taken part in the campaign for the last few years, alongside other companies such as Mophie, which makes a special edition red Juice Pack for the iPhone 7 already and Beats, another Apple-owned company, which has launched special edition headphones for the cause. The (RED) iPhones in the past haven't cost any extra, although companies involved are required to donate a proportion of the sales to the charity. 24/02/2017: Samsung isn't the only mobile maker with battery woes: Apple is now investigating an apparent battery fire on the iPhone 7 Plus. Video of a phone owned by a teenager in Arizona is making the rounds, showing the device smoking with a cracked body. So my IPhone 7 plus blew up this morning %uD83E%uDD17 was not even using it, literally no explanation for this pic.twitter.com/sQ8CJt4Y69 — Bree%u2728 (@briannaolivas_) February 23, 2017 The iPhone owner had brought the device into an Apple Store the day before the incident, complaining that it wasn't turning on. It started to smoke while plugged in to charge next to her as she slept. Apple has reportedly said it's in touch with the customer and looking into the incident. While there have been reports of other iPhone 7 Plus batteries overheating, the handset has been on sale since September with few such complaints, suggesting the issue may be a few flawed or damaged batteries, rather than a widespread fault like that seen by Samsung. 09/11/2016: Apple's new iPhone 7 came with a new choice of colour, 'Jet Black', which gives the smartphone a glossy appearance, thanks to a nine-step process that includes anodisation and polish. This new colour was extremely popular among iPhone 7 customers, despite reports that it was extremely delicate and could be damaged fairly easily. According to a report written by the Japanese publication Mac Otakara, Apple could be considering whether to add a new 'Jet White' colour to those available for iPhone 7 smartphones. Demand for Apple's new device is particularly high, with many customers still waiting to receive their iPhone 7, particularly in the new Jet Black colouring, and in its Plus version. On October 25, during a conference call with analysts, Apple chief financial officer Luca Maestri said: "Worldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 Plus." Apple's new flagship smartphone was launched on 16 September and comes with new features such as dual camera and wireless headphones connected to the phone through a new system called lightening. Other colours for the iPhone 7 include silver, normal black, gold and rose gold matte. 27/10/2016: Several websites are offering iPhone users in China the possibility to purchase 'iPhone makeover kits', false cameras and dust plugs that hide the headphone jack, to make an iPhone 6 or 6s look like the new iPhone 7. Several iPhone users are buying these items and re-vamping their old Apple devices instead of buying the new flagship model. Should this trend spread, it could be detrimental for Apple, which is hoping the new device will help boost its sales. This mirrors the popular opinion among Chinese Apple users that iPhone 7 is not innovative enough to prompt them to buy it. A Beijing-based sales worker told Tech 2 he was getting a Shenzhen firm to replace his iPhone 6's case, saying: "I don't have the money to upgrade, and the (iPhone) 7 is just so-so." On Tuesday, Apple's last quarterly statement showed a decline in iPhone sales globally, with Greater China's revenue down by 30% to $8.79 billion. Counterpoint analyst Neil Shah said: "The iPhone 7 series should help Apple regain lost (China) market share as demand is tracking better than for the iPhone 6s series. Apple needs to offer something cutting-edge to appeal to maturing Chinese smartphone users who are warming to local brands." 10/10/2016: Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak said he now thinks the new Lightning audio port on iPhone 7 was a good idea, in an interview with TechRadar. In August, Wozniak told The Australian Financial Review that he believed dropping the headphone jack would "tick off a lot of people". However, he has since changed his mind, and he said: "Not that many people used it, I never used it. For those who do use it, you can buy a little adaptor dongle." Wozniak also had a change of heart in regards to the Apple Watch. "I've come to like my Apple Watch more... I use it enough in my life for things...I enjoy using it and having it. And when I don't use it, I don't even know it's there," he told TechRadar. In March, the Apple co-founder had expressed his scepticism about the wearable in a post on Reddit. The post read: "I worry a little bit about- I mean I love my Apple Watch, but - it's taken us into a jewelry market where you're going to buy a watch between $500 or $1100 based on how important you think you are as a person. "The only difference is the band in all those watches. Twenty watches from $500 to $1100. The band's the only difference? Well this isn't the company that Apple was originally, or the company that really changed the world a lot." Wozniak engineered Apple 1, the first home computer with keyboard and TV screen as a display. While Steve Jobs took care of the creative aspect of Apple products, Wozniak was the mind behind the construction of Apple's first computers and devices. 30/09/2016: An iPhone 7 has reportedly exploded during delivery, prompting fears that Apple's flagship may be suffering similar battery problems to the ill-fated Samsung Galaxy Note 7. One customer received their device only to discover that it appeared to have caught fire and exploded while en route, according to colleague and Reddit user 'kroopthesnoop'. They posted photos of their coworker's destroyed iPhone, noting that they're "not certain" what happened but adding, "something happened between the factory and delivery". The pictures show that the iPhone was discoloured, partially melted and with the screen coming away from the chassis. The unit bears a strong resemblance to the Note 7 models which overheated and exploded, an incident which prompted Samsung to initiate a full recall of the device. However, unlike the Note 7, this fault does not appear to be affecting numerous devices. Apple did not respond when asked if multiple customers had reported similar issues. 26/09/2016: Research firm GfK has revealed iPhone 7 sales were lower than expected, saying sales of both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were down 25 per cent year-on-year. If GfK's numbers are right, that means Apple shifted less than 10m iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets between September 16th and 19th. However, unlike previous years, Apple didn't release its own sales figures for the iPhone 7 on its launch weekend, explaining in its statement it was due to distribution complications rather than negative shipment results. "In years past, we've announced how many new iPhones had been sold as of the first weekend following launch. But as we have expanded our distribution through carriers and resellers to hundreds of thousands of locations around the world, we are now at a point where we know before taking the first customer pre-order that we will sell out of iPhone 7. These initial sales will be governed by supply not demand, we have decided that it is no longer a representative metric for our investors and customers. Therefore we won't be releasing a first-weekend number any longer. We are reiterating the financial guidance for the September quarter that we provided on July 26." However, Apple said it was expecting the same amount of interest from consumers in the launch weekend because it was allowing preorders a week before it was available from stores. Last year, Apple sold 13m iPhone 6S and 6S Plus devices over the launch weekend compared to 10m iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus devices in 2014. 14/09/2016: The iPhone 7 has already broken pre-order records, according to US mobile networks. Wireless carrier T-Mobile announced that once presales opened on 9 September, the iPhone 7 set a single-day sales record, more than any other smartphone ever sold by the company. Sprint also announced that iPhone 7 and 7 Plus preorders increased by around 375% over the first three days of availability, when compared with last year’s 6s and 6s Plus. This demand was mirrored in the UIK, where the iPhone 7 launch spurred the biggest one-day spike in UK traffic to Apple’s website that the site had ever seen. According to digital market intelligence firm SimilarWeb, the site received a 235% boost in visits on the iPhone 7’s launch day. 07/09/2016 update: The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have both launched today at Apple's special event in San Francisco. They have a new home button with force touch and taptic feedback, an A-10 chip, which makes them both faster and more battery efficient than their predecessors, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, and have a brighter, higher-resolution screen. The worst-kept secret in tech - that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will have no 3.5mm headphone jack - was also confirmed. As expected, the devices will use the lightning connector as an audio output and will ship with a pair of lightning EarPods. The company is also launching a set of wireless "AirPods" (EarPods with no physical connector) in October, but they will cost £159. Another widely rumoured feature – a dual lens rear camera – also turned out to be true. However, it is only available on the iPhone 7 Plus, not the iPhone 7. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus are available in five colours - Rose Gold, Gold, Silver, (shiny) Jet Black and (matte) Black. Both smartphones are available to pre-order from 9 September and ship on 16 September when they also hit shelves in retail stores. iOS 10, which the devices will run on, is available to download from 13 September. 07/09/2016: It's iPhone 7 launch day! The iPhone 7 and its big brother, the iPhone 7 Plus, are set to be announced today at a special launch event in San Francisco, amidst much fanfare. Rumours so far indicate the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will look identical to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, with a handful of new features - some controversial, others a little more mainstream. Last night, a leak from Apple's own store showed the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus listed as compatible devices for some accessories, including the company's new EarPods. Recent rumours suggest Apple will scrap the 3.5mm headphone port and instead insist people use Bluetooth to connect or be forced to buy an adaptor so they fit into the device's Lightning port. It also may introduce a pressure-sensitive home button that won't have moving parts like the iPhone, which will also help it be more waterproof too. The camera may be upgraded too, with storage options ranging from 32GB to 256GB. Additionally, while the iPhone doesn't normally go on sale the same day it's announced, IT Pro sources have indicated it is likely to be in UK shops from 19 September. You can find out how to watch the event, plus follow our live blog from 5.30pm UK time, at our dedicated page. Continue reading to find out the iPhone 7's release date and price iPhone 7 release date The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus launched at Apple's Special Event on 7 September, and both go on sale in the UK on 16 September. Pre-orders are available from 9 September. iPhone 7 UK price The iPhone 7 will cost upwards of £599, and the 7 Plus upwards of £719. The prices are higher than the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus were when they launched (£539 and £619 respectively), but Apple has doubled the phones' storage capacities from 16GB, 64GB, and 128GB to 32GB, 128GB and 256GB. However, like-for-like prices have jumped: the iPhone 6 128GB model was priced at £699 at launch, and the iPhone 7 128GB model price is the same. But while the 6s Plus launched at £789, the iPhone 7 Plus 128GB model is £30 more expensive, at £819. Apple hasn't given a reason, but it is thought Brexit may have pushed the price up, after the UK's decision to leave the EU caused sterling to plummet in value. OnePlus raised its phone price from £309 to £329 in response to Brexit. Apple has also scrapped the 16GB models of the 6s and 6s Plus, and added a 256GB option for the 7 and 7 Plus. Check out our pricing table below for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus UK prices. iPhone 7 32GB £599 iPhone 7 128GB £699 iPhone 7 256GB £799 iPhone 7 Plus 32GB £719 iPhone 7 Plus 128GB £819 iPhone 7 Plus 256GB £919 iPhone 7 best deals If you’re happy to sign up to a 24-month contract for your iPhone, networks are furiously competing with each other to offer the best deals available, with inclusive minutes and texts, a variety of different data options and extra perks such as free music subscriptions or inclusive roaming abroad. Three Although Three’s tariffs are by no way the cheapest per month, they do offer more data, minutes and unlimited texts. For example, opt for a mammoth 4GB data for the 32GB iPhone 7 and you’ll pay just £38 a month, although there is a £149 upfront cost. For the 128GB version, this increases to £43 a month, with the same £149 upfront, while the 256GB version will only cost an extra £5 a month - for all that extra storage! As is usually the case, the best prices are for two-year contracts, so although long-term, they’re the most manageable on a monthly basis. O2 If you’d rather pay a lot less upfront, but are happy paying a bigger monthly fee, O2’s tariffs could be just the biscuit. Starting at just £39.99 upfront for the 32GB iPhone 7, this network’s cheapest tariff is £60 a month. But that will give you an absolutely ridiculous 30GB a month data, meaning you can probably scrap your broadband too. For a more sensible, everyday option, you can pay the slightly higher fee of £59.99 upfront and then £46.50 a month if you think you’ll only use 3GB data a month That same tariff for the 128GB version will add an extra fiver onto the monthly cost, while upping the capacity to 256GB will set you back £56.50 a month, with the handset costing a tenner cheaper at £49.99 upfront. EE EE’s forte is 4G network coverage and as you’d expect, all of its iPhone 7 plans come with 4G support. Like O2, EE is focussing on cutting the upfront cost of the iPhone 7 in order to attract those who’d rather pay for the majority of their device over a two-year period. For example, £55.99 a month will get you the 32GB iPhone 7, 7GB data, unlimited calls and texts, plus you’ll only need to pay £9.99 upfront. Upgrade to the 128GB iPhone 7 and you’ll pay £49.99 upfront, with monthly repayments of £55.99. OK, maybe not as attractive as the smaller capacity iPhone 7, but not a bad proposition if you’re after 5GB data. The best deal for the 256GB iPhone 7 will increase that upfront payment to £99.99 a month, but it’ll give you 10GB data for £60.99 a month. Vodafone Vodafone offers the most interesting added extras for anyone who likes a freebie. With the company’s Red bundles, you can opt to add on a NOW TV Entertainment Pass, Spotify Premium or Sky Sports Mobile TV package when you sign up, but beware - these add-ons come with a cost because the contract prices are some of the highest out there. The 32GB version is available from £32 a month, with a hefty £250 fee upfront, while the 128GB version ups this to £37 a month with £300 upfront. If you want to get your hands on the 256GB version, that’ll cost £42 a month with £320 when you sign up. These lowest tariffs will get you a tiny 500MB data, 500 minutes to UK phones and unlimited texts, which probably won’t even satisfy the average device user. GiffGaff If you want to buy the iPhone 7 upfront from Apple whether by paying the full £599-£799 or its pay monthly plan, GiffGaff offers the best rolling, SIM-only contracts to save you money over the lifetime of the device. The no-frills network is charging £20 a month for its tariff, which, if you add that onto the cost of the handset, turns out you’re paying between £1,079 and £1,179 over a 12-month period. iPhone 7 colours The iPhone 7 is available in five colours -  Jet Black, regular black, silver, gold and rose gold. The exclusive Jet black colour, which is a brand new colour for Apple, is only available in 128GB and 256GB iterations, presumably designed to exude luxury. It's a high-gloss finish produced using a nine-step anodisation and polishing process and although its surface is equally as hard as other anodised Apple products, the company warns its high shine might show up scratches more than the other colourways. It therefore suggests you hide the shiny surface away by slipping it into a case to protect the fragility surface - a bit pointless if you want to show off you have the brand new colour. In terms of pricing for the different coloured editions, they all enter the market at the same price, although it's possible retailers will reduce some of the more unpopular colours as the iPhone 8’s appearance approaches in order to get rid of stock. iPhone 7 features Jump to: iPhone 7 operating system iPhone 7 camera and photos iPhone 7 screen iPhone 7 Siri iPhone 7 operating system The iPhone 7 family will run on iOS 10, which is available for download from 13 September on other iOS devices. The advantage of iOS 10 is it will automatically protect against a recently discovered iPhone threat, dubbed Trident. Trident is particularly dangerous for companies with iPhone deployments, because once installed, it syphons off messages - encrypted or not - to the hacker who launched the attack. That means all data on a business device is at risk of being stolen. While Apple quickly addressed the vulnerability with a patch in iOS 9.3.5, not everyone will have downloaded it, but iOS 10 will include the patch too. iPhone 7 camera and photos The camera has become something of a flagship feature for Apple's smartphones and the iPhone 7 is no exception. The iPhone 7 sports a 12-megapixel camera, the same as the iPhone 6s, and offers three times longer exposure than its predecessor. It also lets 50% more light onto the sensor, which is 60% faster than the 6s's, too. Apple's image signal processor, which is the brains of the camera, uses machine learning to identify people and objects in photos and to set white balance. The processor is also capable of recognising a greater variety of colours, as well. While the iPhone 7's camera is a clear improvement on the last, it's the iPhone 7s camera that really catches the eye. For a start, it has two cameras - a wide-angle lens and a telephoto lens, allowing it to zoom up to 10x on a shot without compromising image quality. iPhone 7 display Compared to the iPhone 6s's screen, the iPhone 7 is 25% brighter, utilising a feature called Wide Color for the first time. Wide Color is Apple's term for DCI-P3, a range of colours that became a standard for digital movie projection in the US film industry. While both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have Wide Color, they lack True Tone (which the 9.7in iPad Pro does have). One of the biggest changes on the iPhone 6s was the 3D Touch screen - an advancement on the Force Touch technology seen on the Apple Watch and most recent MacBook. You'll be glad to know that 3D Touch has now made it to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.  3D Touch allows sensors below the screen to detect whether the user has applied a tap, a press, or a deep press. It is this deep press recognition that is used for Live Photos, as well as 'Peeks' which let you see previews of emails, websites and photos, and 'Pops', which let you open the full email, site or photo simply by pressing down harder. Siri Siri has been part of iPhone since 2010, but its appearance in iOS 10 brings a whole heap of updates to the six-year-old voice assistant, so it's cleverer than ever before. It already sits at the heart not just of iPhone, but also iPads, Apple TV and the company's burgeoning smart home ecosystem. But with iOS 10, Siri becomes a bigger part of many of your go-to apps. On stage, Craig Federighi showed how wider Siri support works: You can instruct it to "Send a WeChat toNancy saying I'll be five minutes late", for instance. By opening up Siri to third-party developers, Apple has made it more useful - it'll soon be present in WhatsApp, Uber, Lyft, Slack, Map My Run, Pinterest and more.

Mar 6, 2017 Reports say that the tech giant has recently entered talks to start an original TV business whatsapp facebook twitter google+ linkedin email Apple could be about to partner some of television and film's biggest companies to create original content to rival the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime.  According to the New York Post, the Cupertino-based tech firm has held talks with executives from Paramount Pictures and Sony to "kick-start a business in original TV programming".  See related  The Grand Tour: Giant Jeremy Clarkson head angers public New on Netflix: What's coming up in March? iPhone 8: Everything we know so far The meetings suggest Apple is "looking for a transformative acquisition" of a film or television studio rather than simply buying the rights to an existing TV series, says the paper. However, a source said executives may want to acquire an existing production house or studio first as creating a start-up company could be "too small" and "too hard".  The tech giant appears to be keen to build a portfolio of original content to compete with Amazon Prime Video and Netflix following the launch of its Apple Music streaming service in 2015.  Last year, it announced it would be releasing original episodes of James Corden's Carpool Karaoke for Apple Music subscribers. While details of the upcoming web series are scarce, Fortune claims it will air 16 half-hour episodes later this year. Video of Apple Music — Carpool Karaoke: The Series — Trailer Meanwhile, Amazon Prime has been growing its online video library with the likes of The Man in the High Castle and Jeremy Clarkson's new motoring show The Grand Tour. Similarly, Netflix has released original series such as The Crown, Stranger Things and House of Cards.  Rumours that Apple might launch an original TV series have "gained momentum" over the last couple of years, says MacRumors, although it has "shelved" similar plans in the past to focus on its App Store content.  Sign up for our daily newsletter Newsletter CloseSign me up Read more: Technology Apple Apple Music TV Amazon Prime Netflix TV & Radio You are here: Home Apple Music Is Apple taking on Netflix and Amazon with original content?

A supply-chain report out of Korea suggests that Apple is aiming to adopt OLED across all models by 2019. Amazon Prime, free delivery, free videos Patently Apple notes a South Korean report that says Apple is to use three Korean suppliers for flexible circuit boards for the iPhone 8, and that one of these has made the OLED claim. Apple is expected to adopt OLED for about 60 million units […] and double the adoption next year. It aims to use OLED for all its new iPhones by 2019. Apple’s complex supply-chain means that individual suppliers generally don’t have an accurate sense of the company’s plans, so the report should be treated with caution. That said, starting with one OLED iPhone this year and switching entirely to the display technology two years afterwards doesn’t seem too great a stretch. It’s been widely reported that Apple will adopt OLED in the iPhone 8, a premium model with edge-to-edge display, while sticking to LCD for an iPhone 7s and 7s Plus.

The iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus may not deliver super screen resolutions, but they hit the right notes for many buyers and with iOS 10 there are even more reasons the iPhone is better than Android for many users. iPhone competition includes the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, One Plus 3, the LG V20 and other phones that deliver a bigger challenge for Apple — but there are still places where the iPhone is clearly better than Android and iOS 10 is better than Android Nougat. Many of these could change with the Galaxy S8 and the LG G6 later this year, but for now – iPhone has an edge. You need to learn what the iPhone does better and how Apple delivers a better experience than Android to see if an iPhone is the best smartphone for you in 2017. Here are 15 reasons the iPhone is better than Android phones in 2017. Use our list of reasons the iPhone is better than Android to figure out which new smartphone you should buy this year. Read our iPhone 7 review to learn what sets this phone apart from the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. You can buy the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus at a discount with the best iPhone 7 Black Friday deals. Read: Siri Tips & Tricks Even if you think you know which phone is best, you might be surprised to learn about all the reasons the iPhone is better than Android. iPhone Apps Are First and Better Looking Most of the popular apps are on both platforms, but many top games and apps still come to iPhone first. We’re seeing more apps come to both Android and iPhone at the same time, but there are still way more iPhone only apps that we see than Android only. When apps are available on iPhone and Android we still often see a better design on the iPhone version than on Android. This is something that still rings true in 2017. For example, we still see some new Snapchat features and Spotify features come to iPhone before Android. iPhone owners are enjoying Super Mario Run, but the Super Mario Run Android app is still on the way. Read: Best iPhone Apps Apps are an area where the gap is closing, but the differences still exist and are noticeable. We also see Apple take better care of the App Store. Recently they purged 47,300 apps from the app store that were simply bad or abandoned. Fast iPhone Updates for All iPhone owners enjoy quick and regular iOS updates for the iPhone no matter what carrier they use. Faster updates are available for all iPhone owners. Android updates take months to arrive on all the devices. After an Android device is 18 months old, you may need to wait for a new Android smartphone to get the latest software. Apple delivers iPhone updates to devices that are three years old. Apple offers iPhone 4s iOS 9 support. It is unheard of to see support for an Android phone that old. iOS 10 is available for the iPhone 5. When you look at Android devices support ends much faster. Google promises at least two years for Nexus devices, which means Nexus 6 support ends this fall and the Nexus 6P in September 2017. Google may push farther out, but it is not a guarantee. Other Android device manufacturers don’t typically match the longevity of iOS updates. On top of the added update support, Apple does not allow carriers to hold up the updates. As soon as the update is available from Apple it is available on every carrier. If you really want Android Nougat, you may need to simply buy a new Android phone. Works Great with All Your Devices If you own an iPhone, iPad and Mac your information flows smoothly from one device to the other. You can quickly sync photos to all of your devices, answer a phone call on your iPad or Mac and send text messages from your other devices. There is also support for Handoff that allows you to start a task on your iPhone and continue on your iPad or Mac. The iPhone works great with the iPad and Mac. Overall the connectivity between these devices is something Android doesn’t yet match without relying on a collection of third-party applications and services to hodgepodge together a similar feature. Sharing a file from your iPhone to your Mac is also faster and easier thanks to AirDrop. This built-in service sends the file wirelessly directly to the Mac, even when there is no other WiFi around.

You simply can’t go wrong. I own an iPhone 5, iPad Mini 3, MacBook Pro, iMac, and Apple TV. I would not even consider anything else, especially something from that “G…” company which I abhor. I won’t even use their search engine. Same goes for anything from that software manufacturer that, well, just call it “MS). Try calling any other manufacturer for support and see if you can understand what they are saying. I suppose I am bias toward Apple but after nearly 30 years of dealing with computers of all sorts I guess my opinion is warranted. 07/17/2015 gabe Reply why people like iphones? I never understood why anyone would like to give control to another company of what you do with their device. why force u to follow MEDIA SHARING and digital rights media? you cannot torrent on iPhone, nor transfer music and videos without ITunes or a paid online service in iOS. I hate that Samsung s6 tried copying apple iPhone. no microsd slot and integrated battery. CMOn! 04/06/2016 Sai Reply You ever used apple ? 07/05/2016 greentoe Reply http://gtoe.me/l/7A0q-A-04r 02/27/2017 david Reply yea 03/04/2017 Evie Reply It is simply the portability. I have watch ,I go to the gym. I have apple computer and I can receive my phone calls there and iMessages. It crashes less often than microsoft does. I can contact apple support, whenever I want. The other time ,the bluetooth in my iPhone did not work, I contacted tech support midnight and they were available. We could not fix the problem. They called me the next day and told me to go to the nearest store and pick up a brand new phone. One more thing, my iPhone was out of warranty for 165 days. They told me they cared about customer satisfaction. When I called microsoft in order to talk to me they wanted $250. Now, compare 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply You’re literally so idiotic that you can’t spell the full name of a company. Only Apple, cuz you’re an I sheep. You can go very wrong. If people were smart these days, they would understand that iPhones are unequivocally not the right choice for them. You wouldn’t recommend anything else, because it is too limited and unintelligent to use anything else. Stop trying to influence other people to buy garbage phones and devices 05/12/2016 Nancy Reply Why are u being a hypocrite calling someone idiotic for not knowing how to spell the company name right when some of ur sentences don’t even make sense. Apple doesn’t have any competition be used it is the best phone to get. 07/13/2016 Rona Reply First of all, don’t criticize someone for calling someone else idiotic when you can’t even use proper spelling or grammar. Second, Apple is all marketing. There is nothing special about it. Android offers phones that have expandable memory (and guess who doesn’t?) and better high-speed data services. iPhones die extremely quickly, you can’t use iTunes on any other devices, whereas Android platforms are available on all devices, the picture quality on an iPhone is pathetic compared to Androids, and Apple products are majorly behind in technology. The latest update for an iPhone came out two years ago for an Android. Apple has a set array of things it can do, and you can’t customize or change that. But if you want a high-end technology phone, choose an Android. It does so much more and you can customize and change its features. I have had both an iPhone and an Android phone. 09/14/2016 Abhishek well,mam i am an android user and i would like to say that iphones are the best because when you buy an android first it will give you good performance but after one month it will start hanging and work slow and that is same with every android devices.and their are so many android malware which also affect performance. Iphones are the best, secure and stable. 09/15/2016 Me Stay butthurt, loser ; ) 12/04/2016 jgames “nothing special about it” fastest phone ever 3d touch very good camera looks very nice “nothing special about it” why do we need expandable memory on iOS? gime a few reasons for that. “better high-speed data” give me your source for all this information. iphones die extremely quickly? how? do you even have an iphone? iphones have much better standby and screen on time with heavy usage than android. you cant use itunes on other devices, yes, but ios wants to keep it ios exclusive because their services are one of the major selling points for them. android platforms are available everywhere, but google software is usually preferred to ios software. pathetic picture quality? wut? iphone pictures wont lose quality when you zoom in and support much more colors than any old android camera. android cameras are very nice as well, though. “apple are behind in technology” a lot of people say this but it’s actually quite the opposite. 3d touch was very innovative, its like a ‘right click’ for your phone. the latest iphone update did not come out 2 years ago. you seem like you have no idea what you’re talking about and just spouting nonsense. apple can do a lot of things without customization, but what customization do we really need? people always saying android is more customizable but never give examples, and when they do its “homescreen.” moving home screen icons around is a pretty useless feature tbh android isnt more high end tech than iphone and i dont see how much more it does. you havent even explained how it can in your comment. so please use common sense before spouting nonsense 02/27/2017 Gage iPhones are by far the better phone. I’ve had android phones for most of my life but i bought an iPhone 6 about a year ago and now I have the 7 and I can’t imagine going back. Android is slow, every button you push there’s a lag before it actually opens the app or whatever you pushed. Also, every android I’ve ever had has had terrible battery life, it never lasts the full day but my iPhone almost always does. And my last point, android automatically installs like 10-20 on your phone that you cannot delete no matter how hard you try. Apple has 3-5. Yes, android has a port for SD cards, but what good is that if a large amount of your memory is made up of apps you don’t want. You’re entitled to your opinion but I advise that you get yourself an iPhone 7 and keep an open mind. I’m fairly certain you realize how much better it is 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Not very nice. Also, Apple is just as good as Android, theres aspects that one company has over the other, and vice versa, so the best thing to do is just to test out both and find your favorite and use it because Android and Apple’s problems and advantages weigh out each other so it really just matters which one you like the most so just use the one u like and stop arguing. 08/19/2016 Zane Reis Reply I prefer Android because of the coustomization it has to offer. I prefer to be able to change change almost every aspect about my phone and making it the way “I” like it, not the way Apple likes it. I like the coustomization while others find it chaotic, confusing, and would rather it be (in their eyes) simpler. 05/26/2016 Billy Reply Says the one who has Zombie Knight as their username. 07/18/2016 Nate Pauley Reply That’s an interesting rather stupid mindset to have and it makes me reflect on the time I had those same views. It took me 6 years as an android user to eventually realise how inferior it is to iOS. Android is plagued with fragmentation, so much that not even customisation can save it. There should be a term that describes blindsided android followers, if there is one then I’d like to know it. iOS is solid, stable, secure and much more better looking than android – Apple pays exquisite attention to the finer details and they will continuously improve on the irritating nooks and crannies so many people mention in the comments. The best part is APPLE USERS CAN ACTUALLY BE A PART of the firmware updates and have assurance in a better OS experience overtime. I’ve had my S6 for a year and I’ve only managed to have one firmware update that took 7 months to deliver. I can only give credit to android for the premium android devices such as my S6, until then the physicality of a device alone cannot make me shift in the near future. I want a solid experience, not a hollow one. 08/02/2016 Adarsh Reply Hi, Your comparison of iphone with S7 is not right because in case of iphone both hardware and software are developed by Apple and in case of S7 developer of hardware is Samsung and developer of software is Google. I use Nexus 5 phone, hardware and software both developed by Google and manufactured by LG and ipad Air2 by Apple. Both devices update periodically whenever updates are released and I am happy with both. 09/15/2016 Me Reply LOL stay laughably buthurt/beyond tasteless loser Fandroid X ) 03/02/2017 xxLoser123xx Reply Wow you know how to use a Thesaurus. 03/06/2017 Sally Fallis Reply Wow! I AM impressed! You know about the Thesaurus!! I didn’t think anyone under 50 ever heard of it anymore! 12/17/2015 Noah Reply This comment, as well as this article are laughable at best. Coming from a person who owns all major Apple products but frequently bounces back and forth in the smartphone department, I don’t see how any of these actually make the iPhone “better” than android. I would say the only point that is valid is the support Apple has from app developers. It’s pretty easy to see that apps on the iPhone can be “prettier” than apps on android with the extra animations, and quick gestures. However even that is relative, since iOS gives you security and “pretty animations” but gives of freedom and functionality in the process. I still can’t tell you which phone is better, as that all is personal preference and I really don’t care which phone is “better”. I just want a phone that does what I want it to do without too many hiccups (which is why I’ll never buy another Samsung device). For now, I’d say in terms of productivity, the iPhone is great if you are a person who needs iMessage, FaceTime, and the Apple ecosystem to feel comfortable doing work. While I believe most android phones will get work DONE. With the amount of third party apps available to you on the play store, multi window, Google now on tap, and other gestures. I have always felt an android is phone is more a workhorse while the iPhone is king of simplicity. 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Congrats, you just wasted about 5-15 minutes of your time typing out this article because its not going to convince anyone. Just stick to the one you like best and live life. 05/25/2016 Blake Kersey Reply And what makes you think he gives a f$&# what you think?? 05/30/2016 hello Reply Unless you’re a billionaire you cannot stick to the pone that you wanto 07/30/2016 Avalanche Tsunami Reply Dude, he also has a “Android vs iPhone: 15 Reasons Android is Better” article too. So, he’s not being biased. http://www.gottabemobile.com/2016/05/26/android-vs-iphone-2016-android-better/ 11/10/2016 Pixleboy2 Just because he has another article doesn’t mean this one’s biased 01/30/2017 Selenia Thank you for that. This article and many commenters made me want to vomit thinking he was so biased and the sheep just followed along. I can give numerous reasons Android is a better OS, but that is not the point. However, some Android devices suck. Most of the detractors comments are true of stock Samsung devices. Samsung may be the most popular, but far from the best. They make pretty good hardware, but the software begs for rooting and custom ROMS. I am typing from a Nexus 6P, which is pure Android. Google does good with monthly updates, too. But I am using Pure Nexus, the best reason for owning a Nexus/Pixel device, with ElementalX kernel for out of this world stability, smoothness, flexibility, and battery life. Unless I use hotspot(tunneled over VPN), I only have to charge every 2 days under pretty heavy use. PN is actually updated more than Google’s stock and usually delivers security updates within a day of release, which is faster than Google often rolls it out to most users. 01/06/2016 Leo Keys Reply Why would someone else go with a product by Google, NVidia (I will come back to them), or Microsoft; over that “A…” Company (Repeat)? The reason people would use nVidia over the AMD (god I hate AMD’s Products) GPU’s found in Mac products? They want a more powerful GPU. Apple says that their “PC’s” are better and use top-notch products. Why don’t they use the GeForce GTX 980m in the MacBook Pro? Why don’t they use Quadro cards over FirePro cards? Because Apple doesn’t know anything about Graphics. As for iMac’s I have no clue why some use an i5. Apple products thermal throttle a lot. Android is secure with the right Antivirus programs. It is also much more free to do what ever you want. But, because your an iSheep, you can’t process facts that favor the other side of the grass. Guess your life must be happy, getting råpēd by Apple, every year and paying thousands on eye candy. Why use Google or Bing over Yahoo? Yahoo sucks, that’s why. Face the fact that Yahoo and other search engines are inferior to Google. Apple products are trash and are eye candy for white girls (Starbucks and that stuff). 01/06/2016 Pedro Coimbra Reply Now you have to bring the Nvidia/ATI war? What, the iphone/android isn’t enough for you? Dude AMD cards are equally powerful, no matter how much you “hate them”. Why Apple chose AMD? Maybe prices, power consumption, price/performance ratio, easier to adapt to their hardware, who knows? But a company such as Apple (you can write the complete name, it won’t bite you) so adept at optimization doesn’t make these decisions lightly, they HAVE a reason, one that you *don’t know*, but that’s irrelevant. About the i5, a reason for the apparent lower specs must be because of how streamlined and optimized the OS is, instead of being made to work with zillions of combinations of brands, boards, peripherals. So what you want in hardware to cope with the software, was made achieved with the fat-free software. «Android is secure with the right Antivirus programs», well I guess any system is secure with the right Antivirus programs, isn’t it? but never 100%. How about a system that doesn’t need antivirus, just a little inteligence from it’s user? Android safe… yes, keep dreaming, it’s not as the net isn’t filled with cases of security holes and breaches of android. If you reply to my I advise you right now to not bringing ATI/Nvidia stupid nerdish arguments or sheep mentality, about mobile platforms and geekinesses like that, because I simply don’t have the patience. P.s: «Apple products are trash and are eye candy for white girls» …. LOL… I’m trying to contain myself here… :D 04/21/2016 Vickie Reply I love you 🙌🏼 (apparently I am a white girl who loves Apple and Starbucks… I’m more of a Costa girl myself) 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Its based on opinion, Apple and Android are like XBox and PS4, they have advantages over each other and problems of their own, nothing is gained over arguing about it because recently Android has caught up to Apple so now its just up to personal preference because they are pretty much at the same level right now. 07/15/2016 quenchybro Reply why does everyone write a full on report about their opinion this is ridiculous 01/23/2016 Maestro Reply hhhh your gr8 especially last sentence 01/23/2016 Maestro Reply Last sentence especially Starbucks hhhhhhhh made me die of laugh 09/13/2016 bestdeals242 Reply Nice 03/21/2016 Matt Reply what search engine do you use Bing lol or internet explorer 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Who the F-Word uses Internet Explorer anymore 05/03/2016 Thomas Oglesby Reply Are you ok? Do you need help? The only reason you like them is because you a billable fanboy that refuses to try anything else, and just because it’s ridiculously expensive, you think it’s better. I feel bad for you and your Apple world 07/02/2016 popcorn Reply yeap http://gtoe.me/l/7A0q-A-04r 07/06/2016 applefanbois Reply You’re just a douche…applefanboi 07/25/2016 Lana Rae Reply Yes, you have just confirmed what the article ‘why do Americans hate Android and love Apple?’ says. Very sad….. 10/06/2016 Alon Reply Amazing, almost all whats written in the article is wrong. More apps with faster updates??? How can it be if 85 percent of the market is Android, and it much more easier to write an app to Android? It’s not making any sense and wrong. Also other things like sharing things and integration compared to Apple products only. Almost every line in this article is not right. 12/12/2016 Cjros Reply LOL, thank you for making me 100℅ sure that Android is way better than newest IOS. Your arguments are so poor and naive :). The only thing youve got right is the SD expansion, but it is not any issue at all :). Thank you, my hero :) 12/15/2016 Debapriyo Reply You are so dangerously biased towards Apple that some of your words make so sense and are outright stupid. I have no problems with you choosing an apple product but lol. You don’t use Google search engine? Then you are missing out. Their search engine is still the best and most reliable and miles ahead of other search engine options. Google Maps way better than Apple Maps. Every tiny feature Apple introduces in the new version of IOS, Google had it in android 2 years back. I myself love some Apple products and appreciate the high standards of quality they incorporate in their products but please don’t even compare Apple with Google. Apple just makes iphones, macbook and some fancy toys. Google makes much much more and is the spearhead of IT innovation today. Be a fanboy but don’t be an idiot. 06/23/2015 Chris H Reply Some of these reasons for being better than Android phones are oxymoronic. An extended warranty and readily available Apple Stores suggest that the iPhone is prone to bugs and damage. I will stick with my G3 because I know if I drop it it won’t shatter and I won’t have to give more money to Apple either for a case and/or a screen fix. There is a reason there aren’t Android stores out there. Because their phones don’t nearly have as many issues in my opinion. Consider Chevrolet and Honda. The Honda will last and is just as nice if not nicer than the Chevy, which will not last nearly as long and will force loyal customers to buy yet another Chevy. 07/27/2016 eiendiaies your_ufo Reply I would love to hear your comment now about your G3. Android stores are not because android companies dont give a f.ck about costumers, they just improve SPECS SPECS AND SPECS but where is NO improving quality. Why for example iphone 12 megapixel camera can beat sony xperia 23 megapixel camera, why iphone 1500 mah battery last longer than lg 3000mah, why fingerprint on iphone works much better than samsungs? And whats a practical difference between 640p vs 2k smartphone screen? Damn the real sheeps dont understand what apple cares about costumers and they stay at same screen resolutions because they just dont need to improve screens, android companies just keep adding numbers on specs. But where is quality improvment? You say iphone works better because of lower resolution screens, but than why androids keep improving resolutions but forget about older android users? I am ex samsung and LG user, rubbish costumer services, if android die than i must wait couple weeks for replacment, if somethin happen with iphone i know where is apple store and dealing with them in same day. Price stays high for iphone for a real reason. Iphone is not about SPECS, its about quality in every aspect. 09/30/2016 Linked Devices Reply The issue with iPhones that I hated was that the only way you could fix any glitch that would inevitably crop up is by factory resetting the phone each and every time. It’s such an annoying and time consuming process having to set everything back up again. When I made the switch to Android I was really impressed by how stable and self contained it was. Whenever there was a glitch it was limited to that particular app and you could simply reinstall it and it’d be fixed. I’ve never encountered any systemwide issues such as the iPhone misc storage bug that would happen to me all the time with the 6s. Apple does a great job hiding all of its glitches by simply not providing any prompts. Apps just disappear when they crash. It’s terrible. I know a lot of people with the misc storage bug to this day and don’t know it. They just think they’re out of space all the time because they need a new phone.. 09/30/2016 Linked Devices Reply I lol’d at how much superior the author thought the lightning cable was because it was reversible. You have a fifty fifty chance at it if you do it blindly but most cables have a dimple on top to make sure you get it even time. It’s the most versatile cable, it’s simple, affordable and it just works. No one really has a hard time plugging them in, that was an invented problem. 06/25/2015 RuskieBear Reply 90% of these are false 09/30/2015 poopy Reply You’re just a piece of poop 09/14/2016 Trashpple Reply Chill out iRetard. 10/28/2015 jihou Reply your moms false 06/30/2015 phinfankid Reply I’m a long time android user, but I thought about switching to iPhone on my last upgrade. Some of these were acceptable reasons, but most were not. My wife is using an iPhone 6, and I have the Galaxy S6 edge. We both agree that my phone is far superior in terms of speed and screen resolution, but her camera, even being spec-deficient to my Android, seems as good as, or even better somehow. I like your point on the updates all rolling out at once, but almost every other “point” you made about iPhone being better boils down to one thing: lots of your friends have iPhones. That’s it. That’s the selling point, and the basis of this article. “iPhone apps look better.” – That’s completely relative. Lots of apps do look better, but they generally are paid apps that are free in the Play Store. “Works for all your devices” – So what? I thought this was a phone article. Android works with all your crap too. “No Carrier bundled apps” – I dont know how that’s a selling point, but okay, you win. Bloatware is an issue on android. “Sharing to other iPhones”/”Better resell” – Your friends all have them, so you should too. Then you can sell them to other friends who have older ones and make more money. Ridiculous. Yeah, you get a few more bucks for them, so that means you should have an inferior phone? Who buys a phone because of resale value? Preposterous. “Lightning cable is miles better” – My S6 charges from nothing to 40% in 10 minutes. iPhone can’t do that. I understand that the cable may be good, but “miles better” is a stretch. “Apple Stores” – So? I don’t even understand how this is a point in your article. Go to best buy, it’s the same crap. “Touch ID”/”Headphone controls” – Those both work flawlessly on a good number of high end android devices as well. “iMessage, Facetime, blah blah” / “Share apps easily” – All your friends have these, so you should too, or they’ll laugh at you. “Siri works better than Google Now” – Google Now isn’t Siri. That shouldn’t be a comparison. It’s not trying to be Siri. It’s a voice search, and that’s it. Siri works, but it doesnt work “better” than anything else, because there’s nothing to compare it to. If you like having Siri, good. “Notifications are better” – No, they’re not. Android’s notifications work exactly the same. Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying iPhone isn’t better, I’m just saying you haven’t proven that it is here in the slightest. Both OS’s are very well made, and the playing field is far more level than any avid IOS or Android user wants to admit. 07/30/2015 Helene Reply Excellent comment. I totally agree with you. 08/07/2015 Sam Reply DONT throw away your s6 edge… get an iphone but if you can use them interchangeably 07/15/2016 quenchybro Reply lol hi sam 10/09/2015 Palbo Reply I disagree. Bloatware is not really a problem on Android; any respectable company will only install commonly used and necessary apps like the Play Store and Gmail. If you are buying a phone that will leave your wallet intact (and still deliver better specs in every single measurable way than an iPhone 6, such as the lenovo k3 note) from a less known company which may allow bloatware, you can easily root the phone and uninstall it. I do agree with your other points, though! 05/27/2016 ZENCKPRI Reply Phinfankid you are completely right. I agree with everything you said. You are probably the only logical person who has commented so far. Also the iPhones storage is just a scam to keep people paying and buying more storage. Unfortunately the Samsung Galaxy s6 also removed the microsd slot, but luckily Samsung got it sh*t together with the Samsung s7, which in my opinion is the best phone. 07/12/2016 10beasts Reply You really explained the situation very well! Loved it. 07/09/2015 D Reply This article compares Apples to apples. Your references to Android are focused towards Samsung (you know the company that makes the screen, processor, RAM, and ROM in most Apple devices). Compared to a more vanilla Android experience, Apple blows. My $200 Zenfone 2 is better than any fruity phone at a third of the cost. With Apple, you pay more for less, but get a pointless logo. 07/10/2015 Scott Reply What about Apples different charger cords? Droids micro USB cords work with any other Android device. In fact, pretty much all phones but apple use it. They want you to need to buy new chargers more often. Apples are streamlined fads also, just like every product they’ve ever released. Yeah, cause being “cool” means getting the same more expensive products all the other rich kids got. 07/30/2015 Helene Reply I had both and I don’t agree with this article. I prefer Android phones over Iphones. I think Apple have better computers, but not better cell phones. 03/06/2016 Firas Bajjar Reply Keep dreaming…. 03/06/2016 Firas Reply Keep dreaming….Apple has better computers you serious? You can do a lot of stuff on Windows pcs while Mac struggles to do one stuff….At least it’s stable and easy to use through…But seriously it’s overpriced shit…You can get almost awesome gaming laptops for the price of a MacBook Air. In fact, iPhone is better than android….Because the mobile era is another thing, it’s called mobile for a reason. It should be easy to use and quick. That’s why Apple wins at this point…Come on get real men you wanna play GTA V on your mobile? No for sure. Apps are even better (which surprises me why it isn’t the same for a Mac vs Windows) iPhone’s are faster than most android phones….But if you compare it to stock original android phones, the iPhone still beats them but not as much as other android phones. Because unfourtantely Google didn’t know how to configure Linux properly but i bet you if it does…The iOS faster than android is a history….Linux is ultra-powerful and that’s why most of the world super computers use it…Because you can tweak it the way you like and you will get an extremely faster performance than Windows and Mac. But Google couldn’t handle it I guess….Even the Java language is much faster in terms of processing but I’m still surpsised why iOS apps are still faster….It’s just another replica of Nokia’s fault with Symbian (Nokia never built a stable Eco system for it until it’s near to death period, which led the CEO to get rid of Symbian because it takes years to built an eco system) 05/19/2016 PABLO Reply Right off the bat i can tell you are a little kid who just bought a samsung and is butt hurt you made the wrong choice, “struggles to do one stuff” he also pays great attention in class shown by how grammatically correct this is (as i was writing this I found this… “The iOS faster than android is a history” WHO TEACHES THIS KID I NEED TO COMPLAIN)! 08/04/2015 Robin Reply Poorly written article bringing in irrelevant points and downright false information. Take your “works great with all your devices” section for an example. I use an android phone and an apple computer, and the two devices are 100% compatible with no need for a “third-party application” or service. Completely untrue information in this section. Also I have texts and all the regular online messaging apps I use from both devices well synced. All data, photos, contacts, music, etc from my phone are stored in a cloud service and attainable through my mac computer and my (android) phone. Also your first section “iPhone Apps Are First and Better Looking” contradicts itself. 07/06/2016 Gretchen Alexander Reply My iPhones have NEVER worked great with my PC laptop. NEVER. And the people in the store aren’t much help either. I’ve wasted hours in there. So I don’t know who the person who wrote this article talked to, but my experience has been awful with compatibility between iPhone and PC. In fact, it’s the main reason I’ll never buy another iPhone. 08/10/2015 Malin Saming Reply Really? Here are 10 reasons you have apples for brains: Android is free, Google drive storage is FREE. 15 gig of files, unlimited photos! Androids voice recognition is WAY better, try a comparison, Siri is like a nagging wife who can’t get it right. Android phones have wireless charging! Android phones built in payment that works everywhere. Not at 3% of stores like Apple payment. Android phone MULTITASK, thats right you can run a dozen apps at the same time while talking. Android phones have sizable widgets, so you have live streaming info on your home screen. Android phones are available in endless formats, not like the communist way “everyone has the same”. Android phones PLAY ALL FILES, iphones only play Mp3’s from itunes etc etc pain in the Apple. Android phones have rapid charging, 10 min = 4 hours of use. Android phones are available with 2 days of battery. I could go on and on but your Apple brain will not listen anyways. You probably have a really nice typewriter that you show off the lack of it needing toner or electricity. There is a reason Android is about 82% of the market and Apple has fallen from 33 to about 12%… In fact the remaining iphone users I know all run Google everything on their iphone anyways, why not get the best hardware too. I look at everything I can and see things for how they are, then I buy the best I can find, if you do the same you will love your new Galaxy S6 8^ ) 12/13/2015 Pedro Coimbra Reply I tried, but stop reading after the «iphones only play Mp3’s from itunes etc etc pain in the Apple.» Just this BS of a sentence already has 2 lies in it.

Honestly, these are more like 15 reasons why an iPhone user should switch to android as soon as possible. Most testify to the fact that Apple product users are chained together under the apple tree, sustaining themselves on apples only. On top of that they are forced to watch android user eat happily from all the trees in the garden, even apples trees, even inventing fruits of their own. 01/25/2016 Real mofo Reply Your clearly insane 09/03/2015 Lodosa Reply Ja wybrałbym androida: http://logoff.pl/ios/wybralbym-androida-a-nie-ponownie-iphone/ 09/03/2015 GoToHell Reply One of the worst article I ever read. And childish comparison . 09/16/2015 Srikanth Reply I can say something here because I own and use both iPhone 6 Plus and a Samusng Galaxy S6 edge equally everyday. So I think I am in a position to give a fair judgement …or at least decide what works better for me. I have changed over from iPhone as my default device to S6 edge and back to iPhone few times. But I find myself using iPhone 6 Plus more often than S6 Edge…because of these reasons 1. Smartphone is smart because of quality apps. I always found iOS apps looking neater, working smoother and more consistent compared to Android Apps. Just to quote an example…Adobe acrobat reader which i made default app to open PDF files….is not able to open files since last two days all of a sudden and reporting error. Everything is updated but still doesn’t work somehow. But works fine with iOS. 2. Screen of iPhone is marginally inferior to my S6 edge which is stunning. But I don’t hold them near my nose and try noticing pixels. From a practical point of view iPhone screen is absolutely fine. 3. In spite of inferior hardware specs on paper, I can’t deny iPhone user interface is more fluid and smooth. Thats what makes the experience more pleasant for me. 4. iPhone 6s is already launched…I am not upgrading. But know what? Last night iOS9 update was available to my phone. I have already updated to same. Isn’t that amazing? I can’t help comparing my Galaxy note 4, my near stock android Motorola droid turbo.. etc..which haven’t received even 5.1.1 Lollipop when Android Marshmallow is about to be launched in a month. Sad. This alone is enough for me to stick to iPhone as my default device. 5. I havent noticed parallels for some Apps in Android (Drafts, Soulver etc). Which I learnt to use often and liked. I am a fan of some automation apps like Tasker on android which doesnt have an iOS equivalent. But as of now my use of same is less. 6. I guess iOS is bit more secure compared to android against virus attacks and hacking. it IS something important to me in this era of mobile banking and when we keep so much data on Google drive and One Note etc. and hey…Google has made most of its apps available to iOS. I agree my S6 edge is superior in Camera department and pictures look very good. Also usage of widgets is better in android. But after using both OS since last 3-4 years, I am sticking with iPhone as my default and S6 edge for miscellany and photos. This is what works for me. I know others have other reasons to stick to any one OS. I have best of both worlds now but can’t help saying one is better than other at present. 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply Updates are an invalid point, because the newest version of iOS isn’t as good as a 2 three year old version of Android 12/02/2015 Srikantha Krishna Reply I don’t agree with you there. Updates are important. They optimise the software, remove bugs and important to plug security issues. Of course Google releases them but only nexus customers get it. Other manufacturers don’t release it in time. Tell me now how many handsets are going to get Marshmallow and when???? 04/25/2016 Sally Fallis Reply So which is less complicated for the over-50 me who is good with words but not pictures? I had to ask a young person what all those little dots and waves, etc., meant on my Ipod Touch. I really miss words, but I realize I am alone in that. Is a Samsung any easier to navigate for (duhhh…) me? 07/11/2016 Iggy Z Reply If you are over 50 you should definitely stick with Apple 1. it is extremely easy to use 2. you can do many tasks without even doing anything, but simply telling your phone to wake you up at 5am, or to remind you to take your pills when you get home 3. you can change the text size and icon size to accommodate your eye-sight 4. you can ask any teenager to help you organize the icons into more intuitive way Microsoft Windows phones are rich on words, but while it would satisfy your need for everything being written – the phone will be difficult to use, and will still contain many icons. So, go with Apple, even an older 16GB model, will still be fully supported, and will work perfectly well, do not get 64GB version, you wont need all that memory. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply but apple is expensive 08/25/2016 ermm Reply with android it is much easier to use… you can tell your phone to set and alarm….you can change the text size 01/10/2017 Frank McConnell Android is an absurd ecosystem, the UI is very hard to even remember, iOS is better due to the simplicity of the UI. OP was right about iPhones being easy, I use one because android is hard to use. Maybe you should get an iPhone, it’s 5x faster than every android phone in the world and you’ll get a good one on eBay for like $200! Why do you think Google is better on iOS than on android. lel, Android is a joke OS and should be defunct! 10/15/2015 Andras Reply I´ve been an iPhone user for 2 years, recently I bought an Android phone to verify if really Android is superior… After 2 months of testing it, I sell the Android and bought an iPhone 6… This do not prove that iPhone is better, but for my needs, iPhone is totally superior… Android is good, everything is cheap but is not an stable OS… Yes you can have all personalize, but for what? I´m not a teenager anymore so whats the point to have all personalized and change it every week? By the way the output of the sound of the iPhone is really more superior than the output of any Android phone With an iPhone (in music business) is way better you can control lights, console really simple with iPhone and all tech for music is much more easy to sync and to handled on an iPhone… Music business in a MAC is much much easier I love iPhone and I would not change it anymore Like I said I´m not saying iPhone is better for everyone but for my needs yes it is 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply Wow! You’re actually dumber than every other I sheep here. IPhone has good sound? Better than any Android? Hahahahahahaha! Have you even seen an HTC One phone? Best speakers and any phone! Ever. IPhone speaker is tinny garbage. The S6 even has the same placement, but sounds much better. Seriously, Google HTC One m8 or m9. Cm8 literally got the top phone of 2014, and everyone mention how good the speakers work. I also got first place cuz it was vastly superior to any iPhone. Better software, better design, better screen, etc 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply And please specify what Android phone it was. Otherwise I’ll assume you’re lying because there are so many and you can’t name one. Or you got a cheaper old one. Android high end phones are very stable. Look it up. They’re way more stable than iOS 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply Signed, someone who has never used Viper4Android. Seriously, I can’t stomach the sound output of very many phones without it. Only a few Androids that have nice customized audio processing(like the LG V20) and no iPhones or Windows phones. Many of the rest of Androids can use this superior sound mod. I have a Nexus 6P with Pure Nexus and ElementalX kernel, which has nice front firing speakers, better than iPhones. V4A gives audio processing to match. Not available on iPhones or Windows Phones. 10/17/2015 Tushar Reply Why r u only talking about iphone 6plus,which is much costlier than androide same feature phones, there are some other iphones had launched by apple like iPhone5, 5s,5c i compare this phones whith 20000 rs android phones where battery of iphones so worst and camera and no memory slot, nevertheless this iphones have more cost than android phones. 10/19/2015 Lu Reply LOL you will not get confused using a LIGHTNING cable? are you kidding me?????????

I carried the Z10 now carry the Passport with BB10. I only have it because my company prefers BB’s security. But as far as fuctionality, it’s like working with bear skins and stone knives compared to iPhone or Android. The lack of apps and limited integration with other devices is stifling. That’s why I carry a separate personal phone. It’s also why BB is abandoning BB10 and switching to an Android platform. So are you going to cast off your somewhat acceptable friends who carry BlackBerry when their platform becomes Android? They better run out and get an iPhone when that happens so they can still be honored to be deemed worthy of your friendship. 07/11/2016 Iggy Z Reply 1. Android they switch to is FULLY custom and has all google services BLOCKED 2. This is the reason why companies are abandoning BlackBerry due to high maintenance costs and instead make private applications for iPhones which you can only download using a special code, a secure application within a secure platform, cheaper to maintain, more convenient for an employee to use. I completely agree with Bob, Androids are for 12 year olds and vagrants, the paper specs of Androids (factually and historically) are not an indicator of how they perform. And the fact that you think that you are smarter than a mass of hard working high ranking professionals, and that you need to show them all how “individual” you are by always “personalizing” your phone – just shows you are a fool and have nothing to do but to play with yourself on your phone like a kid, I bet you are one of those people who thinks wearing a watch is stupid and unmanly because you have a clock on your phone. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply ur insulting me cos im twelve so dont try piggy 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply You guys keep proving how Apple markets to ignorant people with a credit card. Reason many companies don’t use Android is because of the differences in OS customization from device to device and manufacturer to manufacturer. That can be a nightmare for testing in house apps. Nothing to do with security. My company uses Android tablets, but all the same kind. Only point you are right about is specs don’t reflect performance. Nexus/Pixel devices have good specs, not the best, but just try finding a faster Android or iPhone, for that matter. Why? Stock Android that hasn’t been bastardized. 01/17/2016 Grace Reply I use an iPhone, but custom built my own PC.

I can literally break this article point by point. I would just like to say one thing though as a rebuttal, A NEXUS too receives the ota updates. An iPhone 64gb on contract costs almost the same as a carrier free nexus. I am a galaxy s7 user and the screen quality is maybe 2 generations over the iphone. As for the notifications, I prefer android’s iteration way more than apples. And about the cables, except the s7, all flagships use USB type c Samsung compensates with wireless charging. The battery life on a nexus or an s7 edge is way superior than the iPhone. And hangout video quality is as good as facetious. Also I like the fact that you don’t need to get out of hangouts to make a video call. In iphone you can usee iMessage but then to make a video call you need to get out and go to facetime. I get to play with manual controls on my camera which iphone doesn’t permit. I can literally go all day long about this. Just one actual good point about iphone you could have mentioned instead of the trash is that it has a stronger graphic processor that but by a small margin. 03/23/2016 sheel r shah Reply One more thing. You mentioned sharing. Do you feel ashamed that you cannot share media via Bluetooth?? The most basic mode of sharing? Talking about airdrop please use wifi direct once. Or nfc sharing. 03/28/2016 Stanata Reply Basically what this article is saying is: “use iPhone instead of Android – it’s more easy to use if you’re an idiot!”… lol There isn’t even one reason of those in the article that is 100% true… and almost all of them are complete crap! I mean come on – even monkey can plug MicroUSB and it is “a must” standard in Europa for instance anyway. Let alone that the future is in the wireless charging… And who today is NOT using Viber or WhatsApp? Who needs another messenger? I can continue, but don’t see point in that – the articles like this is obviously paid one. But sooner or later it will be clear at the end – the open environment will always be above the close one, because it is more close to the people! Cheers! 03/29/2016 Dark Penguin Reply I’m not sure I get why the headphones are supposed to be a distinctive selling point. My GS5 came with headphones that offer the same control options. They didn’t last, because we have cats, but that’s beside the point. 03/31/2016 SHERIF SHARMY Reply A few years ago my wife bought me an iPhone after I discarded my Symbian phone. Anyway I started to use this and found out in dismay that I have to have all products to live . Windows used to crash if I connect my iPhone…….it does not like it. Couldn’t do anything without iTunes. Can’t see anything on the phone while connected to Windows except photo. Couldn’t copy my videos at all. Then the account with and once you are inside the prisoners you are under arrest until proven innocent. Luckily the Sony Z1 appeared and decided to get one. In two days I found life with this phone by far easier than that silly apple I was using……..I just gave to a friend without asking for any cash. Good riddance…..

It’s a Huawei, nice BIG screen I guess they call a Phablet. My younger son has an iPhone 6 plus. I decided to try an iPhone 5s just to see what it’s like. I have 30 days to check it out. So far, the ONLY thing see is the slow motion camera that’s cool and maybe some cuter emogies …I think they’re called. Otherwise….. I’m so far not impressed. My Huawei Android is 16g the iPhone 5s is 16g. The Huawei was I think $200 and the 5s $160 with its VERY tiny screen. My son has a 6 plus and 64g and that would cost me $650 or maybe it’s $650 for the6 plus 16g. Anyway…. Lots MORE MONEY. I guess if you have a lot of music… It’s better but I just have Lots of pictures. I like my sd card for these. I don’t know all the techy stuff and I don’t do Twitter or FaceTime or sharing pics except Facebook and text. I thought maybe some apps would be cooler but so far… I’m not impressed with the iPhone at all. Just my opinion. 04/12/2016 D Dawg Reply smoke weed everyday 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply wtf!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 04/19/2016 J Corn Reply I knew this article was a joke when his very first reason is “Snapchat looks prettier on iPhone”. And you’re listing reasons why apple is different, not better. 04/21/2016 Anujay Singh Reply Apple optimises the iPhone’s hardware and software. The iOS Is custom built for and iPhone but the android softwares are not built for any particular device or hardware so optimisation is nog as good as in an Apple device. It not about specs the camera which shas more megapixels cannot alone deliver better pictures , a processor with more cores and greater clock speed can not alone give better performence until it utilises the most of it. So as Apple builds it products to its own requirements and deliver better products than android phones. An iPhone has better quality of internals as well as the body and feels premium than its competitors so that’s why an iPhone is an iPhone. 04/26/2016 De'Zsa Smith Reply Currently on my iPhone 6s+, sobbing as I type this. I’ve just got through longingly browsing Google’s Playstore, seeing all the recent updates of my favorite apps and hidden gems that the Apple Store just cannot compete with. Android has some seriously dedicated developers, and I’ve always admired them and even began looking into Android app development. That is… Until I switched over to iPhone several months ago after being a dedicated Android user. I will always be Team Android, hands down. I had a rooted Nexus 5, which means I’m all about customizability, design, testing, flexibility, and freedom. Then I decided I wanted to try something new—FaceTime, great camera, updated social apps like snapchat…you know, the basics. Biggest. Mistake. Ever. Switching over to Apple feels like I’m using a flip phone. Now I’m trying to decide if I should just switch back, or keep this iPhone as a means of communication (don’t know if I’m willing to give up FaceTime with family and friends) and have an Android for all the things I miss. 04/27/2016 weez Reply I just giggle at these articles. Ok Iphone kids, my phone has a webhost, tftp server, a windows deploy share with every iteration of windows going back to w2000, an SMB client, FTP client and host, Tftp server, wi-fi signal scanner, packet sniffer(nmap), a high frequency oscilloscope, a bluetooth HID remote that controls anything bluetooth, a linux/android debugger, point of sale and inventory tracking software(apple has it too but not complete on the phone), and at will I can change my MAC and spoof other phone’s IDs. My phone is a half decade old S2. So I guess if you plan on propping up a desk buy an Iphone, for everyone else that has work to do either grab a toolkit full of different things or just grab your android phone. 04/28/2016 Ken McDowell (@morpheusxp) Reply I don’t understand why it is all Android users say that iPhone users are sheep and that they use an iPhone because everyone else uses an iPhone. The iPhone has less than 20% market share world wide. That means less than 1 in 5 smartphone users have an iPhone. It seems to me going with the herd is more of an Android thing than an iOS thing. Just saying… 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply I think it is more because a lot of iPhone users seem cultic. I honestly think iPhone is a high quality product. But I really like high end Androids as well. However, I know people who use only Apple products and make little comments here and there about how inferior ALL Androids are. In that way I think they are like sheep because they have bought into this notion that their are no good Androids and they are operating on a higher plan than non-iPhone users. 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Agreed. Probably because in the beginning people lined up outside of stores to get the latest and greatest iphone. It’s great hardware, but I can’t get used to a single button. Plus iphones seem to have a higher resale value. I don’t know. I do like how apple updates their devices in a timely manner and no bloatware, etc. I think Android is getting there, but unless it’s a nexus, updates are all over the place. I want the screen of a Samsung, build of an HTC with the battery life of my droid turbo, a headphone jack at the bottom of the phone instead of the top and I would be in heaven. Plus everyone I know say is that a Galaxy? So people in my area associate anything android as a Galaxy. Great marketing by Sammy, but perception becomes reality sometimes. 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply Meant to say plane, not plan. ☺ 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply Yup, it is about the Apple cult and the attitude that you are unwashed and not worthy if you use an Android. The attitude you must be broke, homeless, etc. My Android costs as much as a lower range current iPhone and can do way more. Here in the US, they have much greater market share, unfortunately. 04/28/2016 Joe Reply iphone has nothing on android. They have a good camera but that is about it. isheep all butthurt because android is taking over the world. 04/30/2016 qwertypop13 Reply So far all my favourite android apps were not available on ios, plus a lot of apps are a minimum of 10 cent cheaper on gpl than on apple app store. I also find it totally ridiculous that iphones need to be jailbroken to undergo any form of customization. Plus who wants fast updates at the expense of severe bugs, them slowing down stuff even more and getting a crappy operating system that hasnt changed since 5 years. Iphones are for people that only use their phones to txt and make calls. ps. I have a $20 alcatel phone and wouldnt ever trade it for an iphone. Buy what you like, but the points on this website are the worst I have ever seen. As far as I know you cant even use iphones to transfer files other than audio and photos to and from macs/pc’s. Apple phones are overpriced by like $500 dollars just because they have a flashy logo which they stole from the beatles. 05/05/2016 anthony Reply I love my android devices. Have I had problems. Yes. More than my wife’s iphone? Definitely. But I tinker with it a lot more than her iphone. I transfer files back and forth from a computer a lot easier with my device. Yes using third party apps but it’s still easier. I have all my music in google play, but use itunes (whole family uses ipods) so I just sync up that to google music and playlists as well. Each device has it’s pros and cons. I have used a rooted tablet to get pure android (didn’t like it) and have an ipad 2 which I love. It’s about choice and I like that we have it. Two points I agree with the author about: Timely updates and bloatware. HTC is bucking the trend to stay afloat by addressing this. Wireless charging is not worth it yet. I much prefer quick charging and new devices starting to roll out with usb-c. 05/07/2016 C Reply The article and ensuing comments are a joke. This is what The internet has come to now days. Let me be clear, I have years and years of experience with Android, IOS, Windows & Linux. I have every certification and more hours logged on to these then most of you. Now that we have established my far superior ability to actually comment here goes. First of all, the people on this blog and on others like it simply cannot help the fact that more people love iphone than android, period. So they make nasty little comments because they are frustrated that in reality they couldnt influence people in high school and they aren’t able to now. Second the android users who get angry at Apple users simply appear to only be mad because they don’t have an iphone them selves. Guys! Really! Let me be clear I have Windows and android and iOS. Iphone for the nomal every day user is PERFECT! Let them be! The android is perfect for more shady people who want to be power users an anarchists or some how feel like they are breaking the law or the rules. That is how android feels and that’s the base line of the os. I currently have an android because I can be one of those more shady people who like to go against the grain. But I don’t like android. Who the he’ll wants to root a phone? Who wants to spend hours on doing something? Not I! It takes me 10 minutes to jail break an Apple as and BAM I’m a super users with a linux based system and am sitting with a very powerful device! They all being said I have an android bc of expandable memory, an IR blaster, and a few other small features. When Apple steps up the game with these I will switch to Apple. Here is one reason why. What is a smart device? It is an item created to make your life as a human eaiser. Apple does that by leaps and bounds! The phone thinks of you like a loyal old dog and wants to do nothing more than serve your every whim. I can tell you the iphone holds up better, know why? Ever had to fix your mom or dads PC? And you think to your self wth are they doing with this thing. We never hear that issue out of iphone. So really is a beast just for that reason alone simply bc the general population can break them by doing stupid stuff. Now on to adress some other stupid comments for people who pretend they are SO smart. Windows is better than a Mac ios! Hum WRONG! Know why? Windows is a dos based crap system with a gui created for the average consumer to use a device. It’s not a damn computer it’s a pretty device to help you numb skulls use paint and word or get on the internet. What is my point now!! Oh yet MAC IOS is FAR superior at least for anyone who actually knows how to use Linux which by the way was and still is the base os on which all other smart software was and still is created. So you pretty little Windows fanboy users, please get a grip because until you stop drooling over your poster size photo of Bill gates and actually learn Linux you know nothing about computing. The really dumb person who commented about Honda’s vs Chevys! Hahaha seriously though? You also probably know nothing right? Honda and GM use the exact same part manufactures which in turn makes both cars CRAP! Research before you comment. Go get what ever phone you want and fanboys of each need to get a grip! 05/29/2016 C Reply Just to clarify a few things for the “people who pretend they re SO smart” Windows has been detached from DOS since windows 2000, It maintains compatibility by running an DOS virtual machine on the NT Kernel. Not all systems are based on Linux, Linux is based on Unix, Mac OS (and IOS) is largely based on BSD which is a variant of UNIX, The Windows Micro-kernel is also partly based on UNIX. For someone who has “years and years of experience with Android, IOS, Windows & Linux.” and “every certification and more hours logged on to these then most of you” you are spreading a lot of misinformation. I personally own all apple products, but have and still use the other platforms, They all have their advantages and downfalls. And although I use a Mac, Ipad and Iphone predominantly I still have moments of frustration when I miss windows, android and linux for one reason or another. 05/29/2016 CC Reply Not the same “C” as above btw 05/18/2016 Nikhil Bansal Reply Great Information.

But when it comes to the games the android will never be smooth as Apple or faster the performance in apple will always be better. But android will only have a bit better graphics because of its amoled technology 06/02/2016 Jacob Reply If you wanted to make this a fair comparison you’d compare it against Vanilla Android so it’d be the Nexus 6p and immediately your points about bloatware and cable become invalid. Also, how can you say apple doesn’t come with bloatware? Have you tried removing the stocks app recently? What about file sharing, have you never heard of Android Beam? Or the fact almost every flagship has a fingerprint scanner now? This is the most poorly written, one sided piece of crap I’ve seen in a long time. How do you even have a job? P.s. I own a Nexus 6p for private use and iPhone 6s Plus for work and they’re pretty much equal in every way except for the Nexus having a better screen, free apps, faster charging and longer battery life. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply +1 lol 06/03/2016 alpharidley9098 Reply This article made me laugh pretty hard. I just love the reasons they give for the phone being better. Now 1 thing that is always MORE important than ALL of these is the actual phone. Also, those apps that come with the phone, it depends on what you are getting… Also, you do know apple is making a switch to MicroUSB right? Humph. Seems like just in this 1 paragraph I have already made better points than this article. Anyways, phone-wise, androids are almost always more powerful than an apple phone because of the fact that iPhones are never equip with a good core or a good amount of RAM. They slow down quite quickly and seem obsolete after a few months. Yes. Months. I have had my Moto G3 for awhile and it is still ultra fast and has no technical issues. 06/03/2016 Jens Lipponer Reply problem with iphones is that u need itunes etc.. and too many permissions. I like to just plug in and drag and drop files…. I don’t give a monkey’s behind whether apps look better or what not. let’s be honest, price wise the iphone is beaten every time. there is just no bang for buck.

It seems obvious to me. At least Android screens don’t break when you drop the phone on carpet like iPhone’s do. There’s Applecare because the iPhones break like a window hit by a baseball because the whole phone is either thin aluminum or covered in glass (which is a hazard if the glass shards cut you and potentially make you bleed out). The aluminum iPhone’s are currently being made of bend in your pocket! They’ll need some high quality flexible glass and easily bent straight CPU (without anything on the inside being destroyed). By the way, for the vibration thing on Android you don’t have to input password or anything just click the power button and hold down the turn down volume button for a second or two and that’s it. 06/10/2016 Shaggy C Reply So your reasoning is half “It’s popular” and most the other half is comparing apple features to the bad features of a multitude of android phones?

It could be called Android or robot or Apple or peaches or dog poo. All I care about is having a good phone that can do the most. Phones are expensive. I’m not buying a brand name. I’m looking to buy something that has everything it could possibly have if I’m going to spend that kind of money. You’re “reasons” show good things about IPhone, but are not “reasons” as to why it’s better. IPhones are good phones. People like IPhones because it’s a trend. It’s popular. That’s it. IPhones are not even close to androids. Be truthful. Androids are mini-computers. Literally. IPhone is not. You can do 100 more things with Android that you cannot do with IPhone. The That is the truth. And Apple products are a lot more expensive. Why would anyone pay more for a phone that gives you less? It boggles my mind. Android has variety. There are many, many phones, companies, styles to choose from. They even offer cheaper options that get the job done. They have an SD card slot. Why would anyone dish out $100’s more for more storage? That SD card is yours forever. For future phones or other devices. You can plug your phone into your computer and save(on the phone or SD card) anything (music, photo’s, video’s, contacts) and it’s yours. Without having to go through ITunes or anything else. Apple doesn’t own my stuff. I own it. And I can customize anything I own. There are IPhone stores for these little nick knacks. Transferring files, contacts, etc. It’s like going to a car dealership. One side has a variety of great cars. The other side has one car that is the most expensive. You see that all the other cars have a ton of features, options, colors to choose from, engines, horse power, cylinders, 2-door, 4-door, SUV’s etc. You ask “what’s so great about this lonely more expensive car tht only comes in one model and doesn’t have these other options?” The saleman replies with “Because it’s popular”. 07/06/2016 Gretchen Alexander Reply Yes, this!

I have two iPhones now, a 5 and a 6, that I can’t get my photos off of onto my PC laptop. I’ve gone into the Crapple store more than three times and still haven’t gotten them off. My idea of HELL is the Crapple store! I hate that place. There’s hardly room to stand and then you end up being sat at a table waiting with a bunch of other frustrated people waiting for a tech to help you. Of course this is after you make an appointment, or in my case last time, two appointments. I don’t see that as a plus at all because not only is going there a royal pain in the ass, but then they don’t even offer much help after several hours. My iPhone does not recognize as a drive when I plug it into my PC. It used to, and then stopped. I don’t want to have to use iTunes to transfer photos or music. I want to just plug it in and have it be a drive and copy whatever files I like back and forth. It does not work; and I’ve spent, literally, hours trying to get it to function that way. I also have a pretty complex DSLR camera and yet it is still easy as can be to transfer the photos from the memory card onto the computer. So why can’t a supposedly user-friendly phone just do the same thing? I seriously hate my iPhone 6 so much I wanted to shoot it, except I discovered it’s worth a good bit of money still so I’ll sell it on ebay. 07/09/2016 Joey Reply A lot of childish responses from android fans here. I gave the nexus 6p and try for 2 months after my old iPhone broke. Hardware was great, but I found on this android phone the app integration and interoperability to be no where near as good as an iPhone. Apple is just better when it comes to form and function. Buy an android if you want to tweak it forever and play in a sandbox, buy and iPhone if you need a productive phone. 07/10/2016 Colin Reply Your comment may not be childish but it is not correct. Comparable Android phones have far better form and function. Take the iPhone 6s plus verses a Note 5 or s7 Edge. The Apple is bigger and heavier yet packs has a smaller or same sized screen as the Samsung’s’ yet has far less features. Both these phones are far more productive, can multi-task properly, be fully customized and allow widgets on lock and home screens for speed, convenience and ease of use. The Note even includes a stylus or pencil. Great compact design, fully featured and greater functionality (Android) vs Heavy outdated bloated hardware with mid-range specs and limited functionality (IOS). Not to forget the limited compatibility of iPhones and lack of choice! 07/10/2016 Chris Reply There are facts, then there are opinions. 07/10/2016 Colin Reply This article is a disgrace, misleading at best.

Lightning is better than micro usb? excuse me, what? my iphone takes ages to charge (iphone 6) whereas my s4 charged within an hour. i don’t see how that makes micro usb bad. but well my iphone battery lasts over a day and my old phone could have never. sharing location isn’t hard on android since almost everyone uses whatsapp bc imessage doesn’t exist on android and whatsapp has a location sharing option so that argument was dumb. yes, apps do look prettier on ios but i don’t see how only that would be a reason to switch?? this article clearly comes from someone who has only owned apple devices and doesn’t even know what they’re talking about, if you really want to prove a point you need to ask someone who has used BOTH of the things you’re trying to compare otverwise you’re just gonna embarass yourself. just saying. 07/20/2016 KappaPride Reply Why are you guys even arguing about this? 07/24/2016 George Reply The major advantage iOS has over Android is that Apple designs the phone and software. Whereas for Android (open source) other manufacturers have to play with it to get it to work and sometimes it’s not fluid. Take the Nexus phones for example…they just work like the iphones. No bloatware..nothing (like the iphone). Majority of my friends have iPhones and sometimes I wish I did too because of MMS (iMessage). I used both and I hate that i have to use itune for everything but it is what it is I guess. 07/24/2016 Landry Reply I’m 8 years experimented developer for iOs devices and I say that Apple releases so frequent updates because iOs is just a stone age OS to fool iOs users that Apple works seriously behind their products. It must run to compete Android OS. 07/27/2016 Aza Reply Best to have both. I have an Se and G4 best of both worlds 07/30/2016 Bob Reply So many things piss me off in this article but specifically stood out Notifications I have no idea with this author is saying he obviously hasn’t seen an android phone, they are exactly the same. Lightning vs. Micro-USB Micro-USB usually charges everything from headphones, to power banks, and of course cell phones. And multiple times to insert it is an absurd comment, after about a week you’ll probably memorize which way it goes, and how do you insert it incorrectly more than once. And USB type-C is just starting to come to the mainstream that’s why it’s not on everything. Storage Why do people even buy the 128 GB version, not to get apps but to download media like pictures, videos, music, etc. I agree with the statement about how sd cards are treated but there’s a much more simple solution, buy a larger storage option. Sharing purchased content Sign into the play store with the account that originally bought the content, install it, then sign out. Problem solved, and if anyone says “it’s more convenient” think about how often you might actually purchase something that costs actual money, I’ll bet it’s probably less than once a week. And it doesn’t take long to sign in and then back out 08/14/2016 Adso Rossi Reply I love iPhones. They always have nice designs and I like the simple interface. I have been itching to get an SE with its smaller dimensions (I like small phones). Money is not a problem to me but as much as I really want one I will stick with my Android device. Why? Cause the compatibility of iPhones to Windows pcs are real bad or none. You’d say “get a Mac” but I can’t: too many programs I need that unfortunately are only Windows-available. If this one single point of compatibility would be addressed, the iPhone becoming as compatible as Androids, I would get that iPhone SE in a heartbeat! 08/21/2016 nathanlittles plays minecraft Reply Who the hell needs iPhone I can name 100 reasons why Android is better but I’ll just name 20 1. Freedom 2. Apk 3. More sizes 4. More colours 5. Waterproof phones 6. Big and small tablets instead of the HUGE iPad 7. Clear cache option 8. For apps and also all the app store apps 9. No need for jailbreak but if you root you’re device will have no restrictions :D 10. Notification swipe 11. Google now 12. Google maps instead of the crappy apple maps 13. Multiple users feature 14. SD card storage So you don’t run out of storage easily like on the 16 gig iPhones (128GB or even 256GB) 15. Pattern unlock 16. There’s everything on Google play store even GPS spoofers to do the Pokémon go spoof in like 2 seconds 17. Unknown sources option 18. No need for an apple I’d all you need is a Google account which is way easier to set up and use 19. Get apps that are not out in your country easier (Pokémon go) 20. Android sounds better then apple 08/22/2016 Jim Reply This article made me so angry I must go punch a kitten. It’s an interesting psychological phenomenon, our emotional ties to brand loyalty. It’s as if the device we choose to use says something about who we are as people, and there is some ancient war of two types of people being waged through our genetics. Apple users are like Yankee fans, Android users are the goth kid outsiders. And the war rages on. 08/30/2016 Deleau Clément Reply Hi. Please kill yourself. Thanks 09/05/2016 Krishna Chandran Reply The guy who wrote this sounds to be a one eyes man to me….. He is fond of his iphone and may have seen some android phones, but never used any. Then he decides to write an article called iPhone vs Android and iPhone wins!!!! Good job 09/10/2016 John Ivay Reply Some of these are true but Oh God some are just so, so wrong. Like, the notifications. Android is wayyy better. You clear all at once or swipe. It combines like notifications that you can separate. It allows to interact with the notification and app without opening it and its just, way simpler and cleaner. 09/10/2016 Nigel Nderi Reply Let me settle this. Choose an iPhone if you are incompetent or are ok with a company controlling you’re phone completely. Choose an Android if you want to be able to enjoy the latest technologies and can competently manage it’s abilities without whining that it takes more than half a brain cell to use. 09/11/2016 Josh Mcduff Reply Just read all the comments and wow it’s all he said she said. I’ve had my Nexus 6p which btw one poster said it’s Google made nope huewei or whatever. Point is not the same, for about a year now and I’m now getting the iPhone 7. Are the specs pretty damn similar? Yes alot of the same features? Yes update often? Yes Nexus gets all the Android ones first like Apple. Price? Actually the 7 is less than the Nexus by about 150.00 CAD sooo that defeats the argument about price… Just saying. I love my Nexus but I’m open to changing. Ice bounced back and forth alot between Android and iOS can I say one is superior to the other? Absolutely not it all comes down to does it do what I want it to and can I afford it. 09/12/2016 Lee Reply All good and well people love free stuff but free stuff comes with a price of selling your info to the uncontrollable thirst party. iPhone also offer easy printing option than android you have to download something that will ask you to upgrade by paying just to use your printer no way! Also iPhone helps stop third party apps that try to use your phone making phone calls example if you are searching for nearest restaurant Google will show the call number to the same restaurant but when you try to call instead of calling direct the parasite apps like whatsaapp, text… And more they pop up asking you to use them making a call while they can’t function without your service they bug you each time taking away the time you spend trying to make a call. If you’re in a hurry and these app try to suggest you use it think how buggy this is. The same applies to text messages. 09/15/2016 Jada Reply Have u really owned an android? There are many many more possibilities and helpful apps that came with my galaxy s7 edge and i love it alot! So many more features and charging is so much faster and the battery life is amazing 09/15/2016 Ryan Reply You are a stupid retard Apple isn’t better than android. Apple has had to recall their product so many times because people died from the battery exploding. And with Apple every 3rd phone they stop making updates for it. Android always has updates for their products. Plus Apple owes the government 37 billion dollars Android doesn’t. The iPhone 7 that is coming out is a total ripoff. They copied Samsung. Apple has never made a crack resistance screen and a waterproof phone. Samsung is simply better. 09/17/2016 Rob Doyle Reply I completely am for people having their own opinion, that being said I disagree with the title of this article. That being said without any bias coming into play here, some of the points that the author was trying to make aren’t true or aren’t completely true. 1. “Works with all your devices”… The real title should be works better with all of your APPLE devices. The examples in the article are all apple examples. The author obviously has no experience with android or windows. 2. “Faster Updates”…. Compared to what android device? You can’t just say that Iphones get updates faster and compare that to all android phones. The way that this section was written made it sounds like the day an update is release for Android, nine of there phones get it immediately like the iPhones… this just isn’t true. If you have a nexus you get updates as they are released (just like and iPhone) There is a bunch of other examples that just show the author has no experience with android devices, I’m just going to keep this short. People will choose what they think is best for them. My issue is with the author, not the opinion. All the argument were completely based on opinion and not facts. People are going to read this and take it all as fact, instead of doing research and finding the right device for them. 09/18/2016 Jonathan Masters Reply I have both an iPhone 5 and a Galaxy S7. While there are some advantages to the iPhone, there are several reasons why I just can’t make a permanent switch. First, no home screen widgets (like my calendar and agenda). Sure, you can add something like that to the notifications screen, but that involve swiping, as opposed to right on the home screen. Second, it’s so difficult — even annoying — trying to organize files on the iPhone. On an Android, it operates exactly like a computer should (and our phones really are computers these days), with folders, subfolders, etc., so you can just copy the files to where you want them for later use. You can’t do that on an iPhone, where all of your files go to some mysterious and deep “collection” on the phone. If Apple were to add those two features, then I’d happily switch away from Android. 09/21/2016 de Coulon Thierry Reply I wanted to try an iPhone, so I got an old one. I could simply not install anything because everything on the AppStore has moved to iOS > 7. I could not bring a single file to the phone. All it would do is sync with iTunes on my Mac, but there is nothing to sync because I don’t use this Mac for everyday life. The iPhone I got did not have any smart way to save battery. The iPhone I got could not play any of my music because a) I could not upload it and b) I could not install anything that would play ogg files. The iPhone I got was heavier, thicker and less good looking than my current Sony. So OK it was an old iPhone, but 90% of what I say would be true for the latest iPhone, and at what price! If you live in the Apple world, then an iPhone is probably the logical choice. I live in the Linux world and now I know I’ll never take another look at an iPhone. 09/24/2016 Jim Washko Reply Worldwide stats – Android users 82% vs IOS users 18% There’s not enough votes to even tilt the scale towards IOS being better. Being as the story indicates Android phones are only good for 2 years that makes them more expensive. How can IOS users explain why 82% of the market would rather pay more for less?, if that were in fact true. Iphone offers less control, poor resoluion, no expandable memory and not all phones can share the same apps. Android offers all of it as well as compatible with Windows whcih is currently at 80% of the market share. This is like comparing the Yugo to Prius. Sure the Yugo is cheaper at first, but after a year of so, not so much. Iphone resale is more, but that will drop due to fewer and fewer users as they get tired of the box of crayons with only black and white as an option. when they can get the box of 64 and a sharpener 09/24/2016 Capi Reply Is this all a big joke? You keep saying “iPhone is better than Android” about ten times in the article, like a mantra we have to learn and assimilate, Am I the only one who noticed this? I have and iPad, and iMac and I used iPhone (4, 4s and 5) I am familiar with both iOS and OSX but actually I have an Android and installed Windows 10 on my iMac. OSX is a good system if you like simple and easy interfaces, I don’t really have any problem with it, is a really good system once you learn to do things that are diferent with Windows, like formating drives with Disk Utility. (And if we forget how difficult could be for some people to use drive formats like NTFS in a Mac) But iOS, thats another story, Apple manufactures iPhone and developes a OS which works perfectly with that device, which, supposedly, makes it safer. There ends all iOS and iPhone REAL advantages. There are a lot of reason to say Android is better than Android, but the main reason is that you can freely add and delete files from it. I connect my Android to my computer, I press “Windows key” + “E” and immediately I see all my drives and my Android device there, and I can drag or delete files from it. But when I connect an iPhone I have sync up files with iTunes. Why the hell people think synchronization is good? For example, I spent one week adding all my music from CDs to my iTunes library, then I synced my iPhone and… voilá, my music was there. Then my computer died, and my music adquired during years with my money was completely lost, just because I didn’t buy it to Apple. But hey, music was still on my iphone, but NO, I need a third party program, which costs money or could be a malware, just to upload my songs again to a new computer. (Of course I have all my CDs, but thats a week lost) Im simply asking you to do like me if you can, just try everything, because if I read this article (iPhone is better, iPhone is better, iPhone is better…) I have the feeling that not everyone, but many people conform with iPhone. Just for popularity, for Apple fanaticism, or just because a website is telling you to buy it with superliminal advertising. 09/26/2016 wgallagher142 Reply I actually find that android apps have become much prettier and definitely more modern than iPhone apps at this point. Twitter, Facebook, all the google apps, as well as plenty of others have better looking designs on Android now than on iPhone thanks in large part to material design! 09/27/2016 Simon Reply What a crock of misinformed shite 09/28/2016 Eugene Reply ANDROID IS BETTER Really. Devices cheaper, but they have similar power with iPhones. And it’s open-source, you can customize it all over you want.

I plug the phone to any pc or laptop with Windows and I can access and modify the memory and sd card just like you do with an USB flash drive. 2) probably my favourite Android feat: if I don’t like a new update for an App I just download the previous version (you can get the whole updates hystory as .apk files of virtually every single app found in Google Play on the web) and there I have my dear older version that works so much better for me.

At least I got that right. 10/07/2016 Majid Reply None of these arguments accounts for any good reason to buy an iPhone except argument number 1. Android can do these equally or better. I have been a heavy android user till date until yesterday when I bought iPhone 7 plus. I own an iPad since two years. I am happy with my iPad which I use mainly for games and some handwriting. Yes I was annoyed from android. I owned s3. It had, due to some reason, a built in issue which I only realized after warranty finished. My faulty s3 obliged me to hate Samsung and android. Then I bought note 4. It solved all my problems I faced on s3. But still there were some things I did not feel good about. Now after purchasing iPhone 7plus 128 GB I understand the power of google. The three apps Google search, google maps and google drive are enough reason to close down iPhone factory from the face of earth. 10/10/2016 BM Reply Thinking to upgrade from s5. Thought for iPhone 7. But it can not do even 5 % work compared to android. My andrioid mobile automatically silents itself when I enter meetings or office. Automatic meeting mode when meeting is scheduled (only beeps) I can give my mobile to anyone to see coz I have app specific fingerprint. Only sensitive apps are protected. All other is open. These are not possible with apple except jailbreak. These are just samples. I can write journal what android can do. Speed is not important with a Ibrick which can not do anything smart. I’m not a fan of apple or Samsung. I want my work to be done and my pocket secretary to work according to my requirements. 10/10/2016 Charles Alden Reply 15 reasons why Android is better. Reason number one, you have an actual file system. Anyone who has dealt with iOS horrendous file management paradigm appreciates the ease as at which files are accessible in Android. You simply click on Open, navigate to where your files are stored, select, done. There is also never any reason to use the Share function except when sharing data with the internet. Number 2, multitasking, iOS’s multitasking absolutely sucks, especially when you compare it to Android. Example, I can stream a film to my TV wirelessly, while compiling an application via a remote terminal, while downloading a 40GB file directly to my NAS drive which is mounted as a local folder, while I convert a media file to .mp4, while I play N64, 007 Goldfinger using a replica N64 USB game controller. I’m able to select my own default apps, so when I download a file and click open, the app that I normally use for that extension opens up automatically. I have a global search function, which is one of the worst things about iOS, how do you find files. That was rhetoric, you can’t, it’s basically hunt and peck. I can customize voice commands, this is perhaps one of the coolest things about about Android. I have around 250 custom voice commands, mostly for searching files. Such as, “show me all file [file extension] created on [date]. Even photos, show me all photos from [city] on [particular date/month, years], even for a particular person , “show me all photos for [name] on [particular date/month, year]” External display support, when am connect my phone to a monitor not only is the resolution fully supported but so is the aspect ratio. Mouse support, while connected to a monitor I can use a mouse and a keyboard. Even when not connected to a phone, having access to a mouse is an absolute must when using a tablet as a laptop. USB peripheral support, so besides mouse support, my phone supports a TB external HD, HP All-In-One printer in which the scanner even works, USB replica game controllers in which a have one for the N64, SNES, Sega and PlayStation. Better overall specs, I have a 2K AMOLED display, 6GB of RAM, USB C, SD Card reader, HDMI out support, etc. I can use a custom desktop LDPI, I changed my LDPI to 380 which is the LDPI that activates tablet mode, which means all of my apps are a lot more powerful than the normal phone UI ones. I can customize my entire system to what I want it to be, give it personality, iOS users have been using the same system UI for the last 9 years. There is absolutely nothing I can’t customize. Inner app communication is a lot better, since iOS has a Walled off prison, or so called Walled Garden, apps communicate via API’s, which is the root of everything wrong within iOS. Anyway as stated above, I don’t have to use some half assed sharing function which creates a copy of the file your sharing every time you use it to open up my files within multiple apps, I simply click on Open. I can even open up the same file within multiple apps at the same time. I never, ever have to create more than one file, I just use the original file, always. I can use Linux under a Chroot, meaning I have a full Debian server running under my phone. Why would you want this, well first of all I have CLI applications like; Python, Perl, PHP, MySQL, Apache, etc. I have all of my favorite Linux GUI applications installed like; Dia, Inkscape, Gimp, BlueFish, etc. I can use my phone as a desktop computer, this one might sound weird but not only is it possible, it works incredibly well. Especially when my phone has 6GB of RAM and a Qualcomm 821. Like I said above I have all of my favorite Linux GUI applications installed in which a bring them up using a xterminal, when I’m at work I have access to about a hundred different Windows applications via a Citrix client which works fantastically. All of my applications including the ndroid ones are opened up in individual windows, so none of that dual app view non-sense. In which in iOS less than 0.5% out of a million plus apps actually support. I have access to widgets, they might not interest you but they are extremely handy. I can use wireless chargers. I can use custom ROMs, even completely different OS’s like Ubuntu Touch, SailFish, etc. I will never, ever not be able to run the latest version of Android. When a manufacturer stops updating their phone, no problem, I just install a custom ROM and they work fantastically. My phone is a computer, a real powerhouse, a real smartphone. Every time I use an iPhone I absolutely hate the experience. I mean even to type a post like this I would have to use a text editor as I would be afraid to loose all of my work as anytime you switch to another app, Safari just resets. It has happened to me numerous times, it’s why sites have started saving drafts, not for the Android users but iOS users. Though what bothers me the most is the lack of multitasking, yes, sure, there are a few apps that can run in the background but they are far and few and none of them are the ones that I need or want to use. Than there is the file system or I should say lack of, dealing with files IOS is simply a complete nightmare. Anytime someone at the office who uses an iPhone gets sassy with me about having an Android phone I simply ask them to show me their user directory, what, you can’t mount it, why not, your phone is so great. Not only do I have my remote server directly mounted as a local directory on my phone but my workstation and all of my cloud services as well, all accessible within any app installed. Again, my phone is also my desktop computer and why not, it’s not only powerful enough but more than capable. I couldn’t believe how horrible the external display support was on my iPad Pro, which I recently replaced with a Lenovo YogaBook, best decision I ever made. Talk about a complete makeover on how I work, I’m actually productive now. I can create detailed reports, all in the background and automatically, I have access to a scripting language, automation, multi-user support with OpenID to access my firms internal network, a real Office suite, MS Office for iOS was a complete joke, there isn’t even a import feature, scripting language, nope, database support, nope, by the way, I have the Android version. Which opens up every app under their own window, iOS’s dual app support on the iPad Pro was a joke, hardly anything supports it and that drag and drop feature, only apps designed by the same developer can use it, so MS Word to MS Excel yes, MS Word to Apple photos, no, useless. Yes, my post is huge, but this authors best 15 reasons why the iPhone is a joke. Almost everything listed I have on either my Yoga Book or new Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus or don’t need it as it’s a waste. In fact 90% of the so called new features in iOS 10 are useless. I held on to my iPad Pro thinking iOS 10 would be a game changer, not only was it not, but there wasn’t a single feature that improved my experience. Apple keeps skipping over every feature that we actually want, need. If your happy with multitasking, file management, the fact that you can’t select your own default apps, lack of customizations, horrible external display support, lack of USB C, limited NFC, horrible USB peripheral support, especially mouse support. Horrible inner app communication including the Sharing function in which took Apple 8 years to even release that crap, ugh, the list just goes on and on and …………. 10/11/2016 Gigi Reply This is one of the most biased articles I have ever read on complementing Apple. I am an adult, I don’t need Apple to limit what I can do with my phone and what I can share and who I can share with. I have used Iphone before and it surely not my cup of tea. 10/12/2016 Emma squire Reply Okay Listen what I think is that you have written an article telling the blank truth of your mind. But you see I have an iPhone 6s,iPod 5,MacBook air, MacBook Pro, Samsung TV with built in smart tv, Samsung galaxy tablet pro and I don’t mind Samsung to be truthful. Also I find that Apple is more easier to use but harder to switch from an iOS device to an LGphone. Emma squire, 11y/o from Aus. 10/14/2016 Babble Reply Let’s face it… I use an android lollipop but after comparing and visualizing the specifications.. One can truly say that iPhone is way more better than android. ..though we need to invest some bucks unlike android phones. 😀 10/14/2016 Huen Reply iOS is superior to Android. I was suckered in buying 2 android devices the samsung galaxy s3 and the nexus 4. I gave it a try because my friends raved about android. They are smart people who generally have great advice and knowledge on technology. So I said I’ll give it a shot because they have good judgement. However I found out that their judgement were out of biased hatred toward apple. Android devices: 1. on paper they have more ram, sometimes quicker cpu clock speed, higher resolution etc. however real life performance tests apple out scores android devices, just check geek bench and speed tests. As for higher resolution our eyes dont even detect the larger resolutions. 2. I found out the hard way, downloaded apps that just didnt work for my device. Google needs to improve this I dont know if they are better now but man they need to detect the hardware your using and tell you ahead of time before you download and install an app that its compatible with your device! 3. customizations my butt!! Its a great idea so called if all your launchers actually look good! haha I tried all these loaders for my s3 and they were all ugly. Just go with apple, its like saying would you hire great designers for your house and you would just let them have their way in designing the house for you or would you want to design it yourself? doesnt make sense look at xiaomi great example they just copy everything apple does and it looks great. Dont hire cheap designers to design the way your phone looks and works. 4. OS – android’s solution to everything is “oh just download this app to make it work or oh just kill this task or reduce brightness or this or that” why?! If I’m paying 1k for a phone why does it not just work? Why must I non stop have to tweak things on my phone to get save battery or make things work? For instance for whatsapp there was no function built into the app that when I want to send a larger video than that of the given limit on a video it just rejects it. On iOS whatsapp gives you a little function that u can just cut the video into segments and send them in separate messages? This sounds like it can be something that is on the app level. I dont know but as for end user experience its just not convenient you need to download another app that will cut videos in segments for you this is retarded. 5. battery life just sucks on android – and my friend is all like well it works for me…well that’s because he had to buy a new battery that was double the size and totally threw out the idea of having a sleek thin phone. Theres on and on the list goes android and samsung devices are not superior devices. The features samsung lovers speak of are just gimmicks. Keyboards, widgets, notifications honestly who cares? Especially when widgets just take down performance on your phone? I just dont see any benefits on android especially the argument went something like this: “oh android phones are cheaper for superior hardware” Like I said hardware maybe superior on PAPER but in real life benchmarks iphones outshine samsung and htc and other top tier android devices. By the way prices are not cheaper anymore so android fanboys have no actual argument. Like I said I tried android and they are not superior phones both hardware and software. Aesthetically Android phones are ugly. You now pay a premium price on sub premium products, and they explode. lol 10/20/2016 Jamezz_ Reply Sure. A Samsung or LG’s phone software is ugly. But stock android?! Android 6.0 stock? It’s an extraordinary interface with origami-style apps. The geometry with the shadows and vibrant colors is beautiful. The app drawer is simple, and you can put the apps you use on your home screen. Android’s advantage is software. iSheep are just too autistic to use it. 10/16/2016 Cmi Reply I have both!

Anybody who argues this point has never used them side by side. No comparison.anybody who stands in line for the new iPhone is absolutely getting the shaft and not even getting the best product , it’s laughable! 10/18/2016 George Brite Reply Great article. Over the years I’ve had both. Even a couple of Macs. I use PC’s now because I like being able to work on them and build my own. For the average user the I Phone is a better choice. They are simple and work well. Here’s the big negatives for me: The hardware and software are proprietary. In fact the phones are sealed. You can’t install an extended battery. No SD slot. No root access. Comparable Android phones cost a lot less. The Android phones natively work with Google Apps. We use our phones in the business. If I were a casual user it wouldn’t matter if it were a Trac Phone or an I Phone. We use the Google phones and Motorola phones. They run pure Android without all the carrier bloatware. I like to say Apple invented the smartphone, but Google perfected it. It’s like the choice between a toaster oven and a microwave or a full commercial kitchen. Most people will get along fine with the toaster and microwave. They don’t need a commercial kitchen. But, what if you could get the full commercial kitchen for the same price as the toaster and microwave? Everyone has an opinion about which is better. But trust me when I say this isn’t a choice between chocolate and vanilla. There are very distinct differences between the Android and Apple phones. 10/21/2016 ZinicHD Reply Wtf, apps never ever releases on iOS first. It always releases on android first. Also app updates releases on android first, so that’s kind of bullshit what you are saying. The only thing iOS beats android in is security and stability. Also you can get virus scanners on android, so that thing doesn’t matter. And one thing more, who ever uses FaceTime or iMessage, when we have messenger, Skype ect… And that point when you said that iOS stock apps was the stupidest crap I have ever heard. First of all it was a shit point, what are you gonna need the looks for? Second is that not everyone thinks it look better, so keep that mind. I am a iOS user and I am so disappointed that you can’t even customize the most of the things. I have to admit that the design of iOS is pretty nice, but you get quick tired of it. That’s why I jailbreaked my device to get the ability to customize it more professionally. But I don’t compare a android device and a jailbroken device, because jailbreaking is not something that comes with Apple. iOS is also very expensive compared to android devices. And checking storage on android is way more organized than iOS, so I don’t know where you get that idea that checking storage on iOS is better. 10/22/2016 Bent Vanwijnsberghe Reply the lightning port part is bs i have an iphone (looking for a new phone android) and there are around me on my desk already 3 micro usb and 1 lightning port witch costs around 40 bucks for a new one 10/25/2016 Selenia Reply Terrible article by an obvious fanboy. You are listing many things, like lack of carrier or manufacturer bloatware, reversible charging plug, seamless sharing, etc and saying they are exclusive to Apple. Try Googling USB-C, the current standard on any higher range Android, some still cheaper than an iDevice. Try a Nexus, or as of this year, Pixel phone. No bloat, Android as Google intended it. That would be a more fair comparison as those are at least close in the chain to Google, like an iPhone is to Apple. That is, instead of being made by some company who may not even care how it represents Android, build quality, and other important things, instead of pure profit(not say all non Nexus/Pixel phones are bad by any means, but some do give Android a bad name with poor specs and modified/outdated versions of Android). Seamless sharing? Ever hear of WiFi Direct, Bluetooth, or NFC? NFC is the simplest. Just hit share and tap. All but the cheapest Androids have that these days. Anyways, I am convinced you have never used a decent Android, ever. Certainly not one from Google themselves. I will leave you to tend to your iFlock. 10/30/2016 MzJens Reply For android, I think google products like nexus & pixel are much better than samsung. However, I noticed a lot of crappy apps available on google play that doesn’t work. Some apps require root access which only advance users should do. Android interface is not as intuitive as iOS. Some android apps hang. I’ve never had ios apps hang on me 11/10/2016 Pixleboy2 Reply “You have to try multiple attempts before putting the charger in at the right angle” 1. If you do it in a lit environment you will get it in first try because the micro USB shape is easy to see 2. If you are in the dark: And have an official Samsung charger – there will be a “bumps letting you know which way to put it and the only thing that can go wrong is you missing the port, which is possible on iPhone too. And have any old micro USB – there are two, normal, ways to insert it horizontally upside down and horizontally the correct way both 180 degree angles so please don’t exaggerate it. Finally Samsung cares about you that’s why they use micro USB. This may seem weird but basically to legally make a lightning USB cable you need a licence from Apple and Apple only have their own unique charger to earn more profit, that’s why apple chargers are always more expensive, because they are sold by Apple or the retailer needs to make his money back from the licence fare. P.S. Samsung devices come with a 1 year warranty for free and because it’s Samsung you can get cheaper insurance than their one (yes they have one) P.P.S. Sharing has always been easier on android to anything because you could share with a variety of options such as Bluetooth, NFC, messaging app, other third party apps, S share (Samsung own “air drop” that came out in Android version 4.1.3 BI7 – before Ios 7 Also the settings icon is useful, it’s like apple not making the send button on messages 3d touch to send so you don’t accidently press it, sure sometimes you send half written messages but it is more convenient and normal to have it to a single normal touch. And there is a difference between apps looking better and having more features on Apple which are usually hardware based, I just brought this up because no matter who you ask if you compare a Samsung phone with its equivalent iPhone generation, Samsung phones ALWAYS have better displays and MOSTLY have better cameras. Samsung phones are also very comfortable, for example I am writing this on a Samsung galaxy s7 edge There is a setting that allows the micro sd card to be added as side by side storage Finally Samsung has always had earphone controls so either I read it wrong that you said these are things we will miss very much or you are really confused 11/12/2016 Tetsuokenpachi Reply Each and every single of these are false. Android is actually better in every single of these areas. From the first to the last one. Worse yet, many of these points are actually some of the very reasons why idevices absolutely suck. 11/16/2016 Billy Sastard Reply apple is crap, these idiots make their products so expensive, but android is cheaper and has alot of awesome features.android is also WAY more customisable, with out necessarily rooting your device.And if you do, you can do almost anything from installing apps to changing your software. 11/16/2016 Calculadora Gestacional Reply I think both of them are just great! 11/16/2016 Caleb Reply The update can still download on older Apple products, because I have a IPad 2 that came out in 2011 and it still receives all of the latest updates. It is running IOS 10 right now. 11/16/2016 saurabh Reply Been an exclusive apple lover for 7 years now. But just bought an edge 7. Was amazed to see how much progress android has made and makes my iphone look so limited. I am aware that android tends to slow down over time but that is yet to happen to me. For now the openness of android is amazing as it is giving me a computer like experience while iOS still strictly behaves like a mobile device only. Classic hurt points being in iphone /iOS being No expandable memory No dual sim version (i travel internationally and need this frequently) Unable to use lastpass like apps the same way as in android (and keychain is BS, BTW) Simple things like themes unavailable Very less system wide control Very limited customisation I can go on but i think unless my expensive edge can give me same performance as now for ATLEAST 2 years, i’ll eat my words back But, the 15 points mentioned here are almost all very unconvincing. 11/17/2016 Philip Reply Apple are just simple phones no really fancy stuff I have had two Android phone I love their features but not their battery life which is crappie I have had two Apple iPods and two iPhone they were the 4 32 GB & 5s 64 GB now on Android your apps get updated every 3 months on Apple sometimes twice a week IOS updates are twice month at least I bought my iPhone 5s 64 GB which started with iOS 7 in 2014 now it got iOS 10.1.1 it seems the IOS are getting worse not better it freezes crashes most apps lot of the app you can’t even post two year let alone one day old photo I can get on my Samsung Galaxy S3 with 3 year old photos on it and post photos off it to any app only reason I like the small iPhones I can collect lot photos that way I can post to my apps like now I got over 106K photos on my 5s 64 GB which you can’t do with big phones only problems I got with iPhones are updates on apps and IOS’S like this month iOS 10.2 supposedly be coming out it seems the new IOS’s don’t really fixing any problems you get on your iPhone it just give you different problems while you still have the same old problems you also got figure Apple iPhones are about 3 years behind Android phones on new ideals 11/18/2016 Nick Reply Apple!?

From the moment you boot up ios, there are restrictions to what you can do with your phone. Can you flash IOS9 to iphone4s? Guess what, my old galaxy s2 is already running marshmallow like a charm and i think both of them were released in the same year. and i am in the process of flashing Latest nougat 7.1 cyanogenmod version on my s6 edge. You are writing about malware crap which is misleading. New android versions since lollipop allow users to modify app permissions but i think you are so caught up in app constrained ecosystem, you didn’t noticed. IOS isn’t secure anymore as we thought it was. Su vulnerability has already been fixed and there is no more stagefright bug in android. And you obviously have no idea about the difference between android based phones and android phones. Most of the Phones from samsung, htc, sony etc run Custom Android based OS, They are actually custom build port of android, not real android phones, so obviously there will be some issues too if you try to port IOS on samsung. A high end smartphone can go head to head with iphone in each and every aspect. My s6 edge is not even a tad slower than iphone 6, in fact, it performs even better. The slowdown overtime can be experience on low end smartphone. Obviously the one writing this comment has no idea about fstrim. Stop posting such nonsense crap in order to get traffic to your website. 11/25/2016 ashford Reply I have never once had a problem with android phones, but decided to switch it up as IPhones are the ‘in thing’ It was okay for a few months, but soon started having plenty of issues with speed, memory and doing basic things. I decided to upgrade it to the 7, which turned out to be just as bad. For the price, they should be giving people something amazing, not mediocrity! P.S. How much did they apple pay you for such a bad article. 12/03/2016 Brandon McLean Reply You didn’t mention how Apple has a much smaller battery, late software updates, unneeded restrictions, is insanely overpriced, and most of all, Apples processor specs come in at a fraction of what Androids of the same price have, AKA 1.6 GHZ (Apple iPhones) vs 2.4 GHZ (ASUS, Galaxy S7, OnePlus all running Android), 2 GB of RAM (Apple) vs 4 GB of RAM (Android). Android is by far the superior technology. Your only argument is that Android uses Google’s superior sharing system, rather than their own like Apple does. 12/14/2016 Keith Llewellyn Reply For me, it’s all about security, and Apple has the best. Also, if you buy an iPhone you get updates and support for a couple of years more than Google provides for it’s own Nexus or Pixel phones. Two years worth of updates for the OS and Three years for security updates FROM THE DATE OF FIRST INTRODUCTION is totally inadequate. It means that you have to buy a new google phone from the date it is first available in order to really benefit from the updates. 12/27/2016 Apple Marketing Machine Reply Let’s compare the “core” features of a new iphone to a 2 year old android phone: iphone 7 plus – Released 2016, September Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Released 2014, October iphone 7 plus – 1080 x 1920 pixels (~401 ppi pixel density) Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – 1440 x 2560 pixels (~518 ppi pixel density) iphone 7 plus – Quad-core 2.23 GHz Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Quad-core 2.7 GHz iphone 7 plus – 12 MP camera Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – 16 MP camera iphone 7 plus – Non-removable Li-Ion 2900 mAh battery Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Removable Li-Ion 3220 mAh battery okay…you can have your “better looking apps”. 12/28/2016 MACKabiVIPer42 Reply Yes Android phones are better everything wise but iPhone battery is better last as long as up to 3 to 4 years Samsung last up to 6 months I know had S3 and HTC 1 still got S3 3rd battery it’s just iPod on second iPhone first one was iPhone 4 32 GB lasted 4 years got iPhone 5s 64 GB it’s over 2 yrs old but don’t use for taking photos just for collecting photos which small iPhone can collect up too 100K photos like my iPhone 5s I’m not SELFIE PERSON where I got take photo of my self in every window mirror and bathroom I love stealing other people photos like Anime ladies in bikinis to post on my other apps even Animals if they are cute enough yes Apple do make there apps crappie and there IOS’s also which crashes and freezes a lot then half time you can’t post photos or articles from your e-mail too the apps but I take Apple for small phone over android big phone 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply More pixels require more energy and chip performance. To human eye it looks the same screen. It’s same as you put truck engine in a car for same volume of fuel. Do you really need that for your serious business tasks? Kids need that for games only… 12/27/2016 Bas Reply This brought my iq down by 10 points, iphone users aren’t bothered by that because they dont have any iq points to lose. This list is pure “i don’t like it so that means android is bad” and “its apple so whatever it does it’s genius”. if you’ve ever ACTUALLY went from crapple to android (unlike 99% of the comments here that say they have but in reality… well) you would notice a LOT of improvements over crapple. 1: The price to quality ratio is MUCH better that apple’s. 2: More customisation options. Unless you count changing your phone cover as “customizing”. 3: It’s not apple, so it’s better (see what i did there? I did the shit apple fanboy’s do) 4: No dumb “inovations”. 5: Simplifying things and making something that takes 3 seconds isn’t better, Sony, Samsung etc focus on more important things to improve. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply Well you sound like Forest Gump in his movie when he said that his friend opened Apple company for selling fruits…. You don’t know what Apple is…. 12/30/2016 Joe Reply iPhones are more compatible with other devices if you have an iPad and Mac. But if you’re like majority of people and have a Windows computer that’s a lie. I installed iTunes once and my computer was never the same again. It was slower and crashed more often untill I uninstalled it. With Android you don’t have to install anything to put music on your phone. 01/02/2017 Dusty72 Reply This post is really interesting, but why it is on 15th place in google’s search results. It deserves to be in top 5. Many webmasters think that seo is dead in 2016, but it is not true. There is sneaky method to reach google’s top 5 that not many people know. Simply search for: pandatsor’s tools 01/03/2017 Marcelino Reply I’d have to say if you think the last iPhone was 2 years ago then you know nothing about it. I have a android galaxy tab 3 and the iPod 6 generation and if I was to choose which is better it’s definitely Apples product and I never would get an android again. When I got my android new at Walmart it couldn’t even get the latest version, it was completely unbelievable. After I had it for 3 months it slowed down on me and its battery life is horrible. Now when I bought this IPod new I’ve had it for a double the time now and it works like new and best of all it can get the latest version. The quality of Apple is way better. In my opinion the iPhone is the best visual quality I’ve seen yet. Ive done some decent gaming on them and if you want something to save your progress then forget android, because not all the game link to your google play account so if you reset it the ones that don’t link are gone. Unlike apple I haven’t had any issues with it. I’ve lost decent money and progress on android because of it. Yes Apple does come out with the newest technology a bit latter then android but you can see it it a good way or a bad. The bad way would be that their slow, the good way you can see it as if their watching googles failing parts and their making it better. 01/03/2017 Marcelino Reply Also I can see you all are fighting over this topic which is pretty stupid. To be honest you can’t necessarily compare them. Everyone is different so everyone is going to want something different. If we all wanted android or we all wanted Apple we would become robots. If you wanted to find a phone to get then get into inside detail to see what your looking for. If you wanted fun texting and want to be more secure then go straight for apple because they got the best for that but if you wanted fun lock screens or be able to put micro SD cards and changeable batteries then go for android but let me remind you that anyone can take the SD card out and take your information. Hope this helps. 01/04/2017 LOREN FOK Reply people will buy iphone just because thats what everyone else has they dont even know what they are buying. They think because its popular its the best choice..all robots who don’t think for themselves 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply Since it’s more popular it’s better … 01/04/2017 farafit Reply i read almost every comments and keep deciding what should i buy: an android or iphone. i own android for 8 years now (from the era when sony ericsson still existed) and got so accustomed to it. i changed devices for 4 times during the 8 years because i want to get spec updates regularly. i love the fact that it is very simple in android: you can buy any android device you want and you will feel like you never changed your phone. contact, picture, apps, music will all still be the same as in the old phone. i heard that iphone is more stable compared to android so i am thinking of switching but i am genuinely scared the switch will cost me more: i will have to buy new headphones, mac (because many say that iphones does not connect well with pc), and i am very clumsy so i’m scared of scattering my iphone screen and will need to pay more to repair it. my husband owns a 4s and it still works until now, and it is true that android has shorter lifespan for a clumsy user like me because after some point android will keep hanging.. but still i think android is perfect for people like me who doesn’t really have the money to be a vivid apple follower.. i don’t want to be all attached to itunes.. i dont want to be obliged to buy a macbook to operate my iphone well.. i just don’t really like to spend almost all of my earnings to buy a single phone, when at the same time the same amount of money can be used to buy an android and a pc, and a vacuum cleaner.. maybe someday i will switch to apple products altogether when i have a mountain pile of money to spend.. but for now i am quite happy with a middle-end android phone and will stick to it.. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply As they say: expensive shoes last longer… 01/10/2017 Frank McConnell Reply iPhones are better than androids, PERIOD. At least we don’t get viruses, androids are very slow and lag A LOT! iPhones are really fast, while androids have “better specs” than every iPhone in the world. Wow, people here in the comments are blind as heck, like have you people ever used and iPhone before? Think before you speak. 01/13/2017 Angwell Reply I have used an android phone for the last 20 yrs and just in the last 2 yrs switched to an iPhone. Sure there may be more that an android can do ( provided you download appropriate apps) but as a comment above made, after a month or 2 the android starts slowing down dramatically. With the iPhone this does not happen. BUT the major improvement that will keep me with the iPhone is security !!!!!! 01/17/2017 Shivanki Sharma Reply Well said Josh Smith… But My view about your article is…No one can said this iPhone is better or Android is not Or Vice-Versa until you are not aware of their pros as well. There are alot to know about these two before making your mind to go for iPhone or Android, one of them. Both phones have their own features and plus points.

Most of the alleged superiorities are interoperabilty between iPhones (iMessage, Airdrop) or between iPhone and other Apple devices (Handoff) – if you are a PC owner, or have a large number of friends or fellow users on Android, these advantages are insignificant at best. I will concede that updates and lack of carrier bloatware are significant pluses, the author is doing an extreme disservice to new users by basically promoting an iPhone prejudice. 01/31/2017 Matt Perkins Reply iPhones win over Android smartphones for these 5 critical reasons. Security, Privacy, Stability, Performance and Usability. iOS gets far less malware than Android, it has far less critical vulnerabilities than Android. Vulnerabilities are patched quicker in iOS. iOS crashes and freezes less than Android, Apple doesn’t harvest data to sell like Google does (Google has even started collecting identifiable data since they released their new voice assistant). iOS is a faster OS than Android is while Android smartphones slow down faster than the iPhone does. And of course iOS offers the better out of box experience. Not to mention you can never make Android as secure as iOS, only close to as secure. Part of the reason is even if you tweak your Android settings to be similar to iOS, the official Google Play Store gets far more malware than the AppStore and Cydia combined. So only way to even remotely match it is not download apps or games. My other favorite part of iOS over Android is the fact you can use true adblockers in iOS, not just adblock browsers without the need to root or jailbreak. Google will never allow you to block ads in Chrome or block all ads third party ads without rooting. And as you knowing rooting and jailbreaking merely lowers the security of the OS. That’s another thing Jailbroken iOS is more secure than untouched Android as long as you stick to the default repos in Cydia. 02/01/2017 Shaun Anderson Reply Android Download from unknown sources like a regular computer Download files from browser Plug in and transfer anything to and from computer. File System. Just acts more like a computer in regards to freedom to do as you will where iPhone is locked down like a game system. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply You can do all that in iTunes. iPhone is more careful to protect data while android is less careful.

Who really cares if the poor sods on the other side of the world live the lives of slaves? Who cares if they have to stand ALL day, and ASK for pissbreaks? Who cares if the companies solution to suicides are suicide nets around buildings and removing knives? Who cares if the iphone costs a dollar to make, but sold for $600? Who cares if most of the jobs are not in the countries paying for the status symbols? So lets be clear, its all about “im better than you because i can waste money on bling, and *&$! your community at the same time”. 02/18/2017 exycheezy Reply I’ve had both. many times. I’ve had every version of the iPhone. I’ve never had an Android phone update properly. My 3 year old plays on my old 2nd gen iPhone that has the latest IOS on it. . .. android can’t do that. with the exception of a Verizon flip phone, every single Android phone I’ve ever had got a virus, crashed and I had to reset to factory settings at least 2 times per phone. I have never, ever ever got a virus on ANY Apple product, and never had to put any software or app to keep it running correctly. As far as customization? Who cares. If you’re so busy and have so much time to waste trying to impress everyone with crazy fonts and wild customization, the iPhone is way to sleek, sophisticated and user -friendly for you. Software dictates hardware. The IOS blows Android OS away. And, any (anyone who’s actually worked on both will agree) Apple product gets sometimes twice the speed out of less RAM and processing than ANY other OS (Windows or Android). Give me stability anytime. so your phone has an expandable memory? What good is it when it won’t run half the time. Have a nice day all. . .. .after all, they’re just phones. . .. right? 02/19/2017 Richie Reply Some things to add (pros and cons) as a PC & Android guy that just switched to iPhone (but I’m staying on PC): 1) The iOS versions of Microsoft apps are better than the Android ones and they work great. 2) Article is correct: the iOS versions of apps are generally better than their Android counterparts, in ways you will notice. It’s really kind of a shame for Android – I don’t get why they don’t just match the exact app. 3) Lightning is neat but I found MicroUSB more useful, since it’s used for more devices, i.e. I have a MicroUSB running from my desk to my PC to charge my wireless mouse, and then I would also use it to charge my phone sometimes. 4) Yes I do miss customization heaven with Android, but this iPhone runs like total butter. Android runs WELL but this thing is so zippy and responsive – you wouldn’t believe it until you spent time with one. 5) ALSO customization isn’t as cut-off as it used to be with iOS. Some apps can latch onto some functions in the phone, kinda like installing an extension for your desktop browser. It’s something. Really I just bought an iPhone to “try something new” and I’m really liking it. 02/28/2017 Toby Reply Just do a Quick google search iphone is less reliable than Android, theres your Answer in the studies. End of debate… 03/01/2017 Viking Sheep Reply These comparisons are so lame… Eg: Country X is much better than the rest of the world, because the rest of the world have varying standards, while Country X has only 1 level of corruption. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply First: great respect to Steve Jobs who dedicated his life to Apple iPhone invention and to make communication better more joyful between people. Also to feel the power and beauty of technology in your hand. How I wished that Isaac Newton or Ainstein or Nikola Tessa or… would see what we have today… Second: iPhone is far more serious for people who want job to be done as fast and simpler way without delays. Android phones are for kids who like customizations and pretty colors and to look like iron man or similar… Third: iPhone is made of better materials. And looks for business high class. Android phones are copying iPhone’s look especially Samsung. Fourth: iPhone technology, the software and hardware gives you exactly what you need. No more no less. Android technologies gives you extra things which are seldom used and are simply extra using more battery and device performance. Fifth: iPhone has a specific style in design. Keeping updating same style to better one making it each time better and better. Sixth: Applications on iPhone are much better with much less defects than Android. At the end, I had various Samsung, Sony, Huawei, Htc and iPhone phones. I choose iPhone. Now I have iPhone 6s+ black limited edition with golden Apple. It’s very nice piece of equipment. at the bottom line, Apollo 11 travelled to the moon using Fortan on its 360 kb computer. Today we are talking of gigs bytes. So I respect both iPhone and Android technologies for their great effort and progress. Competition shall exist to make difference and better.

HomeKit Apple debuts a new Home app website to show how its devices work in a smart home Posted Mar 2, 2017 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story The Pixel 2.0 is a tiny OLED screen for your wearable Arduino pleasure Apple is touting the home automation capabilities of iOS and Apple TV on a newly updated website for its HomeKit software and its related Home app. The page now includes a new 45-second video that demonstrates the Home app for iOS 10 in action, showing a woman operating a range of devices from her phone, including the Honeywell Lyric Round thermostat, Kwikset smart lock, and iHome smart plug. The video takes you through the woman’s day, beginning with waking up and telling Siri good morning, which turns on a ceiling fan and raises the blinds, then starting the connected coffee maker by tapping on a Home app scene called “Breakfast Time.” Later, the woman changes the thermostat’s temperature, locks the house, and shuts off the AC. When she returns, she taps “I’m Home” on her iPhone’s screen, which switches on the lights and re-opens the blinds. The video also shows her interacting with Siri on the Apple TV to watch movies and using an iPad Pro to issue other commands. The video is meant to demonstrate what life in a smart home feels like, and how Apple’s products can fit in. However, the challenge for consumers today is that many of the connect home devices are still pricey, and the additional value they add is minimal in some cases. After all, it’s not all that difficult to raise your own blinds or brew your own coffee. The new website itself has also been redesigned, breaking up the various features of the Home app into different sections. One focuses on Apple’s compatibility with over 50 brands’ connected devices; another shows off the way the Home app works to group your accessories by room; and a third focuses on the “scenes” you can configure. This is where you combine a set of actions to be triggered with just a tap or your voice – like those shown in the video. Another section details Siri integration with HomeKit-enabled products, and offers a list of sample commands. The last couple of sections explain how Apple TV can work as the home’s “hub,” allowing you to access your home remotely through your iOS device. The layout of the new site is similar to other Apple product pages, and comes at a time when Apple is facing increased competition in the smart home space. Thanks to Amazon’s Alexa platform, embodied by the Echo speaker line of products, Amazon has sneaked its way into the space by offering a consumer-friendly, voice computing platform for listening to music and using various apps, called Skills. But it has also given Amazon a position to take on Apple and others in becoming the centralized hub for managing your home’s devices – and one that doesn’t require an iOS phone or Apple TV. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase HomeKit Description HomeKit is a framework in iOS 8 for communicating with and controlling connected accessories in a user’s home.

Today it's being reported that Interflex and Samsung Electro-Mechanics are beefing up production of flexible printed circuit boards (or FPCBs) for Apple's upcoming iPhone 8, the first iPhone to adopt organic light-emitting diode screens.   The Bell, who broke the first story about Interflex being a new Apple supplier, now reports today that Interflex plans a new production facility to handle Apple's work later this year that will cost US$866 million.   "FPCB connects chips to parts such as displays and cameras. Apple will secure the part for its new OLED iPhone from three Korean suppliers, including the Samsung unit, Interflex and BH.   Apple is expected to adopt OLED for about 60 million units or 40 percent of the iPhone 8 this year and double the adoption next year. It aims to use OLED for all its new iPhones by 2019."   Orders for each supplier will be decided when the production starts in April or May.       About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Karen McColl Special to The Globe and Mail Published Monday, Mar. 06, 2017 5:38AM EST Last updated Monday, Mar. 06, 2017 2:52PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print The warranty on your iPhone is long gone and you’ve just cracked the screen or damaged it by spilling coffee on it. Where is the best place to get it repaired? Is it better to go to Apple or will an independent repair shop do the trick? The answer depends on factors like repair time, part quality and, of course, price. Kundan Joshi, CEO of TheAppLabb in Toronto, says his company buys AppleCare extended coverage for all its iPhones and therefore uses Apple repair almost exclusively. “It’s hard to vouch whether an unauthorized repair shop will use the right parts or will use the right protocols and so on,” Mr. Joshi says. “Usually we find it much safer and easier to use Apple’s repairing.” But Mr. Joshi says there are downsides to Apple repair. “Sometimes it can be hard to get an appointment when you need it. Sometimes the wait can be long as well.” To get an iPhone repaired at an Apple Store, an appointment has to be booked online. The phones can also be mailed back to Apple for repair, or sent in through an Apple-authorized service provider (AASP), which could be anything from an Apple-dedicated repair shop to a London Drugs store. Some AASPs only offer exchanges for iPhones covered by warranty or AppleCare. When a phone is mailed to Apple for repair, the turnaround time can be weeks. Apple says repairs at its stores can take up to five business days. Independent repair shops are generally much faster, offering same-day service for common repairs such as replacing a screen, battery, charging port or camera, and cost less than Apple’s out-of-warranty fees. The challenge is finding a shop offering high-quality repairs in addition to time and cost savings. You get what you pay for Alex Sebastian, cofounder of Toronto’s Orchard, recommends doing some research before choosing a shop. Mr. Sebastian’s company sells pre-owned iPhones and, before hiring an in-house technician, he had hundreds of them repaired through independent shops. “If a price is low, it means they’re either buying cheap parts, which is very problematic, or they’re skimping on labour, which is also pretty problematic.” Mr. Sebastian recommends checking online reviews and asking repair technicians about part quality (Grade ‘A’ parts are the best non-Apple parts on the market). Steer clear of shops with lower-than- average prices, he advises. Having an iPhone repaired by a third-party shop will void most existing Apple warranties, because Apple doesn’t support the use of independent shops for repairs on any of its devices. “Apple-certified repairs are performed by trusted experts who use genuine Apple parts,” a company spokesperson wrote in an e-mail. “Only Apple-certified repairs are backed by Apple.” That said, some shops offer warranties of their own. Kyle Jagassar, owner of Matrix Mobile repair shops in Winnipeg, guarantees his company’s parts and service with a limited lifetime warranty. The 18-year-old (he opened his first Matrix location at age 16) says he went to great efforts to find the best parts supplier for that reason. “It’s a bit more than what our competitors pay for parts but it’s going to be worth it,” he says. “You can probably get your phone fixed for a lot cheaper in the mall or something, but you’re not going to have the best parts and that quality control.” Mr. Jagassar’s formula is working so far; he opened his second Matrix Mobile location in Winnipeg last spring. Darren Lindwall, owner of BK iPhone Repairs in Vancouver, builds customer confidence by doing repairs in front of the customer, so they can see what he is doing. Mr. Lindwall has been in business for seven years and says he competes with Apple by offering fast service and a wide range of repairs. “I can fix certain things that aren’t recognized according to Apple, such as fixing a WiFi antenna in an iPhone 6,” he says. “I’ve had phones dropped off rollercoasters that I’ve fixed.” Most of the time, it will be cheaper to get an out-of-warranty iPhone repaired with an independent shop than Apple, but not when a new iPhone is released. Since there aren’t many iPhone 7 parts and tools on the market yet, independent shops have to pay a premium for them. For that reason, both Matrix and BK charge about $275 for an iPhone 7 screen replacement compared to Apple’s $169 out-of-warranty cost. “I have an iPhone 7 – I can’t go to my own business now, I have to go to Apple – I’m forced to,” says Mr. Jagassar. Security and data-wiping One potentially major difference between repair options is that Apple erases iPhone data before repairing them, whereas independent shops do not have to. Wiping the data means taking the phone back to its out-of-the-box state. That protects customers from potential data breaches, but it could also mean losing all the photos, apps and phone numbers that haven’t been recently backed up. Orchard’s Mr. Sebastian says customers should take steps to protect themselves, if they can. “Obviously the best practice would certainly be backing up your [iPhone] at home and wiping your phone before you bring it in.” Mr. Sebastian says he’s been in shops where they’ve asked for the customer’s screen-unlock password so they can check the phone after it’s been fixed, to make sure it works. Mr. Jagassar says technicians at Matrix will never ask a customer for a pass code. “We always do start-up checks in front of our customers and they enter the pin in so we can do a system check to ensure the repair went smoothly.” He says customers can erase their data ahead of time if they want to, but it’s not necessary because Matrix guarantees data safety. He says his technicians’ backgrounds are checked before they are hired and his tech lab is under 24-hour surveillance. The bottom line, according to Mr. Sebastian, is that the more professional the shop is, the more it can be trusted in all aspects of repair.

Because, OnePlus 3T Saurabh Singh   |   @singh_saurabh10 Last Updated: MAR 06, 2017 New Delhi Email Author Apple has silently announced an all new 32 gig version of the iPhone 6. Previously spotted in Taiwan, the new iPhone 6 (32GB) is now available in India at a staggering low price of Rs 28,999 on Amazon . But, there's a catch. This version of the iPhone 6 will be available at its introductory low price for just one day. The limited period offer ends on March 7, according to the e-retailer. Also Read: OnePlus 3 review: Flagship killer that will make you want to settle But, look at it this way, the 16GB version of the iPhone 6 is available on the same website for Rs 30,399. An iPhone 6 with 32GB of internal memory at Rs 28,999, therefore, seems to be a killer deal, at least on paper. Not so much when you take into consideration that the iPhone 6 is an almost three year old smartphone now. And then there's the OnePlus 3T. Both the iPhone 6 and the OnePlus 3T have full-metal unibodies. Both the phones scream premium from every nook and corner. Design is, of course, subjective. The iPhone 6 and the OnePlus 3T will mean different things to different people and that's understandable. Also, a lot will depend on how someone perceives their ideal smartphone to be. While the iPhone 6 is a 4.7-inch phone, the OnePlus 3T is a 5.5-inch one. Both the phones have front-mounted fingerprint scanners. The OnePlus 3T, additionally, has physical capacitive keys that are also backlit. The front of the OnePlus 3T is carved out of 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass 4 while in the case of the iPhone 6 you get an ion-strengthened (curved) glass with oleophobic coating to protect from accidental spillage. If you were to talk about screen-to-body ratio, the OnePlus 3T wins hands down. The iPhone 6, because it has wide chunky bezels, offers less real estate. Both the phones come with toggle switches to control/limit the kind of notification alerts that you want at any given time. While the iPhone 6 comes with a 4.7-inch HD IPS LCD display (750x1334 pixels) the OnePlus 3T has a 5.5-inch 1080p Optic AMOLED screen. While the OnePlus 3T offers punchy, oversaturated colours with deep blacks, the iPhone 6 offers a more neutral colour palette. The OnePlus 3T is powered by Qualcomm's top-of-the-line Snapdragon 821 processor (Quad-core 2x2.35 GHz Kryo & 2x1.6 GHz Kryo) clubbed with Adreno 530 GPU and 6GB of RAM. It comes with 64GB of internal memory at similar pricing. The iPhone 6, on the other hand, is powered by Apple's two-generation old A8 mobile processor (Dual-core 1.4 GHz Typhoon) clubbed with PowerVR GX6450 GPU and 1GB of RAM. Now, you can argue -- all you want - that an iPhone is slicker than an Android phone, and it is. But, a two-generation old processor is still a two-generation old processor. You can do the math now. Then, there's the software. While the OnePlus 3T runs Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow-based OxygenOS (upgradable to Android Nougat) the iPhone 6 ships with a two-generation old iOS 8 (upgradable to iOS 10.2). Although, the iPhone 6 is upgradable to Apple's latest software, it must be know, that older phones not fully supporting new software update isn't surprising, even in the case of Apple. This is because most of the software features are designed keeping hardware in mind. You can't expect to run everything as smooth as butter on old-gen hardware. Every new major iOS update seemingly has a reputation of slowing down an older iPhone/iPad leaving users both anxious and reluctant whether to upgrade or not. And just so you know, iOS 11 is coming. The OnePlus 3Tsports a 16-megapixel camera on the rear with f/2.0 aperture, phase detection autofocus, OIS and LED flash. It supports 4K video recording as well. The iPhone 6, on the other hand, comes with an 8-megapixel rear camera with f/2.2 aperture, phase detection autofocus and dual-LED (dual tone) flash. 4K video recording isn't supported. On the front, while the OnePlus 3T has a 16-megapixel camera, the iPhone 6 has a 1.2-megapixel camera. While the OnePlus 3T is backed by a 3,400mAh battery, the iPhone 6 has a 1,810mAh battery inside. I am sure, you've all heard about OnePlus' Dash Charging functionality. Additionally, the OnePlus 3T is a dual-SIM smartphone, while the iPhone 6 supports only single-SIM. If you're into that sort of thing, that is. It must be clearly understood that the iPhone 6 isn't a bad smartphone. But, come to think of it, it doesn't belong in the world we live in today unless of course you absolutely have to have one. Even if you're a die-hard Apple fan, the iPhone SE makes more sense than the iPhone 6. You will get a smaller 4-inch screen but all the latest in hardware and software. After all, the 4-inch iPhone from Apple is everything that the iPhone 6S is (save 3D Touch) only in a 5S-esque body which means that it is a relatively newer-generation phone. For everything else, there is the OnePlus 3T. Also Read: Does Apple want iPhone SE to be part of dream team?

So it comes as no surprise that a follow-up model is on the way later this year. Rick Osterloh is the head of Google's hardware department and he confirmed during an appearance at Mobile World Congress that the Pixel 2 was on the way. "There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it," he told AndroidPit.com .

The Pixel won favour for being a high-end smartphone with build quality to rival the likes of Apple. It was also free of the usual bloatware that accompanies most Android handsets. Osterloh confirmed that the next Pixel will stick to the premium design that worked so well last time. Unfortunately, that probably means a similar price tag to the £599 starting price of the current Pixel . "Pixel stays premium," Osterloh said. Read More Death of the bezel?

Therefore, we may not see a new Pixel until October 2017 - which would allow it to compete directly with the upcoming iPhone 8 .

By Aaron Ricadela. Added by Agency Staff on 6 March 2017. Saved under Editor's pick Tags: Alastair Curtis, Amazon, Apple, Bracken Darrell, Google, Logitech, Microsoft Tweet Since Bracken Darrell took over Logitech International four years ago, the company’s stock has quadrupled on robust sales of snazzy PC accessories that complement products by the likes of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google. But as Darrell plots his next move, those heavyweights are starting to look more like competitors than partners. Darrell’s goal: tying together TVs, appliances and voice-controlled devices — an area many of the globe’s biggest tech companies are trying to crack. “They want to be at the centre of connected homes but you’ve got to sleep with one eye open” because erstwhile allies may well become rivals, said IDC analyst Jonathan Gaw. Darrell insists the new strategy won’t be a dramatic change from the way Logitech has long operated. Its keyboards, wireless mice and neighborhood-rattling speakers have always fitted into the larger PC market, and in newer, faster-growing categories, Darrell has sought to make his offerings work with those of tech giants. Logitech’s UE Boom speakers understand Apple’s Siri and Google Now, its remotes use Amazon’s Alexa to control everything from TVs to lights and heating, and its accessories can turn iPads into mini laptops. Even as he pushes deeper into the smart home, Darrell says Logitech can find niches that will be profitable without raising the ire of the industry’s leaders. “There’s no way these big players are going to want to be in every little puddle around their operating systems,” says Darrell, 55, slouched in an Eames-inspired chair in Logitech’s Innovation Centre at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, a top Swiss technical university with long ties to the company. “We’ve always been in categories where the big players are.” To fund that strategy, Darrell aims to wring maximum profits from his PC mouse and keyboard business, which racks up sales of almost US$1bn/year with gross margins approaching 50%. That will let him enter new areas such as voice-controlled devices, video collaboration, and augmented-reality games. Investors will get an outlook for the fiscal year that starts in April at a meeting with Logitech management on 7 March in New York. Tavis McCourt, an analyst at Raymond James in Nashville, praises Darrell for turning around a company that was “really struggling to define what it was”. McCourt says he expects Logitech to develop keyboards for Internet-connected TVs and a device that might take voice commands for home automation, like Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home. The big hitters have a massive advantage over Logitech, which has historically been better at commercialising others’ inventions than developing its own. Logitech, whose revenue is forecast to reach $2,2bn this year, devotes less than $150m annually to research and development. Microsoft last year spent about $12bn, Google $14bn and Amazon $16bn. That could make it tough for Logitech to build products with enough sophistication to command premium prices, said Torsten Sauter, head of Swiss Research at broker Kepler Cheuvreux. “The smart home looks difficult” for Logitech to crack, Sauter said. “They have no software, no ecosystem. Logitech is much more a design company than a tech company.” Logitech CEO Bracken Darrell Darrell joined Logitech after four years at Whirlpool and stints at General Electric and Procter & Gamble, where he ran Braun, the German maker of high-design shavers and clocks. His predecessor had been ousted in 2011 after profit cuts and a $34m writedown for the Revue, a keyboard for Google TV. Darrell says the company had lost its focus on design. “We had let our products slip and were just making black plastic,” Darrell said. While revenue was largely flat in Darrel’s first three years as he focused on cutting costs and shutting down or selling less-profitable businesses, retail sales this year are expected to grow at least 12% excluding currency fluctuations. More important, profit has more than tripled under Darrell. Darrell says he can succeed by stressing design and marketing to create hits like the UE Boom speakers, as well as novelties such as a “silent” mouse and a wireless dock for phones that lets users toggle between typing on their PC screen and smartphone. And Logitech has a long tradition of buying its way into new categories. The company in 2008 purchased Ultimate Ears, now its UE division, which represents 15% of Logitech’s sales and is growing at 25% annually. Last year, Darrell paid $50m for Jaybird, a Utah start-up that makes wireless headphones for runners, and he agreed to buy Saitek, a maker of mock steering wheels and airplane sticks for gamers, for $13m. Darrell says projects in the works include cloud services tied to Logitech products, such as storing video collected by home-surveillance cameras. He points to Spotlight, a $130 remote for presentations, as an example of the hardware and software integration and higher-quality manufacturing Logitech is shooting for. Its weighty aluminum feel and simple three-button design are reminiscent of Apple products, and it works with both Windows and Macs to highlight specific areas of a computer screen. Further out, Logitech is researching how gestures may replace computer mice and looking into devices designed for use in self-driving cars, said Alastair Curtis, a Nokia veteran Darrell hired in 2013 as design chief. “When I first joined, Logitech was not in a good place,” Curtis said. “I gave a brutal assessment.” Now, he says he’s happy with the company’s direction and position in relation to tech’s agenda-setters. “We’re closer to Apple than ever before.”  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 9Is it all over for Internet banking? 6Zuma orders welfare grants be paid 6Chaos as welfare payments crisis deepens 5Bank of Baroda ‘closing’ Gupta accounts 5SqwidNet IoT network now live in Gauteng Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

Apple never officially launched the 32 GB model of iPhone 6, however, the 32 GB variant became live on most Apple stores online in the past few days. Now Apple has officially launched the 32 GB iPhone 6 in India exclusively on Amazon for a price of Rs. 28,999. The 32 GB variant of the iPhone 6 is available with this introductory discount, valid till 7th March’17. Amazon is also providing exchange offers to customers for this variant of the iPhone 6. The 32 GB variant of the iPhone 6 is available in the Space Grey colour. While this iPhone 6 variant was already available in China since February it is expected in the Gold colour from 10 March. The iPhone 6 while 2 generations old, still runs the latest iOS 10 and according to Amazon is one of their hottest selling phones. The 32 Gb will help users make a better choice for storage without spending for the 64 GB variant. Since the iPhone does not have microSD expandability. The rear snapper on the iPhone 6 has an 8MP sensor with PDAF and dual-LED flash, whereas the front camera has a 1.2MP sensor. Reports suggest that the 32 GB variant of the iPhone 6 is available in India only via Amazon, and the chances of it showing up at offline retail shops or other e-commerce websites is slim. Amazon may also make available the Gold variant at a later date. likethis What's your reaction?

Now this small showdown could have a big impact Farmer and technician Kyle Schwarting, from Ceresco, Nebraska, in the cab of his Case IH tractor. Photograph: Olivia Solon for the Guardian Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Olivia Solon in San Francisco Monday 6 March 2017 06.00 EST Last modified on Monday 6 March 2017 14.25 EST There are corn and soy fields as far as the eye can see around Kyle Schwarting’s home in Ceresco, Nebraska. The 36-year-old farmer lives on a small plot of land peppered with large agricultural machines including tractors, planters and a combine harvester. Parked up in front of his house is a bright red 27-ton Case tractor which has tracks instead of wheels. It’s worth about $250,000, and there’s a problem with it: an in-cab alarm sounds at ten-minute intervals to alert him to a faulty hydraulic connector he never needs to use. Why the digital era is destined to fail us | Oliver Burkeman Read more Because farm machinery is now so high-tech, the only way to silence the error message is by plugging in a special diagnostic tool – essentially a computer loaded with troubleshooting software that connects to a port inside the tractor – to identify and resolve the problem. Only manufacturers and authorized dealers are allowed that tool, and they charge hundreds of dollars in call-out fees to use it. For a fifth-generation farmer in an increasingly squeezed industry, whose family has spent decades fixing the equipment they paid for, it’s a tough pill to swallow. He’s coped with the intermittent alarm sound for almost a year. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Farmer and technician Kyle Schwarting from Ceresco, Nebraska wants the right to fix his own hi-tech farm equipment. Photograph: Olivia Solon for the Guardian “I can’t turn the alarm off. If I had the literature and capability to diagnose and fix it, it would already be done. I changed the mechanical switch and wire, but now I’m down to the programming,” he said Wednesday. Kyle is one of many farmers in the US fighting for the right to repair their equipment. He and others are getting behind Nebraska’s “Fair Repair” bill, which would require companies to provide consumers and independent repair shops access to service manuals, diagnostic tools and parts so they aren’t limited to a single supplier. They have an unlikely ally: repair shops for electronic items like iPhones, tablets and laptops who struggle to find official components and information to fix broken devices. This means the bill could benefit not just farmers but anyone who owns electronic goods. There’s also a benefit to the environment, as it would allow for more refurbishment and recycling instead of sending equipment to the landfill. Nebraska is one of eight states in the US – including Minnesota, New York, Massachusetts, Illinois, Wyoming, Tennessee and Kansas – seeking to pass “right to repair” legislation. All eyes will be on the Cornhusker state when the bill has its public hearing on 9 March, because its unique “unicameral legislature” (it’s the only state to have a single parliamentary chamber) means laws can be enacted swiftly. If this bill, officially named LB67, gets through, it may lead to a domino effect through the rest of the US, as happened with a similar battle over the right to repair cars. These Nebraska farmers are fighting for all of us. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A procession of horse travelling through Lincoln, Nebraska, to celebrate the state’s 150th anniversary Photograph: Olivia Solon for the Guardian Big agriculture and big tech – including John Deere, Apple and AT&T – are lobbying hard against the bill, and have sent representatives to the Capitol in Lincoln, Nebraska, to spend hours talking to senators, citing safety, security and intellectual property concerns. John Deere has gone as far as to claim that farmers don’t own the tractors they pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for, but instead receive a “license to operate the vehicle”. They lock users into license agreements that forbid them from even looking at the software running the tractor or the signals it generates. Squaring up to the corporates are grassroots activists like Kevin Kenney, 52, who has spent months educating fellow farmers and pounding the corridors of the Capitol building to counter the lobbyists’ fear-mongering. Kenney argues farmers are in effect being held to ransom when their machinery breaks down. “Before software, there wasn’t anything you couldn’t work on. It was all book and tools. Now it’s book and tools and software,” he said. Opening up the equipment will allow Nebraska’s farmers to expand their skills into computer science, allowing for ag-tech innovation in “Silicon Prairie”. The combination of the agricultural repair with electronic goods repair makes Kenney nervous: he thinks it’s going to be a harder fight with the attention and lobbying clout of technology giants. “Apple is going to throw too much money at it,” he said. Facebook Twitter Pinterest State senator Lydia Brasch sponsored the ‘Fair Repair’ bill in Nebraska. Photograph: Olivia Solon for the Guardian State senator Lydia Brasch, who sponsored the bill, described a meeting with the Apple lobbyist Steve Kester. “Apple said we would be the only state that would pass this, and that we would become the mecca for bad actors,” she said. The Cupertino-headquartered company also argued there was a safety risk associated having untrained people installing unofficial components, particularly lithium ion batteries – as demonstrated by Samsung’s Note 7 debacle. Apple also told Brasch that there were plenty of authorized repair shops to choose from. The state of Nebraska, which covers 77,000 sq miles (roughly the size of England and Scotland combined), has just one Apple Store. It’s an 80-mile journey for Brasch to get there, and it can take weeks to get a Genius Bar appointment. “It’s disruptive and inconvenient,” she said. It’s the same for authorized repair shops of agricultural equipment. Long waits for engineers can lead to costly downtime at critical weather-sensitive parts in the farming cycle, such as planting or harvesting. Brasch, who works as a software consultant and is married to a farmer, said that in her seven years in office, she had never experienced lobbying like it – even when she introduced a pro-life bill, which she recognizes is a “controversial issue”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Jason DeWater, founder of iFixOmaha in Omaha, Nebraska, wants access to official parts and tools. Photograph: Olivia Solon for the Guardian Jason DeWater, 36, is a former principal horn at the Omaha symphony orchestra. He founded a chain of repair shops in the city, called iFixOmaha. He and a team of skilled technicians repair smartphones – mostly iPhones – as well as tablets and laptops. He scoffs at the idea that independent repair shops are somehow unsafe; his staff go through several months of OSHA-certified training before they can even touch a customer’s phone. “We take full liability for our customers’ devices. If we make a mistake, we buy them a replacement device. In addition, our products are backed with a lifetime warranty,” he said. “Apple can’t even say that.” Not having official diagnostic and disassembly tools makes their job difficult, particularly as companies such as HTC design their products to make them tricky to even open without specific proprietary tools. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Kevin Kenney is leading a grassroots movement demanding the right to repair in Nebraska. Photograph: Olivia Solon for the Guardian He even went as far as contacting Apple to ask about the authorization process, but the company then looked at his website and told him he was engaged in “fraudulent activity”. By signing up with Apple he would not be permitted to mention any other smartphone manufacturer on his website nor would he be allowed to replace modular parts or remove screens. Instead, he’d have to send devices to an Apple service center, leaving customers without them for weeks instead of hours. “If we signed up, they would dictate the pricing and terms of service. We’d end up being a post office for Apple,” DeWater said. All he wants is the the ability to buy official components from Apple and others and the diagnostic software. “We’re not looking to access personal data. We’re certainly not trying to reverse-engineer Apple’s products. All we’re trying to do is fix customers’ devices.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest One of iFixOmaha’s technicians treating a water-damaged iPhone 6. Photograph: Olivia Solon for the Guardian Apple declined to comment, but emphasized that using authorized channels was the only way to ensure a user was getting genuine Apple parts and that the repair was done to the right specifications. John Deere declined to be interviewed but sent a lengthy statement outlining its concerns. The company doesn’t want people altering its copyright-protected code because, said director of public relations Ken Golden, “changes could lead to the unsafe operation of products, disruption of machine capabilities and performance, changes to emissions controls, voiding of warranties and lack of transparency to the changes when the equipment is sold to another user”. Despite the intense lobbying, farmers, electronic repair shops and state senators remain largely united, and frame the issue as one of corporate greed. “They see someone trying to share the sandbox and they don’t want anybody else to play in it,” said Brasch. “In my view, that’s not how our country was built. We are all about free enterprise and competition. That’s what makes us strong.” Farming Nebraska Apple Computing news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content most viewed The Guardian back to top home US politics world opinion sports soccer tech arts lifestyle fashion business travel environment selected all sections close home US politics world UK europe americas asia middle east africa australia cities development opinion sports soccer MLS NFL MLB NBA NHL soccer live scores tables competitions results fixtures clubs tech arts movies tv & radio music games books art & design stage classical lifestyle food recipes health & fitness love & sex family women home & garden fashion business economics sustainable business diversity & equality in business small business travel USA europe UK skiing environment selected climate change wildlife energy pollution science media crosswords blog editor quick cryptic prize quiptic genius speedy everyman azed video Environment › Farming Facebook Twitter jobs guardian labs subscribe all topics all contributors solve technical issue about us contact us work for us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop © 2017 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Now, a latest one from Nikkei Asian Review says that the premium iPhone 8 will feature a 5.8-inch OLED display while 4.7-inch Apple iPhone 7s and a 5.5-inch Apple iPhone 7s Plus will sport LCD displays. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities had also said that iPhone 8 will use a 5.8-inch OLED display of which 5.15 inches will be used for screen content while the rest is being reserved for a “function area” at the bottom that will house virtual buttons. The report further added that the larger screen size will help raise the average price of an iPhone, which is currently near $700. The premium iPhone 8 model is said to cost around $1000. The new iPhones are expected to feature iris scanner, wireless charging and come with other major changes as it is Apple’s 10th Anniversary.

Nikkei Asian Review - a trusted source on all things iPhone - is reporting Apple is working on a 5.8-inch OLED iPhone that will likely be the most expensive in the range. Previously Nikkei resisted rumors of there being a larger iPhone and instead reported there would be three phones with 4.7-inch, 5-inch and 5.5-inch screens. Nikkei must have some new information to change its mind on the topic of a larger iPhone, but it's a strong sign the rumor is true. A switch to OLED is looking likely for the next version of the iPhone but it seems a lack of supplies is why Apple is restricting it just to the larger version of the phone. Here we go again If this proves successful for Apple and there are enough sources of OLED panels we may see every iPhone with an OLED screen in 2018. A recent report also noted there would be what’s being toted as a “function area” at the bottom of the large screen iPhone, leaving the usable screen area at just 5.15-inches.  Whether Apple will claim this iPhone has a larger screen than the iPhone 7 Plus and whether the Touch ID fingerprint scanner will be removed remains to be seen. It’s also currently unclear what name the next iPhone range will take. It may be the iPhone 7S, but considering this is the 10 year anniversary of the original iPhone many are expecting Apple will skip right up to the iPhone 8.

A new report fresh from Japan claims that a 5.8-inch iPhone is currently in the works at Apple. While we have already heard this rumor, the latest one is particularly interesting as it comes from a publication which refuted the said speculation before. Nikkei Asian Review previously slammed reports that Apple’s next generation of iPhones will sport larger displays. 9to5 Mac recalls that the site instead claimed that Apple would introduce new 4.7-inch, 5-inch, and 5.5-inch iPhones this year. But recently, the Japanese publication retracted the statement and “confirmed” that 2017 will indeed bring us a 5.8-inch iPhone. For those hearing about these claims for the first time, what the Cupertino-based tech giant is apparently planning to do this year is to launch three configurations of its smartphone line. According to Apple Insider, two of these are “incremental updates” on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus nicknamed the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus, and the remaining is a top-of-the-line iPhone believed to be the iPhone 8. The standard models are expected to be the same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch options with LCD displays. However, the third one will come with an all new OLED display measuring a massive 5.8 inches. Assuming this is true, the iPhone 8 will be the company’s largest smartphone yet. It should also be significantly bigger than any current mass market smartphones. However, the upcoming Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus will likely change that. Biggest, Most Expensive iPhone Yet Nikkei further suggests it could be the most expensive iPhone Apple has ever released. This iPhone 8 prediction now matches the ones that were given by KGI Securities Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo who often makes accurate speculations. As previously reported, he claimed that the iPhone 8 could cost $1,000. Apple reportedly intends to make the display bigger to further hike the average sales price of the iPhone, which is already sitting at about $700. Although some old models like iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, and iPhone 7 are available below the $700 mark, many people prefer those with more expensive configurations. iphone8i.net iPhone 8 concept design. As usual, these are all but confirmed. Unfortunately, Apple has and will likely remain tight-lipped about its next iPhone until its official launch. The release date remains indefinite at this point either. A report last week claimed that the company may have to push back the release of the flagship iPhone model. This is due to OLED display supply constraints. It might not start iPhone 8 production until September of this year. This means the new device won’t be available for purchase in September as expected. However, the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus should enter production this July as scheduled.

Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations TechEye Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations Menu Microsoft and Safari browser use dying Posted on March 6, 2017 by Nick Farrell - Uncategorized It seems that the world has had enough of Microsoft and Apple’s browsers and all roads are starting to lead to Chrome. According to California-based analytics vendor Net Applications, from March 2015 to February 2017, the use of Microsoft’s IE and Edge on Windows and Apple’s Safari browser plummeted. Two years ago, the Volish browsers were run by 62 per cent of Windows PC owners. Last month, the figure had fallen by more than half, to just 27 percent. An estimated 69 per cent of all Mac owners used Safari to go online. But by last month, that number had dropped to 56 percent, a drop of 13 percentage points — representing a decline of nearly a fifth of the share of two years prior. Simultaneous with the decline of IE and Safari has been the rise of Chrome. The user share of Google’s browser — its share of all browsers on all operating systems — more than doubled in the last two years, jumping from 25 percent in March 2015 to 59.5 percent last month. Along the way, Chrome supplanted IE to become the world’s most-used browser. In the last 24 months, Mozilla’s Firefox — the other major browser alternative to Chrome for macOS users — has barely budged, losing just two-tenths of a percentage point in user share.

Apple celebrates 10 years of iPhone this year and rumours has it that the Cupertino-based giant will bring three iPhone variants this time. While the two of them are expected to annual incremental updates from iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, Apple is also expected to launch iPhone 8 (or X) which is probably grabbing all the attention lately. A new report from Nikkei Asian Review suggests that iPhone 8 will comes with a 5.8-inch display.   The report reads - “The upcoming iPhone, to be launched this fall, will come in three configurations—two with liquid crystal displays (LCD) and one with a 5.8-inch organic light-emitting diode  (OLED) display.”   Meanwhile, a previous report from Ming-Chi Kuo (an analyst at KGI Securities) claims that out of the 5.8-inch OLED display, the actually usable dimension will limit to 5.15-inch with the rest of the display being used up for virtual buttons and other controls. Interestingly, despite the larger display, the report claims that Apple will probably manage to fit in this display in a size equal to current 4.7-inch iPhone variant. This does make sense as Apple is expected to part ways from its traditional Home button.   On the other hand, a recent report hinted that Apple might be planning to introduce USB Type-C to its iPhone lineup, however, it is expected to retain the Lightning port as of now. The US-based multinational is touted to blend USB Type-C components inside while retaining the Lightning port on the outside. Also, we are not sure if this will be extended to all the variants or just limited to iPhone 8 (or X).   Another interesting feature which Apple is reportedly working for the upcoming iPhone 8 is a 3D-front camera. The new 3D technology in the front camera can be used for 3D gaming, augmented reality, facial recognition etc. In other words, the next iPhone might scan your face and put on your favourite gaming character. To know more about this, click here   Lastly, we might also see the fingerprint scanner on the next iPhone embedded on the display. Apple is likely to place a bunch of interactive pixels coupled with a supporting chip at the bottom of the screen which would essentially scan your fingerprint every time you place your finger on the given area.   If all the above-mentioned rumours come out to be true, Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8 will surely be an innovation marvel. On the downside, all these new implementations are expected to bump up the price of iPhone 8 over $1000 (for the base model) which is much higher than the last iPhone 7 ($649).

Search giant wrongly said shop closed down, refused to list the truth More like this Google Youtube Apple Personal Tech YouTube TV will be huge. Apple must respond It is the world’s largest online vid-slinger, after all 6 Mar 2017 at 09:02, Faultline When the world’s largest online silo of video content decides to come out and launch its own TV subscription service, including sought after live sports content, it’s not just the traditional pay TV industry which should be concerned, but the streaming giants too. YouTube TV is here and Apple has to return fire. YouTube’s much anticipated TV service will roll out to the major markets in the US later this spring, and at a premium price point of $35 a month, the new service is a direct threat to AT&T’s Di-recTV Now, Dish Network’s Sling TV, and Sony’s Vue. At present, it will first launch in the US, but Google will be angling to get rights to take this international. YouTube TV will launch with a skinny bundle of 40 channels combining networks from broadcast and cable, including ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, ESPN, Bravo, Disney Channel, Fox News, FX, MSNBC, Sprout and USA Network. It will roll out as a standalone app with six accounts available per subscription, and includes unlimited cloud DVR storage with no fixed term contract, allowing subscribers to cancel at any time. Even at a monthly fee of $35, YouTube TV’s profit will be minimal given the carriage costs of these major networks, but converting just a fraction of its 1 billion viewers to paying members will chip away at the market share of cable and satellite TV. In fact, YouTube also announced this week that it now receives over 1 billion hours of video views on a daily basis. In comparison, Nielsen data suggests the entirety of US TV has a daily viewership of around 1.25 billion hours, a figure steadily dropping in recent years. Apple’s failure to take control of the viewing experience has been well-documented, the firm having struggled to strike content deals. Apple was never going to compete directly with YouTube itself, but there’s no doubt it should have launched its own subscription TV service sooner, and it has long been rumoured to be looking to acquire a major content company. At Apple’s earnings conference last month, CEO Tim Cook noted that the company is exploring original content options for Apple TV, but original content is something YouTube has no issue with, and has already launched its own original content subscription service YouTube Red. In the YouTube TV offering, there are a few missing names of popular channels such as the Discovery Channel, as well as the channels owned by pay TV operators such as Viacom, AMC and Time Warner. Once it builds up a head of steam, these channels may join in, rather than get left out in the cold as its audience grows. YouTube’s dominant position in online video is likely to make YouTube TV a huge success, coupled with the convenience of using it as a live TV source appealing greatly to the Android smartphone market, as well as users of Chromecast dongles. Even Apple super fans would be tempted, particularly if YouTube TV launches on Apple TV devices, something yet to be announced. YouTube may want to write an App for Apple devices, but then it would have to give away 30 per cent of its revenue to Apple. Alphabet’s Google has been interested in NFL rights for years and it certainly has the cash to start bidding for NFL streaming rights next time around, which would be a great way to jump start adoption of YouTube TV. However, all streaming services currently hit a barrier when it comes to watching live NFL games on mobile devices, as Verizon holds these rights exclusively. But what if Verizon decided to partner with YouTube TV and add those games as a premium? YouTube has not yet announced any deals with pay TV operators or manufacturers to integrate the app onto set tops or smart TVs, but we expect it to forge some partnerships in the coming weeks, particularly given Comcast’s YouTube-focused news this week (see separate article on this issue). YouTube TV has been two years in the making, according to product chief Neal Mohan, who has “bigged up” the quality of service compared to similar offerings from competitors, highlighting “reliability and scalability – more than likely a dig at DirecTV Now which has been plagued with technical issues since launch. It will also include its own Google AI-powered recommendation engine, likely to be using technology from Google’s British AI subsidiary DeepMind. The $9.99 a month ad-free subscription service YouTube Red, which launched towards the end of 2015, has not been reported as a huge success, so the company is bundling Red into the YouTube TV package for no extra cost, along with Google Play Music. “There’s no question that people love TV, from live sports to breaking news to sitcoms and dramas. But the truth is, there are a lot of limitations in how to watch TV today. Unlike online video, people can't watch TV when they want, on any screen and on their terms, without commitments. Consumers have made it clear that they want live TV without all the hassle. They don’t want to worry about their DVR filling up. They don't want to miss a great game or their favourite show because they’re on the go. They tell us they want TV to be more like YouTube,” said the company in a statement.

As Darrell plots his next move, those heavyweights are starting to look more like competitors than partners. Darrell’s goal: tying together TVs, appliances and voice-controlled devices -- an area many of the globe’s biggest tech companies are trying to crack. “They want to be at the center of connected homes but you’ve got to sleep with one eye open” because erstwhile allies may well become rivals, said IDC analyst Jonathan Gaw. Bracken Darrell Photographer: Michael Short/Bloomberg Darrell insists the new strategy won’t be a dramatic change from the way Logitech has long operated. Its keyboards, wireless mice, and neighborhood-rattling speakers have always fit into the larger PC market, and in newer, faster-growing categories, Darrell has sought to make his offerings work with those of tech giants. Logitech’s UE Boom speakers understand Apple’s Siri and Google Now, its remotes use Amazon’s Alexa to control everything from TVs to lights and heating, and its accessories can turn iPads into mini-laptops. Even as he pushes deeper into the smart home, Darrell says Logitech can find niches that will be profitable without raising the ire of the industry’s leaders. “There’s no way these big players are going to want to be in every little puddle around their operating systems,” says Darrell, 55, slouched in an Eames-inspired chair in Logitech’s “Innovation Center” at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, a top Swiss technical university with long ties to the company. “We’ve always been in categories where the big players are.” To fund that strategy, Darrell aims to wring maximum profits from his PC mouse and keyboard business, which racks up sales of almost $1 billion a year with gross margins approaching 50 percent. That will let him enter new areas such as voice-controlled devices, video collaboration, and augmented-reality games. Investors will get an outlook for the fiscal year that starts in April at a meeting with Logitech management March 7 in New York. Tavis McCourt, an analyst at Raymond James in Nashville, praises Darrell for turning around a company that was “really struggling to define what it was.” McCourt says he expects Logitech to develop keyboards for internet-connected TVs and a device that might take voice commands for home automation, like Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home. The big hitters have a massive advantage over Logitech, which has historically been better at commercializing others’ inventions than developing its own. Logitech, whose revenue is forecast to reach $2.2 billion this year, devotes less than $150 million annually to research and development. Microsoft last year spent about $12 billion, Google $14 billion, and Amazon $16 billion. That could make it tough for Logitech to build products with enough sophistication to command premium prices, said Torsten Sauter, head of Swiss Research at broker Kepler Cheuvreux. “The smart home looks difficult” for Logitech to crack, Sauter said. “They have no software, no ecosystem. Logitech is much more a design company than a tech company.” Darrell joined Logitech after four years at Whirlpool and stints at General Electric Co. and Procter & Gamble Co., where he ran Braun, the German maker of high-design shavers and clocks. His predecessor had been ousted in 2011 after profit cuts and a $34 million writedown for the Revue, a keyboard for Google TV. Darrell says the company had lost its focus on design. “We had let our products slip and were just making black plastic,” Darrell said. While revenue was largely flat in Darrel’s first three years as he focused on cutting costs and shutting down or selling less-profitable businesses, retail sales this year are expected to grow at least 12 percent excluding currency fluctuations. More important, profit has more than tripled under Darrell. Darrell says he can succeed by stressing design and marketing to create hits like the UE Boom speakers, as well as novelties such as a “silent” mouse and a wireless dock for phones that lets users toggle between typing on their PC screen and smartphone. And Logitech has a long tradition of buying its way into new categories. The company in 2008 purchased Ultimate Ears, now its UE division, which represents 15 percent of Logitech’s sales and is growing at 25 percent annually. Last year, Darrell paid $50 million for Jaybird, a Utah startup that makes wireless headphones for runners, and he agreed to buy Saitek, a maker of mock steering wheels and airplane sticks for gamers, for $13 million.

Sign Up Darrell says projects in the works include cloud services tied to Logitech products, such as storing video collected by home-surveillance cameras. He points to Spotlight, a $130 remote for presentations, as an example of the hardware and software integration and higher-quality manufacturing Logitech is shooting for. Its weighty aluminum feel and simple three-button design are reminiscent of Apple products, and it works with both Windows and Macs to highlight specific areas of a computer screen. Further out, Logitech is researching how gestures may replace computer mice and looking into devices designed for use in self-driving cars, said Alastair Curtis, a Nokia veteran Darrell hired in 2013 as design chief. “When I first joined, Logitech was not in a good place,” Curtis said. “I gave a brutal assessment.” Now, he says he’s happy with the company’s direction and position vis a vis tech’s agenda-setters. “We’re closer to Apple than ever before.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

However, the Cupertino-based tech giant has reportedly announced a 32GB storage variant exclusively for the Asian market. (Photo: Reuters) Amazon India Monday surprised smartphone enthusiasts with an advertisement on its website offering the 32GB Space Grey version of the old Apple iPhone 6 for Rs 28,999. The offer which is valid till March 7, is surprising because Apple never launched a 32GB storage variant in India. The Apple iPhone 6, which was announced in September 2014, was made available in 16GB, 64GB and 128GB storage options officially. However, the Cupertino-based tech giant has reportedly announced a 32GB storage variant exclusively for the Asian market. Also read: Xiaomi to Launch Xiaomi Mi 6 on April 16: Expected Price, Specs And More (Image: Screenshot/ Amazon.in) While China and Taiwan will officially get the 32GB variant of the older iPhone 6, there is no confirmation from Apple to launch the same in India. So, before you buy it from Amazon India, here are four things to consider: 1) Third-party offer and not by Apple: The 32GB iPhone 6 offer on Amazon India is made by a third-party seller, called E-Mobiles, on the platform. While the offer is “Fulfilled by Amazon”, this simply means that the product is “stored, packed and dispatched by Amazon”. There is no cash on delivery option as well. 2) Amazon India is not an Apple Authorised Internet Reseller: Only Infibeam and Flipkart are Apple Authorised Internet Resellers for iPhones in India. While the offer claims to provide “1-year manufacturer warranty for device and 6 months manufacturer warranty for in-box accessories including batteries from the date of purchase”, there is not much clarity on the same.

There is no mention of the older iPhone 6. The company has reportedly stopped making them as well and there are newer iPhone variants at similar competitive prices.

It also states that the flagship will be launched alongside the iPhone7s and iPhone 7s Plus.  ( Paul Hudson | Flickr ) Advertisement After the phenomenal success of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus devices, Apple it seems has decided to redesign its range of smartphones to better compete with the other OEMs in the market. A few days ago it was reported that the next flagship smartphone from Apple, dubbed the iPhone 8, will be the first ever device from the company to sport an OLED screen. However, it was unclear if the device would boast a 5-inch screen which was indicated by some reports or whether it would come with a bigger display. A report from Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities had reflected though that the display will be 5.8 inches out of which 5.15-inch would be the usable screen and the rest would be taken up by the virtual home button. Latest Rumors A report from Nikkei Asian Review now reveals that the iPhone 8 will sport a massive 5.8-inch OLED display. If this report is to be believed, then the device would sport the biggest screen ever for an iPhone. People may feel that a 5.8 inch iPhone would perhaps be too big, but it must be noted that according to speculations the device will ditch the home button which would mean that it would probably come with less bezels on the top and the bottom of the screen. The overall dimension of the phone may be similar to the iPhone 7 or the iPhone 7 Plus. The report also goes on to state that the iPhone 8, which many believe will be dubbed the iPhone X, will launch with two updated versions of the iPhone 7, namely the iPhone7s and iPhone 7s Plus. Nikkei also reveals that the iPhone 8 will be considerably more expensive than the iPhone 7. Although, an exact price has not been stated, it is believed to bear a price tag of over $1000 dollars upon its release. Other Rumored Specs Speculations and unconfirmed reports have stated that a variant of the next flagship smartphone from Apple may sport 3 GB of RAM and the lowest variant will come with 64 GB of internal storage. Till now, iPhones have sported 32 GB storage in the base models. However, if reports are to be believed, this may soon change. The highest internal memory that is rumored to be provided by the iPhone 8 will be 256 GB. Availability The company may launch the device sometime in the middle of 2017 and it would likely be available by the latter part of the year. However, it has been reported that Apple intends to begin mass production of the iPhone 8 in July preparing for the high demand it expects upon its release in the markets.

NEW DELHI: Apple has quietly relaunched the iPhone 6 in India and some other countries in Asia. Wonder what's new in the 'relaunched iPhone 6'? It's the storage, the iPhone 6 comes in an-all new 32GB storage variant. The smartphone made its debut globally in the year 2014 in 16GB, 64GB and 128GB storage variants. It was, however, discontinued last year post the launch of Apple iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus . The new iPhone 6 32GB comes in Space Grey colour and is available at Rs 28,999 on Amazon India's website. The website says that this is 'introductory price' as a part of a limited-time offer. The new iPhone 6 is being so far sold only via third-party retailers and not on the company's online or offline stores. The smartphone can also be purchased at a further discount of up to Rs 8,550 under an exchange scheme being offered on the website. View As Photolist » 6 tools to boost your Apple iPhone's storage 17 6 tools to boost your Apple iPhone's storage Ever since the first iPhone was introduced way back in 2007, Apple’s category-defining smartphone has gone through a lot of changes. But even though Apple has introduced numerous advancements and features in iPhones over successive generations, there’s one ‘feature’ that most iPhone users have always missed – expandable storage. However, what if you could double your iPhone as a portable hard disk for carrying files and documents everywhere? Wonder how? Here are six tools to help you accomplish this. Credits: makeuseof.com File Manager File Manager is arguably the best phone-based app on the list. Not only does it let you manage your files, but it also acts as a virtual USB drive for both the iPhone and iPad. Once you’ve installed the app on your device, you have two ways of getting data onto in: Use iTunes: Connect your iPhone to a computer (Mac or Windows) with a copy of iTunes. Navigate to Apps and find File Manager on the list. Click on it, and you can drag-and-drop files into the documents section in the right-hand panel. Use Wi-Fi: In the app, go to Settings > Upload Via Wi-Fi Sync, and it will give you an IP address. Enter the address into a browser that’s on the same network as your phone, and you’ll be able to transfer files back and forth. The app can read certain files (such as Microsoft Office, PDFs, and Apple iWork), but it will gladly accept any file you throw at it. Files: Document & PDF Reader Files: Document & PDF Reader is largely similar to File Manager. However, it offers a couple of additional ways to transfer your files; you can use iTunes and a Wi-Fi network, but it’ll also work with Windows Explorer and Finder. There is one drawback – the app has a 200 MB data limit. You’ll need to purchase the pro version if you want unlimited storage. The premium version also adds support for Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, and OneDrive. iMazing Unlike the above two apps, iMazing (formerly DiskAid) doesn’t require you to install anything on your actual iPhone. Instead, it’s a desktop app that acts as a replacement for iTunes (available on Mac and Windows). The app has got lots of great features, including photo organization, backup creation, and advanced iOS management options – but you’ll be most interested in the file transfer service. It has a simple drag-and-drop interface and will let you choose which app on your phone you want to save the content to. SanDisk iXpand Flash Drive Of course, you don’t need to use an app at all. These days, you’re probably already carrying around lots of dongles to connect your iPhone to various other devices, so one more can’t hurt. There’s an entire sector devoted to iPhone-specific USB drives. They all come with a Lightning connector and plug directly into your iDevice. Currently, the best-in-class is the SanDisk iXpand Flash Drive. It’ll automatically backup your photos, lets you transfer any file on/off your phone, and is USB 3.0 enabled. Best of all, it also has a USB port; if you have a USB cable, you’ll be able to transfer data from the flash drive directly onto any device – even if there’s no Lightning port. It comes in three sizes: 32 GB, 64 GB, and 128 GB. iMart USB Flash Drive If the SanDisk offering is out of your price range, check out this eMart product. Sure, it doesn’t look as sleek as the SanDisk, but it’s only half the price. Interestingly, it has three connectors – Lightning, USB 2.0, and micro USB. As such, it will also work with most Android phones, making it perfect if other members of your household use Google’s rival mobile operating system. iTunes Finally, it’s worth noting iTunes itself will let you transfer most files to and from your device. It’s not as elegant or straightforward as the other methods, but if you don’t want to rely on third-party products – and you don’t deal with any unusual file types – it will do the job. To transfer files, plug your phone into your computer and launch the app. Select your device and click Apps. Underneath File Sharing, choose the app you want to transfer a file to. You now have two options: To transfer a file from your phone: Right-click the file, choose Save To, and select your destination. To transfer a file onto your phone: Select Add, choose the file you want to move and click Open. You don’t need to be able to open the file using the app you specified, just remember where you’ve put the file and download it elsewhere. Though so far the new iPhone 6 is available only on Amazon India's website, it is possible that the particular model goes on sale on other leading e-commerce websites in India as well. The new Apple iPhone 6 model has also been introduced in China. Here the smartphone has been relaunched in Gold colour option. It will be officially available on Taiwan Mobile, starting March 10. There are also speculations that Apple may not launch this model in developed markets like the US and will continue to sell its iPhone SE (launched in March last year) model on the sidelines in India. Incidentally, the company is expected to launch a bigger storage variant of iPhone SE at an event this month where it is expected to introduce the new iPads. The new Apple iPhone 6 runs iOS 10 out of the box and features a 4.7-inch HD Retina display. It is powered by the Apple A8 chipset clocked at 1.8GHz, clubbed with 1GB RAM. There is also a 32GB inbuilt storage with a single nano-SIM card support. On the camera front the iPhone 6 32GB model includes an 8MP rear and a 1.2MP front-facing camera. Backed by a 1810mAh battery, the smartphone weighs 399 grams and has usual set of connectivity options including Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi Hotspot, Bluetooth, GPS, NFC and 3.5mm headphone jack.

According to a report by Nikkei Asian Review, “the upcoming iPhone, to be launched this fall, will come in three configurations—two with liquid crystal displays and one with a 5.8-inch organic light-emitting diode display.” In an earlier statement KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted Apple will bring a 5.8-inch display iPhone in 2017 with 5.15-inch of usable screen space, while the rest of the space will be used for virtual buttons. In the statement he also mentioned that the phone will feature the display in size similar to the 5.5-inch model, but it in a 4.7-inch package. “Apple iPhone 8 will be about the same size as that of its predecessor, but will pack a battery of a ‘Plus’ variant – the iPhone 7 Plus, which features 5.5-inch screen and is powered by a 2700mAh of battery,” Kuo explained. In his reports, Kuo stated the substrate-like PCB mainboard will result in the OLED display iPhone 8 having similar dimensions to a 4.7-inch iPhone, yet comparable battery life to a 5.5-inch iPhone. To make it possible, Kuo is expecting Apple to include an L- shaped two cell battery pack with a 2700mAh battery capacity.

Reuters/Brendan McDermid Fans have been waiting for the upcoming iPad models for a long while now, but Apple may apparently announce a new set of its premium tablets before March ends. The Cupertino, California-based company is reportedly set on launching four iPad variants, which means that a new model could be joining the revamped versions of the current line-up that consists of the iPad Air, iPad Mini and iPad Pro. Previous reports indicate that the 2017 iPad models could furnish an assortment of sizes, including 7.9-inch, 10.5-inch, 10.9-inch and 12.9-inch proportions. New chipsets are also expected inside Apple’s new devices, specifically the A10X processor. Fans should also keep their fingers crossed as the new iPads will supposedly retain the 3.5 mm headphone jack that Apple removed from the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Apple has been mum about its upcoming products, but the new generation iPads will reportedly include an entry-level tablet that will be aimed at the education sector, which seem to consider the 12.9-inch iPad Pro as too expensive. Forbes reports that the cost-effective iPad may go for as low as US$299 (AU$395), which makes it much more affordable than the current iPad Air 2 that starts at US$399 (AU$527). According to analysts, some – if not all – of the next generation iPads could feature edge-to-edge designs. But in order to achieve that goal, Apple would have to get rid of the Home button for its new devices to be near borderless. All four upcoming iPads could also reportedly include quad microphones instead of the current dual setup. Other potential features that round out the list for the upcoming iPad 2017 line-up include 12 MP iSight main cameras with True Tone flash, quad speakers, True Tone displays and the successor to the Apple Pencil stylus. Apple is also reportedly going to launch a new iPhone along with the new iPad models at the said March event. It is not known yet if the Mac maker is going to announce the iPhone 7s, the iPhone 8 or a special tenth year anniversary iPhone (which has been unofficially called the iPhone X). It has been speculated as of late that Apple will be treating fans to a special edition anniversary iPhone as a way to celebrate its decade-long dominance of the mobile phone industry. And speaking of “special edition,” there’s also the buzz about the iPhone SE’s successor potentially hitting stores this year. Check out the related stories below.

Interestingly, the new storage variant is only available online for now in India, though the iPhone 6 32GB has cropped up in other markets as well. iPhone 6 32GB price and discounts Amazon India is offering the iPhone 6 smartphone's 32GB storage variant in Space Grey colour at Rs. 28,999 until Tuesday, March 7 with an exchange offer with up to Rs. 8,550 off (depending on the smartphone you're exchanging). For reference, the 16GB variant of iPhone 6 is currently available on the website at Rs. 30,399. Apple India confirmed the availability of the 32GB iPhone 6 via Amazon India, so if you are worried about about the legitimacy of the product, you can rest easy. Interestingly, India is not the only country where the 32GB storage option for the smartphone has shown up. The new storage variant of iPhone 6, albeit in Gold colour, will be made available on March 10 in Taiwan and has already been available in China since February, as per a report by 9To5Mac. Gadgets 360 understands the 32GB iPhone 6 is exclusive to Amazon India for now and is unlikely to show up on other websites or be available via offline retail just yet, though that might change in the future. iPhone 6 key specifications iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch display with 750x1334-pixel resolution, iOS 10 operating system, A8 processor, 1GB RAM, 8-megapixel rear camera, 1.2-megapixel front camera, Bluetooth 4.0, 3.5mm headphone jack, and 1810mAh battery. Last year, Apple discontinued its iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus models after the launch of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus smartphones.

In our review we said the iPhone 6 is much faster than the its predecessors. By: Tech Desk | Updated: March 7, 2017 2:20 pm Apple iPhone 6 is a solid device when it comes to performance. In our review we said the iPhone 6 is much faster than the its predecessors. Apple iPhone 6 (32GB) in Space Grey colour option is now available on Amazon India at Rs 28,999 as opposed to its original price of Rs 30,7000. Additionally users can up to Rs 10,000 off on exchange offer. However, the exchange offer is only limited to certain regions. Apple iPhone 6 is being sold via third-party seller ‘E-Mobiles’ and is listed as ‘Fulfilled by Amazon’ product. The smartphone comes with 1-year manufacturer warranty for the devices as well as in-box accessories and batteries. The offer ends March 7. Apple doesn’t sell iPhone 6 in 32GB variant but the company has been lately working on reviving the model, says a report in 9to5 Mac. According to the report, iPhone 6 in Gold colour option will launch on March 10 with Taiwan Mobile. “So as we noted yesterday about the 32GB Gold iPhone 6 apparently slated for a March 10 release with Taiwan Mobile, these 32GB versions popping up could potentially be new models,” the report points out. Watch all our videos from Express Technology Apple iPhone 6 was announced along side iPhone 6 Plus in 2014. Sure, this is almost a two year old model but the iPhone 6 series has an 8MP rear camera, which is still one of the best in the market. Apple iPhone 6 (16GB) Space Grey colour variant, on the other hand, is listed at Rs 30,399 on Amazon. Apple iPhone 6 (32GB) at Rs 28,999 is a pretty good deal given users are getting more storage space at a significantly lesser price. Apple iPhone 6 is a solid device when it comes to performance. In our review we said the A8 processor in iPhone 6 is much faster than the ones on its predecessors. Apps launch really fast and you can switch between them seamlessly. Plus, the iPhone model is likely to get upgraded to iOS 11. Sure, iPhone 6 doesn’t have 3D Touch as its successors, but users will have to shell out a bit more money to get the feature. Apple iPhone 6S (32GB) is listed at Rs 40,999 on Amazon, while the iPhone 6S Plus (16GB) is around Rs 44,000. Read: Apple iPhone 6 review + video: Worth every penny you spend on it If you’re not an iPhone fan, there are a lot more better and newer Android smartphone options available at the same price-point. OnePlus 3 costs Rs 27,999 while the OnePlus 3T can be bought starting at Rs 29,999. OnePlus 3T smartphone is an upgraded version of the OnePlus 3. The key changes in the OnePlus 3T are the new Snapdragon 821 processor, a 128GB storage version, higher megapixel front camera along with a bigger 3,400 mAh battery. Both OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T are pretty capable smartphones. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: Amazon Apple Election 2017 UP polls 2017: In his last appeal, Modi talks jobs, empowerment for farmers UP polls 2017: In this village of soldiers, families that lost sons can’t agree on Army and strikes UP elections 2017: At ghats, they revel in arguing about Ganga, politics and Modi Best of Express SportsIndia vs Australia Live Score EntertainmentNoor trailer: Sonakshi Sinha says Mumbai is killing her.

However the reports are also claiming that Apple might get of Touch ID, which is interesting and bit odd given that Touch ID is probably one of the more popular iPhone features. Whether or not Apple will go through with that remains to be seen, but a new report from DigiTimes is claiming that Touch ID will be here to stay. According to the report, it seems that Apple will be using an in-house developed fingerprint ID solution that will rely on ultrasound to detect the user’s fingerprints, which presumably will be hidden under the display as Apple has also been rumored to ditch the home button. In fact we have seen similar patents filed by Apple in the past, so perhaps one of them might be coming true. This isn’t the first time that we have heard rumors of an ultrasound fingerprint sensor. Qualcomm has actually created something similar of their own called Sense ID so it’s not really a stretch to think that Apple could be thinking of something of their own. In any case DigiTimes has a pretty mixed track record when it comes to Apple-related rumors, so perhaps it’s best to take it with a grain of salt for now, but how would you guys feel if Touch ID were to be replaced? Would you miss it? Filed in Apple >Cellphones >Rumors. Read more about iPhone and Security.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Apple Quietly Launches 32GB iPhone 6 Model In Taiwan By Tyler Lee on 03/05/2017 20:55 PST Right now the latest iPhone is the iPhone 7 (and its Plus variant), which means that the iPhone 6 is basically 3 generations ago. However interestingly enough it seems that over in Taiwan, Apple has quietly launched a new 32GB iPhone 6 model that will be available via local carrier Taiwan Mobile. It is odd that despite the iPhone 7 being the latest model that Apple is still churning out iPhone 6 units, let alone one in a new configuration. For those unfamiliar, the iPhone 6 was launched in 16GB, 64GB, and 128GB models, so it is interesting that Apple is introducing a 32GB model for the iPhone 6 at this point in time. However this move isn’t completely unprecedented. Apple has in the past kept older iPhone models around to act as cheaper alternatives to the newer models. For example for a while Apple continued to sell older iPad models despite there being much newer models available, so presumably this 32GB iPhone 6 is aimed at customers who’d rather not fork out that much money for a new iPhone 7. That being said it should be noted that this appears to be only available in Taiwan and also China where it was launched last month. We’re not sure if it will ever find its way stateside so maybe don’t hold your breath. Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about iPhone and iphone 6.

Most of them revolve around the controversial switch to OLED display, while others are with the imaging and other value-added features. A new report now claims Apple has already made a decision about one of the security features for the iPhone 8. According to Digitimes, Apple has already chosen its in-house fingerprint sensor development to be featured on the iPhone 8. Furthermore, instead of optical fingerprint reading, it opted for a much newer ultrasonic biometric authentication. The report also mentioned that Apple’s Authentic algorithm in combination with the glass identification technology from Privaris will make up the iPhone 8’s fingerprint scanner. The new biometric chip will be manufactured by TSMC under its 65nm process technology. Apple Touch ID (via apple.com) This decision from Apple does not really come as a surprise. Although there are technologies already available like Qualcomm’s Sense ID and Synaptics’ Natural ID, Apple still pushed for in-house tech. It seems that the new fingerprint scanning sensor will be embedded within the rumoured “function area” of the iPhone 8. This new function area will replace the original home button. Also, this particular area on the screen will be situated at the bottom part of the display. Unfortunately, at the moment, there are no updates on what sort of functions this area could possibly have. But one can guess that it may include the fingerprint scanning features of the iPhone 8. The iPhone 8 is rumored to be released sometime in September this year. Along with the function area and the new fingerprint scanner, it will also have other new features. The much hyped feature at the moment is the OLED display. The 5.8-inch display will have a micro bezel design, making the entire phone no bigger than the current 4.7-inch iPhone. In addition to the new display, it is also rumored to include additional security features like iris scanning and facial recognition. These functionalities are linked to the new infrared camera that can also be used for augmented reality. Like in all rumors about the iPhone, this one too should be taken with a grain of salt. There is no telling whether these rumours hold any truth or not. For more updates on the iPhone 8, be sure to check out TheBitbag.

While some predict and speculate an iPhone X, others say that Apple will stick to its regular cycle of two smartphones and introduce a new bigger-size category. Japanese news agency Nikkei had reported that the tenth year anniversary edition of the iPhone will feature a 5-inch OLED display, however, in a new report it has reiterated that the iPhone 8 will be the largest of the three new models that will be making an appearance this year. So the new prediction says that the iPhone 8 will have a 5.8-inch OLED display, the iPhone 7s with a 4.7-inch display and the iPhone 7s Plus with its usual 5.5-inch dimension. The regular upgrades will feature LCD panels like last year. Nikkei’s new prediction around the iPhone now matches the ones that was put out by KGI Securities Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has been known for quite some accurate leaks and speculations. In a world where smartphones are growing, well at least display sizes, a larger iPhone makes perfect sense. And its nice to see Apple changing with the times. This year smartphone makers are expected to launch smartphones that have a large display but cut down on bezels making them fit better in the hand. Just look at the LG G6 and the leaked Samsung Galaxy S8.

Launched in 2008, Spotify had 40 million paid subscribers in September and the company tweeted the 50 million figure on Thursday, the same day messaging app company Snap Inc pulled off its massive share sale that bodes well for other technology companies considering a flotation. Apple, which launched its music service less than two years ago, had about 20 million subscribers in December and its entry looks to have done little to slow the rapid growth of its older Swedish-based rival. Spotify, which has yet to show a profit as it spends to grow internationally, is now looking at a possible stock market listing in the United States, online news portal TechCrunch said last month. A company spokeswoman declined to comment on Friday on when it might seek a listing. But a partner at a leading investor in Spotify, venture capital firm Northzone, said late last year the company could start to become profitable as early as 2017 after years of focusing squarely on “growth, growth, growth”. Spotify is the most highly valued venture backed start-up in Europe and according to media reports is considering a listing on Nasdaq and potentially a dual listing on the Nasdaq exchange in Stockholm, where the company is headquartered. It was last valued at $8.53 billion, according to venture capital market research firm CB Insights. That valuation alone would make a flotation Europe’s biggest technology start-up listing since the market launch of German e-commerce investor Rocket Internet in 2014. While still loss-making, Spotify has posted rapid subscriber growth since it was created a decade ago by Swedish founders Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon. Following its announcement on Thursday that it had reached 50 million paid subscribers, Ek made a point of retweeting a comment from Wall Street media analyst Rick Greenfield which pointed to how Spotify was adding subscribers at an increasingly rapid rate. The Stockholm-based company also announced a major expansion in New York last month. One of Europe’s most highly valued venture-backed start-ups, Spotify will move its New York office to the World Trade Center from the Midtown area of Manhattan, adding more than 1,000 new jobs. In 2016 Americans used on-demand streaming platforms, such as Spotify, to listen to 431 billion music tracks, Nielsen said in its U.S. year-end report.

Apple, in all its wisdom, made a device with a perfectly circular cross-section. Because of this, the device will never sit still on any platform unless it’s perfectly level. The lack of any clip means that it can fall out of your pocket and the lack of anything so simple as even a magnetic clamp means that the device doesn’t actually attach itself to the iPad Pro like you’d expect. Image: Patently Apple Thankfully, Patently Apple appears to have stumbled across a patent filing for an accessory that might alleviate these concerns. The accessory will apparently attach itself to the iPad’s Smart Keyboard cover and hints at an iPhone cover attachment as well. The patents themselves don’t describe anything special and only suggest a kind of loop that can be magnetically attached to your iPad Keyboard cover and, potentially, a future iPhone Smart Cover. Given that the pencil has no clip, one can assume that the Pencil is held in place by friction. Patently Apple reports that the application itself was filed in Q3 2015. We wonder why it hasn’t seen the light of day yet.

Apple Apple iPhones and Samsung Galaxy devices have both dominated the mobile phone industry over the last few years, so it’s no wonder why the two companies constantly try to upstage one another when it comes to handsets. Nowadays, the theme for smartphones seems to be “the bigger they are, the better.” And both mobile phone leaders seem to agree as they reportedly continue with the trend on their upcoming respective flagships. Samsung is expected to launch the new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus on March 29 in a New York event. The South Korean electronics giant’s new smartphones are going to furnish 5.8-inch and 6.2-inch displays, respectively. Those numbers are huge since no previous Galaxy S model has ever gone beyond 5.7 inches of measurement, which is already Galaxy Note territory. The Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus are going to be the first S series handsets to equip at least 5.8-inch displays, and this basically drags out the above-mentioned theme that isn’t going away anytime soon. Of course, Apple, the innovative tech titan that it is, refuses to get left behind. A new report reaffirms that the Mac maker is set to furnish an upcoming iPhone variant with a 5.8-inch display, which is a first for the company’s iconic smartphone. Not only that, the next flagship (which is unofficially called the iPhone 8) will reportedly utilise an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen for the new 5.8-inch model, which is another first for the Cupertino, California-based innovator. What’s more, many insiders believe that the upcoming iPhone 8 is going to come in not only two, but three variants. If this pushes through, it will likewise be the first time that Apple launches three different variations of an iPhone simultaneously. According to Nikkei Asian Review, the 5.8-inch OLED model is going to be accompanied by two smaller liquid crystal display (LCD) variants. There are conflicting reports on the measurements of the supposed iPhone 8 LCD units, but they are likely to be the same as the current 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus. There is also the speculation that Apple could furnish an iPhone 8 variant with a 5.0-inch display, but until the official word is out, fans should take these rumours with a grain of salt. Apple is also reportedly going to launch before the end of March a new iPhone SE 2017 model, the sequel to last year’s 4.0-inch “special edition” iPhone.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone is king, but it does have some healthy competition from Samsung and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL). Although, Google has gained ground against both of these competitors recently. This also gives Google the opportunity to solidify Android’s reputation as a premium platform. Sales of the Pixel have been steady, but it has been somewhat hard to get a hold of one due to component shortages. But this hasn’t dampened the company’s plans to continue investing in its own smartphones. As the iPhone 8 is planned for a release later this year, there will also be a successor to the Pixel that will continue to carry a high price tag. Google intends to keep the Pixel at a premium price, so we might not expect anything cheap coming from this tech giant. Rick Osterloh, Vice President of Hardware at Google, told Android Pit in a briefing at Mobile World Congress: There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it. You can count on a successor this year, even if you don’t hear a date from me now. According to Engadget: Although Google is keeping information to a premium, its typical development cycle suggests a Pixel 2 will go on sale in the fourth quarter. The current Pixel launched in October 2016 and Google has held launch events at around the same time for Nexus phones in the past. Shares of Alphabet were last seen down 0.5% at $845.67 on Friday, with a consensus analyst price target of $988.95 and a 52-week trading range of $672.66 to $867.00. Apple traded at $139.00 a share, with a consensus price target of $142.48 and a 52-week range of $89.47 to $140.28.

While the release date of the device remains unknown as of now, speculations are high that the next powerhouse tablet from the Cupertino-based tech giant would make its debut within the next couple of months. The original iPad Pro was designed to be a portable device that is capable of replacing a full-fledged laptop computer. However, a limited suite of enterprise-driven apps and clunky accessories ultimately caused the first-generation iPad Pro to fall short of its goal. It was a successful tablet in its own right, but it remained no more than that. Things appear to be different this time around, however, as Apple is gearing up to release a successor to its powerhouse tablet, the iPad Pro 2. With this in mind, here are three notable features that the iPad Pro 2 must have if Apple would like to finally take a decisive crack at the productivity-centered enterprise market. Proud to show you my vision of next #ipadpro2 concept ! ???????? #ipad #ipadpro #photoshop #apple #design #jetblack #creativity #visionary ???????? pic.twitter.com/SZVB1Yvfcu —  Philippe Legrand (@picsigndesign) March 3, 2017 An Updated, High-Res Screen The displays in the current iterations of the iPad Pro are already stellar. Featuring Apple’s iconic Retina Display, the screens of the devices are eye-catching and definitely of premium quality. However, the resolution of the displays, especially the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, is the same as the resolution that debuted in the iPad 3 almost five years ago, according to a TechRadar report. Thus, while its display is still good enough for users, it would be great if Apple releases the iPad Pro 2 with a screen featuring better resolution. An improvement in quality on the screen of the iPad Pro 2 is very likely, but a bump in resolution would be even better. After all, with competitors such as the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 rumored to be equipped with admirable 4K screens, it is high time for Apple to step up its game and improve its Retina displays for the iPad Pro 2 even further. Real Multitasking, Enterprise-Grade Features The iPad Pro 2 is a device that could actually achieve what its predecessor was unable to accomplish. The original iPad Pro had enough power to do some real productivity tasks, but a limited suite of enterprise-grade apps and the subpar multitasking capabilities of iOS ultimately pulled down the device’s chances of fully breaching the business market. With the iPad Pro 2, however, Apple could address all of the previous devices’ flaws. This could be done by optimizing the iPad Pro 2 for enterprise-grade tasks and productivity. Apps that are comparable in features to those found in macOS must be made available to the iPad Pro 2, allowing users of the device to perform intricate tasks that were previously only possible on a laptop computer. Multi-window support must also be included by Apple, allowing users to simultaneously access and manipulate multiple apps on the screen, much like a desktop unit. If Apple manages to pull this off with the software of the iPad Pro 2, the upcoming device would most likely be a blockbuster hit. https://t.co/TivwJsLPCo : #iPadPro2 #iPhone7Plus – #Apple iPad Pro 2 Specs & Features: iPhone 7 Plus Dual Cameras And Much More Tipped pic.twitter.com/8yBj6na88e — SndyAaron (@SndyAaron) February 4, 2017 Better Accessories The original 12.9-inch iPad Pro and its smaller, 9.7-inch sibling are excellent tablet devices that have enough horsepower to perform like a full-fledged laptop computer. While the devices undoubtedly had potential, however, its two main accessories, the Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard, were inherently flawed. The Apple Pencil was huge, cumbersome, and was just plain unsightly when charging, while the Smart Keyboard was clunky and shallow at best. Thus, with the iPad Pro 2, it would be best for Apple to ensure that the device is released with accessories that are just as good as its specs. A better keyboard is already rumored for the iPad Pro 2, and speculations are also high that the Apple Pencil would see an update. If these rumors prove true, the iPad Pro 2 might actually end up as the device Apple meant it to be: a portable machine that could replace a full-fledged computer. The official release date of the iPad Pro 2 remains unknown, but speculations are high that the device would see a March, 2017, reveal, according to a MacWorld report. Pricing for the iPad Pro 2 has not been confirmed either, but considering Apple’s penchant for placing premium prices on its devices, rumors are high that the powerhouse tablet would start at $799 for the entry-level 12.9-inch version, and $599 for the entry-level 9.7-inch model.

Bacarra EditorialFailure to launch Apple sued in China over showing of war film from the 1990s Associated Press July 9, 2016 12:37 pm TECHNOLOGY 428 0 BEIJING — Apple was sued by a subsidiary of China’s broadcasting regulator over a propaganda film more than 20 years old, in the latest legal wrangling for the tech giant in China in recent weeks. A Beijing court said the case has been brought by a production center that alleges that Apple has infringed its exclusive online rights to broadcast a film that depicts Chinese fighting against Japanese soldiers in northern China in the early 1930s. The plaintiff also sued the developer and operator of the Youku HD app available on Apple’s App Store that it said enabled users to watch the film and caused it “huge economic losses,” according to the Beijing Haidian District People’s Court. The court said it has accepted the case brought by Movie Satellite Channel Program Production Center that comes under the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television. The plaintiff alleged that Apple has infringed its exclusive online rights to broadcast “Xuebo dixiao,” which loosely translates as “Bloody Fight with the Fierce Enemy” and was first shown in 1994. The production center is also suing Heyi Information and Technology (Beijing) Company Ltd., which developed and operated the Youku HD app, the court said in an online statement Thursday. The app is sold by Youku.com, according to information on Apple’s iTunes site. The Youku site is one of China’s best known movie and TV program streaming sites and is owned by Youku Tudou Inc., which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The plaintiff wants the two companies to immediately stop broadcasting the film and is seeking compensation of 50,000 yuan ($7,500) plus its “reasonable expenditure” of 20,158 yuan ($3,000) in attempting to stop the infringement of its rights, the court said. Emailed requests for comment to Apple spokespeople were not answeredSaturday, and a spokesman for Youku Tudou was not able to immediately comment. Apple Inc. has recently faced legal setbacks and other obstacles in China, its second-biggest global market. In April, it suspended its iBooks and iTunes Movies services, reportedly due to an order by Chinese regulators. In May, a Beijing intellectual property tribunal in Beijing ordered Apple to stop selling its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in the city after finding they look too much like a model made by a small Chinese brand. Sales of the phones are continuing while Apple appeals. Also that month, Apple suffered another setback when a court ruled that a Chinese company is allowed to use the iPhone trademark on bags, wallets and other leather goods.

Easiest Ways To Upgrade Your Computer Yourself David Nield Mar 6, 2017, 10:00am ⋅ Filed to:  apple dell fieldguide upgrades Share Upgrading your computer can be a great way to save a little cash. It can also be a great way to fulfil that need most gadget geeks have for getting cool new stuff on a regular basis. But upgrading can also be shockingly expensive if you're not careful (steer clear of Apple's overpriced RAM), and it can seem especially daunting to upgrade if you're not familiar with the insides of your computer. Yet there are many ways to upgrade your current setup without spending too much cash or needing a degree in computer science to tackle them. These are the DIY upgrades that will give you the most bang for your buck, and are shockingly easy to perform in an afternoon. Add more memory If the processor inside your computer determines how fast it can think, then the amount of RAM affects how much it can think about at any one time — opt for a memory upgrade and you'll be able to run more programs simultaneously and more smoothly, and you'll find larger files or multiple files are handled better too. Getting extra RAM sticks inside your machine isn't that expensive or that difficult to do, particularly if you're using a desktop computer with an extra memory slot or two free on the motherboard. Your first task is to identify what your motherboard is, and how much memory is already installed — you can either open up the case and take a look or run a diagnostics tool like CPU-Z or Apple's About This Mac to check for you. In the case of laptops the job is a lot trickier but not impossible for the casual computer user — how easy the task is can vary widely from model to model, so again you need to do some online research into the laptop you've got. As the video above from Brue Computing shows, you can do the job on a Dell laptop with a screwdriver, a plastic pry tool and a few minutes' spare time. Where possible find instructions for your exact make and model of computer, to minimise the chances of running into problems. Ifixit.com is a great resource for learning how to get into many laptops from major brands, including Dell, Apple, Samsung, and HP. Add more storage space Your computer doesn't like running out of storage space — besides losing out on a place to store that kitten video you downloaded for Youtube, you'll also find your computer runs a lot slower when the storage is nearly full. So anything you can do to keep a healthy chunk of storage space free is an upgrade that's well worth doing. Investing in an external hard drive and plugging it into a spare USB port is an upgrade that pretty much anyone can do. You won't be able to move your operating system files over to it, but you can shift all those photos, videos and other personal files to the external drive no problem. Just remember that you need to back them up somewhere else too, just in case your new external hard drive should fall into the fish tank. Fitting a second hard drive inside your case or even swapping out your original drive for a bigger one isn't as difficult as you might think, though in the latter case you have the added hassle of having to move your operating system, applications and files over at the same time. If you do decide to replace your internal hard drive, than switching from a mechanical hard drive to a speedy SSD can make a huge difference to the load times and running speed of your computer, as well as potentially giving you more storage space too. The comprehensive video above from Babbling Boolean is a great introduction to the process of adding an SSD drive to your system (and you can see the before and after speed difference too). The process is easier if you're working with a desktop computer with large hard drive bays but you can made the switch on most models of laptops too. Upgrade your input options Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo You may not think that buying a new mouse and keyboard is much of an upgrade for your computer, but you use these devices constantly, and buying new kit can feel like upgrading your whole machine (even though all the internal components are exactly the same). There are a lot of options out there and you don't need to spend much to get something of great quality. You could consider investing in a mechanical keyboard for a more pleasing typing experience or a dedicated gaming keyboard for all those FPS games you play. On the mouse side, upgrading to a model with more switches and options gives you access to more instant shortcuts — whether that's for Excel or No Man's Sky. Installation and setup can be done in seconds and then you're ready to go. For those who aren't particularly concerned with computer performance, or who already have computers that are running top-notch components, focusing on the devices you use to interact with your system is an upgrade path well worth considering. Buy a new (or second) display Image: Samsung As with keyboards and mice, adding a new display doesn't change anything about the core specs of your computer, but it can make the experience of using it a whole lot better. There are a couple of options here: upgrading to a bigger display from your original one or adding a second monitor. Both can make a big difference, letting you run programs side-by-side, or keep one app open constantly on one screen while you work on another. If you've never considered setting up a secondary monitor before, take our word for it that it's a lot more useful than you might realise: web browsing, office apps, playing music and video, all these tasks benefit from extra screen real estate, whether that's more room on one monitor or a second one available to the OS. And the upgrade is about as easy as they come as long as you can plug in both ends of an HDMI cable and find a power socket. If you're adding a second monitor then you need a desktop or laptop capable of powering two displays (most can), otherwise you can simply swap out one monitor for another and you're ready to go. However you set up your displays, both Windows and macOS should detect the changes instantly.

Customers in Austria, Italy, and Singapore can now use mobile phone billing with select carriers where available. Sony A6500 Mobile phone billing lets customers roll charges for the iTunes Store, App Store, iBooks Store, and Apple Music memberships into monthly phone bills from the carrier as an alternative to storing debit or credit cards with Apple. These carriers work with mobile phone billing in each new country: Drei in Austria 3 in Italy M1 Limited in Singapore You can find the full list of supported carriers in previously supported countries including Belgium, Germany, Japan, Norway, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Taiwan, and UAE on Apple’s support site. While the concept has been available from other companies with various carriers in the United States, Apple does not support mobile phone billing for the App Store and other services in the US.

Apple has also made some general updates to that Home-focused website. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case In the video, which is accessible from the header of the Home webpage, Apple showcases a variety of different features that the Home app offers. The ad starts with a woman waking up and asking Siri to set her morning scene and from there the “breakfast time” scene is enabled, which turns on the coffee pot and other kitchen appliances. From there, the woman adjusts the temperature in her home using the Honeywell Lyric Thermostat. The Kwikset smart lock is also showcased when the user sets the “Lock Up” scene on her way out the door. The next feature showcased is Home support on the fourth-gen tvOS Apple TV, with the woman setting the “movie time” scene, which closes the blinds and dims the lights. Last but not least, the “Lights out” scene completely turns out the lights and drops the temperature by 2 degrees. Apple has also made some slight tweaks to its Home-dedicated page on its website. The header tagline and image has been updated to read, ” Your home at your command” with a link to the short film right below it. Apple also offers up a description of the Home app’s capabilities: With the Home app, you can easily and securely control all your HomeKit accessories. Ask Siri to turn off the lights from your iPhone. See who’s at the front door on your iPad. And even control things remotely with the help of Apple TV. The Home app makes all your connected devices work harder — and smarter — for you. Furthermore, Apple has divided the page into more clear subsections, including ones for: One app for all your home accessories. Get your house in order. Room by room. Set several things in motion with a tap. Or your voice. Siri makes your voice the on/off switch. With Apple TV as your home hub, you can control your house from just about anywhere. Check out the new Home webpage and video here.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Sponsor Book → RSS → The Future of Target Display Mode  March 5, 2017March 5, 2017 ⌘ Permalink In the fall of 2009, Apple retired the 20 and 24-inch iMacs in favor of widescreen models with 21.5 and 27 inch displays. These machines are not the Retina models we enjoy today, and still packed things like an optical drive. They introduced Target Display Mode, which allowed a user to use an iMac as an external display for another Mac. Late 2009 and Mid 2010 models required a Mini DisplayPort cable for the feature to work. Setting it up was as simple as running a cable from the Mini DisplayPort on a MacBook Pro over to the same port on the iMac, and pressing Command-F2 on the iMac’s keyboard. In Mid 2011, Apple put Thunderbolt on the iMac, and Target Display Mode suddenly required the new connector. This setup is more familiar to most users, and many even call the feature “Thunderbolt Display Mode” mistakenly. (All of this is outlined in a single kbase article, as if you doubted my desire to link to an Apple support page in this post.) In the fall of 2014, Apple introduced the first Retina iMac, a 27-inch model with a 5K display. It did not support Target Display Mode, as Jason Snell pointed out in his review of the machine: While recent iMacs have been able to double as an external display via something called Target Display Mode, the Retina iMac can’t. This is cutting edge technology, and pumping this volume of pixels through a display cable or series of cables is a serious challenge. With the Retina iMac, Apple has punted: There’s no better way to attach a computer to a display like this than to build them together. In the future, there will undoubtedly be standalone 5K displays—even from Apple!—and ways to connect them to other Macs effectively. For now, though, the Retina iMac is an island, its own display and computer as one. When the 21.5-inch iMac with Retina 4k display shipped in 2015, it too dropped this technology. Thunderbolt 2 just couldn’t push these displays in any reliable way. In short, if you have a Retina iMac, you don’t have Target Display mode. However, that could be changing in the near future. While Thunderbolt 2 was not up to the task, Thunderbolt 3 is. Found on the new MacBook Pros — and assumedly the next iMac — this port could allow users to turn their 2017 iMacs into big, beautiful displays when needed.1 While the technology would allow Apple to do this, the company would still need to elect to re-enable it in macOS. When this topic comes up, an argument in favor of Target Display Mode I often hear goes something like this: “It can extend the life of an iMac. It the machine has a failure, you can just use it a display instead of getting rid of it!” I don’t buy this line of thinking, however. Target Display Mode may extend the life of an iMac that isn’t fast enough for the latest software, but if the machine has some sort of catastrophic component failure that keeps it from booting, Target Display Mode isn’t an option. I cannot imagine that this was a popular feature, but my guess is that people who once relied on it would like the option again. My iMac won’t support it, but in the future when its replacement and my notebook both pack Thunderbolt 3, it could prove useful from time to time. The one-port MacBook will be left out of this party. While it ships with USB-C, the port does not utilize Thunderbolt 3. The Intel chipset used in this machine does not support the more robust connection, leading to weird (and confusing) fragmentation. ↩ Post navigation ← Previous Post Next Post → New 512 T-shirt!

Todd Campbell (TMFEBCapital) Mar 5, 2017 at 12:21PM Warren Buffett is arguably the greatest investor of our time, and that makes knowing what stocks he's buying for Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) must-know news. In the fourth quarter, Buffett added a bunch of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) to his portfolio, and recently, he told CNBC that he's spent about $20 billion of Berkshire Hathaway's cash stockpile buying these and other stocks since "a little before the election." He also revealed that his position in both Apple and airline stocks is bigger now than it was in December. Profits by the bushel After consumers opted to hold off on upgrading their iPhones, Apple shares stumbled early in 2016, and that proved to be the perfect opportunity for Berkshire Hathaway portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler to pick up shares of the electronics giant at a discount. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Berkshire Hathaway invested $1 billion in Apple stock in the first quarter of 2016 -- a fairly modest stake for a portfolio with $150 billion under management. However, that stake climbed significantly throughout the remainder of the year, and exiting December, Berkshire Hathaway's Apple position was worth about $7.7 billion, making it Buffett's sixth biggest individual stock position.  This week, Buffett appeared on CNBC to discuss Berkshire Hathaway's performance last year, and in his conversation, he let it slip that his interest in Apple continued into this year. Although Apple was already a big holding entering this year, Buffett says he now owns 133 million shares in Apple, making it his second biggest holding. Apple's shares have rallied sharply since they first showed up in Buffett's portfolio, so it's safe to assume that Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on a nice gain on Apple's stock. He reminded CNBC viewers he could sell at any point, but I think there's reason to think he'll hold on to his Apple position for a while. Last quarter, iPhone, Mac, Apple Watch, and services sales all reached record highs, and as a result, Apple's revenue and profit finished 2016 on a high note. Revenue in its fiscal first quarter was a record $78.4 billion, up from $75.9 billion last year, and earnings per share were $3.36, up from $3.28 a year ago. Apple's management is guiding investors to expect between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion in sales this quarter, up between 1.7% and 5.7% year over year. With operating cash flow of $27 billion allowing management to return $15 billion to investors last year through share buybacks and dividend payments, and business humming along nicely, it wouldn't be surprising if Apple returns even more money to investors this year. Growing exposure to airlines When it comes to rewarding investors with market-beating returns, airlines have a rocky history. However, an industrywide restructuring a few years ago is boosting profit, and that's making airlines some of the market's top performers. If the U.S. economy continues to strengthen, then fuller flights will help keep prices firm, and investments in fuel-efficient airplanes will drop even more money to the bottom line.  IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. In the past, Buffett has said that one way to become a millionaire is to start out as a billionaire and then invest in an airline. He doesn't seem to believe that anymore. Over the past six months, he's invested billions of Berkshire Hathaway's cash into the stock of the country's largest airline operators. As of December, Berkshire Hathaway owned 60 million shares in Delta Air Lines worth roughly $3 billion, plus he owns about $2.5 billion in Southwest Airlines, and about $2.1 billion in each of American Airlines and United Continental Holdings. Overall, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has invested over $9 billion in airlines.  Although he didn't say exactly what airlines he's adding more to in 2017, he didn't deny that he's continuing to increase his bet on the industry. When he was asked if he's spending more money on Apple and airlines this year, he said that was a "good guess." Clearly, he thinks airline stocks are going to go up, not down, and with unemployment low and incomes rising, it's not a stretch to to think that airlines like Delta will continue to fill seats. If so, these companies could reward investors with bigger profits and, in turn, higher dividend payments. For instance, Delta Air Lines' goal is to return about 70% of its annual free cash flow to investors, and while a lot of that cash flow could be used for share buybacks, a low dividend payout ratio and cash dividend payout ratio suggest there's room to increase quarterly dividend payments, too. Currently, Delta Air Lines' dividend payout ratio -- or the percentage of earnings paid to shareholders in dividends -- is less than 12%. American Airlines and Southwest's ratios are even lower. That's pretty low when you consider that other big companies are paying out far more to investors. For example, General Electric's payout ratio is 75%.   With Warren Buffett owning a big and potentially growing position in airlines, and an opportunity for investors to pocket bigger dividend payments, it might be time to buy stock in these companies.  Todd Campbell owns shares of Apple and General Electric.

To explain, 4Shared is basically a huge database in which everything, all files, are shared by its users. It may not be specifically designed for free music, but it certainly has large amounts of free music for you to download. Along with millions of music files, you can also share and download video files, images, and whatever other media which the app supports.

The best part is, although it is technically a radio-streaming programme, you have complete control over what you want to listen to, unlike actual radio. SPOTIFY I personally use Spotify myself, and the reason is due to not just its huge wealth of great music, but because it is also legal and it contributes somewhat financially to the actual music artists.

There are intermittent ads, but this doesn’t detract from Spotify’s quality and wealth of free, great music. Google Play Music This app, designed by Google, is essentially a free radio service.

Rock My Run Are you perhaps interested in fitness? Does your week consist of regular workouts? If so, Rock My Run has been specifically designed for you. This app is manufactured for those who love to listen to music during workouts. Some of the best features about this app is that you can create some unique playlists. For example, you can make playlists which are moulded around a certain tempo or mood. If you wanted to create a fast playlist for running, for example, or an inspiring playlist for hill climbing, Rock My Run is the app for you. All in all, this app will certainly motivate you in the gym or in the great outdoors. ROckmyrun is an amazing free music app for fitness training app. You can hear your favourite music while running, jogging or exercising. You can hear some popular DJ’s with perfect beats for training. It will increase your confidence and enthusiasm and will motivate you to keep going. You just need to choose your favourite genre and then it will stream body driven music. I would really prefer his app as I am personally a sportsperson.

Furthermore, it even consumes fewer data. In conclusion, it is one of the best free music apps for android. Gaana This app is one of the most popular music apps for Hindi, Bollywood, Punjabi and other similar types of music. Most popular in India, Gaana also offers free streaming service for popular songs in English, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Kannada, and Malayalam. You can also browse through the charts and select your favourite tracks to listen to or place in your own personalised playlist.

There are a recorded 10 million music tracks to choose from, as well as thousands of playlists. At present, Gaana has been downloaded more than 800,000 times according to Google Play. SoundCloud SoundCloud is a unique music programme used by millions of people and musicians for self-production. In other words, with SoundCloud, musicians everywhere are using this free platform to upload their music. Musicians everywhere are joining this free programme, and listeners everywhere likewise are tuning in to hear what common everyday people are producing. Once a music file is uploaded to SoundCloud, people from all over the world can tune in and listen to it for free. With SoundCloud, you can be either a listener or a giver of music, or both. Soundcloud is great music downloader free app. A lot of features. The enormous database of mp3 songs. Download your favourite music tracks or songs quickly from this app. Connect and share with your friend. Entirely ads free. Finally, you can download this Android app from the below link. It is an editor’s choice music downloader free app for Android. Furthermore, it has been downloaded billions of times. Sound Cloud Since it has been rated four stars, it is an amazing free mp3 download app for android. It seems like it requires Android 4.0 or up. It was last updated in June 2016. Furthermore, this free mp3 music downloader app was developed in Germany by SoundCloud. Finally, it is a fantastic music downloader free app for Android. I personally have many friends who record and upload their own music onto SoundCloud. The benefits of using SoundCloud is the fact that you can listen to undiscovered talent which the radio cannot deliver. You can listen to friends or upcoming breakthrough artists, before the music companies slap a copyright on the tracks. Of course, you won’t find top 50 artists through SoundCloud. This is why it doesn’t rank as highly on my list. Nonetheless, there is great music out there besides the popstars on the radio. Why not give it a try and perhaps you will find a local musician whose music you could love. Saavn Music & Radio Another Hindi-related app for free music downloads, Saavn is in contention for the best app for Bollywood music. Personally, I believe Gaana is a bit better, but Saavn nonetheless shouldn’t be ignored. Saavn gives pretty much everything that Gaana does, but there are some differences between the two apps. For example, with Saavn, you can also enjoy podcasts and audio programmes. By following your favourite artists, you will be notified when/if there are any updates. Saavn In addition, with Saavn you can listen to your favourite songs offline. Playlists are also in your control to create and then modify. Like Gaana, you still get the array of different music, from English to Bollywood, Hindi to Tamil. Saavn Music & Radio is proving to be quite popular, with around 750,000 downloads recorded on the Google Play site. MP3 Music Download An app as simple and effective as its title suggests, MP3 Music Downloader may not be as popular as the rest of these apps for free music downloads, but it certainly contends well. With this app, you have unlimited access to a bunch of music files, as well as unlimited music downloads. It’s all very simple with this app. Just search for the song, artist or genre you have in mind, let the app work its magic, and then begin your download. Download App You can alternatively just stream the track if you prefer. Ultimately, this app is one of the most basic music-related apps out there on the market. It has been downloaded only 8,356 times at present, but around 50% of users have rated the app a full 5 stars out of 5. Other Great Free Music Download Apps That Almost Made the Cut Apple Music From the mega power of Apple Music comes this useful app. There are approximately 30 million Apple tracks available to listen to through this app. However, I must declare early that this app is not completely free. On the other hand, if you subscribe you can use it for free for 3 months. The fact that Apple Music is not free has dropped it out of my personal top 10 apps for free music downloads. If it weren’t for this hick-up, however, Apple Music would have a fair shot at one of the highest positions on the top 10. There are thousands of playlists to go along with the huge library of 30 million Apple songs. You can create your own library of your favourite songs. Apple Music also offers regular recommendations depending on what you listen to. There are also radio stations and other audio programmes to delve within. Basically, if you don’t want to spend a penny, you can only have this app for a limited time. The Apple Music app currently holds an overall rating of 3.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Shazam I wrestled with myself for quite some time on where to put Shazam on this list. This app fully deserves a top 10 place, and 2 million people on Google Play would probably agree with that. At the present moment, Shazam has been downloaded almost 3 million times. Of these downloaders, around two-thirds of them have given Shazam the full 5 out of 5 rating. Another half a million have given the app a 4 star rating. Shazam has an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Besides these highly impressive statistics, what does Shazam have to say about itself? Apparently, top singers and celebrities like Adele and Demi Lovato are using the app for their own free music downloads. Some of the top features include: access to lyrics, identify music offline, add songs onto Spotify playlists from Shazam, and more. Shazam also uses amazing visual recognition scanning. This means if you see an album cover or poster, for example, which you want to know more about, use Shazam to scan it and the app will collect information about the music artist in question. There are many other little features which make Shazam a great free app to have. I highly recommend giving it a try, despite the fact that it has just slipped outside the top 10. Vevo In recent years, the Vevo corporation have placed their stamp on many of the biggest, most viewed music videos. Vevo is the result of the partnership between two of the giants of music distrubution: Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group. From this we now have Vevo, the now-popular music video hosting service. So, what can their app do for you? This app as you may have already figured is focused solely on music videos. Due to the fact that this app deals with videos only, and not specifically free music download, it has thus crept out of the top 10 spot. With Vevo, you can watch your favourite music videos in HD and create playlists of the videos you like most. You can also favourite artists, and when a new music video is released by your favourited artist you will be notified. However, Vevo is only available in a select number of countries. The Vevo app is available in the following countries: Canada, USA, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Ireland, France, Germany, The Netherlands, UK, Spain, Mexico, Poland, and New Zealand. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.2 out of 5 on Google Play. TuneIn Radio One of the most popular radio apps, TuneIn Radio offers an impressive 10,000 different radio stations for free. As a radio station app, it has thus fallen out of my top 10 apps for free music downloads. In addition to all this great music, you can also tune into the news, sports and weather broadcasts, as well as other radio programmes. With TuneIn Radio you can keep track of college basketball, the NFL, NBA, and the NHL. All of the radio is delivered live from the very sources. Therefore, you won’t be in complete control over what music artist or song you want to listen to. Nonetheless, you can choose a specific radio station out the thousands of quality stations on offer. Basically, TuneIn Radio sources thousands of top quality radio stations into one single app. There is an abundance of stations to choose from. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play. Tidal This app combines high quality definition, high definition music videos, as well as valued information from music journalists. There are huge amounts of music on offer with Tidal. The app claims to offer over 40 million tracks, as well as more than 130,000 high definition music videos. As for the contributing journalists, you can try out the carefully selected playlists chosen by these musical experts. You can also read the well-crafted articles, recommendations and interviews provided by these music journalists. In addition to all this, there are no ads nor any ‘fuzzy images’. There is also an offline mode, which allows you to listen to your albums and playlists when you are out and about. The Tidal app currently holds an overall rating of 3.6 out of 5 on Google Play based on 38,653 votes. Heart Radio Again another radio app, Heart radio is a popular radio station situated in the UK. The app is plain and simple. This app is the official app of Heart Radio and thus brings the station to your device. With the app, you can also see what songs are playing next, re-listen to songs from the past week, view the top trending videos, get celebrity news, and more. Of course, this app isn’t exactly an app for free music downloads, hence why I haven’t included it in my top 10. It is, however, a good radio station nonetheless. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on Google Play. Qello Concerts This app is quite unique. With Qello Converts, you can stream classic concerts and documentaries. This app is essentially a treasure chest full of old great live concerts which you can replay at any time. Some of the things which this app also provides are: One of more free tracks from each concert, more than 30 channels of continuous concert moments, and special free full-length shows. It may not be an app for free music downloads, but is is however an app for free music concert downloads. In addition, there are a whole bunch of award-winning music documentaries to feast your eyes and ears on. Qello Concerts currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on Google Play based on 23,233 user votes. Pandora Radio Unlike most radio apps, Pandora gives you complete control over what you want to listen to. With Pandora music, you can create individual stations or playlists for your favourite artists. Most Pandora apps allow you to store up to 100 different artist playlists. Once you have an artist playlist, you will be given anything by that artist on demand. Like I said, Pandora lets you create your own unique radio channels. Personally, I am a huge fan of Pandora, and it almost made its way into my top 10 favourite apps for free music downloads. You can upgrade to Pandora Plus, which will cut the ads, allow replays and skips, and offline playing. The Pandora Radio app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play based on an impressive number of 2,651,882 user votes. I highly recommend this app, despite the fact I haven’t included it in my top 10. SongFlip The SongFlip app claims to offer its users the ability to stream millions of free songs online. I am unsure if there is actually millions on offer from SongFlip, but it does nonetheless offer a lot. The SongFlip app is one of the most basic apps for free music downloads. Simply search for your song or artist and begin streaming for free. There is a high chance that SongFlip has the exact song or artist that you have in mind. After all, it does claim to have millions of tracks to give. The SongFlip app currently holds an overall rating of 4.5 out of 5 on Google Play. Radio Player by Audials This app, yet another radio app, offers over 80,000 different radio stations across the USA. Simply search for an artist, a genre, song or album, and Audials will do its best to retrieve a station best suited to your search. In addition, you can record songs playing on any radio. In other words, if you hear a song which you happen to like but you don’t know the name of, you can choose to record the song right there and then. You can also connect your device to another computer belonging to you, thus allowing you to sync the selected music onto your home PC or laptop. The Radio Player by Audials app currently holds an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5 on Google Play based on 19,49 user votes. Radio Online – PCRADIO You’ve probably assumed by now that there are thousands of radio-related music apps. That assertion would be correct. However, Radio Online – PCRADIO is one of the best free radio apps out there, and the following is why. This app offers hundreds of free radio stations, which is not as many as the thousands offered by the above Radio Player by Audials, or, TuneIn Radio, for example. Nonetheless, Radio Online PCRADIO does have its own perks. With this app, you can use it even if you do have the lowest of internet speeds. Also, all the radio channels are categorised by artist and genre, making your searches easy. Furthermore, Radio Online PCRADIO also offers full discographies on several artists. The Radio Online PCRADIO app currently holds an overall rating of 4.7 out of 5 on Google Play based on 645,547 user votes. Other Great Music Downloader Apps For Free Music Downloads, and Apps Similar To Music Streaming The following apps are other apps for free music downloads. In addition there are some apps which are not quite designed to download free music. Some play music like many of the aforementioned apps and some are more unique in what they offer. SoundHound Picture yourself listening to a song, you don’t know who it’s by, and you have no way of finding out the artist. Well, these days we have SoundHound to do that for us. SoundHound can recognise voice clips, which will then generate heaps of results. You can save all your searches and import your findings into your Spotify account. The app comes with an embedded YouTube player so you can watch the music video of the found song (if there is one). You can also view the lyrics to the found song, or, if you wish, SoundHound will direct you to where you can purchase the track. There is also an abundance of information on numerous music artists to browse through. All this sounds great, but there is one snag. One version of SoundHound on the Google Play website is unfortunately not free ($3.99). On the other hand, there is another SoundHound app which is practically the exact same which is free. At the moment, I am trying to differentiate between the two apps and figure out if there is any difference. However, I can’t see any major differences, or a single difference at all. In short, search for the free version of SoundHound. This app currently holds an overall rating of 4.3 out of 5 on the Google Play website based on 623,731 user votes. Deezer – Songs & Music Player Deezer does everything that a good music app should do. One of the best features used on this app is called ‘Flow’.. Flow will suggest music based on your listening habits. You can also play unlimited playlists, tune into the radio and catch up on the news or sports, create your own playlists, and generally listen to some of the world’s leading musical icons. The Deezer app currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on the Google Play website. blinkbox Music A very basic app, blinkbox Music is an app specifically for android users. The app itself offers the essentials, such as unlimited streaming and a ton of free and popular hits. You can tune into top 40 playlists and other great additions. The blinkbox Music app currently holds an overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on the Google Play website. YOUZEEK Free Music Streaming A great app which shouldn’t be ignored, YOUZEEK is offered in 16 different languages, and it has in store around 1 million music artists and 1,500 different genres to choose from. You can create and edit your own individual homepage, share playlists with friends and use the privacy settings. YOUZEEK is available in over 200 countries. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4 out of 5 stars on the Google Play website. Stingray Music This app is available for free if it is part of or related to a TV subscription which you have signed with. Stingray has around 2000 individualised music channels to select from. In total, there are around 100 different genres to browse through, and you can customise your very own channel. Stingray offers the basics of any other great free music streaming app. The app currently holds an overall rating of 4.3 out of 5 on the Google Play website. Torch Music With Torch music, you can experience all the pleasantries of listening to your favourite music without the interruption of ads. Think of Torch Music as an app similar to Spotify without the ads. You can also connect your Torch Music account with Facebook and share what you’re listening to with your friends online. The Torch music app currently holds and overall rating of 4.1 out of 5 on the google Play website. New Releases Ed Sheeran – Shape Of You Currently storming the charts across the world is the young English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran. After a few years from his last album release, Sheeran is back from a brief break to release his new album, Divide. In the event of its release, Ed has given us two songs from his newest album, Castle on the Hill and Shape of You. Shape Of You is currently number 1 in the UK as well as other countries, and is the perfect track to ‘get down to’ in the clubs (if you haven’t already). Chainsmokers – Paris The Chainsmokers are the biggest DJ act to appear from the music scene within the past year or so, and their most recent single Paris is storming the charts. In recent weeks, these guys have produced big hits like Closer and Don’t Let Me Down. Paris has that same vibe, which has thus placed the track highly on the official charts throughout the world. The song has the same elements has other big tracks, which will make it an essentially tune on any weekend playlist. Rag’n’Bone Man – Human This rising artist is from England, and his most recent song Human is not only taking the UK charts by storm, but it also reached no.1 in several other European countries. Rag’n’Bone Man is certainly a name to remember for the future. To put a name on the genre, I would classify the song itself as Soul track with a modern touch of R & B.  This song may very well top the charts in the next few weeks, so get listening now. I Don’t Wanna Live Forever – ZAYN & Taylor Swift Zayn Malik of One Direction and pop super queen Taylor Swift have banded together to produce this song for the official Fifty Shades Darker soundtrack. The movie is set to release this week in cinemas worldwide, which should hopefully boost the song further up the charts. The song itself is well suited for the love and romance projected in the movie, so if you want some music for the upcoming Valentine’s day celebrations, this song may very well become part of your soundtrack. Little Mix – Touch Since appearing on the popular TV show The X Factor a few years back, Little Mix have gone from strength to strength. Their newest album has done quite well in the charts, and their new single, Touch, currently sits comfortably at no.4 on the UK top 40 charts. Touch blends the band’s nice girlband vocals with R & B vibes that have made them successful with earlier tracks, such as Shout Out To My Ex. Martin Garix & Dua Lippa – Scare To Be Lonely The world recognised Dj and producer, Martin Garrix teams up with female vocalist, Dua Lippa, for this big club mix. Scared To Be Lonely follows Garrix’s previous dance flavours, with big drops and catchy melodies sure to earn a place in your weekend playlist, and certain to get you pumped for the weekend parties. Stormzy – Big For Your Boots One of the biggest success stories to emerge from the London grime scene this year is Stormzy. It’s been 9 months since his last single, and now, his new single Big For Your Boots has climbed its way up the UK charts at no.8. The song is another great analysis of the working class London way of life. If you are a fan of British rap, Stormzy is an absolute must. James Arthur – Say You Won’t Let Go This young man won the coveted X Factor competition and disappeared into the shadow. Nothing was heard of James Arthur until this big single was unleashed, which shot its way up the charts. This, his first no. 1 single, is an acoustic ballad with simple love lyrics, sure to calm the heart of any romantically-seeking individual. He should be back with more similar music in the future, so keep an ear on him for the time being. Nick Jonas & Nicki Minaj – Bom Bidi Bom With the release of the new installment of the Fifty Shades franchise, Fifty Shades Darker, also comes a hot new soundtrack. Minaj and Nick Jonas from the hugely successful Jonas Brothers have teamed up to feature on the movie’s racy soundtrack. The track itself, Bom Bidi Bom, much like the movie it features on, is sure to get pulses racing and bodies moving. Ed Sheeran – How Would You Feel (Paean) Continuing from the upcoming release of his new album, Divide ÷ , Ed has just dropped yet another new single destined to do very well in the charts. The newest single, How Would You Feel (Paean) follows the same romantic vein as previous songs like Thinking Out Loud and Tenerife Sea. The song evokes the same nostalgic romances, sun rises and heartbreak which define some of Sheeran’s most popular songs. Jax Jones – You Don’t Know Me ft. RAYE Currently sitting nicely at no.4 on the UK top 40 charts is You Don’t Know Me by British DJ and producer Jax Jones, with RAYE on vocals. The track is inspired by the likes of Justin Timberlake and most other popular pop dance tracks that have dominated the charts these past few years. The song is perfect for uplifting the weekend party, setting a nice light dance atmosphere without going over the top. Dua Lipa – Be the One One artist who has really broken onto the music scene with great success recently is the beautiful singer, Dua Lipa. The singer has previously provided vocals for other chart hits, such as Scared To Be Alone by Martin Garrix, and You Don’t Know Me by Jax Jones. Dua Lipa indeed has her own material, and this upbeat track is doing quite well in the charts. She is really one to watch for the upcoming musical year and beyond. Kygo & Selena Gomez – It Ain’t Me Pop princess Selena Gomez is back with a new track set to become a big hit. The song is another tale of hardship in a relationship, and although the track has a romantic attitude, Kygo is featured to deliver the dance vibes which make it the perfect track to get your groove on. It Ain’t Me is ultimately a great blend of ballad and beat, passion and pulse, love and vibe. Lana Del Rey – Love After her hiatus, Lana Del Rey is finally back and throwing out the big tunes. Her latest track, Love, features her trademark ethereal atmospheres, smooth vocals and tender themes. Love is a passionate track which echoes the nature of her first big hits, such as Born To Die, Summertime Sadness and Video Games. Fans of her music are sure to ‘love’ her new track. Sam Hunt – Body Like A Back Road Sam Hunt, a new name that launched from the American country scene just over 2 years ago, has released an interesting mix of country and pop. The singer holds onto his country roots with the slide guitar, organ and other elements, and meshed it with a cool beat. If you’re not a fan of country music, Body Like A Back Road might make all this change for you. The Weeknd & Daft Punk – Starboy Popular rap act The Weeknd teams up with the legendary DJ duo, Daft Punk for this big track. Daft Punk provide the solid beats for The Weeknd’s flow, creating a great mix of rhythm and attitude in Starboy. This track is on route to joining another hit for The Weeknd, which is not surprising considering Daft Punk are behind the creation. Drake – Fake Love American rapper, Drake is back releasing big hits. The Online Bling singer’s new track, Fake Love, is another mastery of R & B and a solid lyrical flow. Fake Love deals with superficial relationships, and features a good beat along with some nice melodies. If you’re a fan of Drake’s music, this track is a must. Maroon 5 – Cold Adam Levine and co. are still going strong in their latest offering, Cold. The high tempo track features some house elements, along with Levine’s trademark alto voice. Cold is ultimately about a failing relationship. In addition, rapper, Future, also provides a flowing rap and some extra vocals mid-track to mix things up, creating a mesh of pop and R & B elements. Coldplay & The Chainsmokers – Something Just Like This Two of the world’s leading musical acts have teamed up to produce something quite special. The ethereal harmonies and progressions of Coldplay have beautifully meshed with the vibes and feel-good pulses of the The Chainsmokers. Something Just Like This will soon dominate radio stations and the charts everywhere, I’m almost sure of it. Calvin Harris – Slide World-recognised DJ superstar Calvin Harris is back with the big tunes. His latest single, Slide, features the good old savvy beats and rhythms that previously made the DJ such a big success. Slide has a hint of 80s funk, blended with some smooth male rap-inspired vocals and the essential big drops that’ll surely get you grooving. Imagine Dragons – Shot Imagine Dragons have enjoyed worldwide success over the past few years, and its for good reason that the American band are so popular. Their latest track, Shot, is filled with their trademark feel-good blend of pop, rock and dance. With a touch of electric guitars, blended with some synths and some strong vocals, Shot is a euphoric song that all fans of the band will surely enjoy. Katy Perry – Chained To the Rhythm Katy Perry has never really stepped out of the spotlight since her first single, I Kissed A Girl shot to no.1 all those years ago. These days the singer is back on the radio with her popular single Chained To the Rhythm. This song is doing quite well in the charts, with its catchy melodies and his forceful rhythm, it’s sure to be another pop hit for the American singer. Willie Nelson – A Woman’s Love The Red Headed Stranger is still going strong, as is evident in his most recent single, A Woman’s Love. For fan’s of Nelson and country in general, this track will be a joy. A Woman’s Love returns to the country roots of a vocalist spurned by love, accompanied by a wailing harmonica and the rest of Willie’s ingredients which open up the vistas of the western dusty roads in the mind’s eye. Rag’n’Bone Man – Skin Perhaps the biggest music star to emerge from nowhere these past few weeks is Rag’n’Bone man. His track ‘Human’ erupted onto the charts and catapulted the young singers name into the uppermost ranks of the musical world. The hits keep on coming with this man; Skin is set to also do very well in the charts. It features that similar gospel, R & B vibe that is inherent in his other tracks. This man is certainly a talent to keep an ear on. Coldplay – Hypnotised Coldplay are back, but then again, due their huge success as a band over the years, have they ever really left? Their most recent single, Hypnotised, is a continuation of their soft pop/rock sound, with a dreamy mix of piano, hypnotic guitars and Chris Martin’s high vocals. Although a new album hasn’t been scheduled for the band, I sense that a new album is in the works and coming soon. Ed Sheeran – Perfect The 25 year old pop superstar has just brought out his much anticipated new album, Divide, and the songs are proving to be big hits. Following the release of Shape of You and Castle On the Hill, two huge hits, Sheeran’s new song Perfect is another romantic hit dedicated to the new love of his life. Perfect is as romantic as it gets, and this ballad should certainly do very well in the charts over the next few weeks. Meghan Trainor – I’m A Lady Pop princess Meghan Trainor returns with another big track sure to empower ladies across the world. The singer secured some pretty big hits last year, and the big tunes keep coming from this one. I’m A Lady has hints of Beyonce, with some techno drops, R & B sazzle and powerful vocals. This song should do well in the tracks, if her past songs are anything to go by.

While it may not be anything new, an email was sent to me over the weekend that claimed to be from Apple Customer Support. The email told me that my Apple ID account had been temporarily frozen and that I needed to confirm my Apple ID account information in order to unfreeze it. The reason for the freezing is because someone apparently added or changed a contact email address on my account. So it appears someone hacked into my account and Apple is simply being the good guy and stopping the hacker in his or her tracks, but none of that actually happened, and what I merely received in my inbox was a phishing scam designed to steal my Apple ID username and password. If you’re not familiar with the term “phishing,” you no doubt at least experienced at some point during your lifetime. Phishing is when “Phishing is when a scammer poses as a legitimate company in order to acquire personal information such as your username, password, credit card details, etc. This email looks like an official email from Apple, but not entirely. There are a few ways to tell if this kind of email is a scam, and usually it only takes a few seconds. For starters, you can look at the email address of the sender. In this email it says that the email comes from an Apple.com address, which looks pretty legit, but take notice of the “via secureserver.net”. This means that the email isn’t actually coming from that Apple.com address, but rather another email address that’s masked as the Apple.com email address. Pretty sneaky on the scammer’s part. Furthermore, when you hover over any links in the email, you’ll get a small pop-up in the lower-left corner of the browser that shows you where the link takes you. If this was an official email from Apple, it would take us to an Apple.com link. However, the email that I received links to a webpage on a site called Infolktainment.com (for the record, we don’t recommend actually going there). Phishing scams are nothing new and they’ve been around for as long as the internet has existed. Apple is a heavy target, though, as it’s one of the most popular brands on Earth, so it’s fairly easy for a scammer to reach a wide selection of users by posing as Apple. Unfortunately, many users take the bait since they’re easily convinced that it’s a legitimate email, and they end up having their iTunes account hacked into. The next time you get one of these emails, simply just mark it as spam so that similar emails don’t show up in your inbox again. Instead, they’ll be sent straight to your spam folder. Of course, scammers always find ways around this, like sending phishing emails from different email addresses so that they still make their way to your inbox. This can be pretty frustrating, but the more you send these kinds of emails to your spam folder, the more you’re knocking them down one at a time. It’s also important to make sure that you give your Apple ID account a strong password with a mixture of letters and numbers in order to make it difficult to crack. And obviously never give out your Apple ID password to anyone, unless they’re a trusted friend or a family member. 6 Responses 10/18/2014 Cree Reply Your website is the best 10/18/2014 Cree Reply The best 02/16/2015 Pramod Reply Make apple id 06/01/2015 Rick Hyne Reply Unless you have initiated the email by some method such as a password reset, NEVER respond to ANY email requesting you perform an action. Ask yourself why I might be getting an email for a service I use that has advised me of a change. Did I forget to change my expired credit card information. If so, log-in to the service as you would normally do. NEVER respond to a link in an email. There is no end to various attempts to scare people into giving up their personal information, to provide access to their accounts or computer. This also goes for inbound phone calls. 02/24/2017 Suzanne Swenson Reply apple1@dontyougiveupnow.com – definitely seems like a scam e-mail: Apple Dear Apple User, Thank you for choosing Apple .

Rather, the self-driving space is left to contend with legal hurdles, in addition to the likes of technological and regulatory issues. It is currently speculated that the earliest self-driving ventures could come to fruition is 2020. With the legal monkey on its back, will the schedule be pushed back? Technology Companies Give Up Go-Alone Approach After high profile launches, with the promise to commercialize self-driving cars, tech companies such as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) have slowly and steadily realized the challenges to diversify into hardware. After Google spun off its self-driving venture into a standalone company called Waymo, it has signaled that it will stick to its strength of supplying the technological expertise, while leaving the hardware part to traditional automakers. Related Link: Automakers Eye The Finish Line in Sprint To Rollout Driverless Vehicles Confidentiality Breached These companies are now facing challenges from unexpected quarters. A few of them have initiated legal proceedings, alleging theft of intellectual property, specifically by former employees, who breached confidentiality clause. Google's ‘Et Tu, Brute' Moment Google's Waymo filed a lawsuit in a California federal court last Thursday, alleging that Anthony Levandowski, a former manager at Waymo had downloaded more than 14,000 proprietary and confidential files, including the lidar, Light Detection and Ranging, circuit board. Levandowski quit Google in January 2016 and later formed Otto LLC in May 2016 — a company intended to develop hardware and software for autonomous vehicles. Otto was subsequently acquired by Uber Technologies for $680 million. Waymo's lawsuit alleges unfair competition, patent infringement and trade secret misappropriation. "Instead, Otto and Uber have taken Waymo's intellectual property so that they could avoid incurring the risk, time, and expense of independently developing their own technology," Waymo said in the complaint. The lawsuit doesn't look like without merit, as Waymo took seven years to design the lidar circuit board, while Uber reportedly did it in nine months. Google was also involved in another lawsuit, which it filed last December, against a former employee for breaching the contractual obligations concerning possession and use of confidential information, when he went on to work for a start-up called Drive.ai. Tesla Also In Legal Tangle Meanwhile, in a separate development, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) has sued its former autopilot director. In a lawsuit filed with the Superior Court of California, Santa Clara, the case reads in part, "This dispute arises out of the efforts of [redacted] [...] to violate his contractual and other obligations to Tesla by attempting to recruit at least a dozen Tesla engineers, taking Tesla's confidential and proprietary information, and doctoring and destroying evidence in an effort to cover his tracks — all for the benefit of a competing venture he launched while still a Tesla employee." The formal complaints raised in the case, however, are verbatim: Breach of contract. Breach of duty of loyalty. Aiding and abetting breach of duty of loyalty. Intentional interference with contractual relations. Intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. Violation of Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200. With huge stakes involved in IP, it is not without rhyme and reason, these technology giants have opted to fight it out in the courts.

By Christopher Morris on March 5, 2017 12:00 pm in Technology ShareTweetPostFlip Four big mobile releases are due from the two major players in the marketplace before the end of 2017. Apple will release two iPhone units under the iPhone 8 moniker, with an iPhone 8 Plus variant accompanying the standard iPhone 8 smartphone. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S8 from Samsung will arrive in the next few weeks, followed later this year by the Galaxy Note 8. All four devices promise different qualities, while there are particular reasons why we should expect something outstanding from each individual handset. Image Credit: Samsung Display via YouTube (Screen grab) Galaxy S8 The Galaxy S8 is arguably the most important mobile release in the history of Samsung, as it must follow on the back of the most disastrous release in its history. The exploding Galaxy Note 7 has cast a shadow over Samsung for several months, particularly after the Korean Company was forced to pull the plug and completely recall the handset. In the media furore which followed, Android fans patiently awaited the next release from Samsung, and this is now imminent with the Galaxy S8. Usually there are a huge amount of rumors circulating regarding any Galaxy S mobile, and it seems as if Samsung is somewhat willing to play ball with such suggestions. However, in the ensuing climate following the the disaster of the Galaxy Note 7, it is hardly surprising that the Korean manufacturer wishes to proceed with caution. Thus, we haven’t heard too much from Samsung on the subject of the Galaxy S8, and the corporation has even chosen to duck its annual appearance at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Samsung is assiduously ensuring that the Galaxy S8 is the absolute best smartphone that it can possibly produce, and this should lead to a very slick and stable device at the very least. There haven’t been any mind-blowing specs linked with the Galaxy S8, but the introduction of the Bixby AI assistant will be a major step forward for the series. We can, though, expect the processor, RAM and battery included in in the S8 to be improved. The bezels in the unit will also be slimmed down significantly to produce a new slimline design, and reports have suggested that Samsung will include a powerful front-facing selfie camera. As the first major smartphone released in 2017, those looking for an upgrade will be particularly attracted to the Galaxy S8. Image Source: ReleaseDatePortal Galaxy Note 8 The Galaxy Note 8 must pull out all of the stops to attract consumers in 2017 after the debacle of the Galaxy Note 7. And thus Samsung is expected to take more chances with this particular release. In particular, the Galaxy Note 8 could witness the first foray of the Korean corporation into 4K resolution. A whopping 6.2-inch screen has also been linked with this phablet release. Samsung may also choose to include a true octa-core processor this time round, while a massive 6GB of RAM is another rumored spec. Powerful camera technology and micro SD will bump the storage of the device up to 256GB, ensuring that this is an extremely powerful unit. Ultimately, the Galaxy Note 8 is likely to be one of the most advanced mobiles ever released when it arrives on the scene. hurk / Pixabay iPhone 8 Apple is expected to make significant changes to the iPhone design when the iPhone 8 is released in order to mark the tenth anniversary of the iPhone range. Thus, the iPhone 8 will feature a largely glass-based design, with the smartphone also notable for delivering the first ever curved screen in iPhone history. The iPhone 8 has also been linked with an edge-to-edge display, while Apple could also shift from LCD to OLED technology. There will be a certain onus on Apple to increase the screen resolution of the iPhone 8 in order to catch up with rivals. Thus, we could see a full HD iPhone smartphone for the first time when the iPhone 8 is released. Apple has also been strongly linked with augmented reality for the iPhone 8, with the Californian corporation having invested heavily in this innovative technology. Wireless charging and USB-3 have also been linked with the phone, and it seems that Apple is ready to remove the Home button from the device completely, instead replacing it with virtual buttons embedded within the display. Apple is also reportedly working on some nifty camera technology, while specs such as processing speed, storage and RAM will also get a boost. This promises to be the revolutionary iPhone release that fans of the hugely successful range have been promised for at least a couple of years. Image Source: iphonedigital/flickr.com iPhone 8 Plus Finally, the iPhone 8 Plus will accompany the mainstream iPhone 8, being released alongside the flagship smartphone. It is not entirely clear whether or not Apple will release two or three devices in the iPhone 8 generation, as the consumer electronics giant has also been linked with the release of a so-called iPhone X. But an iPhone 8 Plus release is a certainty, with the phablet backing up the iPhone 8 smartphone. But what differences can we expect between the two? Generally, the specs of the iPhone Plus range are superior to the smartphone, so a larger battery and more RAM can be anticipated. Apple will also fit the iPhone 8 Plus with a bigger screen, with some suggesting that there will be a 5.8-inch version of the iPhone this time round. Furthermore, Apple often includes superior camera technology in its phablet range, and this is likely to be replicated once more when the iPhone 8 generation hits the stores. Some obsesrvers have suggested that Apple will include dual-camera technology in all of its handset releases this time round, so it remains to be seen how the iPhone 8 Plus is distinguished from its smaller cousin. Those wanting the best Apple handset, with the largest, highest resolution display, will definitely opt for the iPhone 8 Plus. And there is even a chance that this could be the only mobile Apple releases this year that benefits from OLED technology.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple The Better One Between Apple iPhone 8 vs. Google Pixel 2 Corazon Victorino International Business TimesMarch 5, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share After Google confirmed that a Pixel successor is hitting the market this year, the device is now expected to be one of the major competitors of Apple’s upcoming 10th anniversary iPhone, which is speculated to debut with the “iPhone 8” moniker. The iPhone 7 was not so much of an upgrade compared to its predecessor, so Apple is poised to change that with the next iPhone. On the other hand, Google’s Pixel 2 could raise the bar for Android smartphones coming out this 2017. Given that both handsets are likely to emerge successful upon their respective launch, it’s just fitting for us to look into them and see if one can one-up the other based on their rumored specs and features. Performance Apple’s iPhone 7 impressed a lot of people when it launched with the Apple A10 Fusion chip, which is basically a quad-core ARM processor composed of two high-performance Hurricane cores and two high-efficiency Zephyr cores. The six-core PowerVR Series7XT Plus GPU was also no joke for it enabled the device to do “console-level” performance when running mobile games. This year, the Cupertino giant is rumored to bring its A11 processor to the next-generation iPhone. Back in December, The Motley Fool reported that Apple’s supplier, TSMC, is going to manufacture the smartphone CPU using 10-nanometer technology. It is then expected to be more powerful and faster than the A10 Fusion. As for its GPU, analysts have said that the next-generation iPhone could come equipped with Imagination Technologies’ Series8XT, which is reportedly more power-efficient than the one on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Geekbench scores for the current iPhones are really impressive, so we’re hoping to see higher ratings for the iPhone 8’s performance.  Google also ensured that its flagship smartphone, the Pixel, would be a powerhouse. The Android 7.1 Nougat-running handset debuted with the Quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chipset, which is made up of two 2.15 GHz Kryo cores and two 1.6 GHz Kryo cores. The device also came wth the Adreno 530 GPU. The CPU and GPU combo in the Pixel was regarded as pretty stellar by the tech industry at the time. Looking at it now, however, the combination wouldn’t really be as impressive as before. Despite receiving great scores from Geekbench, it’s clear that the Pixel was nowhere near the iPhone 7 in terms of performance. BGR’s comparison of the handsets’ Geekbench scores showed that the Apple device crushed the Google phone in both the single-core (3488 vs. 1565) and multi-core (5590 x 4103) tests. The Pixel 2 is rumored to run on Snapdragon 835 CPU — the same chipset that will be powering Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. If this were the case, then it’s certain that the iPhone 8 will trump the Pixel 2 in terms of performance. The Geekbench results for the Galaxy S8+ have already been leaked, and the Snapdragon 835 chipset received a lower score than the iPhone 7 Plus in the single-core test (1929 vs. 3473). In the multi-core test, the processor did better than the A10 Fusion, but the difference isn’t as significantly large as in the single-core test (6084 vs. 5664).  Display For the most part, the iPhone 8 is claimed to launch with a 5.8-inch display. What would make this screen special is the company’s rumored venture into edge-to-edge display that would see the death of the physical home button. This will not come as a surprise if true because the big players in the smartphone industry are migrating to this type of display for their flagship devices. LG already showed off its edge-to-edge design on the G6 at the recently concluded MWC 2017. Samsung is also said to have embraced this type of display design for its Galaxy S8. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said back in February (via MacRumors) that the iPhone 8's display is an OLED panel. In spite of the larger screen estate, fans can expect the handset itself to retain the size of the current iPhone. Kuo said the measurements of the phone’s form factor would be the same as those of the iPhone 7, but the rather large screen will eat up the entire front panel of the iPhone 8. This would be possible thanks to the advanced technology that would allow Apple to embed its Touch ID fingerprint scanner onto the display itself. Read More There were rumors of Apple killing off Touch ID for a more advanced 3D scanner with facial recognition technology, but come to think of it, it’s unlikely for the Cupertino giant to just get rid of Touch ID after all of the hard work it has put into making it the first line of defense of iPhone users from hackers as well as the verification tool to authorize users’ purchases and other mobile monetary transactions. Nothing about the screen resolution has been mentioned so far, but we’re hoping Apple is considering bumping up the 750 x 1334 resolution and 331 ppi pixel density on the iPhone 7 for this year’s iPhone.  The original Google Pixel launched with a 5-inch AMOLED capacitive screen with 1080 x 1920 screen resolution and 441 ppi pixel density. Based on speculations from tech insiders, Google is sticking with the 5-inch screen size for the Pixel 2. It is also expected to have a 2560 x 1440 screen resolution. This improved screen resolution will make the handset the perfect partner of Google’s VR headset Daydream. While many believe that Google could be bringing the design of the first-generation Pixel to the upcoming version, there are also others who are hoping for the company to follow the new trend of edge-to-edge displays. If done well, this could help increase the reception of consumers since not everyone was a fan of the rather large top and bottom bezels of the original Pixel smartphone. Pocket-lint says shrinking the bezels is one way for Google to stay competitive now that most of the big players in the phone-making scene are starting to embrace the almost bezel-less design for their devices. There also wouldn’t be a problem if the Mountain View giant shifts to edge-to-edge display since the fingerprint scanner on the original Pixel is rear-mounted. By keeping the sensor at the back, Google will have less challenges to take on in making the almost all-screen front possible.  Camera Technology At launch, the biggest selling point of the iPhone 7 was its advanced camera technology. Its bigger brother stole the show for the most part with its dual-lens camera module that was marketed as a technology that captures DLSR-quality photos. The iPhone 7 also has a similar kind of camera; the only difference is it has a single lens instead of two. It has the same 12-megapixel sensor, phase detection autofocus, optical image stabilization and the quad-LED (dual tone) flash. For its front camera, the iPhone 7 sports a 7-megapixel FaceTime HD camera that’s capable of taking 1080p@30fps videos. It also has face detection, HDR and panoramic features. There’s no word yet on how Apple intends to top the rear camera of the iPhone 7, but there’s now word on a powerful front-facing selfie camera with 3D-sensing capabilities. This actually fueled speculations that Apple is getting rid of Touch ID because the front snapper is said to function as a 3D facial scanner as well as an iris scanner. JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall was even quoted by MacRumors in a separate report that facial recognition is a more secure alternative for Apple Pay.  On the contrary, Google set the bar high for Android-powered phones in terms of camera technology when it introduced its Google Pixel late last year. It even got a recognition from DxO Mark as the best smartphone camera yet. The back camera on the Pixel has a 12.3-megapixel sensor, an f/2.0 aperture, electronic image stabilization and laser autofocus as well as dual-LED (dual tone) flash. Despite not really having specifications that would make it stand out by leaps, Wired explains that the camera just impresses and blows everyone away because its HDR+ marquee mode takes images in rapid succession, analyzes them and creates some tone-mapping magic to create stunning photographs. The 8-megapixel front snapper is also commendable. This 2017, Google is likely to put a major emphasis on the camera of the Pixel 2. 9to5Google learned through sources that the company is developing a camera lens that will perform impressively even in low light conditions. The megapixels will not see a significant increase, but Google is going to compensate for this with extra camera features. Miscellaneous The iPhone 8 is going to have a water-resistant body. Compared to its predecessor, The Korea Herald reports the next-generation iPhone will have a higher water resistance rating. The iPhone 7 has IP67 rating by the way. With the 10th anniversary iPhone, Apple is aiming for an IP68 rating that would enable users to submerge their handsets underwater for 30 minutes without negative repercussions. There are also rumors Apple is re-adopting the glass body it used on the iPhone 4 instead of keeping its streak of using the aluminum body found on the recent iPhones. Apple supplier Catcher Technology says (via Nikkei) the glass body is returning this year. If true, Apple could make use of stainless steel frames to hold together the front and back glass panels of the device. For users who are very particular with the internal memory of their daily driver, the next iPhone could be the best iPhone for you yet. CNET reported late last month that Samsung’s biggest rival is ditching the 32GB base model for a generous 64GB starting memory variant. Previously, Apple got rid of the 16GB entry-level model when it launched the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Other expected specs and features for the iPhone 8 include wireless charging, support for Apple Pencil, 3GB of RAM and a new color variant (Red). Given the premium hardware of the next-generation iPhone, it is said to come with a hefty price tag that could exceed $1,000.  Water resistance has become a must-have feature of flagship phones, so the Pixel 2 is also rumored to sport a water-resistant body. Trusted Reviews claims Google could be looking to build a handset with either an IP67 or IP68 rating just to compete with the iPhone 8 and the Galaxy S8. The Pixel 2 is also expected to come with a tougher build because the original Pixel’s metal body is prone to scratches and dents. Some are hoping for Google to improve the audio experience in the next-generation Pixel since the first-generation device have tiny and downward facing speakers. Perhaps Google could equip the handset with more powerful speakers to make it a notable media-centric device. Rumor also has it that the Mountain View-headquartered company is going to increase the base model’s internal memory. The first Pixel debuted with 32GB and 128GB storage variants. Since video files and mobile games are becoming more ambitious, a larger internal memory would come in handy. Thus, sources are saying Google could be boosting the base model’s storage to 64GB. Other standout features that are expected for the Pixel 2 include Quick Charge 4.0 and Android 8 or another modified Android software like the Android 7.1 Nougat of the first Pixel. Meanwhile, it’s very likely for Google to keep the same price points of the predecessors for the new models.  Apple is likely to launch the iPhone 8 in September, while Google could hold an October/November launch event for the Pixel 2.

Apple is expected to launch three iPhone models this fall, and Business Insider is reporting that the release date for the much-anticipated smartphone could be later than its typical September launch date. There will be two successors to the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, but one model will be completely redesigned and could cost over $1,000. The $1,000 model will be the much anticipated “10th anniversary” iPhone that will feature better “OLED” screen, redesigned fingerprint sensor, and other yet to be revealed technologies. Forbes Apple Loop: New iPhone 8 Leaks Drop Loved Features, Pro Problems For MacBook, iPhone… https://t.co/PA8ju1jGlb — Alex Cart (@alex_carts) March 4, 2017 Though the launch may proceed as planned, in September, shipments could be delayed by a month or more because of two reasons: tech delays related to the 3D camera and the fingerprint ID. Apple is apparently developing its own technology for the fingerprint sensor that will sit under the display, instead of relying on tech offered by others. If they can pull off a September launch with a short turnaround time for shipping iPhone 8, it will be a tremendous achievement. iPhone 8 to use USB-C?

Here are 3 easy ways to find and buy AirPods, even when Apple says there are none available Dave Smith Mar. 5, 2017, 10:00 AM 73,267 facebook linkedin twitter email print Reuters/Beck Diefenbach Apple's truly wireless earbuds, called AirPods, are one of the hottest new gadgets right now. Despite being available for a few months now — they were supposed to release in October, but got delayed to December — finding AirPods is still incredibly tough. Unless you're extremely lucky, you will not be able to walk into an Apple store and find AirPods. Even if you ask store employees, like I did, they'll point you towards Apple's website, which says AirPods won't be widely available for at least another month. As of March 3, Apple says AirPods won't ship until April 21. But here's what Apple doesn't broadcast: Apple stores actually do receive routine shipments of AirPods on a semi-regular basis, albeit in small quantities. And there is a way to ensure you can find, buy, and pick up a pair of AirPods as soon as they become available at a nearby Apple store, which is way faster than waiting for Apple to ship them to your door. After trying this method myself, I was able to find and buy a pair of AirPods in less than a day. Here's how it works: View As: One Page Slides First of all, here's why these websites work in the first place: The following websites are not sanctioned by Apple in any way, but they are extremely accurate and work like a charm. Here's why: Apple stores won't advertise when they receive a new shipment of AirPods, but Apple's website does in fact update in real-time, and will reflect when any given store receives AirPods. There's no way to get notifications from Apple.com when new units are available, but these sites keep track of Apple's available inventory to give you alerts in various ways — some via email, some via browser notifications. Regardless of which website or service you choose, you'll also need to use Apple's own website to actually reserve your AirPods for pickup. Here's how that works: Apple; Dave Smith/Business Insider Once you get an alert from any of the following sites, quickly go to the AirPods page on Apple.com, click "Buy," but then choose the "Pickup" option on the page, as seen in the image above. You'll then see a list of nearby stores, based on the ZIP code you chose.   Apple Most of the stores will say AirPods won't be available for another month, but once you get an alert from any of these sites, you should see a green button instead of the ship dates, which will allow you to buy the AirPods online and pick them up from an Apple store that same day — in as little as one hour. The first site is by far the best: Fruit Basket. Guy Bianco/Fruit Basket Fruit Basket was created by Guy Bianco, a programmer based in North Carolina. To me, it's the easiest site to use because it's mostly hands-off, but still effective at alerting you. While the other options can send you emails, Fruit Basket can alert you as long as you keep the tab open on your browser; the site crawls Apple.com every 30 seconds, so there's less of a chance of you missing an opportunity. So long as you keep the Fruit Basket tab open on your desktop, you can have it alert you via browser notification as soon as there's AirPods stock available — it'll put a notification in the center of your screen, even if you're on another tab — as well as play a sound. It's extremely effective, especially if you're at work and on a computer most of the day. This was the site that worked for me: As soon as I got the notification that AirPods were available at Grand Central Terminal, I visited Apple's site, found the pick-up option for that store, purchased the AirPods, and picked them up in person — all in less than 30 minutes. Another great option: IsInStock.com IsInStock IsInStock can send you text or email notifications as soon as AirPods are available — this site also works for other Apple products and other rare items like the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation VR. To create an alert, you'll need to sign up to receive email and/or text notifications. Signing up also lets you choose which nearby stores you want alerts for, and you can also see a global map of what's in stock around the world in case you're interested. It's a useful site, but you have to be actively monitoring your phone and/or email for it to be truly effective — I got several emails saying AirPods were available at nearby stores, but since I didn't notice my emails immediately, waiting even just 10 minutes was enough for those units to sell out. Keep this in mind if you use IsInStock. Finally, the third best way to get AirPods: iStockNow. iStockNow iStockNow is very similar to IsInStock, in that it can show you a map of global availability for any given product, including non-Apple products like the NES Classic, and alert you via email when stock becomes available. That said, I found this site most useful by looking at stock in a list format. This provides a way of confirming what the other sites might tell you — are AirPods in stock in this store, or not? — and they'll also show you when those stores sell out to give you an idea of how long available stock actually lasts once it becomes available. The best piece of advice: Keep at it! Like I mentioned earlier, AirPods are sent to Apple stores on a semi-regular basis. This might mean your local Apple store gets in shipments every day or two, or every few days, or once a week, or once every couple of weeks. But if you sign up for alerts from any or all of these sites, you should be able to snag a pair of AirPods much sooner than Apple advertises. Best of luck, and happy hunting!

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Struggled in the Education Market in 2016 as Schools on Tight Budgets Chose Chromebooks | Main | A $12 Million Dollar Civil Rights Lawsuit has been filed against Apple for Alleged Racial Profiling by Apple Store Staff » March 05, 2017 Apple Still in the Hunt for a Transformative Acquisition to set Apple TV on Fire Prior to the Arrival of the Mobile TV Revolution   In 2011 Steve Jobs biographer Walter Isaacson once recounted Jobs wanting to reinvent televison: "I'd like to create an integrated television set that is completely easy to use. It would be seamlessly synced with all of your devices and with iCloud.' No longer would users have to fiddle with complex remotes for DVD players and cable channels. 'It will have the simplest user interface you could imagine. I finally cracked it." Yet Apple fans around the world are still waiting for the TV revolution to arrive.   In 2013 when Apple's CEO Tim Cook was interviewed by NBC, the topic of TV came up and Cook's face lit up, as noted in our cover graphic, and he said "It's an area of intense interest."   In 2014 Cook focused on TV in an interview with Charlie Rose. Apple's CEO is always saying that Apple doesn't talk about future products, yet in 2013 and 2014 Cook went out of his way to make it sound like something huge on the television front was on the verge of debuting. It's 2017 and Apple is still in search of something that could excite Apple fans regarding Apple TV.   This week the Post had learned that "Senior Apple executives have reached out to some of Hollywood's most successful TV and film producers in the last couple of weeks about going to work for the tech giant.   While at least one of the discussions between Apple and an executive was vague when it came to the tech company's ultimate goal, the executive was left with the impression that the Cupertino, Calif., company is looking for a transformative acquisition and not just a deal to buy TV shows."   Every year, Apple is on the verge of something big with Hollywood and nothing comes to fruition. In early 2016 Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple's Eddy Cue is on a Mission to Win Original TV Shows for Future Apple TV Service Bundle." In July another report was posted titled "Apple Once thought they cracked the TV Market, but just Keep Spinning their Wheels in Vain."   Last April Fast Company wrote a report According to five different sources who have been briefed on Apple's plans or spoken directly to Apple executives, the company is still a bit "disorganized," and these Hollywood principals complain that Apple hasn't presented a coherent strategy.   Evidently Apple thought they had something at one point in time but it could never materialize. Whether the Steve Jobs road map was too vague or the new leadership just couldn't find the magic lost with Jobs passing is unknown. But in that same time frame, Amazon came out of nowhere and created some amazing award winning TV series and their movie Manchester by the Sea walked away with two academy awards. They made Apple TV look irrelevant and outdated overnight.   In addition Google and Facebook are now in game or about to enter the market. Google is going to tie in their service to the Google Home device and I suspect that Amazon will introduce that on their Echo devices this fall.     While Apple is reportedly working on original TV series tied into Apple Music, it's unclear how well Apple's new service will be received beyond Apple's hardcore fans. The market is going to be so saturated with new TV services that Apple will have to do something rather dramatic for their new hybrid service to stand out. Tying it into a high end Apple HDTV could be what fans may want but are unlikely to get.   Hopefully Apple could pull off a win this year because after buying into the Apple TV box for years, many fans including myself will likely give up and go with another service. Apple TV's greatness has always been "just around the corner" and has never really materialized.   In many ways the key to the next TV revolution will be coming in 2018-2019 when 5G networks arrive and make mobile TV the next big thing. On that front, Apple owns the best smartphones and tablets on the market. So Apple could still pull off a big win in this market if they get their fan base recharged for this coming market later this year with a reinvented vision about content, content and more quality original content.   Apple has to go far beyond talk and finally deliver something tangible that can excite Apple fans because mere documentaries like Vital Signs or Carpool Karaoke, as fun as that is, isn't going to be enough to knock it out of the park.   Along with the arrival of Apple's exciting new high-end iPhones later this fall, Apple fans will be looking forward to seeing Apple deliver their all-new Apple Music/TV hybrid service that will prepare them for the coming 2018 5G mobile content revolution.    Until that day arrives, what would you like to see Apple's upcoming Apple TV service offer in terms of content over their competitors?

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software iOS 10.2 Has an ‘Ethernet’ Entry in the Settings App for iPhone & iPad By Uzair Ghani Mar 2, 2017 17Shares Share Tweet Submit Apart from the usual WiFi and Cellular options, you’ll be surprised to learn Apple baked in a new Ethernet entry in the Settings app. If Your Are Going to Hardwire Your iPhone or iPad to Ethernet, You Can Tinker with its Settings too Apple tends to bake new features into iOS depending on the use-case at hand. Now it has come to light if you connect an Ethernet adapter to your iPhone or iPad using a Lightning to USB 3 Camera adapter, then you will see a brand new entry pop up in the Settings app labelled ‘Ethernet.’ Using this new option, you can tinker around and see more information regarding the network you are hardwired too. This includes the IP address, subnet mask, router address, DNS, search domains, client ID, and of course, the usual settings pertaining to manual DHCP, static IP and more. Interestingly, the option is not visible at all if you aren’t connected to a network using a cable. Also, it should be noted here that Apple does not sell any sort of Lightning-to-Ethernet adapter to get things up and running immediately. Instead, you have to mix and match a few things if you want to jump into business. Still, with the new option in place, we have high hopes Apple will eventually release a dedicated adapter, allowing hardwired connectivity for iOS users. Advertisement Last but not the least, users should be aware of the fact that iOS has long accommodated Ethernet connections but there was no UI to manage things at all. Thankfully, with this addition in iOS 10.2, things are looking great for those especially in Enterprise. And of course, those who don’t tend to rely on WiFi at all for whatever reason. It remains to be seen if Apple will eventually come through with a dedicated adapter for iPhone and iPad users in order to access a network without having to use WiFi. But given how the company is setting up the entire stage, we have high hopes for a dedicated piece of hardware. What do you think about this little addition to iOS? Will you utilize it given you have the right adapters and dongles for it?

 What experts are saying about Apple's next big thing Kif Leswing Mar. 5, 2017, 8:00 AM 22,724 facebook linkedin twitter email print Not a real photo of Apple CEO Tim Cook.AP / Matthew Sumner for Getty Images There's a lot of pressure on Apple's next iPhone to deliver, both in product quality and sales.  Chatter from Apple's factories in Asia point to a completely redesigned iPhone coming out this fall, possibly with a better screen, longer battery life, and a $1,000 price tag. But perhaps the most interesting feature currently rumored for the so-called "iPhone 8" is a new "3D" camera.  The 3D camera would be the first step towards a technology called "augmented reality," which integrates the internet with the real world. It's a technology Apple CEO Tim Cook is fond of talking about in public.  In fact, earlier this year, he said it could "be as big as the smartphone," a technology that accounts for two-thirds of Apple's sales. Apple has bought several augmented reality startups, including FlyBy Media and Metaio, and has integrated some of them into a special projects camera group, Business Insider previously reported.  The ultimate goal is for augmented reality to inject computer graphics and important information into everyday situations — imagine raising your phone on the street and seeing directions to your next appointment, or a Pokemon hiding behind a bush. A 3D camera would allow the device to see how far away things are from it, which is critical for placing computer graphics in the real world in a way that they integrate seamlessly.  Eventually, a pair of smart glasses might replace your phone altogether to seamlessly integrate graphics and the real world. Apple never publicly comments on future products. But over the past few weeks, several Wall Street analysts have shared what they think they know about Apple's new "3D camera," and what it could mean for Apple investors and future Apple products — especially the high-end iPhone expected to launch this fall and likely to include the rumored 3D camera.  Steven Milunovich, UBS  UBS' Apple analyst wrote that "investors could be surprised at how AR could reinvigorate the iPhone/iPad and possibly result in new products" in a February 28 note in which he writes that Apple has 1000 engineers working on "a project in Israel that could be related to AR." He writes that Apple has an advantage over companies like Magic Leap, Google, and Microsoft for AR for four reasons: "hardware expertise and superior hardware/software integration; consistent updated releases with most customers on the latest version of iOS compared with the fragmented Android OS base;  an installed base of iPhone and iPad customers that can use AR rather than starting from scratch; and  a cloud infrastructure that facilitates data gathering." Milunovich also writes that "Apple's experience designing its own chips could present an opportunity." Here's how he sees Apple's potential AR timeline: UBS   In the short term, Milunovich believes Apple may integrate facial recognition and early developer tools for "basic AR experiences" into the next version of the iPhone or iPad, and that the features could improve retention rates and upgrade rates.  Andrew Gardiner and team, Barclays Barclays Gardiner's research note, dated February 22, focuses more on the specific hardware that Apple could introduce with upcoming versions of the iPhone or iPad, citing "research into the supply chain." "Comments from a number of optical and light sensing component companies over the last quarter or two have reignited discussion of the additional functionality to come in smartphones, in particular the so-called iPhone 8/X/Pro flagship device," Gardiner wrote. Gardiner spends a lot of time identifying which companies make the parts that go into the iPhone and which ones could stand to gain from a next-generation "3D camera."  He believes chipmakers like AMS, STMicroelectronics, Lumentum, and II-VI may be big winners as Apple includes a 3D sensor in 10s of millions of iPhones. A source familiar with Lumentum's business previously told Business Insider that the company would be supplying parts for the upcoming iPhone.  Ultimately, the big question for Gardiner is whether Apple will use a time-of-flight sensor or structured light sensor. He thinks Apple will use a combination of the two. Above is the chart he uses to explain the difference between the two. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages, Gardiner writes. Apple currently includes a "time-of-flight" sensor in current iPhones.  Morgan Stanley  Primesense/Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley's research looks more broadly at 3D sensing technology, and not necessarily Apple's interest in it. They write that 3D sensing will initially be limited to high-end smartphones, of which Apple makes up 70%-75% of the market.  The report looks at how 3D sensing works and which parts are generally needed: a light source, controlling optics, an image sensor, and a firmware chip.  They include a diagram courtesy of Primesense, an Israeli company that Apple bought in 2013.  Morgan Stanley cites AMS, a current Apple supplier, for potential applications for this technology, including "augmented reality and virtual reality, gesture, face recognition biometrics, improved 2D and video images, body measurement as well as autonomous driving." But Morgan Stanley questions the consumer appeal of AR and the viability of the requisite 3D camera technology, including whether most smartphones will have the necessary horsepower to do get the job done. Many people in the AR industry have told me that the power consumption and heat generated by processors are critical roadblocks. And it's not a given that the initial games and other AR experiences will click with consumers. Pokemon Go, an early AR app that had huge engagement, saw a sharp drop in usage after the initial novelty wore off.   Ming-Chi Kuo, KGI Securities KGI Securities In two notes issued in February, Kuo, widely seen as the top expert on Apple's supply chain, laid out everything he's hearing about Apple's 3D sensor, which he says is the result of "1-2 years spent on related-component R&D." He believes that the 3D camera on the upcoming phone will actually take the place of the front sensor, and will be composed of three modules. The application for this 3D camera is a "innovative user experience." "3D modeling offers a wide array of potential applications, for example replacing the head of a character in a 3D game with a user’s selfie (which contains 3D data), or using a 3D selfie (with depth information, unlike an existing 2D image) for AR/ MR applications," Kuo wrote.  In a previous note dated November 1, 2016, Kuo explained how he believes this fits in with Apple's product plans (emphasis ours): AR is related to all Apple’s current businesses; the key is that AR is an innovative human-machine interface that could be used in various devices & applications. All of Apple’s past successes were related to human-machine interfaces, such as mouse for Mac, click wheel for iPod, and multi-touch for iPhone and iPad. Assuming Apple successfully develops AR, we predict the firm will enjoy the following competitive advantages: (1) redefining existing key products and leading competitors by three to five years. For instance, this could happen for iPhone, iPad and Mac; (2) eliminating obstacles of Apple Watch and Apple TV by offering an innovative user experience; and (3) entering new business fields, such as autonomous driving system. We expect Apple to generate preliminary results for AR in the next 1-2 years at the earliest and working with iPhone may be the first step. Above is a diagram from a February 20 note explaining what sources he thinks will supply parts for the iPhone camera — largely lining up with the Barclays research.  Tim Cook, Apple CEO  But the biggest hints about Apple's augmented reality ambitions may come from its CEO himself. Here are the takeaways from his comments: He thinks that it could be a huge market opportunity: "I regard it as a big idea like the smartphone. The smartphone is for everyone. We don't have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market; it's for everyone."

Even the buttons on the elevators at Apple Park are said to resemble it. The button's tactile circularity promises an escape route to familiarity should users get lost or apps go wrong. However, its delicate components converge upon a recess in the phone's bezel, an area that could otherwise provide extra space to fit a larger display within the same handset profile. Rumors that the "iPhone 8" will replace the home button as we know it with an entirely virtual one can be traced back to April 2016. More recently, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that Apple will introduce a functionally distinct area below the screen exclusively for displaying virtual buttons, with a rumor over the weekend seeming to suggest that such a "function bar" is the reason behind conflicting reports over the display size of an upcoming OLED iPhone. Before the "function bar" rumor first surfaced, MacRumors forum member deuxani shared concept images, reproduced below, that offer some context for imagining how the bar might work. Framed within a 4.7-inch handset with minimal bezels, the virtual home button sits below the dock on the home screen in a separate dynamic space. Assuming Kuo's claims that the 5.8-inch OLED display includes a function bar, the remaining 5.15-inch primary display area allows existing apps to run fullscreen in their existing 16:9 aspect ratio. In the above example, only the home button is shown in the function area, but Apple could theoretically move the dock down with it, or add options for additional virtual icons like Bluetooth, App Switcher, Camera, or Siri. The shot on the right shows how the adoption of OLED screen technology might also enable the home button and indeed other screen elements to remain visible when the rest of the display is turned off. As with the Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro, native apps could be augmented with contextually adaptive virtual buttons, while third-party developers could code for additional UI elements alongside the home button, or bring frequently accessed functions into closer proximity with the user's thumb, as these concept designs for Instagram and Twitter envision. Other possibilities for virtual buttons could potentially include: Moving the back button from the top-left of the status bar to the bottom-left of the screen, alongside the home button; a scrollable strip to access additional buttons; media playback and video scrubbing controls; in-app navigation buttons; or perhaps additional space for game controls. "Soft" buttons on a smartphone are nothing new, but a "function area" on an iPhone could offer more flexibility by taking cues from the MacBook Pro's OLED Touch Bar. Patents show Apple has explored extending Touch Bar functionality to other devices, while Jony Ive has said the interface is "just the beginning of a very interesting direction" for the company. However, adapting the technology for an iPhone display likely presents distinct challenges, such as how to integrate the various functions the home button has inherited over the years (Siri, Reachability, exit Lock Screen, and so on), and how to avoid the presence of "dead space" where the Touch ID sensor would usually be located. iPhone 8 concept by Thadeu Brandão Indeed, ultimately the fate of a home button and "function bar" on an OLED iPhone may rest on Apple's ability to integrate fingerprint recognition technology into the display itself. A report earlier this week suggests Apple has solved this problem, but questions still remain. Will the display have a recess for Touch ID? Will new fingerprint recognition technology function across a larger screen area? And what other bio-recognition features might Apple include that could help solve the authentication issue? Facial recognition, iris scanning, and ultrasound methods have all been proposed. Rumors conflict over whether Apple will ramp up production earlier than usual for this year's OLED iPhone, but we may see part leaks that shed light on the design fairly soon. Other rumored features for the "10th anniversary edition" device include an edge-to-edge display, a glass body, some form of wireless charging, and extended battery life. The "iPhone 8" is expected to launch this September, alongside two more traditional "S" cycle iPhones with LCD displays.

Rating: 13 Votes Rainshadow 2 days ago at 05:00 am As with many new concepts, it will come down to how Apple implements it. I, for one, am looking forward to seeing what they come up with. I think there is potential here. One of my favorite things about iPhone 7 is the non-mechanical home button. I've let friends use my phone as guinea pigs and not one of them have noticed that it was not a button until I tell them. And no, they aren't idiots. Rating: 12 Votes odedia 2 days ago at 04:39 am So it's basically a touch bar for the iPhone. Makes sense given how apple likes to use the same concepts across their products. Rating: 4 Votes Avieshek 2 days ago at 04:28 am Wish 17" MacBook Pro could be offered in a 15" form factor similarly. I don't understand, a MacBook is rather a display without a touchscreen making it easier than an iPhone 8 with integrated fingerprint scanner as well to have zero bezels. Rating: 4 Votes subjonas 2 days ago at 07:16 am One of the main reasons I moved away from Android to iPhone many years ago was that I was fed up with always accidentally hitting the soft buttons on the bezel, and always having to look down at the bezel to press home. Jumping onto the iPhone with its one physical home button was like... coming home. Simple design at its absolute best. Apple, please don't sacrifice something classic and great for something new and kinda cool. Rating: 4 Votes NexusUser 2 days ago at 06:24 am You could've just said it will be like Android's on screen navigation setup... Seems fitting that Apple would copy one of the most iconic differences between iOS and Android for their 10th anniversary phone. I look forward to my iPhone friends demonstrating their "brand new" back button! Rating: 3 Votes SupaDav03 2 days ago at 09:26 am Wouldn't the option of leaving the Touch ID area visible even when the screen is off cause a crazy amount of burn in?

The store marks Apple’s second in Cologne and has been under construction for over a year now. The store is located in the high-traffic shopping district of Schildergasse. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case According to local blog Apfelpage, Apple has started assembling the teams for its new retail store in Cologne. The company has reportedly pulled some employees from the city’s other store at the Rhein Center. The new store has been under construction for nearly two years now and its opening is highly anticipated. We shared photos of the construction process a few months ago, showing the store start to take shape. Original photos of Apple’s signature wooden tables from the store can be dated back all the way to April of 2015, though. The Schildergasse shopping street is referred to as the busiest shopping street in Europe, attracting 13,000 people per hour. The street is 500 meters long and dates back to Roman times. The opening of an Apple store in this area is notable for a variety of reasons and this store will likely turn into one of Apple’s most popular locations around the world.   If Apple holds true to its normal tradition, the Schildergasse Apple Store will likely open during the morning of March 25th in celebratory style. We’ll have to wait for the company to release more specific details, though. Chance Miller @ChanceHMiller Chance covers Apple for 9to5Mac and contributes to 9to5Google, Electrek, and 9to5Toys.

Apple has discontinued selling the iPhone 6 from its line of products. Adding an even more interesting element here to the equation is that the iPhone 6 here comes with 32GB storage. The iPhone 6 has so far been available in storage options of 16GB, 64GB and 128GB. An iPhone 6 with 32GB storage in space gray variant is currently available on Amazon in India. This comes shortly after Apple silently launched an iPhone 6 32GB variant in China. The iPhone 6 is displayed on the homepage of Amazon and is being given as an offer which lasts up to March 7. The smartphone is listed with a price of Rs 28,999 which is supposedly a discount from its original price of Rs 30,700. The iPhone 6 is being sold by a third party retailer named E-Mobiles and it comes with 1 year warranty. There is an EMI option available as well starting at Rs 2,590 per month. The specifications remain the same as the other iPhone 6 models, but the question remains as to whether this is indeed a genuine product or not. And Amazon has taken up the deal as a promotional offer and included on its homepage. It also comes right after Apple launched a 32GB variant of the iPhone 6 in China, but in gold color. The said 32GB iPhone 6 in China has been available in China as a low-end model sold by third-party retailers. The same 32B iPhone 6 model will reportedly go on sale in Taiwan by Taiwan Mobile starting March 10. Taiwan Mobile will offer the 32GB iPhone 6 in gold variant for around $45 per month with a 30 month contract, reports 9to5Mac. Apple iPhone 6 specifications Apple launched the iPhone 6 back in 2014 in three different storage variants. Recalling the iPhone 6, it features a 4.7-inch LED-backlit IPS LCD display. In addition to the storage options, the iPhone 6 comes with 1GB of RAM. Under its hood, runs an Apple A8 dual-core Cyclone processor clocked at 1.4GHz. On the software front, the iPhone 6 runs on iOS 8. ALSO READ: Apple iPhone 6 review roundup: Is this the best iPhone ever?

However, online reports have been mostly based on rumors and unverified leaks. Different Mac rumors have also been circulating about the specs of one of 2017’s most anticipated new devices. News about the Cupertino-based tech giant’s newest premium tablet come out almost every week. However, none of them have come even remotely close to confirming its design and features. Nonetheless, we have rounded up the most recent and widely-circulated claims about the next-generation iOS gadget. Key features Alleged insiders have claimed that among the iPad Pro 2’s key specs include a 2224 x 1668p display. However, reports also stated that the tablet will still have the same pixel density as its predecessor. HIS market analyst Rhoda Alexander added that it will even sport the same 9.7-inch dimension. In spite of these unupdated features, Forbes claimed that the device will have a larger screen aspect ratio. This will be made possible by bezels that will be significantly reduced in terms of its . There are also rumors about its smoother navigation and A9X chipset. Aside from the 9.7-inch tablet, Apple will allegedly come out with other similar variants for more upscale techies. These allegedly include a higher-end 12.9-inch iPad Pro. There will also supposedly be an additional 10.5-inch variant that will be priced slightly higher than the generic one. There are also iPad Pro 2 rumors about its accompanying accessory, the Apple Pencil 2. The digital stylus pen will reportedly get an array of improvements this year. As per Mobipicker, it is very possible that the supplementary device will be released alongside the tablet. iPad Pro 2 release date DigiTimes said that the tablet will be released sometime this May or June 2017. This is contrary to previously reported earlier dates. The delay has allegedly already affected iPad component suppliers such as TPK and Foxconn. Both supposedly got very low first quarter financial results for this year and are pressuring Apple to speed up the launch. Other Mac rumors Aside from the iPad Pro 2, other Mac rumors have been keeping enthusiasts on their toes since 2017 began. For one, a  lot of patrons have been eager to learn more about the tablet line’s lightweight variant. The iPad Air 2 was released towards the end of 2014, so many believe that it badly needs a much newer version. However, the possibility of Apple releasing four different tablets this year just seems unlikely for some. The fact that none of the four have even been confirmed by the company also makes things very vague. Because of this, the public has been advised to just wait for Apple’s official announcements. What can you say about the different reports regarding Apple’s 2017 tablet line? Let us know by commenting below.

By Hadlee Simons on 3 March, 2017 A new report has refuted claims that Apple will be ditching the Lightning connector in favour of a USB Type-C port. Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal, citing “people familiar with the matter”, reported that the Apple would use the Android and Macbook standard on its smartphone. “They said Apple would introduce other updates including a USB-C port for the power cord and other peripheral devices instead of the company’s original Lightning connector,” the publication was quoted as saying. At the time, we wondered whether this could mean an actual Type-C port on a new iPhone or on the power cable going into the adapter. Now,  noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has claimed that Apple will use “Type-C Power Delivery” but will keep the Lightning port, Apple Insider reported. In other words, Apple could integrate the underlying USB Type-C power technology into its own Lightning connector. A respected analyst has disputed claims that Apple will ditch the Lightning port in favour of USB Type-C The analyst explained that one advantage of a USB Type-C port was the ability to transfer HD videos at a faster rate, but he said that this was a “niche” application for the tech. Kuo added that Apple was expected to retain the Lightning port across three iPhones this year. Will the three iPhones be comprised of the iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus and an SE model? Well… rumours claim that, in addition to an iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, Apple is readying a high-end iPhone that packs a curved OLED screen. Expect the rumour mill to be working overtime in the next few months, as Apple and its suppliers get ready to ramp up production of the new handsets.

Here’s a list of the five best options ranging in price from around $100 to over $2500. When Apple introduced the iPad back in 2010, it wasn’t the first tablet to hit the market because plenty of Windows Tablet PCs existed. Today, Apple’s tablet stands out from the crowd in terms of sales and mind share. In fact, the term iPad is synonymous for many people with the word tablet regardless of the brand. Not everyone wants an iPad, though, and they’re looking for good alternatives like the five here. Some users want a Windows computer that runs their programs instead of apps. Vertical markets often rely on proprietary software without an iOS or even Android version available. Only a Windows tablet will do. That’s why we’ve rounded up a list of the 5 best iPad alternatives that run Microsoft Windows. These Windows tablets come in various sizes and speeds, but they all run a full version of Windows and can potentially run all or most of your Windows software. We avoided the 2-in-1 convertibles with the keyboard permanently attached except for one favorite. The rest will function without a keyboard attached and some come with specially designed keyboards like the Surface Pro 4 and Samsung’s Galaxy TabPro S. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 – Best of the iPad Alternatives Probably the best Windows tablet available comes from Microsoft. Every model of the Surface Pro 4 includes the great all metal hardware design with a fantastic 12.3-inch display boasting a 2736 x 1824 resolution. The display has excellent multi-touch capability and works with the amazing Microsoft Surface Pen. It might be the best stylus available on a tablet, except for maybe the iPad’s Apple Pencil. The Surface Pro 4 has a full-sized USB 3.0 port, a micro-SD card slot, headset/mic combo jack, and a DisplayPort. The bottom edge also connects to the Surface Type Cover, which comes extra for $129.99 without a fingerprint reader and $159.99 with one. They also now sell a Signature Edition Type Cover with special fabric material, but no fingerprint reader. It’s also $159.99. Enjoy up to 9 hours of battery life, depending on your screen brightness, the programs you running and the processor you have. Speaking of processors, Microsoft configures the tablet with the following combinations and prices: Intel Core m3 processor, 128GB SSD and 4GB of RAM for $699 (sale price, regularly $799). Intel Core i5 Processor, 128GB SSD and 4GB of RAM for $999. Intel Core i5 Processor, 256GB SSD and 4GB of RAM for $1,099 (normally $1,199). Intel Core i7 Processor, 256GB SSD and 8GB of RAM for $1,499. Users can also configure other combinations. We maxed out the specs with 16GB of RAM, Intel Core i7 Processor and 1TB SSD and it costs $2,599. For more coverage on the Surface Pro 4 see the following posts from our team: Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Review 11 Exciting Things You Can Do With a Surface Pro 4 How to Set Up a New Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Samsung Galaxy TabPro S – Gives Surface Competition The Samsung Galaxy TabPro S might seem like a “me-too” device from Samsung copying the hardware of the Surface Pro 4, but that’s a good thing. It copies it in the best areas and even adds some improvements. First, here’s a list of the specs that make this an impressive alternative to the iPad Pro for $799 and $749 at B&H Photo: 2.2GHz  Intel Core M Dual-Core processor 4GB of RAM 128GB SSD 12-inch 2160 x 1440 AMOLED display 1 Type C USB port 1 headphone/mic combo jack 802.11ac and Bluetooth 4.1 Built-in GPS and NFC Up to 10 hours battery life Some specs that stand out in comparison to the Surface Pro 4 include the AMOLED display and a Type-C USB port. Samsung’s AMOLED displays look amazing with bright and rich colors. Type-C future proofs the tablet a little since that’s the direction computing is going. Samsung also added GPS and NFC to the list. That makes it more useful on the road and for quick connections via NFC. It also includes the keyboard at that price which is something Microsoft doesn’t do. The Samsung C Pen that gives the tablet pressure sensitive writing and drawing features like the Surface Pen costs extra ($79.99 retail, but it’s usually available for under $60 at Amazon or B&H Photo). Dell Latitude 11 7000 Series – Best of Midrange iPad Alternatives The Dell Latitude 11 5000 Series tablet starts at about $750. It competes with the Surface Pro 4 since it comes with an optional keyboard that attaches to a port along the bottom edge. The 10.8-inch screen features a 1920 x 1080 display that supports multi-touch and the Dell mini-pen for writing and drawing on the screen. An optional keyboard connects to a special port on the bottom edge giving users a laptop-style experience with their tablet. Starting at $749, buyers can get an Intel Core M3 processor, 4GB of RAM and 128GB SSD. Other optional configurations can include an M5 processor, up to 8GB of memory and a 256GB drive. Maxed out it costs $1,068. The list of ports and buttons includes: 1 USB Type C 3.1 port for data and charging Full-size USB 3.0 port Micro-HDMI Headphone/mic combo port Fingerprint reader Micro-SD card reader Noble lock slot for security Volume up/down rocker Windows button Lenovo IdeaPad Miix 310 – Best of the Low-cost iPad Alternatives This ten-inch system comes in at $300 making it the cheapest tablet in the round-up.  In fact Amazon sells it for even less at $233. It runs on an Intel Atom X5 Z8350 processor, which means it’s also the lowest powered device in our list. The 2GB of RAM and 64GB SSD means this machine is best for browsing the web, running simple programs and reading. You can also stream audio and video. The 10.1-inch display sports a lower resolution of 1280 x 800. You can run that display for up to 10 hours. Add Bluetooth 4.0 and 802.11 b/g/n for connectivity. There’s a keyboard dock to connect the detachable keyboard included with the tablet. Other ports include a micro-HDMI, micro-SD card reader, headphone/mic combo jack, micro-USB 2.0 and 2 full-size USB 2.0 ports on the keyboard. The tablet alone weighs only 1.28 lbs and less than 2.5 with the keyboard attached. That makes it one of the lightest available. NuVision TM800W610L Signature Edition Tablet – Bargain Basement The NuVision Signature Edition Tablet makes our list for two reasons. It’s super cheap at only $150 from Microsoft Store or $100 at Amazon and it’s one of the only 8-inch Windows tablets available today. Buyers can look hard for some models that are no longer manufactured. Dell’s Venue 8 and the Toshiba Encore 2 8-inch model still show up on Amazon and other places, but Dell and Toshiba don’t make them anymore. NuVision designed the Signature Edition Tablet with a basic black plastic case, a 1920 x 1200 resolution, an Intel Atom processor and a meager 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. It comes with an expansion slot that supports up to 128GB in the form of a micro-SD card. The battery lasts up to 6 hours, a little low these days. But that’s probably enough for most people who will use this as a Windows book reader plus social networking, Internet and email. It can handle things like Netflix or streaming audio, too. The tablet has a single micro-USB port, a micro-HDMI port and mic/audio combo port. Add Bluetooth 4.o and 802.11n Miracast enabled Wi-Fi. Miracast lets users cast the screen to supported devices like the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter or a Roku Box or Stick. Which Windows Tablet to Buy? So which of these five tablets should you buy? If you just want the best tablet available without concern for price, go with the Surface Pro 4 and get as much as you can afford. It’s a great device and works well as a laptop with occasionally using it as a tablet. The Samsung Galaxy TabPro S gives the Surface Pro a run for the money, so find one at a Best Buy store or Microsoft Store to see if you like the AMOLED screen better. Also, the USB Type-C port might make it a better option for some, since that’s the future of connectivity. People who want the smallest and cheapest should look at the NuVision. It’s under-powered for most tasks, but not for the very basic tasks of reading books, playing streaming video or music, and doing your day-to-day email tasks. You can even hook it up to an external display to use it for presentations or hook up a keyboard and get some work done. Buy the Lenovo if you want a larger 10-inch screen, but also want a lower price and have basic needs. The 1280 x 800 resolution seems a bit low, but the long battery life that comes as a result will make road warriors with limited needs happy. The included detachable keyboard makes it a great deal. The Dell’s a good mid-range option for people who can’t afford the Surface or Samsung, but want more than the Lenovo or NuVision tablets offer.

In iOS 10.2, Apple has added configurable Ethernet-specific UI to the Settings app. When connecting a compatible Ethernet adapter via something like Apple’s Lightning to USB 3 Camera adapter, an Ethernet preference panel will automatically appear below the Wi-Fi section in the Settings app. The best wireless keyboard for the Mac? As noted by developer Steve Troughton-Smith, the Ethernet preferences are a welcome addition to the Settings app for anyone who regularly uses a hardwired Ethernet connection with their iOS devices. I tested the connectivity on my iPhone 7 Plus running iOS 10.3 beta 4, and it worked just as expected. After connecting my USB Ethernet adapter to my iPhone using the Lightning to USB 3 Camera adapter, the Ethernet preferences automatically appeared shortly thereafter. iOS 10.2+ finally has a UI for USB ethernet adapter settings 🎉 pic.twitter.com/r7mojxgdGE — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) February 28, 2017 Video walkthrough Subscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more videos As you can see from the screenshots below, the configurable Ethernet pane is wedged between the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth preferences panes. Tapping on Ethernet allows you to select the Ethernet interface, and tapping the interface displays connectivity details related to the interface. The Interfaces section seems to suggest that you can even have multiple Ethernet adapters connected to the same iOS device. If you’re running iOS 10.2 or above, you too can see this Ethernet pane after connecting a compatible USB Ethernet adapter. It’s a relatively simple addition, but one that will prove to be quite useful for iOS users who prefer Ethernet connectivity. To get your iOS device online with Ethernet, you should be able to use one of the many Ethernet adapters available, but you may need to combine it with a powered hub to provide it with adequate power. Keep in mind that you’ll also need some way to connect the USB cable to your iOS device, which is where something like the aforementioned Lightning to USB 3 Camera adapter comes into play. One of the benefits of using Apple’s powered dongle is that you may not need to combine the Ethernet adapter with a powered hub. Have you ever used an Ethernet adapter with your iPhone or iPad? Would you ever consider doing so? Jeff Benjamin @JeffBenjam Jeff leads 9to5Mac’s YouTube channel — editing and producing tech videos, walkthroughs, how-tos, written tutorials and reviews.

The original verdict reached by a Texas jury stuck Apple with $533 million in damages. Sony A6500 Smartflash LLC targeted game developers who largely all settled out of court in 2014, but Apple defended its use of data storage management and payment processing technology in court. Reuters has more on the new developments: The trial judge vacated the large damages award a few months after a Texas federal jury imposed it in February 2015, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said on Wednesday the judge should have ruled Smartflash’s patents invalid and set aside the verdict entirely. A unanimous three-judge appeals panel said Smartflash’s patents were too “abstract” and did not go far enough in describing an actual invention to warrant protection. Apple originally lost its case in February 2015 when a Texas jury slammed Apple with $533 million in damages out of the $852 million demanded from Smartflash LLC.

Friday’s complaint concerns three apartment buildings – located at 201 5th Ave. N., 621 5th Ave. S., and 401 Pine Street in Edmonds – that are managed by defendant Debbie A. Appleby, of Stanwood, Wash. The properties are owned by three Limited Liability Corporations controlled by Appleby – Apple One, LLC, Apple Two, LLC, and Apple Three, LLC—which are also named as defendants in the suit. The complaint alleges that in March 2014, defendant Appleby told a woman seeking an apartment for herself, her husband and their 1-year-old child that the apartment buildings were “adult only” and therefore not available to her family. The complaint also alleges that at various other times from April 2014 to November 2015, defendants advertised their available apartments as being restricted to adults only. The family filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which conducted an investigation, issued a charge of discrimination against the defendants, and referred the case to the Department of Justice. “Equal access to housing is essential for all Americans, including families with young children,” said U.S. Attorney Annette L. Hayes. “Particularly in our tight housing market, landlords must follow the law and make units available without discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability or familial status.” “The Fair Housing Act prohibits landlords from denying apartments to families just because they have children,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Tom Wheeler of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “Many families already face challenges finding affordable housing, and they should not also have to deal with unlawful discrimination.” The complaint seeks a court order requiring defendants to cease their discriminatory housing practices, damages for the family that filed the HUD complaint and any other families against whom the defendants discriminated against because they had children, plus civil penalties. Any individuals who have information relevant to this case are encouraged to contact the Civil Rights Division at 1-800-896-7743, Option 96.The case is being jointly handled by trial attorney Kathryn Legomsky for the Civil Rights Division for the U.S. Department of Justice and Assistant United States Attorney J. Michael Diaz for the Western District of Washington. You can read the full Justice Department complaint here.

We couldn’t figure it out because she was one of the first people to view and she and her husband had great jobs. Now she knows. Reply Laura Johnson March 4, 2017 at 2:14 pm Joy- That is disappointing, but Edmonds is not immune and discrimination eventually touches all of us. We need to take a stand against discrimination and profiling- in their many unjust forms. Reply Alec denson March 4, 2017 at 9:30 pm “not immune to discrimination” – pretty euphemistic way of putting it. Edmonds is one of the whitest places in western Washington.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Rumor: All three 2017 iPhone models to feature Lightning port with USB-C fast charging Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Friday, March 3rd, 2017, 05:06 Category: Hardware, iPhone, Lightning, Rumor, USB-C It’s thought that all three upcoming iPhones will both retain the Lightning connectors but add USB-C Power Delivery for faster charging. The rumors currently state that Apple will release an all-new OLED model with a larger L-shaped battery and updated 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Kuo offered the following comment in his most recent note: New 2H17 models may all support fast charging. We believe all three new iPhones launching in 2H17 will support fast charging by the adoption of Type-C Power Delivery technology (while still retaining the Lightning port). A key technical challenge lies with ensuring product safety and stable data transmission during a fast charge. In order to achieve that goal, we think Apple will adopt TI’s power management and Cypress’s Power Delivery chip solutions for the new iPhone models. We note the OLED version may have a faster charging speed thanks to a 2-cell L shaped battery pack design. Kuo has stated that he expects Apple to retain the Lightning port, which features a similar design compared to a USB-C port. Such a move retains the requirements for the MFi Program licensing income from Lightning accessories. Kuo also added that he believes USB-C’s high-speed data transmission is “still a niche application” for iPhone. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro already supports USB 3.0 speeds and fast charging with a Lightning to USB-C cable, while iPhones and other devices with a Lightning connector still transfer at USB 2.0 speeds. The prediction comes only two days after the Wall Street Journal reported that at least one upcoming iPhone model would feature a USB-C port instead of a Lightning connector. Apple’s latest MacBook Pro models are equipped with Thunderbolt 3 ports, which share the same connector design as USB-C, while the 12-inch MacBook also has a USB-C port. Apple could still bundle a Lightning to USB-C cable with its next iPhones to allow for connectivity with those notebooks out of the box. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Apple adds second-generation Apple TV to “vintage” and “obsolete” lists, halts support for the device in most areas of the world Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Friday, March 3rd, 2017, 05:33 Category: Apple TV, Hardware, News As much as you may love your second-generation Apple TV, it’s now on Apple’s “vintage” and “obsolete”products list, thereby rendering it ineligible for repairs in most parts of the world. With the new change, the only places where service and parts may still be available are in Turkey and California, where the device is still classified as “vintage” according to an Apple support document. Vintage devices are defined as being made over 5 but less than 7 years ago, and the category typically excludes products from support except where required by law. For all other places, the second-generation Apple TV has been declared “obsolete”, which generally refers to products discontinued more than seven years ago. The second-generation Apple TV launched in September of 2010 with production ending in 2012, when it was replaced by the third-generation unit. Apple is already largely distancing itself from the third-gen model, providing minimal updates. A fourth-gen model with support for apps and Siri went on sale in Oct. 2015. An upcoming fifth-gen device is expected to add 4K resolution support and likely a faster processor to match, but not much else. As always, stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Launched in 2008, Spotify had 40 million paid subscribers in September and the company tweeted the 50 million figure on Thursday, the same day messaging app company Snap Inc pulled off its massive share sale that bodes well for other technology companies considering a flotation. Apple, which launched its music service less than two years ago, had about 20 million subscribers in December and its entry looks to have done little to slow the rapid growth of its older Swedish-based rival. Spotify, which has yet to show a profit as it spends to grow internationally, is now looking at a possible stock market listing in the United States, online news portal TechCrunch said last month. A company spokeswoman declined to comment on Friday on when it might seek a listing. But a partner at a leading investor in Spotify, venture capital firm Northzone, said late last year the company could start to become profitable as early as 2017 after years of focusing squarely on "growth, growth, growth". Spotify is the most highly valued venture backed start-up in Europe and according to media reports is considering a listing on Nasdaq and potentially a dual listing on the Nasdaq exchange in Stockholm, where the company is headquartered. It was last valued at $8.53 billion, according to venture capital market research firm CB Insights. That valuation alone would make a flotation Europe's biggest technology start-up listing since the market launch of German e-commerce investor Rocket Internet in 2014. While still loss-making, Spotify has posted rapid subscriber growth since it was created a decade ago by Swedish founders Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon. Following its announcement on Thursday that it had reached 50 million paid subscribers, Ek made a point of retweeting a comment from Wall Street media analyst Rick Greenfield which pointed to how Spotify was adding subscribers at an increasingly rapid rate. The Stockholm-based company also announced a major expansion in New York last month. One of Europe's most highly valued venture-backed start-ups, Spotify will move its New York office to the World Trade Center from the Midtown area of Manhattan, adding more than 1,000 new jobs. In 2016 Americans used on-demand streaming platforms, such as Spotify, to listen to 431 billion music tracks, Nielsen said in its U.S. year-end report.
