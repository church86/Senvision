Follow TechnoBuffalo Prior to Apple’s October event, I was eagerly awaiting the next MacBook announcement. I currently use a 2012 13-inch MacBook Pro that’s on its last legs. I’m due for an update and I was hoping Apple would fill that need, but to my disappointment, its new computers don’t quite fit the bill for me. Even so, I tried to find reasons to convince myself to buy one, but it became blatantly obvious that Apple doesn’t offer a laptop that perfectly suits my needs. As a writer, I value portability over raw power, but I still need a computer that can be a bit of a workhorse. This is why I refuse to buy a 12-inch MacBook; the Core M processor just doesn’t offer enough power. And even though I thought I was ready to jump ship into any computer Apple made, I didn’t order one. The new computers have less functionality and worse battery life than their predecessors. The inclusion of USB-C ports is understandable, but why not include more than two or four? Apple’s previous computers weren’t perfect, but they were more well-rounded than the ones offered today. If we’re taking a step into the future, why are we receiving less? Less power, fewer ports and decreased battery life. Let’s change that, Apple. It’s time for a MacBook Air with Retina Display It’s time for a MacBook Air with Retina display. Apple just needs to take the current design and add the sharper display and newer processors. The MacBook Air is a timeless computer, so much so that I am confused why Apple seems to have forgotten about it. It hasn’t been updated in nearly two years. Even when it was updated, back in March 2015, it was a minor upgrade. It looks bleaker by the day that Apple will do a 180 and completely revamp it, but I’m still holding out hope. The important laptop features for me are portability, battery life and power. This computer would offer all three. Putting an Intel Core i5 chip would give me all the power I need. The beautiful new Retina display would be a big step up from the current display on it, and it would also borrow the new Butterfly keyboard 2 along with the Force Touch trackpad. I’ll also take three USB-C ports, an SD Card reader and a headphone jack, please. For internals, I’ll take an integrated GPU combined with the aforementioned seventh-gen Intel Core i5 chip; that is plenty of power to handle the writing and photo editing I do. A Core i3 chip or an Intel Core M chip would be underpowered for what I need, but Apple could offer one of those at the lower-end. The Core i7 (and discrete graphics) would be overkill for what I do, and would be enough of a reason for folks to jump right up to the MacBook Pro. For design, using the MacBook Air tapered slope with the elimination of thicker ports would allow Apple to shave off some unnecessary weight. The current 13-inch Air weighs 2.96 pounds, so I’d like Apple to try to get it down to 2.5 pounds or less. To compensate for the unique design, it would include the terraced battery cell found in the MacBook to achieve the best battery life possible. This computer is plausible, but I highly doubt Apple will create anything that resembles it. I hope I’m wrong, but the recent direction of the Mac division doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence. It used to be that Apple did the little things perfectly, and the totality ended up being a magical experience. Now Apple is skimping on features and selling a watered-down product. It’s time for that to stop. Topics #Apple #Apple #MacBook Danny Zepeda Danny’s interest in writing began with tech, which influenced his career path in college.

Well, you want to buy something that ties into the person’s interests or hobbies. You want something that’s reliable, safe and recommended by a good source. And you want something that fits in your budget.  To match all those criteria, consider the venerable Consumer Reports and its 2016 Holiday Gift Guide, which breaks down products by different categories to make it easier to pick out the right gift. Play Video Your Holiday Financial Guide Popular tech gifts this holiday season If you got a late start on your Christmas shopping, don't worry. CNET senior editor Ashley Esqueda joins CBSN with some ideas for last-minute tec... CR’s Gift Guide suggests presents for people who are into technology, those who like to cook or just eat, and those who like home appliances. You’ll also find categories based on who you’re shopping for and how much you want to spend. You can browse each category to view the top picks, along with brief descriptions, price and where to purchase. Since it doesn’t accept advertising, Consumer Reports has long enjoyed a reputation as an impartial and independent judge of the best products on the market. So following its advice seems like a good way to pick out just the right gift for people who aren’t always easy to shop for. So let’s peruse the gift ideas CR suggests by category to see if it takes some of the challenges out of holiday shopping. Gifts for tech lovers Personal technology is a hot category and one that CR has filled with a variety of gift ideas. Under the category called “The Gift of Tech,” CR has served up recommendations on everything from headphones to to computers. Here are some the many gift ideas: 1) The Phiaton BT 100 NC headphone is available from Amazon for $100. Offering very good sound quality and noise-canceling technology, this headphone sits in place securely through a collar that fits around your neck. 2) The Sonos Play:5 (2015) wireless home speaker is sold by Amazon for $465. The speaker delivers very good sound, is simple to set up and can provide audio for a medium to large room. 3) The Apple TV (32 GB) (4th Gen) streaming media player is available from Amazon for $150. The latest version of Apple’s set-top box comes just in the nick of time for the holidays. It offers a speedier processor, a touchpad remote control and support for the Siri voice assistant. 4) The Amazon Echo wireless speaker is sold by Amazon for $180. Using a voice assistant known as Alexa, the Echo is a speaker system that resides in your home to provide news and weather, play music, order products online and control smart home appliances. Alexa can respond to your questions and commands, perform specific tasks and connect to Amazon’s cloud-based services. 5) The Lenovo Ideacentre 700 all-in-one 24-inch computer sells for $900. This one is a “lightning-fast desktop computer,” according to CR, with the power to help you edit videos and provide ample storage with its 1 terabyte hard drive. 6) The Epson Expression Premium XP-830 inkjet printer, scanner, and copier will cost you $104 at Amazon. This device offers a touchscreen display along with a feeder for copying and scanning documents. You can also send paperless faxes via your computer. 7) The Samsung Galaxy S7 smartphone goes for $650 at its full retail price. Outfitted with a 5.1-inch screen, Samsung’s latest flagship phone offers a 12.2-megapixel rear camera, healthy battery life and a water-resistant glass body. The base model comes with only 32GB of on-board storage, but you can up that to more than 128GB with the right microSD card. 8) The Apple Watch Series 2 (38mm) Aluminum case smartwatch runs $470. Apple has updated its smartwatch series with new features, most notably ones geared toward fitness buffs. The watch is now water-resistant up to 164 feet, includes built-in GPS to track your jogs and lets you share your workout details with other people. 9) The Microsoft Surface Book laptop starts at $1,499 at Walmart. Equipped with a detachable screen that transforms it into a tablet, the base model of Microsoft’s Surface Book offers a 13.5-inch touchscreen display, an Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of onboard storage. Those specs provide a hefty amount of power, but you can upgrade the processor, memory, and storage to truly beef up the machine. The Surface Book is ideal for photo and video editing, said CR, while the included Surface Pen helps you draw and take notes easily and precisely. 10) The Apple MacBook 12-inch MF855LL/A computer goes for $1,200 at its base configuration. Outfitted with a 12-inch Retina display, this model features a speedy Intel Core M 1.1GHz processor, 8GB of memory, a 256GB solid state drive and Intel HD Graphics 5300 graphics. A weight of only 2 pounds and 16 hours on a single battery charge are icing on the cake. The one item missing is an optical drive, so you’d have to buy an external drive if you need to use a CD or DVD. Appliance gifts Home appliances may not always be sexy, but they can certainly come in handy to help your gift recipient better take care of the home, more easily tackle housework, and cook up tasty meals more quickly. Here you’ll find everything from robot vacuums to microwaves to cookware to coffee makers. Some of the gift ideas include: 1) Samsung POWERbot SR20H9051 Series vacuum cleaner sells for $1,000. This robotic vacuum earned a top score from CR because of its ability to effectively clean both carpets and bare floors. The Samsung product’s edge brushes serve nicely to clean along walls, while the unit’s squared-off front helps it clean corners better than most of the competition. 2) The Roomba 880 vacuum cleaner is a less pricey robot vacuum than Samsung’s model, selling for just $500. The Roomba 880 was CR’s top pick before Samsung’s vacuum debuted and is still highly rated for its ability to clean both carpets and bare floors. And since it’s only 4 inches tall, this Roomba excels at cleaning under sofas and other low-ceiling objects. 3) The Samsung MC11H6033CT microwave oven goes for $300. Equipped with a convection mode, Samsung’s microwave can brown and crisp food better than rival units. The unit earned good grades for its ability to heat and defrost food evenly. You can even use it to bake a cake. 4) The Swiss Diamond Reinforced 10 piece #6010 kitchen cookware sells for $500 to $600. For that price, you get 8-inch and 9-inch frypans, 1.4-quart and 2.2-quart saucepans, a 3.2-quart saute pan, an 8.5-quart stockpot, and glass lids. The cookware is made of cast aluminum and offers nonstick coating. 5) The Bialetti Moka Express Stovetop Espresso Maker starts at $22 at Amazon. Available in five different sizes and various colors, the Bialetti Espresso Maker impressed Consumer Reports as it’s found in the homes of almost 90 percent of Italian households. The design ensures that heat is distributed evenly and that the two halves are easy to connect. Gifts for teens and ’tweens Looking for a present for your son, daughter, nephew, niece or someone else in the younger crowd? CR serves up some suggestions here, such as the Apple MacBook 12-inch MF855LL/A computer,  the Apple Watch Series 2 (38mm) Aluminum case smartwatch, and the The Lenovo Ideacentre 700 all-in-one 24-inch computer. Other ideas included the $99 1MORE E1001 Triple Driver headphone that offers “excellent sound quality” and comes with nine different earpieces in various sizes, the $350 Braven BRV-XXL wireless Bluetooth speaker that’s rugged enough to take with you on outdoor excursions, and the $200 Fujifilm FinePix XP90 digital camera equipped with a 6-megapixel lens, a 2.9-inch LCD, and 5x optical zoom. Gifts for moms and dads Find it harder to pick the right gift for your parents each year? CR’s suggestions may just help narrow down the choices. For mom, the magazine recommends Apple’s iPhone 7 starting at $650, the Fitbit Surge fitness tracker running for $250, and an iCoffee RCB100-BC12 coffee maker for $105. For pops, you may want to consider such items as a Garmin Vivosmart HR fitness tracker for $119, an LG OLED55E6P 55-inch 3D-capable OLED Ultra HD TV for $3,165, or a $600 Nikon Coolpix P900 digital camera. Gifts for grandmas and grandpas Looking for the right present for your grandparents? Some ideas from Consumer Reports include the Amazon Kindle Oasis WiFi e-book reader for $289, the $92 Clarity BT914 cordless phone with built-in answering machine, and the $40 Hunter QLS-03 portable humidifier. Gifts that best fit your budget Sometimes you’re seeking the right present for a family member, relative, friend, co-worker, or even just a casual acquaintance and don’t want to spend too much. CR’s gift ideas include items under a certain price if you’re working with a specific budget. Don’t want to spend more than $200. Consider such items as the $150 Apple TV (32 GB) (4th Gen) streaming media player, the $180 Asus ZenPad S 8.0 Z580C-B1 (32GB) tablet, and the $120 Brother MFC-J680DW all-in-one inkjet printer. For less than $100, you can snag a $60 Bell Draft Mips bike helmet for bicyclists, a Krups 2-Slice KH732D50 toaster for as little as $40, and a Ninja Personal Blender for $75. Need to go even cheaper? CR’s gift ideas under $50 include a Cuisinart CastLite Non-Stick 10-inch CIL22-26R kitchen cookware for $35, a Cuisinart Power Advantage HM-50 mixer for as little as $33, and a Scosche SportClip 3 headphone for as low as $28. And finally, if you don’t want to shell out more than $25 on a gift, check out the $22 Bialetti Moka Express Stovetop Espresso Maker, a bag of Blue Bottle Three Africans coffee beans for $15, and the Proctor-Silex Cool-Touch 22203 toaster for a little as $16. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..

The latest comes from Consumer Reports, which refrained from recommending Apple’s newest laptop for the first time ever — and Apple is working with the organization to figure out what went wrong. More: Apple’s first 2016 MacBook Pro design failed tests, leading to poorer battery Consumer Reports was generally positive about the 2016 MacBook Pro’s display quality and performance. The machines fell down in battery performance, however, an area that has been a complaint of numerous buyers (apparently the result of the choice of a lesser design). According to Consumer Reports’ testing, the most significant issue with battery life wasn’t specifically how long the computers would run before shutting down but rather their inconsistent battery life. The 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, for example, ran for 16 hours, 12.75 hours, and 3.75 hours on subsequent tests. The 13-inch version without Touch Bar ran for 19.5 hours and 4.5 hours in different trial runs, and the 15-inch machine showed a range from 8 to 18.5 hours. More: MacBook Pro 13-inch with Touch Bar review The organization notes that laptops usually vary by less than five percent between tests; Consumer Reports said it was able to replicate the MacBook Pro’s inconsistent results via repeated testing. The reviewers requested a response from Apple and at first received a typical canned statement: “Any customer who has a question about their Mac or its operation should contact AppleCare.” Apple Vice President of Marketing Phil Schiller responded via Twitter Friday evening that Apple is taking things a little more seriously than that, however: Working with CR to understand their battery tests. Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data. https://t.co/IWtfsmBwpO — Philip Schiller (@pschiller) December 24, 2016 Consumer Reports cannot be faulted for its testing methodologies, which seem rigorous. The group upgraded its test machines to MacOS Sierra 10.12.2 and tested again to determine if Apple had resolved any battery issues in the latest update. The results were the same. Apparently, similar concerns about the 2016 MacBook Air’s battery life are not without merit. While lower battery life could be expected given their smaller battery capacity versus previous MacBook Air models, the incredibly inconsistent results suggest a problem — one Apple is hopefully working to resolve. Updated on 12-24-2016 by Mark Coppock: Added Phil Schiller’s response. What’s the best MacBook for your money?

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Apple to work with Consumer Reports to figure out MacBook Pro battery issues Yoni Heisler BGR NewsDecember 24, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share On one of the busiest shopping days of the year, Consumer Reports dropped a bombshell of a report where, for the first time in history, it was unable to give Apple’s MacBook Pro a ‘buy’ recommendation. The root of the problem is that Consumer Reports found battery life on Apple’s new notebook to be wildly inconsistent. Don't Miss: The best TV shows on Netflix you’ve never heard of While testing all three of Apple’s next-gen MacBook Pro models, Consumer Reports saw battery life fluctuate between 19.5 hours on the high-end and 4.5 hours on the low-end. All the more curious is that CR’s testing involved loading up a continuous stream of web pages in a browser, hardly a test designed to put a machine through the ringer. In the wake of the above report, some have been quick to call CR’s methodology into question. Indeed, the erratic results CR encountered prompted many people to wonder why the publication didn’t take a closer look at their own testing methods. To this point, Rene Ritchie of iMore writes: Those results make very little sense and I’d take apart my chain, link by link, until I found out what was going on. I’d check and re-check my tests, I’d watch the systems like a hawk, and I’d do everything possible to find what was causing the variance. I’d even — gasp — try testing different machines and something other than web pages to see if that revealed more information. Inconsistent results from battery life tests, for responsible publications, aren’t a reason to rush out a headline in time for the holidays. They’re a reason to start questioning everything, and to diligently retrace every step along the way, until you can get repeatable, reputable results. This is a valid point, though we should also point out that user complaints about MacBook Pro battery life began to surface well before Consumer Reports’ review came out. Regardless, Apple at the very least isn’t keeping its head in the sand. In a tweet sent out late on Friday, Apple executive Phil Schiller said that the company is working with Consumer Reports in order to figure out what exactly is the root of the problem. Working with CR to understand their battery tests. Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data. https://t.co/IWtfsmBwpO — Philip Schiller (@pschiller) December 24, 2016 That said, hopefully Apple will be able to figure out what’s going on sooner rather than later. Even if we dismiss Consumer Reports’ findings out of hand, the fact remains that many MacBook Pro users have found battery life on Apple’s new flagship notebook to be oddly inconsistent.

Pokemon Go for Apple Watch is finally here The Financial Express 23-12-2016 IANS The wait of hatching eggs on the wrist is now over as Pokemon Go is finally available on Apple Watch. The announcement of the Apple Watch version of the game by the end of the year was made in September by US-based software company and developer of the gaming app Niantic. On Wednesday, the developers, in an official blog post, announced that the game is finally available. With Apple Watch and Pokemon GO integration, users can log each play session as a workout, with gameplay counting toward personal activity rings and receive notifications about nearby Pokemon. Users can count distance toward hatching Pokemon Eggs and receiving Candy with their Buddy Pokemon. Once they encounter a Pokemon, they can catch it from their iPhone. "You can receive notifications about PokeStops nearby and collect items from them and receive notifications when Eggs hatch and medals are awarded," the developers said. Recently, an email circulated through Reddit, supposedly sent by a Niantic customer service agent, claimed that the "port for the Apple Watch has been shelved" and that development had been stopped unless the demand increased. But the developers had denied the reports saying, "Development on Pokemon Go continues, as it has since before the Apple announcement. We will have more news on the product soon."

We walk you through the best way to set it up. The new Apple MacBook Pro comes with a speedy Intel Core i5 or i7 processor, brilliant Retina display, a Touch Bar (if you're lucky), and enough juice to last a coast-to-coast flight with power to spare. Now that you've brought it home, what do you need to do to get it up and running? Here's a quick primer. 1. Plug it in Even though the system comes with a bit of juice in the battery from its post-assembly testing, you'll still need to plug the system in "just in case." There's no way of knowing how long the system has been sitting around since it left the factory thousands of miles away, and it would be unfortunate if it lost power during the setup process, because you'd likely have to start over. Plug the USB-C charger in, and you're ready to move on to the next step. 2. Press the power button The power button is the top-most right key above the delete key. If you've upgraded from an older pre-2012 MacBook or MacBook Pro, you'll notice this is where the DVD eject button used to reside. 3. Choose your country The MacBook Pro will ask you what country you're in. This will guide which language you're using, as well as determining the format for things like dates, time, and the language in in macOS. Choose correctly for your habits, since most people are picky about things like day-month-year sequence and whether to use 24-hour time or AM/PM. You can change or correct this setting later in the Language & Text control panel. 4. Choose your keyboard Right off the bat, it should suggest the US QWERTY keyboard as standard. Choose Show All if you need to plug in a foreign keyboard or if you're setting up a MacBook Pro that you've bought overseas. 5. Connect to Wi-Fi The system will ask you to connect to a Wi-Fi network. Choose your router from the list of SSIDs presented, or click on the "use another network" button if you're using an Ethernet adapter or don't wish to connect to a network at this time. The MacBook Pro has an 802.11ac Wi-Fi adapter in it, so it should connect to any Wi-Fi router. (For more, check out How to Set Up and Optimize Your Wireless Router.) 6. Migrate your stuff The MacBook Pro will give you the option to migrate your accounts, password, apps, documents, and environment from another Mac. If you have a Thunderbolt cable and adapter, you can connect your old Mac at this time. If you're using a Time Machine backup from an older Mac, you can connect the drive now. Once you connect the drive and click next, you can choose a backup or account to move over to your new MacBook Pro. 7. Set up iCloud The MacBook Pro will ask you to log in to your iCloud account by entering your Apple ID and password. This is equivalent to your .Mac or Me.com account if you're a veteran Apple user. If this is your first Mac, it would behoove you to create an iCloud account now. This way you can take advantage of iCloud's free features, like email, find my Mac, and Keychain password sync with iOS devices. If you have a separate Apple ID for your iTunes account, you can enter this info here too. Otherwise, your Apple ID will work for both iTunes and iCloud. We recommend that you enable Location Services and use "Find My Mac," as it will help you recover a lost MacBook Pro if you leave it in a coffee shop or even if it is stolen. 8. Agree to terms and conditions You'll have to agree to the terms and conditions next; they're pretty standard legalese that almost no one reads. 9. Choose a username and password You can just let macOS make up one based on your full name, but you can change that on this screen. You're also required to select a password at this time. If you want to disable your password later (though you shouldn't), you can do that in the Security or the Users & Groups control panel. 10. Select or opt out of Diagnostics & Usage It is an egalitarian idea, but allowing bug reports will help developers fix and update problems with macOS programs and the operating system itself. Uncheck these boxes if you'd rather keep a larger semblance of privacy. 11. Enable Siri Siri is the automated assistant introduced with iOS. Since this is a brand-new MacBook Pro, you should have more than enough power to run Siri with very little slowdown to your multitasking. 12. Set up Touch ID Another crossover from the iPhone is Touch ID, which lets you log in without typing your password. You'll still need to remember it for the first time logging on after a reboot, but it can shave precious seconds when you wake the system from sleep mode. 13. Enter your fingerprint to enable Touch ID Start with the index finger on your dominant hand. You can always add others later. Just like on the iPhone, you'll need to tap and lift your finger several times to register all the arches, loops, and whorls. 14. That's it! The next screen you see should be of the Mac filing all of this info away, and then you should see the majestic peaks of the Sierra desktop.

Many of us like to give new products a chance, but the majority of consumers tend to stick to brands already well known. Apple TV was a streaming media player before the term was commonly used, and the 1st generation model produced from 2007 to 2010 actually came with a 40GB or 160GB hard drive to store content. Later models focused only on streaming though, and so moved the trend in media boxes to require an internet connection to temporarily cache video and audio streams rather than storing permanently. Personally, I like to avoid using the term set-top boxes to describe these smaller boxes. In a traditional meaning, a set-top box has a connection to a television service or over-the-air signal. A streaming media player, on the other hand, doesn’t require you have TV service. And although your channel choices expand with a pay TV subscription, you only need internet service to watch a lot of the content on a streaming media player. But those are just the boxes. We’d be missing something if we didn’t mention streaming sticks in this article. There are only two models in the US market that’ll we’ll consider: the Roku Streaming Stick and Google’s Chromecast. The lightweight, dongle-sized devices are extremely practical to install — just plug them into your HDMI input for video/audio and USB port for power and you’ve got no long cables to deal with. Most of these streaming media players are moderately priced below $100, and all give you the most popular streaming video and audio services such as Netflix, Hulu Plus and Pandora. Without further introduction, here are ten streaming media players to consider. 1. Amazon Fire TV Just released in April, Amazon’s Fire TV is ahead of all competitors in terms of processing power, memory, storage, and the ability to expand gaming with the Amazon Fire Game Controller. Fire TV houses a Qualcomm Krait 300 quad-core processor running at 1.7 GHz and a Qualcomm Adreno 320 GPU for graphics processing. The device comes with 2GB RAM and 8GB Flash storage. Second screen capabilities are available to Kindle Fire owners, and a remote control includes a microphone for voice search. The device supports 1080p video and Certified Dolby Digital Plus with 7.1 channel audio. Where the Fire TV falls short upon release are content channels, which aren’t as many as Roku and Apple TV offer, most notably the lack of HBO Go. The Fire TV costs $99, and $39 more for the game controller. 2. Roku 3 Roku has several current models including the Roku 1 and Roku 2, but their flagship Roku 3 is what we’ll focus on here. The Roku 3 is best comparable to Apple TV with regard to storage and memory. But Roku has many more channels to choose from, boasting over 1,000 different choices. The remote control for the Roku 3 has integrated motion technology for gaming (unlike the lower-tier models), and features a headphone jack for late night viewing when you don’t want to disturb anyone. The Roku 3 supports up to 1080p video and Dolby Digital 5.1 and 7.1 surround sound pass through HDMI. $99 bucks get you a Roku 3 with remote control. 3. Apple TV You might call Apple TV a great uncle to other streaming media players out there. But the device is hardly irrelevant among its newer competitors. In fact, Apple recently announced the company has sold 20 million Apple TV boxes through this year’s second quarter. Although Apple seems a bit more selective of the channels it allows on Apple TV (as opposed to Roku), there are plenty of big time networks including HBO Go, Disney Channel, Watch ABC, and A&E. (Take note Apple, that we’re anxiously awaiting Showtime Anytime.) Apple TV has a single-core A5 chip processor, 512MB RAM memory, and 8GB storage. Maximum video resolution supported is 1920 x 1080p (H.264) with Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound for audio. And, the streaming media box comes with a nicely designed remote control. Like the Fire TV and Roku 3, the Apple TV will cost you $99. 4. Chromecast Google’s Chromecast is a simple-to-use dongle that plugs into your TV’s HDMI port for video/audio and USB or wall outlet for power. The device requires you use a mobile device (both Android and iOS supported) or Chrome on a Mac or PC as the remote control. Supported apps include Netflix, HBO Go, Hulu Plus, and MLB.TV Premium among the 17 channels listed on the product’s web page. Although, a recent announcement with PlayOn will provide Chromecast users with over 100 more channels from the premium service that costs $29.99 per year. The device supports up to 1080p video and digital audio surround sound pass through. Chromecast is the cheapest streaming device among the bunch, selling for a meager $35. 5. Roku Streaming Stick The Roku Streaming Stick (model #3500) is a direct competitor to Chromecast that hit the market about 6 months after Google’s product (although Roku released earlier 3400 and 3420 MHL models in 2012). Easy to install and discreet, the Roku 3500 is an HDMI dongle that draws power from either a USB connection or wall adapter. The stick gives you all the channels Roku has available, supports 1080p video, lets you cast videos from Netflix and YouTube apps to your TV via mobile phone and tablet, and use your Android or iOS mobile device as a remote control with supporting apps. The Roku Streaming Stick also comes with a standard remote with RF technology (so you don’t have to point directly at the device). Priced a bit higher than Chromecast at $49.99, the Streaming Stick will give you hundreds more channels than Chromecast and comes with the remote control.

Reply Jeff on Would liked to have at least a passing mention of any ability to play local media files Reply Prabhakar Vangala on Try NVidia Shield. It does it all including playing local media (attached directly or on the local network). You will have to use an app like Kodi to best utilize the Shield’s capabilities for playing local media. I think it’s the next best thing to a dedicated HTPC. Reply Randy Bobandy on How are there no options for streaming media players that have 3.5mm or rca audio out ports and an ethernet connection? Anyone with a simple 2.1 speaker system without an optical port is simply screwed. Reply Christen Costa on Hey Randy, the solution is to run the audio to your TV and then out of your TV into your stereo. The thought here is that anyone using one of these players will have to have a compatible television. Reply FORREST OLNEY on NVIDIA SHIELD HAS IT ALL AND MUCH MORE. Reply Prabhakar Vangala on I agree. It’s easily the best of all that I have used – Roku 3, WD TV Live, Amazon Firestick, XBox One, PS3 etc. Some apps that buffer on other media players run smoothly on the Shield. It also streams local network media flawlessly via Kodi. Shield really shines where many other media players have difficulty accessing (or playing smoothly) the huge collection of local media on my network. Reply gavincredible on Thanks for the article.

The game involves catching digital pocket monsters in an augmented-reality version of your surroundings. The Apple Watch version will let you discover nearby Pokemon and collect special items, such as potions, from nearby “PokeStops.” But once you encounter a Pokemon, you will need to use your iPhone to catch it. Still, the Apple Watch should make it easier for players to log their steps (needed to advance in the game and to hatch new Pokemon out of eggs), and to avoid walking around with their phones held out to search for nearby monsters. “Pokemon Go” was a huge success when it came out in July. It’s not clear how the Apple Watch version will do, especially now that it’s too cold in much of the Northern Hemisphere to be outside catching Pokemon. Plans for the watch version had been announced at Apple’s iPhone launch event in September. The game’s maker, Niantic, hasn’t announced any plans for Android Wear and Samsung Gear smartwatches.

If the government ends up approving the $85 billion AT&T-Time Warner merger, credit won't necessarily belong to the executives, bankers, lawyers, and lobbyists pushing for the deal. More likely, it will be due to the professors. A serial acquirer, AT&T must persuade the government to allow every major deal. Again and again, the company has relied on economists from America's top universities to make its case before the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission. Moonlighting for a consulting firm named Compass Lexecon, they represented AT&T when it bought Centennial, DirecTV, and Leap Wireless; and when it tried unsuccessfully to absorb T-Mobile. And now AT&T and Time Warner have hired three top Compass Lexecon economists to counter criticism that the giant deal would harm consumers and concentrate too much media power in one company. Today, "in front of the government, in many cases the most important advocate is the economist and lawyers come second," said James Denvir, an antitrust lawyer at Boies, Schiller. American industry is more highly concentrated than at any time since the gilded age. Economists who specialize in antitrust—affiliated with Chicago, Harvard, Princeton, the University of California, Berkeley, and other prestigious universities—reshaped their field through scholarly work showing that mergers create efficiencies of scale that benefit consumers. But they reap their most lucrative paydays by lending their academic authority to mergers their corporate clients propose. Corporate lawyers hire them from Compass Lexecon and half a dozen other firms to sway the government by documenting that a merger won't be "anti-competitive": in other words, that it won't raise retail prices, stifle innovation, or restrict product offerings. Their optimistic forecasts, though, often turn out to be wrong, and the mergers they champion may be hurting the economy. Some of the professors earn more than top partners at major law firms. Dennis Carlton, a self-effacing economist at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business and one of Compass Lexecon's experts on the AT&T-Time Warner merger, charges at least $1,350 an hour. In his career, he has made about $100 million, including equity stakes and non-compete payments, ProPublica estimates. Carlton has written reports or testified in favor of dozens of mergers, including those between AT&T-SBC Communications and Comcast-Time Warner, and three airline deals: United-Continental, Southwest-Airtran, and American-US Airways. American industry is more highly concentrated than at any time since the gilded age. Need a pharmacy? Americans have two main choices. A plane ticket? Four major airlines. They have four choices to buy cell phone service. Soon one company will sell more than a quarter of the quaffs of beer around the world. Mergers peaked last year at $2 trillion in the US The top 50 companies in a majority of American industries gained share between 1997 and 2012, and "competition may be decreasing in many economic sectors," President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers warned in April. While the impact of this wave of mergers is much debated, prominent economists such as Lawrence Summers and Joseph Stiglitz suggest that it is one important reason why, even as corporate profits hit records, economic growth is slow, wages are stagnant, business formation is halting, and productivity is lagging. "Only the monopoly-power story can convincingly account" for high business profits and low corporate investment, Summers wrote earlier this year. In addition, politicians such as US Senator Elizabeth Warren have criticized big mergers for giving a handful of companies too much clout. President-elect Trump said in October that his administration would not approve the AT&T-Time Warner merger "because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few." During the campaign, Trump didn't signal what his broader approach to mergers would be. But the early signs are that his administration will weaken antitrust enforcement and strengthen the hand of economists. He selected Joshua Wright, an economist and professor at George Mason's Antonin Scalia Law School, to lead his transition on antitrust matters. Wright, himself a former consultant for Boston-based Charles River Associates, regularly celebrates mergers in speeches and articles and has supported increasing the influence of economists in assessing monopoly power. "Mergers between competitors do not often lead to market power but do often generate significant benefits for consumers," he wrote in The New York Times this week. A late Obama administration push to scrutinize major deals notwithstanding, the government over the past several decades has pulled back on merger enforcement. In part, this shift reflects the influence of Carlton and other economists. Today, lawyers still write the briefs, make the arguments and conduct the trials, but the core arguments are over economists' models of what will happen if the merger goes ahead. "There are few government functions outside the CIA that are so secretive as the merger review process," said a former general counsel of the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee. These complex mathematical formulations carry weight with the government because they purport to be objective. But a ProPublica examination of several marquee deals found that economists sometimes salt away inconvenient data in footnotes and suppress negative findings, stretching the standards of intellectual honesty to promote their clients' interests. Earlier this year, a top Justice Department official criticized Compass Lexecon for using "junk science." ProPublica sent a detailed series of questions to Compass Lexecon for this story. The firm declined to comment on the record. Even some academic specialists worry that the research companies buy is slanted. "This is not the scientific method," said Orley Ashenfelter, a Princeton economist known for analyzing the effects of mergers. Referring to one Compass study of an appliance industry deal, he said, "The answer is known in advance, either because you created what the client wanted or the client selected you as the most favorable from whatever group was considered." In contrast to their scholarship, the economists' paid work for corporations rests almost entirely out of the public eye. Even other academics cannot see what they produce on behalf of clients. Their algorithms are shared only with government economists, many of whom have backgrounds in academia and private consulting, and hope to return there. At least seven professors on Compass's payroll, including Carlton, have served as the top antitrust economist at the Department of Justice. Charles River Associates boasts at least three. "There are few government functions outside the CIA that are so secretive as the merger review process," said Seth Bloom, the former general counsel of the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee. One evening in 1977, University of Chicago law professor Richard Posner hosted a colleague from the economics department and a young law student named Andrew Rosenfield at his apartment in Hyde Park. The leading scholar of the "Law and Economics" movement, Posner wanted to apply rigorous math and economics concepts to the real world. "Why not see if there are some consulting opportunities?" he mused. The three of them agreed to form a firm, throwing in $700 for a third each. They called it "Lexecon," combining the Latin for law with "econ." The trio then shopped their services to a dozen law firms, which all turned them down. "If you had to value the firm at the end of the tour, you'd have to say it was zero," said Rosenfield. They went back to their academic work. Not too long after, AT&T called Posner to ask if he could consult on its antitrust defense. The government was trying to break up Ma Bell. Posner agreed. So began a long and mutually beneficial relationship between AT&T and Lexecon. Soon after its founding, Lexecon hired one of Chicago's most promising young economists: Dennis Carlton. He had grown up in Brighton, Mass., earning degrees from a trifecta of elite local institutions: Boston Latin High School, Harvard, and MIT, where he would later endow a chair. He played basketball in his spare time. "Backaches have temporarily sidelined me from embarking on my second career as a basketball player in the NBA," he joked in a 40th reunion report to his Harvard classmates in 2012. (After a short interview with ProPublica, Carlton subsequently declined comment, citing client confidentiality.) Ronald Reagan appointed Posner to the federal bench in 1981. Posner left Lexecon. "Andy and I were young," Carlton said. "Gee, we wondered: Is the firm going to survive? Not only did it survive, but it did very well." Lexecon capitalized on the Eighties merger explosion. M&A was rising to cultural prominence as the domain of swashbucklers. Corporate raiders enlisted renegade lawyers and brash investment bankers to take on stalwart names of American industry. Behind the scenes, the less-flamboyant economists gained influence. From the time antitrust laws began to be passed, in the late 19th century, until the 1970s, courts and the government had presumed a merger was bad for customers if it resulted in high concentration, measured at thresholds much lower than the market shares for the dominant companies in many sectors today. The government passes most mergers without question. On rare occasions, it requests more data from the merging parties. Led by University of Chicago theorists, a new group of scholars argued that this approach was overly simplistic. Even if a company dominated its industry, it might lower prices or create offsetting efficiencies, allowing customers more choice or higher quality products. In 1982, William Baxter, Reagan's first head of the Justice Department antitrust division, codified the requirement that the government use economic models and principles to forecast the effect of mergers. Lexecon seized the opportunity. "We were not just going to talk about economic theory but show with data that what we were saying could be justified," Carlton said. By the late 1980s, the top four Lexecon officers were each making $1.5 million a year, according to a Wall Street Journal article. Any merger over a certain dollar size—currently, $78 million—requires government approval. The government passes most mergers without question. On rare occasions, it requests more data from the merging parties. Then the companies often hire consulting firms to produce economic analyses supporting the deal. (Sometimes the government hires its own outside academic.) Even less frequently, the government concludes it can't approve the merger as proposed. In such cases, the government typically settles with the two companies, requiring some concession, such as sale of a division or product line. Just a handful of times a year, the government will sue to block a merger. Recently, the Obama administration has filed several major suits to block mergers, as companies in already concentrated industries propose bigger and bigger deals. According to a tally from the law firm Dechert, the government challenged a record seven mergers last year out of a total of 10,250. Recent research supports the classic view that large mergers, by reducing competition, hurt consumers. The 2008 merger between Miller and Coors spurred "an abrupt increase" in beer prices, an academic analysis found this year. In the most comprehensive review of the academic literature, Northeastern economist John Kwoka studied the effects of thousands of mergers. Prices on average increased by more than 4 percent. Prices rose on more than 60 percent of the products and those increases averaged almost 9 percent. "Enforcers clear too many harmful mergers," American University's Jonathan Baker, a Compass economist who has consulted for both corporations and the government, wrote in 2015. Once a merger is approved, nobody studies whether the consultants' predictions were on the mark. The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission do not make available the reports that justify mergers, and those documents cannot be obtained through public records requests. Sometimes the companies file the expert reports with the courts, but judges usually agree to companies' requests to seal the documents. After a merger is cleared, the government no longer has access to the companies' proprietary data on their pricing. The expert reports "are not public so only the government can check," said Ashenfelter, the Princeton economist who has consulted for both government and private industry. "And the government no longer has the data so they can't check." How accurate are the experts? "The answer is no one knows and no one wants to find out." Compass Lexecon itself is the product of serial M&A. A Michael Milken-backed company bought Lexecon for $60 million in 1999. Then it sold Lexecon to FTI Consulting, an umbrella group of professional consulting service firms, in 2003 for $130 million. In the deal, Carlton received $15 million through 2008 in non-compete payments, according to a Chicago Crain's Business story. He also has held an equity stake in the firm. In 2006, FTI bought Competition Policy Associates, another consulting firm that had also built itself through combination, merging it with Lexecon to form Compass Lexecon. FTI Consulting had $1.8 billion in revenue in 2015, of which $447 million came from economic consulting. The economic consulting division has 600 "revenue-producing" professionals who bill at an average hourly rate of $512 an hour, the highest of all the company's segments. Charles River Associates brought in about $300 million in revenue last year, led by antitrust consulting. So few top consulting firms and leading experts dominate the sector today that economists wonder mordantly whether excess concentration plagues their own industry. In 2013, the government granted a waiver to Joshua Wright, the law professor and economist who was a consultant for Charles River. The waiver permitted him to serve as an FTC commissioner and review deals his former consulting firm advised on, as long as he didn't deliberate on matters that he had directly worked on. Otherwise, the commission's business might have ground to a halt because Charles River was involved in a third of all merger cases that came before the agency. Wright declined to comment. Jonathan Orszag, senior managing director of Compass Lexecon, came up with a solution to allow Compass experts to work on more mergers. He is a well-known figure in Washington circles, and the brother of Peter Orszag, the vice chairman of investment bank Lazard and former high level Obama administration official. Jonathan's social media teems with his globetrotting adventures. Brides magazine featured his destination wedding in the Bahamas. In August 2015, he celebrated on Twitter that he had played on all of the top 100 golf courses in the world. Although he does not have a Ph.D. in economics, he serves as an expert himself and is respected particularly for his expertise on global deals. He declined to comment on the record to ProPublica. At Orszag's urging, the firm relaxed its conflict of interest rules, according to multiple people who have worked with or for Compass. Now, Compass Lexecon experts can, and do, advise both sides in disputes. (Under Compass policy, the parties need to consent to such arrangements.) Separate teams of staffers, who cannot communicate with the opposing side, run the cases. The arrangements require on occasion that experts with adjacent offices must stop talking to each other during cases. Compass economists can reach very different answers to the same question, depending on who is paying them. In 2012, the federal government and a group of states sued Apple for conspiring with several major publishers to fix prices on e-books. The states hired American University's Jonathan Baker, the Compass economist, as one of its experts. Baker's report concluded that e-book prices cost 19 percent more than they should, as a result of the price-fixing. Another government expert arrived at the same 19 percent estimate, and calculated that consumers had been overcharged by $300 million. Apple later hired Orszag, also of Compass, to do the same calculation. Orszag first came to the conclusion that the effect on prices was lower than the government side's estimate, around 15 percent. Then he argued there were offsetting benefits to consumers that knocked the number all the way down to 1.9 percent, or just $28 million. "The actual harms suffered by consumers … are modest," Orszag concluded. A federal judge slapped Orszag down for that work. Denise Cote, of the Southern District of New York, threw out part of Orszag's report in the Apple case. The judge assailed Orszag's study as "unmoored" from facts and "unsupported by any rigorous analysis," criticizing a calculation of his as "jerry-rigged." Lawyers for the states found out Orszag was working for Apple only when he filed his expert report in the case. The news shocked them, two of the lawyers said, because they felt Orszag had been privy to their legal strategy. Orszag had personally negotiated and signed the contract when the states retained Compass and Baker to do the expert work attacking Apple, now Orszag's client. The contract prohibited Compass from working on both sides of the case without permission, which had not been obtained. The states, which had paid Compass and Baker $1.2 million for their work, later sued Compass for breach of contract. They found out that two of its staffers, an administrative assistant and an entry level researcher, had worked for both of the opposing economists. In a deposition, Orszag defended his firm, saying that he believed the Compass contract with the state governments "had been suspended" when he signed on to work for Apple. Compass settled with the states, paying back some of the money. A person familiar with Compass' position says that its conflict-of-interest rules didn't apply to the low-level employees who helped both economists. Economists often argue that a merger will produce efficiencies, allowing companies to make more widgets for less money, an overall boon for society. But for an efficiency to count as an argument in a merger's favor, it must be a result of the merger itself. The premier economists in the field move back and forth from consulting firms to the top positions at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. In 2006, Carlton joined the Bush Department of Justice for a 17-month stint as the highest-ranking department economist, before returning to the firm. Carlton and the other luminaries in the field keep busy. From 2010 to 2014, Carlton consulted on 35 cases, according to his declaration in one case. That total includes his help for companies not only in front of the government but also in private litigation. Mostly he works on the defense side, fending off accusations of price-fixing or anti-competitive behavior. His clients have included Verizon, Honeywell, Fresh Del Monte, and Philip Morris. Because top experts get bonuses based on what the firm generates in billings, their annual incomes can run up to $10 million in a very good year. Like other top consultants, Carlton devotes hundreds of words in his expert reports to describing his academic credentials, scholarly publications, and journal affiliations. Corporate clients value him not just for his prestige and point of view but for his skill as a witness. Unlike some of his colleagues, he is never bombastic or arrogant. With small eyes, puffy cheeks crowding his soft, wide nose, and hair that sweeps above his brow, Carlton looks as intimidating as a high school guidance counselor. But his calm, unassuming demeanor, even under intense cross-examination, makes him the perfect champion for his corporate clients. "If you needed one guy for one deal and price didn't matter, I'd take Dennis," said a partner at one top New York corporate law firm. "He is the best." Carlton also knows just how far he can go. When he speaks, he proceeds deliberately, in a nasal accent, displaying a wariness that comes from decades of being questioned in court. Economists often argue that a merger will produce efficiencies, allowing companies to make more widgets for less money, an overall boon for society. But for an efficiency to count as an argument in a merger's favor, it must be a result of the merger itself. Carlton sometimes says the cost-savings are "merger related," according to a former Justice Department economist. "He is very careful about language. He won't say ‘merger specific.'" An off-the-cuff comment at a recent conclave illustrated Carlton's prominence in the hidden world of antitrust proceedings. One evening in April, lawyers, government officials, and economists gathered in Washington for the spring meeting of the American Bar Association's Antitrust Section. Held at the JW Marriott on Pennsylvania Avenue, the gathering is the prime marketing event of the year for the economic consulting industry. After a mind-numbing day of panels on issues like "Clarifying Liability in Hub-and-Spoke Conspiracies," the consultancies hosted competing cocktail receptions. The Charles River Associates event featured a generous spread of Peking Duck. Berkeley Research Group hired a live jazz band. Justice Department staffers sipped drinks with once-and-future colleagues now at white-shoe law firms, and Ivy League economists. Earlier in the day, during a discussion of new theories about the damage caused by concentration in the airline industry and the overall economy, antitrust attorney John Harkrider shrugged at his fellow panelists. "I'm sure if you paid Dennis Carlton a million bucks, he'd blow up all these things," he remarked. Carlton's rosy forecasts about the impact of proposed mergers haven't always proven accurate. In the summer of 2005, Whirlpool, the appliance giant, decided to take over Maytag, a storied name that had gradually faded. The combination would leave three companies—the other two being GE and Electrolux—in control of more than 85 percent of the market for clothes washers and dryers. They would have 88 percent of the dishwasher market and 86 percent for refrigerators. In addition to the namesake brands, the newly enlarged Whirlpool would own Amana, KitchenAid and Jenn-Air, and manufacture many Kenmore appliances. The companies hired top law firms to persuade the Bush administration Justice Department to allow the deal. And the firms brought in Carlton. Despite the combined entity's powerful position, Carlton argued in his report that it still faced a threat from foreign competition. The possibility that a big box retailer might switch to LG or Samsung would prevent the newly combined company from raising prices, he asserted. The companies did not persuade Justice Department officials, who proposed blocking the merger. An outside economic expert of their own, University of California at Berkeley's Carl Shapiro, backed the staff's analysis. The Bush appointee who headed the antitrust division, Assistant Attorney General Tom Barnett, resisted the staff's conclusions. Right after Shapiro provided his analysis, Barnett wrote to the companies' law firms, outlining the arguments that Shapiro and the staff made against the merger. Barnett, who declined comment, provided a roadmap to how to respond to the government's claims, a person familiar with the letter said. After months of deliberation, in March 2006, Barnett overruled the staff recommendation, allowing the merger to go through with no conditions. Shapiro and American University's Baker later called it a "highly visible instance of under enforcement." Carlton's predictions did not pan out. Whirlpool raised prices. Five years after the deal, Princeton's Ashenfelter and an economist with the Federal Trade Commission found that, contrary to the Compass Lexecon pre-merger forecasts, the takeover resulted in "large price increases for clothes dryers" and price increases for dishwashers. In addition, the companies reduced their offerings, giving consumers fewer choices. By 2012, LG and Samsung had grabbed some market share mostly from second-tier players. Whirlpool and Maytag's combined shares dropped just over two percentage points in washers and dryers, according to Traqline. But the competition had not brought down prices. Antitrust experts say that a scenario in which companies raise prices despite losing market share to competitors can be evidence that a merger hurt consumers. The Whirlpool-Maytag merger was revisited in 2014 when GE tried to sell its appliance division to Electrolux, a Swedish manufacturer. Electrolux hired Jonathan Orszag. In December 2015, government officials questioned Orszag's expert report on the possible effects of the GE-Electrolux merger. Contradicting Ashenfelter, Orszag had submitted a study asserting that the Whirlpool-Maytag merger had not raised prices, conclusions he based mainly on the washer and dryer market. Justice Department staff economists studied backup material to his analysis and they found something troubling. Buried there was an acknowledgment that the Whirlpool-Maytag merger had resulted in price increases in cooking appliances, the very sector of the market that government officials worried might be affected by the GE-Electrolux combination. The Justice Department filed suit to stop the deal and GE pulled out during the trial. In a speech in June, outgoing deputy attorney general David Gelfand warned about gamesmanship by economic consultants. While much economic work is good, "we do see junk science from time to time," he said. As an example, Gelfand pointed to the GE-Electrolux case, though he did not name the company or Orszag. He said the inconvenient data "should have been disclosed and presented with candor" in the expert report supporting the merger. Orszag did allude in a footnote to the other data, and provided backup materials that disclosed the higher prices in cooking appliances. He contended in his testimony that these price increases were due not to the merger itself but to other factors such as rising costs of raw materials. He said that Ashenfelter's conclusions were wrong because, unlike Orszag, the Princeton economist did not have access to Whirlpool's costs for making appliances. The government's reliance on economic models rests on the notion that they're more scientific than human judgment. Yet merger economics has little objectivity. Ashenfelter stands by his study. "My concern with Orszag's deposition as evidence is that all this is done behind a curtain of secrecy. None of us know just what he did, how the cost data were constructed," he wrote in an email to ProPublica. "Orszag's results would only have been presented if they favored his client. Our paper had no clients and we would have been happy to find no price effect." In a bright conference room at Fordham Law School on a warm day this past September, an economist realized she had made a mistake in a deposition. A WilmerHale partner seized on the error. A group of people, seated at blond wood tables in sleek, ergonomic black chairs, took notes as light streamed into the room, reflecting off the columns of Lincoln Center across the street. The economist, Michelle Burtis of Charles River Associates, turned to the audience and, letting out a laugh, broke character. "And at this point, I would definitely start obfuscating," she said, smiling. Burtis was presenting a mock deposition to train lawyers and economists on the pivotal role economists can play in antitrust matters. Charles River and another consulting firm, Cornerstone Research, sponsored the conference. Burtis, who has short, chin-length brown hair, oversized glasses, a friendly demeanor, and a doctorate in economics from the University of Texas at Austin, continued to guide the attendees toward "what is helpful in a situation like this," where the economists had erred but still needed to push the client's line. "You're never going to get me to admit this is a mistake," she explained. The government's reliance on economic models rests on the notion that they're more scientific than human judgment. Yet merger economics has little objectivity. Like many areas of social science, it is dependent on assumptions, some explicit and some unseen and unexamined. That leaves room for economists to follow their preconceptions, and their wallets. Economists have an "incentive to get a reputation as someone who will make a certain type of argument. People will hire you because they know what testimony you will give," said Robert Porter, an economist from Northwestern who has never testified on behalf of a corporation in an antitrust matter. In a 2007 interview, Carlton maintained an expert witness shouldn't be biased. "It is the job of the economic consultant to reach an expert opinion in light of all the evidence, both the good and bad. I think it destroys an expert's credibility to present only the supportive evidence," he said. Economists who do a lot of consulting on antitrust cases say it is not in their long-term interest to shill for a corporate client. Carlton says consulting is tougher than writing for peer-reviewed journals. For scholarship, "it's not required for the editor to re-run your numbers. In litigation, the expert on the other side has reviewed to make sure I haven't made errors. The scrutiny is good and leads to a higher quality of report," he told Global Competition Review, an antitrust trade publication in 2014. While the data is hidden from outsiders, what matters to Carlton is that there are no secrets between the companies and the government. "When economists are speaking to each other, it's transparent. They are discussing the economics. The data is turned over to the other side. It's your model vs. theirs," Carlton told ProPublica. Several former employees of consulting firms describe their jobs differently. They say they understood that clients wanted them to reach favorable conclusions. The job was "to go through analyses of market data and try to suggest that this merger doesn't raise antitrust concerns," said David Foster, who left Compass Lexecon in 2014, after working as a young analyst there for a year and a half. The companies and lawyers that rely on economists as witnesses aren't looking for neutrality. At the Fordham conference, a panel moderator asked Katrina Robson, a lawyer at O'Melveny & Myers, what she sought in an expert. "To be able to be an advocate without seeming to be an advocate," she replied. Companies and their lawyers shop around for amenable economists, looking for the reports that provide the answers they are looking for. Karen Kazmerzak, a partner at Sidley Austin, told attendees that she likes to hire two economists if the client can afford it. "It often comes out that one economist is not prepared to deliver the conclusions you need them to deliver," she said. In those cases, the law firm can fire one economist and go forward with the other, more malleable consultant. When an expert concludes that a merger won't pass muster with the government, the corporate client typically either backs out of the proposed deal, figures out concessions to offer the government, finds a more supportive economist at the same consulting firm, or switches firms. Sometimes, according to a prominent antitrust lawyer, unwelcome predictions are locked in a drawer, protected by attorney-client privilege, never to be seen by the government or the public. On occasion, Carlton has told companies that their deals are unlikely to be approved. He's walked away from at least one merger: H&R Block's 2011 takeover of TaxAct, a software firm. The government challenged it, and Carlton pulled out a few months before the trial. The companies hired a new expert from a competing firm, who defended the merger in court. The Justice Department used Carlton's departure to cast doubt on the credibility of the new consultant and won the case. In 2011, when AT&T sought to take over the cell phone company T-Mobile, the government balked. T-Mobile, a smaller and scrappier rival, often tried out new and innovative offerings to keep cell service costs low. Carlton represented AT&T. Based on data the company provided, he predicted that the cost of cell phone service would explode if AT&T couldn't take over T-Mobile and use its network to meet rising demand. Without the acquisition, Carlton and his Compass colleagues concluded, AT&T would be forced to charge higher prices. When government officials looked closely at Carlton's model, they realized that it was implying that prices would rise so high without the merger, the cell phone market would shrink by 90% within a few years. Justice Department officials viewed this as wildly implausible. "We find that the applicants' economic model is deficient," the government wrote of the work by Carlton and other Compass Lexecon consultants. Soon after the companies announced their deal, the Department of Justice sued to block the transaction and after several months of wrangling, the companies dropped the transaction in late 2011. Even though AT&T was not able to complete its takeover, cell phone usage in the US has not collapsed by 90%. Shortly after AT&T withdrew its offer for T-Mobile, the top economist at the Justice Department, Fiona Scott Morton, held a dinner at the Caucus Room, a Washington eatery, for several economists who worked on the deal. The restaurant provided an intimate and comfortable setting for a post-mortem. "Everyone is friends," recalls one attendee. "It was fun." They debated who had the better case. Carlton conceded that AT&T and T-Mobile would have found it hard to win at trial, according to an attendee. But he wished it had gone to court. He was eager to try out a new and provocative argument for mergers: That even though prices would have risen for customers, the companies would have achieved large cost savings. The gain for AT&T shareholders, he contended, would have justified the merger, even if cell phone customers lost out. Carlton's expert report predicted that T-Mobile was doomed to failure without the merger. "Our review indicates that T-Mobile USA's competitive significance is likely to decline in the absence of the proposed transaction," he and two other Compass Lexecon economists wrote. Five years later, T-Mobile's stock price and market share are up and its colorful CEO, John Legere, has been credited by the business press for "singlehandedly dragging the industry into a new era" with innovations such as abolishing cellular contracts. In 2014, Bill Baer, then the head of the antitrust division at the Justice Department, claimed victory: "T-Mobile went back to competing to win your business," he said in a speech. "And T-Mobile's competitors were compelled to respond." Today, AT&T's much grander takeover of Time Warner will be an early test case for president-elect Trump, who feuded during the campaign with CNN, a Time Warner property. It will also be a boon for Compass and the small army of academic economists mobilizing for the multi-front battle waged by the government, competitors and the merging companies.

A substandard battery life performance was the key reason for the U.S. tech giant to miss out on a recommendation from the publication after extensive testing on three of Apple's new MacBook Pro models. Apple says its latest MacBook Pro laptops' battery life should operate for up to 10 hours yet Consumer Reports discovered the three models tested would range from less than four hours to more than 19 hours. Widely disparate figures "A laptop's battery life may vary from one trial to another by less than 5 percent," Jerry Beilinson, reviewer at Consumer Reports, said in a blog post published Thursday. "However, the widely disparate figures we found in the MacBook Pro tests, an average wouldn't reflect anything a consumer would be likely to experience in the real world. "Battery life is an important attribute for a laptop, and it represents a significant portion of our overall score... After factoring together our complete test results, Consumer Reports finds that all three MacBook Pro laptops fail to meet our standards for recommended models," he added. CNBC reached out to Apple on Friday however they were unavailable for comment. Its shares closed 0.72 percent lower on Thursday.

That is the annual task that faces those trying to select the ideal gift package for college bowl participants. Most games try to avoid giving away the same thing. Most have watches, backpacks and hats but when it comes to the big gifts this is where the real competition begins. Top gifts (non-gift suite) For the 16 games that choose not to have gift suites, there are some interesting choices this year. Here are the top five: Apple Watch Nike + (Alamo Bowl): This is the only game that has announced it has the popular smartwatch as one of its gifts. Rick Hill, the game’s vice president of marketing, said they went up to the last-minute to make its decision and was in constant contact with Nike to make sure they could get them. While most companies offer a discount on bulk items, that is not the case with Apple watches, which have a retail value between $349-399. Finrod’s Festive Wear (Armed Forces Bowl): Brant Ringler, the bowl’s executive director, said he got the idea two years ago when he saw Illinois arrive in Texas for bowl preparations wearing ugly holiday sweaters. This year there are two colors, red and blue. Both feature the game’s sponsor’s logo, an F-35 jet, footballs and a goal post. “I didn’t know if it was still popular but last week I was out and saw seven college kids wearing ugly sweaters and another in ugly suit. It is nice to see the trend continuing,” Ringler said. Red, inflatable “big-lazy” (Arizona Bowl): The Tucson-based game is only two years old but is developing a reputation for unique gifts. Last year it was a pair of Cowtown custom cowboy boots where each team had its own fitting sessions. The boots aren’t one of the gifts this year but the inflatable couch might get more use in a player’s dorm room or apartment. Whatever the Cotton Bowl gives: This is the only game that does not reveal what their gifts are before the players arrive. However, the gifts are usually the best of all the bowls. Last year Alabama and Michigan State received an Apple Watch and Amazon Fire TV. Two years ago it was Beats wireless headphones and three years ago it was an Apple TV and iPad Mini. Bobblehead (Taxslayer Bowl): These are not your standard mass produced bobbleheads. Each player will get one with their face, name and uniform number. Top gift suite items This year 25 games are doing gift suites. In the case of the Fiesta Bowl, athletes from Clemson and Ohio State have the option of the gift suite or a PlayStation bundle that includes the game system and accessories. Jon Cooperstein, director of the sports marketing division for PAC, said the big-ticket items remain the most popular. Recliners: The leather chair, which includes two USB ports and a drink holder, remain the most popular item, no matter what position someone plays because it allows them to create their own home theatre system. Michael Kors watches: Most games supply watches as gifts but some prefer having something more stylish or get one to give to a family member or girlfriend. Mountain bikes: These have gained in popularity among the past year or two as athletes use them to commute around campus. Amazon echo: The internet-connected wireless speaker with the digital assistant named Alexa has gained in popularity the past two bowl seasons. Wireless headphones: Beats came out with a couple new versions before the holidays, which will make them more popular than some of the outdated ones. Over the ear headphones instead of earbuds remain the more favored option.     Tags: gifts, popular, games, years, watches, apple, Other stories from today: Five more minor-league baseball suspended, raising 2016 total to 100 Beloved Warriors fan ’Sweetie’ dies at 107 What's on tap     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   What are your New Year's resolutions?

Britta O'Boyle23 December 2016Phones Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Google's Pixel and Pixel XL have been on the market for a few months now, and while it might not end up being the most popular among consumers, it's one of the best phones we've reviewed this year.  The Pixel XL offers flagship specs and a premium design, putting it in the same boat as the Apple iPhone 7 Plus.. How exactly does it compare to Apple's big flagship? Let's find out.  Google Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus: Design Both premium, well-built designs Pixel XL is the lightest, iPhone 7 Plus is larger and slimmer Both have fingerprint sensors Google's Pixel XL and Apple's iPhone 7 Plus both have solid, premium designs. They look different of course, but they both look great. The iPhone 7 Plus is all about metal, while the Pixel XL uses a combination of metal and glass. That distinct glass panel on the back ensure that it can't be confused with anything else on the market.  The iPhone 7 Plus is water and dust resistant with a rating of IP67, so should cope with being accidentally dropped in the bath, or being caught in drizzle. The iPhone 7 Plus has its fingerprint sensor on the front, while the Pixel XL's is positioned on the rear. The iPhone 7 Plus is the largest and heaviest of these two devices, but it is also the slimmest, measuring 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3mm and weighing 188g.  The Pixel XL is the thicker but also lighter, measuring 154.7 x 75.7 x 8.6mm and weighing 168g. Google Pixel XL review: Android's new heavyweight champion Google Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus: Display Both phones have 5.5-inch screens Pixel XL has sharpest display Apple iPhone 7 Plus has pressure sensitive display for more functionality The Google Pixel XL and Apple iPhone 7 Plus both have 5.5-inch displays. The Pixel XL has a Quad HD resolution for a pixel density of 534ppi, and it uses AMOLED technology, while the iPhone 7 Plus has a Full HD resolution for a pixel density of 401ppi across the LCD screen. Apple's trump card is 3D Touch, the company's version of pressure sensitive technology, meaning its display is more functional than the Pixel XL, with extra features available based on the force with which you press. Both devices offer excellent, sharp and bright displays with great viewing angles. Neither of them will disappoint in terms of their screen. Apple's LCD displays more natural colours and crisp, clean whites, while the AMOLED Pixel XL screen is more vibrant and has higher contrast.  Apple iPhone 7 Plus review: Big changes from the big iPhone Google Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus: Camera Pixel XL has the highest resolution front-facing camera iPhone 7 has a dual-lens rear camera setup Pixel XL camera is very fast The Google Pixel XL has a 12.3-megapixel rear camera with an aperture of f/2.0 and 1.55µm pixels. It features a dual-LED flash, phase detection autofocus and laser autofocus, along with video stabilisation. The front-facing camera is 8-megapixels with 1.4µm pixels and an aperture of f/2.4. The Apple iPhone 7 Plus has a dual-lens setup on its rear comprising two 12-megapixel sensors, one wide-angle and one telephoto. The wide-angle sensor has an aperture of f/1.8 while the telephoto has an aperture of f/2.8 and optical image stabilisation and a quad-LED flash are also on board. The front-facing camera is 7-megapixels with an aperture of f/2.2 and a Retina Flash. Results are great and consistent on both devices though, with both of them producing brilliant images. The Pixel XL takes some of the best photos we've seen from a phone, and the iPhone 7 Plus photos are incredibly well balanced, and that 2x optical zoom is very useful.  Google Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus: Hardware Neither supports microSD expansion iPhone 7 Plus has largest available storage capacity option Pixel XL has largest battery capacity The Google Pixel XL features the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, 4GB of RAM and a 3450mAh battery charged via USB Type-C. It is available in 32GB and 128GB storage options and it doesn't support microSD. There is a 3.5mm headphone jack and it features bottom-firing speakers. The Apple iPhone 7 Plus uses Apples latest A10 Fusion chip with an embedded M10 motion coprocessor. It is thought to be supported by 3GB of RAM with a 2900mAh battery running the show, charged via Lightning. The iPhone 7 Plus comes in 32GB, 128GB and 256GB storage options, none of which have microSD expansion. There is no 3.5mm headphone jack but it has stereo speakers. Google Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus: Software Pixel XL offers pure Android Nougat experience iPhone 7 Plus offers streamlined experience for Apple and Mac users The Google Pixel XL launched on Android Nougat 7.1 and it offers a pure Android experience with no bloatware. There is a new launcher, round app icons and it is the first phone to offer Google's Assistant built-in. The Apple iPhone 7 Plus runs on iOS 10 and it will offer a streamlined experience for Mac users, like the Pixel XL does for Google users. There is no Google Assistant obviously, but Apple has Siri instead. Google Assistant tips and tricks: Master your Android assistant Google Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus: Price Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus start at £719 The Google Pixel XL has a starting price of £719 for the 32GB model. It creeps up to £819 for the 128GB model.  The Apple iPhone 7 Plus also has a starting price of £719, again for the 32GB model. The 128GB model also costs £819 like the Pixel XL, while the 256GB model will set you back £919. Google Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus: Conclusion The decision between these devices will probably come down to the design you like best and the software experience you prefer rather than the specs. For those of you who do care about the specs though, both devices are pretty much on par. The Pixel XL has the sharpest display, all the power you could want and a brilliant camera offering. The iPhone 7 Plus is the slimmest device and it too is an excellent device in terms of both performance and camera. Ultimately, whichever you choose, you're unlikely to be disappointed. They are both well-built, both powerful and both flagships.

It was clear from the inception of the smartwatch that the product would ultimately fall into one of two categories: a dumb, Bluetooth-linked smartphone peripheral or a smart, standalone device, depending on the absence or presence of a modem. The former category was the first to arrive and offered some value, primarily as a fitness tracker and notification device. However as the demise of Pebble has shown there is a limited market for such a limited feature set, especially when companies like Apple expect you to spend hundreds of pounds for the privilege. The latter category is still at a nascent phase and is struggling under several inherent problems. The need for a modem and consequent mobile subscription makes them expensive, especially considering the limitations presented by such minimal screen real estate. The use of smartwatches as communication devices is awkward both for text and voice – who wants to be holding their wrist up to the side of their head half the time? – and nobody is going to abandon the smartphone entirely in favour of a smartwatch. Nonetheless, with the smartphone category having already matured to the extent that innovation and sales growth have peaked, there remains considerable industry pressure to make the category work. As a consequence we are seeing giants such as Google, Apple and Samsung continue to roll the dice. In an interview with The Verge Jeff Chang, Android Wear Product Manager at Google, said his company is going to take the initiative – much as it has with smartphones and Chrome devices – and partner with an unnamed OEM to launch a couple of flagship smartwatches that will run the second major version of its wearables platform, Android Wear 2.0. Inevitably Change stressed his optimism for the category, but failed to detail why. There is talk of Android Pay integration for contactless payments and support for Google’s Assistant, to provide a voice alternative to the unsatisfactory voice UI but still no compelling reason why we should either pay more than a few quid on one or abandon our smartphones. Apple, which of course insists the Apple Watch is the best thing since sliced bread, seems to think supporting apps that require physical movement might help. TechCrunch reports that you can now play Pokémon Go on your Apple watch and even combine it with the fitness tracker functionality. Now you can not only humble-brag about how much exercise you’ve done on social media, you can also gloat about how many virtual beasties you acquired while doing it. The same publication, however, reports that US consumers are pretty unimpressed with the whole concept of the smartwatch and, quite reasonably, are waiting to see if there’s any point to them before splashing the cash. This is consistent with many previous reports, including our own. The whole ‘smart’ industry is at an impasse. Smartphones have arguably been the single most significant growth driver in the global economy for the past decade and now that growth has dried up. It’s therefore understandable that the search for the next big smart thing should be so desperate, but with every year that we fail to state the case for smartwatches it grows more likely we will have to search elsewhere.

By Hyacinth Mascarenhas December 23, 2016 11:46 GMT Developer Niantic has announced that Pokemon Go is now available on Apple Watch.The Pokémon Company/Niantic Niantic has launched the Apple Watch companion app for its smash-hit mobile game Pokémon Go. "You will now be able to explore and experience the world around you directly from your wrist, whether you're searching for wild Pokémon or trying to hatch the Pokémon originally discovered in the Pokémon Gold and Pokémon Silver video games," the developer said. "Apple Watch is particularly well suited to Pokémon Go as it seamlessly combines gameplay and imaging with getting exercise and exploring the real world." While the Apple Watch version of Pokémon Go isn't the full version of the game, the app does connect to the mobile game on your smartphone to collect items from PokéStops and view nearby digital critters that pop up. You will also be able to see how far you need to walk to hatch a Pokémon egg or receive candy from your Buddy Pokémon. Players will also be able to log their daily Pokémon Go gameplay sessions as a workout towards their personal Activity Rings. However, players will still have to use their smartphone to capture the beloved monsters. According to Niantic, here's what the new Apple Watch app can do: Log each play session as a workout, with gameplay counting toward personal Activity rings Receive notifications about nearby Pokémon Count distance toward hatching Pokémon Eggs and receiving Candy with your Buddy Pokémon Receive notifications toward PokéStops nearby and collect items from them Receive notifications when Eggs hatch and medals are awarded The announcement follows reports claiming that Niantic had cancelled its plans to port the game to the device, which the developer quickly debunked. An email recently circulated on Reddit, said to be sent by a Niantic service agent, claimed that the developer had stopped working on the port for the Apple Watch. However, Niantic quickly put the rumours to rest, saying the email was not real and confirming that Pokémon Go would still be coming to Apple Watch. Since its massively successful release in July, Pokémon Go has captured the hearts of people across the globe. Niantic recently reported that Pokémon Go trainers have collectively walked more than 8.7 billion km — more than 200,000 trips around the Earth — and have caught more than 88 billion pocket monsters since launch. This month, Niantic has launched a slew of new in-game events, partnerships with Sprint, Starbucks and Sprint, rolled out the game to new markets in South Asia including India and released several new Gen 2 creatures in an effort to draw players back to the smartphone game. They also released a limited edition, Santa hat-wearing Pikachu for players to stalk and capture through 29 December.

Google will launch two flagship smartwatches early next year with Android 2.0 running the show  Google confirms first Android Wear 2.0 watches will debut in Q1 2017 They will be made and branded by an unconfirmed third-party manufacturer Following launch, Android Wear 2.0 update will be rolled out to existing devices By Luke Johnson For Mailonline Published: 06:50 EST, 23 December 2016 | Updated: 07:00 EST, 23 December 2016 e-mail 30 shares 59 View comments Google has been quiet on the wearables front recently, but that's all about to change with two new flagship smartwatches confirmed for release in early 2017. Teasing the upcoming launch, Jeff Chang, product manager of Android Wear at Google, confirmed the future watch plans in a recent interview. But despite bearing flagship status, these watches won't be made by Google. Scroll down for video  No pictures have been released of the two new watches yet, but multiple sources involved in the project have revealed the specifications of a sporty, feature packed device as well as a lighter, stylish wearable WHAT IS ANDROID WEAR?  Android Wear is Google's proprietary software designed to run on touchscreen wearable gadgets. It's an offshoot of Android OS, the world's most popular smartphone software. It uses gesture controls to let users swipe through on-screen apps and menu options. Compatible with all recent Android phones, there's also limited support for iPhone owners. By contrast, the Apple Watch only works with Apple's handsets.  Instead, they will be branded by the manufacturer that the firm has collaborated with on the new Android Wear powered devices. Although this mystery manufacturer hasn't been named, Chang confirmed the company had previously made Android Wear devices. This lengthy list could include firms such as Samsung, Huawei, Motorola and LG, or traditional watch brands including Tag Heuer, Fossil and Michael Kors. As well as new hardware, Chang, speaking with The Verge, confirmed the new watches would be the first to run the heavily updated Android Wear 2.0 operating system. Revamping the software's awkward user interface, the update will also introduce a number of new features. These include Android Pay support, standalone apps that don't require a phone to work, and the recently released voice-controlled Google Assistant.

Share this article Share 30 shares Despite having been overtaken by Apple and its Apple Watch at the top of smartwatch sales charts, Chang says Google remains 'quite optimistic' about the future of smartwatches. Unlike Apple, Google doesn't make its own watches, instead partnering with third-party manufacturers and licensing out its software, a move it believes gives it the long-term edge.  Although this mystery manufacturer hasn't been named, Chang confirmed the company had previously made Android Wear devices. This lengthy list could include tech firms such as Samsung, Huawei, Motorola and LG. Pictured is Motorola's 360 2 smartwatch  'We've enabled a lot of diversity with our hardware partners to target different types of consumers and preferences,' Chang said. 'This is a marathon, not a sprint. 'This category of products is here with us to stay.' Despite dodging manufacturing duties on the first Android Wear 2.0 watches, Google is no stranger to making its own gadgets. Earlier this year, the company launched its first own-brand smartphone, the Google Pixel. The new watches have been confirmed for release on an unspecified date in Q1 2017, a period that runs from January 1 to March 31. With Mobile World Congress, the Barcelona-based mobile technology show, to run between February 27 and March 2, it's likely the new devices will make their first official appearance around this time. Once the new devices are released, Google has confirmed the Android Wear 2.0 update will be rolled out to a number of existing devices.  Read more: Google will launch two flagship smartwatches early next year - The Verge Share or comment on this article e-mail 30 shares Most watched News videos Mariah botches New Year's Eve performance and storms off stage Heart-warming moment woman plays piano and sings in cathedral Man goes crazy when he catches another guy in bed with his wife Woman takes seven minutes to parallel park car in double space Man finally talks to wife after over twenty years of silence Passenger insults flight attendant before being led away by police Disturbing moment pitbull kills small dog in front of its owner Mass brawl erupts between customers and restaurant staff Dog shows off its incredibly efficient banana-eating technique Bottles and furniture thrown during terrifying NYE fight Spooky!

Here are some of the best gifts you’ll find without ever hitting the Apple Store. By Emily Bary Dec. 21, 2016 5:36 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large You don’t have to spend up on Apple’s own pricey products to make an Apple fan happy. Photo: Apple Are you looking for a gift for that Apple-obsessed sibling, cousin or parent? Some of the best ideas -- and deals -- are likely to be found outside the walls of Apple’s glimmering retail shops. Barron’s Next has previously catalogued ways to save huge amounts of money on cables for Apple gear. But surely no one wants an Apple charger for the holidays. So here are some other great ideas for actual gifts that can help you save money while not feeling quite so beholden to Apple’s premium pricing. More from Barron’s Next Apple Accessories: When to Save, When to Splurge 7 Last-Minute Tech Gifts for People Who Hate Tech Last-Minute Holiday Gifts for $35 or Less Apple Watch bands: You don’t need to pay $149 for a metal Milanese loop band sold by Apple itself when you can get a perfectly nice one from Amazon for $12. And at $49, silicone “sport” bands are among the cheapest you can get from the Apple Store, but we like Moko’s version, also available on Amazon for $12. One good thing about the knock-offs, aside from their prices, is that they come in colors not offered by Apple. Impress your sister with a rose gold metal band that matches her watch face. iPhone battery cases: Older iPhones like the 6 and 6S have been having battery issues lately. Apple is replacing some iPhone 6S batteries due to manufacturing issues, but many users continue to have problems and aren’t eligible for Apple’s repair program. If your loved ones have phones that keep shutting down unexpectedly, consider a case with a built in battery pack. We like Apple’s version ($99) but admit that the hump on the back is pretty ugly -- and heavy. The case for the 6 often got us through a full day of pretty heavy usage. You could also try Mophie’s $100 battery case, which is a little easier on the eyes. AirPods: If you can manage to get your hands on a pair, your friends will love to receive them as a gift. Even if you have to wait a while -- the AirPods are backordered for six weeks -- it’s almost worth printing out your order confirmation and telling your loved one she’ll be getting them eventually. We love the feel and convenience of the AirPods, and we think folks on your holiday shopping list will, too. If your recipient already has the pods, get him or her a $10 AirPod strap on Amazon, which connects the two pods. They’ll prevent you from losing the pods, which are quite small and light. MacBook Pro case: Of course, a hard-shell case protects your MacBook from getting scratched in your bag, but it also helps distinguish it from everyone else’s MacBooks. Your friend can dress up the colored case with stickers of her corporate logo and the restaurant where she met her boyfriend, and then not have to worry that she’s ruined her computer in case she leaves her company or suffers a nasty breakup. We like Speck’s models. You can get them pretty cheaply on Amazon in time for the holidays. Follow Barron’s Next on Facebook and Twitter.

This marks the first time a new MacBook model hasn’t received a recommendation from the famed testing organization. Don't Miss: Behold: The edgeless iPhone 8 you’ve always dreamt of While testing all three variants of Apple’s new MacBook Pro, Consumer Reports was surprised to see battery life on each machine vary drastically with no particular rhyme or reason. The MacBook Pro battery life results were highly inconsistent from one trial to the next. For instance, in a series of three consecutive tests, the 13-inch model with the Touch Bar ran for 16 hours in the first trial, 12.75 hours in the second, and just 3.75 hours in the third. The 13-inch model without the Touch Bar worked for 19.5 hours in one trial but only 4.5 hours in the next. And the numbers for the 15-inch laptop ranged from 18.5 down to 8 hours. All the more bizarre is that Consumer Reports’ battery testing is far from machine-intensive. On the contrary, it involves consistently running a notebook’s web browser through a sequence of web pages. Consumer Reports relays that the normal variance in battery life it sees on a new notebook typically falls somewhere in the 5% range. And as a direct consequence of receiving CR’s lowest possible score for battery life, Apple’s new flagship notebook lineup failed to receive a ‘buy’ recommendation. Despite mostly positive reviews, the MacBook Pro’s inconsistent performance with respect to battery life has been an issue we’ve seen sprout up quite frequently on Reddit forums and on Apple’s own support forums over the past few weeks. There, some owners have detailed how simply opening up a single app can sometimes lower battery life by well over 50%. Meanwhile, other users have complained that they can’t even get a full 6 hours of usage on a machine that boasts that it supports up to 10 hours. Regardless of the cause, this certainly isn’t a good look for Apple. Hopefully the problem is something that can ultimately be addressed via a software update. UPDATE: Apple’s Phil Schiller has tweeted a note stating that Consumer Reports’ findings do not align with Apple’s own test results. Working with CR to understand their battery tests. Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data. https://t.co/IWtfsmBwpO — Philip Schiller (@pschiller) December 24, 2016 Trending right now: The best TV shows on Netflix you’ve never heard of Scientists just discovered a huge cluster of galaxies hidden in Earth’s backyard 10 awesome iOS 10 tips that will make you an iPhone power user See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next 9 tech-friendly gifts for people obsessed with travel Yahoo Tech CNN uses screenshot from ‘Fallout 4’ to show how Russians hack things BGR News Facebook launches live 360-degree video feature Yahoo Tech The battle between SSD and HDD is over, and the winner is clear Digital Trends Celebrity sues Tesla, claims Model X drove itself through a wall and into his house BGR News A theory that challenges Newton’s and Einstein’s gravity and nixes dark matter passed its first test Quartz Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo Finance

Nokia's lawsuits, filed in courts in Dusseldorf, Mannheim and Munich, Germany, and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, cover patents for displays, user interfaces, software, antennas, chipsets and video coding. "Since agreeing a license covering some patents from the Nokia portfolio in 2011, Apple has declined subsequent offers made by Nokia to license other of its patented inventions which are used by many of Apple's products," Nokia said in a statement. Try Newsweek for only $1.25 per week Apple on Tuesday had taken legal action against Acacia Research and Conversant Intellectual Property Management, accusing them of colluding with Nokia to extract and extort exorbitant revenues unfairly from Apple. "We’ve always been willing to pay a fair price to secure the rights of patents covering technology in our products," said Apple spokesman Josh Rosenstock. "Unfortunately, Nokia has refused to license their patents on a fair basis and is now using the tactics of a patent troll to attempt to extort money from Apple by applying a royalty rate to Apple’s own inventions they had nothing to do with." Acacia and Conversant did not immediately respond to requests for comment, and Nokia was not immediately available to comment on the Apple lawsuit. The legal action by Nokia and Apple appear to mark a revival of the "smartphone patent wars" that began five years ago, when Apple filed a series of patent infringement cases against Samsung around the world, with wins and losses on both sides. Apple's lawsuit against Acacia, Conversant and Nokia was filed only one day after Ottawa-based Conversant named Boris Teksler as its new chief executive. He had worked as Apple's director of patent licensing and strategy from 2009 to 2013, the latter half of his tenure overlapping with the lawsuits against Samsung. Acacia is a publicly traded patent licensing firm based in Newport Beach, California. One of its subsidiaries sued Apple for patent infringement and was awarded $22 million by a Texas jury in September. Similarly, Conversant, which claims to own thousands of patents, announced last week that a Silicon Valley jury had awarded one of its units a $7.3 million settlement in an infringement case against Apple involving two smartphone patents.

Nokia, once the world's dominant cellphone maker, missed out on the transition to smartphones triggered by Apple's introduction of the iPhone in 2007. The Finnish company sold its handset business to Microsoft two years ago, leaving it with its telecom network equipment business and a bulging portfolio of mobile equipment patents. But this year, Microsoft sold its Nokia-feature phone business to a new company called HMD Global. Nokia agreed to a 10-year licensing deal with HMD, which continues to market low-cost Nokia phones and plans to introduce new Nokia smartphone models next year.

TECHNOLOGY When It Comes to Leadership, Tech Employees Have Lapped Their Bosses Don't expect Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and their peers to lead on social issues under Trump as they did during the Obama presidency. By Salvador Rodriguez Salvador Rodriguez is a staff reporter for the San Francisco bureau of Inc. He covers Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, tech diversity, virtual reality, and other aspects of technology and entrepreneurship. Previously, Rodriguez was the Silicon Valley correspondent for the International Business Times; before that, he was the lead tech blogger and gadget reviewer for the Los Angeles Times. Rodriguez has interned with The New York Times in Arizona, The Arizona Republic, and the Houston Chronicle. He was born in Mexico and raised in Texas, and he earned his journalism degrees at Arizona State University. One of his special skills is the ability to name all the Super Bowl winners chronologically from memory. @sal19 Staff reporter, Inc.@sal19 1 COMMENTS CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Over the past eight years, there has never been a shortage of bold social action by Silicon Valley's most powerful and influential. We saw it in 2014 when Apple CEO Tim Cook came out as a proud gay man. We saw it in 2013 when Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and several others launched FWD.us, calling on Congress to open the U.S. to more immigration. And most recently we saw it in 2015 when Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff threatened to pull his company out of Indiana after the state passed a law that allowed discrimination against LGBT people. One month after the election of Republican businessman Donald Trump, whose campaign was filled with racist, sexist and xenophobic rhetoric, there's still plenty of moral leadership to be found in the tech industry. It's just not coming from the top. As Silicon Valley's most influential leaders take a wait-and-see approach toward controversial President-Elect Donald Trump, pausing to consider what effect his policies could have on their companies' bottom lines, it's grassroots efforts by everyday tech workers that are perpetuating the industry's tradition of tolerance and progressive activism. "This presidency, given the drastic divisiveness of all of it, it's really forcing [tech leaders] to think about what's important," said Kyle Graden, a gender solutions strategist and former employee of Salesforce. "They do really care, but they have to ask themselves 'Do we care enough to risk some business?'" It's a change in the tech industry that has been underway for some time but has become starkly evident in the past month. Nothing has done more to highlight the new dynamic than the question of where tech companies stand on the idea of helping the federal government create a Muslim registry as a tool against future terrorist attacks. A growing number of tech companies have vowed never to build such a demographic database, but these pledges came only after most large tech companies originally stonewalled the question. It took hundreds and then thousands of independent tech workers signing their names to a pledge before their companies finally began to budge on the matter. "We are choosing to stand in solidarity with Muslim Americans, immigrants, and all people whose lives and livelihoods are threatened by the incoming administration's proposed data collection policies," independent tech workers said in their pledge against the creation of a registry. Their display led directly to Apple, Google and Facebook, among others, distancing themselves from the proposal, which Trump has yet to renounce. A similar pattern played out in November around the issue of fake news. Journalists questioned the influence of false and misleading stories shared and propagated on Facebook, Twitter and Google. Zuckerberg's initial reaction was to dismiss any blame, calling the idea of fake news stories swaying Americans votes as a "crazy" proposition. Zuckerberg only changed his stance after a renegade group of his employees formed an unofficial task force to look into the matter. "It's not a crazy idea. What's crazy is for [Zuckerberg] to come out and dismiss it like that, when he knows, and those of us at the company know, that fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season," one Facebook employee told BuzzFeed regarding the renegade group. Shown up by his underlings, Zuckerberg quickly adopted a more contrite tone; Facebook is now launching efforts to better identify fake news. He has even softened on his long-held assertion that Facebook should in no way be considered a media company. The national context matters. During Obama's time as president, it was always easy for Silicon Valley to be progressive without worrying about high-level fallout for their businesses. The leader of the free world was a fan of both tech and progressive social norms. With the looming presidency of Trump, things have changed. Trump may say that he believes Silicon Valley is a unique industry, but he is not afraid of leaning on its biggest players, as he already has with Twitter, which he shunned from a recent high-level CEO summit. "For better or for worse, founders, CEOs and tech leaders have a duty to their investors, partners, shareholders and employees. Their words and actions have a pronounced effect on their companies," said Ben Parr, co-founder of Octane AI, a startup whose tools can be used to create artificially intelligent messaging bots. As an example, Parr argues that if a tech CEO makes a public comment and is then suddenly lambasted by Trump, who is never shy to express his thoughts through tweets, that CEO could suddenly see the price of his or her company's shares fall instantly as a result. "This is one of the reasons why you see tech leaders so restrained at the moment," Parr said. "Employees, on the other hand, don't have these restrictions. They are more free to speak their minds and organize. Their actions don't have the same impact on a company or an industry. In fact, tech leaders may quietly support these efforts since they cannot publicly." Tech's leaders may be restrained at the moment, but there is evidence that a divide is growing, and nowhere is it more evident than in the industry's individual contributions throughout the 2016 election. VIEW FULL VERSION As usual, the tech industry shaded heavily blue in its campaign support. Hillary Clinton raised more money from Silicon Valley than any other presidential candidate at nearly $8 million from 9,670 contributions, according to Crowdpac, a nonpartisan tech startup that analyzes data on contributions to political candidates. But while Clinton raised the most money, she did not receive the highest number of contributions from the tech industry. That distinction went to social liberal Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, who received more than 41,900 individual contributions from Silicon Valley, most of which came from the industry's non-management tech workers, Crowdpac told Inc. The tech industry's top brass may have put its weight behind the business-friendly Clinton, but more everyday tech workers gave what they could to the more liberal Sanders, the data shows. Now with the ascension of Trump to presidency, a similar pattern is beginning to play out in which tech workers lead on social issues while tech executives gravitate toward strategies that can help or protect their businesses. Some executives may be choosing constraint in their statements, but others have been eagerly speaking out -- in support of Trump that is. Following the election, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty wrote a public letter congratulating the incoming president and offering the company's services. Rometty also promptly joined Trump's transition team as a member of the president-elect's economic advisory committee. "I am writing to offer ideas that I believe will help achieve the aspiration you articulated and that can advance a national agenda in a time of profound change," Rometty said in her note. "I do so as the leader of the nation's largest technology employer, its leading patent creator, and the company that for more than 105 years has believed that prosperity and progress can be achieved by unleashing the potential of all people." Also serving as a Trump advisor is Oracle Co-CEO Safra Catz, who was quoted as saying, "I plan to tell the President-elect that we are with him and are here to help in any way we can." At IBM, more than 100 employees signed a petition against Rometty's letter, saying they assert their "right to refuse participation in any U.S. government contracts that violate constitutionally protected civil liberties." Oracle, meanwhile, saw the public resignation of one of its staff directors published on LinkedIn for all of his colleagues and business associates to see. "I am not with President-elect Trump and I am not here to help him in any way. In fact -- when his policies border on the unconstitutional, the criminal and the morally unjust -- I am here to oppose him in every possible and legal way," wrote former Oracle employee George Polisner on Monday. "Therefore I must resign from this once great company." The higher up the tech corporate ladder you go, the more people you will find whose political views are shaped by the flow of capital investment and revenues, Polisner told Inc. Understanding that, Poliser opted not to resign when Oracle Executive Chairman Larry Ellison donated millions to Republican Sen. Marco Rubio's bid for president. What Polisner cannot tolerate, he said, is the executive of his company joining the advisory board of a president-elect he disagrees with without first resigning her position at Oracle and then roping her employees into her personal support with her words. "That is so against my own personal values in terms of the rise of hate crimes that Trump has given license to," Polisner told Inc. "To have a co-CEO who commits to helping this administration in anyway it can, I cannot -- I would feel like I'd be putting on an SS uniform." Going forward, Polisner said he expects to see this divide between the tech industry's higher-ups and everyday workers continue to widen. In part, this is because tech workers have already begun to see just how much influence they too can have on the world. He said he encourages his peers to exercise their strength by donating to groups that can oppose the incoming president on social issues and by personally committing to not helping the administration create anything that could be used to discriminate against groups of any kind. They can "refuse to engage on anything that can effectively be used to further hate or discrimination," Polisner said. "Rejecting a Muslim registry is an incredibly important thing to do."

[shrugs] By Leon Hurley Shares The Pokemon Go app for Apple Watch is finally here after a surprise update and... well, it's alright I guess. It works exactly as shown at the last Apple conference so I wasn't expecting much and, in practice, that's what I got. The main issue is that you can't use it to catch Pokemon like you can with the Pokemon Go Plus. You'll get notifications about them but have to get your phone out if you want to do anything. To be fair that function was never promised but it still feels so weird to get a notification like this and not be able to act on it:  You can collect pokestops, after receiving a notification and then spinning the wheel. You'll get a little update then to show you what you collected: And that's pretty much it. There's loads of stat tracking, showing you nearby pokemon, distances needed to walk for eggs and so on. But without that basic catching function it actually feels less useful than the Plus.  Image 1 of 5 Image 2 of 5 Image 3 of 5 Image 4 of 5 Image 5 of 5 It also murders the battery. Normally I put my watch on to charge at night at around 30-40%. After barely a couple of hours here I was already down to 50% suggesting you won't make it through the day if you try using it.  Obviously this is just a little bit of fluff to go with the main app but I was expecting it to be fun, not to be thinking about deleting it on the first morning. I'll use it for a bit more and see how I feel after some longer walks.  Seen something newsworthy?

Brian Barrett Security Date of Publication: 12.23.16. 12.23.16 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am The Year Encryption Won WIRED Between the revelations of mega-hacks of Yahoo and others, Russia’s meddling in the US electoral system, and the recent spike in ransomware, it’s easy to look at 2016 as a bleak year for security. It wasn’t all so, though. In fact, the last 12 months have seen significant strides in one of the most important aspects of personal security of all: encryption. End-to-end encryption, which ensures that the only people who can see your communications are you and the person on the receiving end, certainly isn’t new. But in 2016, encryption went mainstream, reaching billions of people all over the world. Even more significantly, it overcame its most aggressive legal challenge yet, in a prolonged standoff between Apple and the FBI. And just this week, a Congressional committee affirmed the importance of encryption, giving hope that future laws around the topic will include at least a modicum of sanity. There’s still a long way to go, and any gains that were made could potentially be rolled back, but for now it’s worth taking a step back to appreciate just how far encryption came this year. As far as silver linings go, you could do a lot worse. Apple Bites Back In February of this year, a California magistrate ordered Apple to help the FBI get into an iPhone used by San Bernadino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook. Apple said no. Encrypt All the Things The Apple-FBI Fight Isn’t About Privacy vs. Security. Don’t Be Misled Forget Apple vs. the FBI: WhatsApp Just Switched on Encryption for a Billion People You Can All Finally Encrypt Facebook Messenger, So Do It The Apple-FBI Battle Is Over, But the New Crypto Wars Have Just Begun What followed was a nearly two-month stand-off between the FBI and Apple, one that saw both parties make their cases in court and in front of Congress alike. The core issue wasn’t whether Apple would help law enforcement; it does so regularly. It was whether Apple would create a tool that would weaken the iPhone’s encryption at the FBI’s behest. To do so would have both created special access that bad actors could also have exploited, as well as set a dangerous precedent. This would not have been—and likely still won’t be—the FBI’s last request. “The FBI thought they had picked the perfect test case,” says Andrew Crocker, staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Because it involved a terrorist attack, public sympathy seemed likely to be on the FBI’s side. And to some degree it was; Donald Trump, at the time a long-shot GOP primary nominee, went so far as to call for a ban on Apple products. What happened instead, though, is that Apple was able to effectively mount its case not just in the courtroom, but for the public. In the process, it explained what encryption is, and why it’s important, in ways that many iPhone owners may never otherwise have bothered to consider. “The level of public engagement did a lot to improve the understanding of encryption,” Crocker says. “There’s a net benefit of having educated the public.” There ultimately was no ruling in the case, as the FBI found a way into Farook’s iPhone without Apple’s help. In a way, that’s a shame, because a decision in Apple’s favor could have helped cement the separation between tech companies and law enforcement. Still, it brought encryption to the forefront of public consciousness, and put the rest of Silicon Valley on alert. “It backfired [for the FBI] because it put a deep freeze on law enforcement’s relationship with the tech companies and with civil society,” says Nathan White, senior legislative manager with Access Now. That broader awareness also couldn’t have come at a better time. Just a week after the Apple-FBI imbroglio finally ended, encrypted messaging blew up on a whole new scale. Encryption For All In early April, WhatsApp added end-to-end encryption to its popular messaging service. That includes messages, phone calls, photos, and videos. WhatsApp, it should be said, has over a billion users. Better still, it rolled out encryption the right way. It’s enabled by default, meaning that two WhatsApp users are instantly secure in their communications without having to change a single setting. And it used the Signal Protocol, developed by Open Whisper Systems and widely acknowledged as the most reliable and secure end-to-end encryption available, to undergird its system. (Apple iMessage has offered end-to-end encryption for several years, but it has several known weaknesses not present in Signal.) A few months later, Facebook announced that it would roll out end-to-end encryption as well for its popular Messenger platform. Its “secret conversations,” also based on Signal Protocol, launched in October to another billion users. Facebook’s approach isn’t quite as sturdy as WhatsApps; people need to opt-in, rather that encryption being on by default. Still, it’s a large-scale deployment that not only expands encryption’s reach, but helps normalize it. “By rolling out end-to-end encryption in a very user friendly way, these companies are taking steps to protect people but also exposing people to security without overwhelming them,” says White.” WhatsApp and Facebook aren’t alone. Google’s Allo messaging app and Duo video app offer opt-in, end-to-end encryption, also using Signal smarts. An app called Viber, which doesn’t have much of a US foothold but has 700 million users around the world, switched on its own end-to-end encryption in April. And the Signal app itself, the gold standard in encrypted messaging, saw downloads increase 400 percent following Donald Trump’s presidential win. I do think we have to be vigilant. Andrew Crocker, Electronic Frontier Foundation If anything, 2016 is the year encrypted messaging became a default offering. The next step? To have it be a default setting as well, rather than an opt-in for which users have to dig. “If you teach the public that it’s not something they should be using by default and considered normal, you sort of stigmatize it,” says Crocker. “It seems like something they should only use when they have something to hide.” For now, though, they at least have the option. And hopefully will far into the future as well. What Comes Next While 2016 was a banner year for encryption, it’s uncertain what 2017 will bring. Trump opposed Apple, and has expressed a strong interest in vigorous use of surveillance powers. And the most encryption-based legislation to work through Congress was immediately derided as “ludicrous, dangerous, [and] technically illiterate.” “Not to be too pessimistic,” says Crocker, “But I do think we have to be vigilant.” The next Apple-FBI case could show up any day, with guarantees how it will shake out. There’s some hope, though, that the encryption gains made in 2016 have a chance to continue. Just this week, the US Congress Encryption Working Group released a report saying that “any measure that weakens encryption works against the national interest.” It’s as strong an endorsement from a bipartisan group as you’re likely to see. “The report makes it clear that Congress is not going to move forward with legislation to weaken encryption,” says White, who points out that the Chairman of the House Judiciary committee was one of the report’s signatories. That should minimize the chances of anti-encryption laws making their way through Congress. It’s not a firm guarantee, and who knows what a Trump administration will bring. For now, though, it’s enough to appreciate the gains encryption made in 2016, and be hopeful that 2017 will only build on them. Go Back to Top.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Powering Your World Why Apple is investing in wind turbines in China by Sherisse Pham   @CNNTech December 9, 2016: 6:07 AM ET How Morocco is embracing renewable energy Apple's latest deal in China doesn't have anything to do with smartphones. The tech giant is investing in the Chinese wind power industry, turning to the world's most populous country to help it achieve its goal of getting 100% of its energy from renewable sources. The iPhone maker struck a deal this week to buy a 30% stake in three subsidiaries of Goldwind, China's biggest wind-turbine manufacturer. The companies aren't saying how much money is involved. But it's Apple (AAPL, Tech30)'s largest clean energy project to date and the first of its kind in the wind power sector, Lisa Jackson, vice president of Apple's environment initiatives, told state-run newspaper China Daily. Apple is investing in businesses run by Goldwind, China's largest wind-turbine maker. Many Apple (AAPL, Tech30) products are made in China, and the country accounts for about one fifth of the company's sales. Environmental group Greenpeace has warned that electronics manufacturing uses a lot of energy in China, drawing on the country's high number of polluting coal power stations. Apple's moves into renewable energy are an attempt to compensate for this. Last year, it announced a series of solar projects, including one in the mountains of Sichuan Province where the panels were designed so that the local yak population could graze among them. It's also pushing its Chinese suppliers to use more clean energy. Related: Google will hit renewable energy milestone in 2017 The new wind project will add 285 megawatts of clean energy to China's grid, which Apple says will offset some of the other sources used by its operations and those of its immediate suppliers Foxconn, Lens, Catcher and Solvay. China provides plenty of opportunity for such initiatives. The country is the world's largest investor in renewable energy, pouring a record-breaking $102.9 billion into wind, solar and other projects in 2015, according to a U.N. report published in May. Like other companies, Apple uses power purchase agreements, in which it buys renewable energy from wind or solar energy developers, and then sells the energy back to the grid at a wholesale price. In exchange, Apple receives renewable energy certificates, which it applies to the non-renewable energy it uses to power some of its operations. Other tech companies like Facebook (FB, Tech30) and Google (GOOG) are also chasing the 100% renewable energy target. Google said earlier this month that it will hit the renewable energy milestone in 2017. Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) said it has been 100% powered by renewable energy since 2014.

Happy New Year firework wallpapers The top stories of the week on iDB How to use AirPods like a pro   skip to main content skip to main menu     The NomadPlus turns your iPhone power adapter into a portable battery By Anthony Bouchard, Dec 23, 2016 Tweet 10 Comments For everyday charging of your iPhone, the supplied power adapter that comes in your Apple retail packaging will suffice, but if you go places a lot, then having an AC adapter that can not only charge your iPhone, but also store power for charging when away from the plug is a must. Nomad comes the rescue in this department with an ingenious idea; a special type of AC adapter known as the NomadPlus that includes a built-in 1,800 mAh battery inside. Forget backup batteries; if you charge your iPhone every night, then you will have more than enough juice with a full charge and the NomadPlus to get you through even a day of heavy iPhone usage. The NomadPlus is designed in such a way that you can still use your OEM Apple power adapter to charge your iPhone or iPad from any power outlet, so you don’t have to worry about the dangers of third-party AC adapters ruining your device’s battery. The Apple power adapter fits very snugly into the NomadPlus. It can only go in one way, as the USB port in the AC adapter must plug into the NomadPlus. Once in, it won’t fall out, and requires a firm grip to pull back out again. The added 1,800 mAh battery capacity inside the NomadPlus lets you get a good charge even when you’re not near a power outlet. Depending on the model of iPhone you have, it can get you from near-dead to somewhere in the 90% range, or it could get you from half-capacity to fully charged. When you plug the NomadPlus into the power outlet, it gives priority to charging your iOS device, ensuring it charges as quickly as possible. As it charges your device, and even after, the power outlet will fill the internal battery of the NomadPlus with reserve power you can use later on. A power indicator is displayed on the front of NomadPlus, with each section of the circle representing 33% of charge. The incremental scale is as follows: 1 section = 33% charge 2 sections = 66% charge 3 sections = 99%+ charge Notably, even the USB port illuminates when the NomadPlus is plugged into the wall, so if you’re using it in the dark, you will be able to find the port with ease. The NomadPlus’s internal battery isn’t huge, but it’s just enough to give you a decent power boost throughout the day. This is something you can easily bring with you in your commute to or from work, as it’s not entirely huge by any means. Because the internal battery isn’t as high as a number of power banks on the market today, it doesn’t make a replacement for a heavy-duty battery pack. That said, you get a power boost from one full charge of the NomadPlus, but you can’t charge your iPhone or iPad repeatedly from the limited 1,800 mAh battery capacity. Still, to have a product that integrates right into something you use every single day, it offers a lot of convenience by providing you with spare power when you need it, such as when you’re stuck on the bus on your way home from work with only 10% of your iPhone’s battery remaining. I’ve included a short list of pros and cons below: Pros: Integrates with Apple power adapter Small size makes the NomadPlus portable LED indicators let you know of the power remaining Very affordable Cons: Battery capacity is limited, so it won’t charge as much as larger power banks If you think the NomadPlus would make an excellent addition to your iPhone or iPad accessory arsenal, you can grab one from Nomad’s website for the incredible Holiday price of just $13.95. This price is for a limited time only; the retail price for this product is $39.99 any other time of the year.

Love that company. Rowan09 Only good for the iPhone 7, 6, etc not the Plus models. Anthony Bouchard It’s good for all of them really, but you get less battery charge for a Plus model. If you’re getting to around 50% of your battery life on your Plus-sized iPhone and you use this accessory, you can get yourself back up to a full charge to continue on through your day. Joshfei I like the concept, but I would prefer and would have bought it, if they wrapped it around the 12w adapter. It charges iphones and ipads faster, at least that has been my experience with using both. Joey_Z $13.95 is not incredible, $39.99 is. For 40 bucks you can buy two 10,000 mAh power banks with some changes. and why design around Apple’s 5w charger… Anthony Bouchard The idea is to reduce the amount of things you have to carry around with you by squeezing the AC adapter you always use into a portable battery. It’s not a replacement for portable battery packs, but not everyone needs such a huge battery either because of the way they use their devices. This reaches a different kind of audience who are looking to downsize their travel bags. Krepler “The NomadPlus is designed in such a way that you can still use your OEM Apple power adapter to charge your iPhone or iPad from any power outlet, so you don’t have to worry about the dangers of third-party AC adapters ruining your device’s battery.” That’s gotta be pretty inaccurate.. The OEM charger will charge the Nomad but the Nomad has its own output and at 1 amp, that’s a slow charge. All they’ve done here is make a small powerbank that you can consolidate with one type of charger. The only pro I see, if you’re willing to spend anything at all on this, is that it MIGHT be able to charge your phone WHILE charging the bank, saving from having to charge them separately.. Maybe. Anthony Bouchard I don’t think this is inaccurate. 1 amp is not going to ruin your device’s battery, but besides the point, when NomadPlus is not being used as a battery, it allows the Apple charger to pass right through to the iPhone at its normal operating charge rate. Agneev Mukherjee I happen to own the old version of the wall plug, so I’m out of luck! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/87e9ec772826936f7d5efafebc08bd0f57ebe861f6100248599836c117079e17.jpg Whatya_know_joe I bought 2 of these about 3 years ago.

Happy New Year firework wallpapers The top stories of the week on iDB How to use AirPods like a pro   skip to main content skip to main menu     Have any Health information at a glance with HealthFace for Apple Watch By Steffen Reich, Dec 23, 2016 Tweet Leave a Comment The developer team at Crunchy Bagel has taken the wraps of HealthFace, a product designed to assist regulars of Apple’s Health app in monitoring their vital data on the fly. HealthFace is capable of reaching deep into your personal Health catalogue and displaying virtually any data point in form of a complication on your wrist. For users constrained to keeping a close eye on their vitals, food intake or other health related parameters, the app sets out to become a quasi extension of Apple’s Health app. Once downloaded to your iPhone and Apple Watch, HealthFace presents itself in a tidy and clear look closely resembling Apple’s own Watch app. This makes it all the more easy to find your feet and pick up the mechanisms of the app, which comprise of three simple steps to cook up the most detailed Health complications on watch possible to date: After launching the app on iPhone, HealthFace auto detects your current Watch faces and offers to create up to two Health complications per face wherever it applies (circular small and utilitarian large). Having selected the face and complication style, users have the absolute freedom to browse through any of Health’s rubrics (Activity, Nutrition, Body Measurements, Sleep, etc.) and peg a desired metric as a new complication for your wrist. What’s more is that said metric can be benchmarked against a target goal (e.g. sleep hours, maximum caffeine intake) and further calibrated in terms of date range, units, icons and more. As far as usability goes, WatchFace really excels because it does not boast unnecessarily complex layers within the app or anything one would regard as clutter. At the same time, it manages to offer a lot in the customizability department, which is not only slick but also absolutely crucial for users that have to painstakingly track certain items for medical reasons. In line with the theme of simplicity, the watch’s only purpose in the equation is to display the Health data set up on iPhone – a tap on the corner complication is not going to inflate or detail the icon’s information. Before jumping the gun and calling it plain though, consider this: a strong point of difference to other apps is the aforementioned ability to display two HealthFace complications on the same Watch face, which again can be imperative for people encouraged to watch more than one Health variable over the course of the day. At this point you should know whether or not you have a use case for HealthFace. It succeeds at bridging the existing gap between your Apple Watch and the Health app by providing a window for Watch into the deepest depths of your Health data. As we have come to know with Health, new data is either entered manually through Apple’s app or transmitted automatically if you own a smart health device (iHealth SmartGluco Monitoring, Smart Scales, Sleep Trackers). For $0.99, HealthFace is a solid client to relay any of that data in real-time from Health to your wrist. Availability HealthFace is compatible with iPhone, iPod touch and Apple Watch and requires iOS 10.0 and watchOS 3 or later. Find HealthFace for $0.99 in the App Store.

Tech titan's 74-page developer program agreement protects the right to distribute products performing similar functions as 'Licensed Applications' By Andrew J. Chapin • 12/23/16 8:00am Members of the media gather around a table displaying the new Apple MacBook Pro laptop after the product launch event on October 27, 2016 in Cupertino, California. Stephen Lam/Getty Images Ben Erez has a side hustle. His iPhone app, Breathe, is simple: it sends push notifications throughout the day to remind users to pause and take a breath. This mindfulness exercise has many benefits and, with few marketing resources, Erez has built a loyal audience from more than 11,000 downloads. In San Francisco, the land of tech titans and billion-dollar valuations, Breathe is the successful small startup that doesn’t grab the headlines. Until it did. Sort of. In June, publications, including Observer, covered an exciting Apple Watch feature that the company announced at their Worldwide Developer Conference. It is an app called Breathe that sends push notifications throughout the day to remind its users to pause and take a breath. Sound familiar?  Neither Erez or his co-founder Mohammed Islam were involved. In a shocking twist to their side-hustle tale, Apple’s announcement was about software they built in-house. David, meet Goliath. Erez describes being surprised at the announcement, and he wasn’t alone. “I got text messages from friends saying that Apple stole our idea.” Still, he spent the moments following the announcement celebrating validation: “The moment that you see that headline where Apple gives this feature primetime coverage, you realize that there’s really something there. It was also cool to see that these branding geniuses at Apple, with an unlimited budget, came up with the same name that I came up with, with nothing but time and my own thoughts.” The honeymoon feeling was brief. “Naturally, I started wondering if I was wronged.” Predictably, Apple’s 74-page developer program license agreement protects the company in these cases. Buried in section 14.4 on page 37 of this document that many have blindly accepted: “Nothing in this Agreement will impair Apple’s right to develop, acquire, license, market, promote, or distribute products or technologies that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Licensed Applications, Covered Products, or any other products or technologies that You may develop, produce, market, or distribute.” Section 14.4 on page 37 of Apple’s 74-page developer program license agreement. Apple One lawyer who works with a large number of tech startups told me that his “inclination is that there’s a strong case here.” In a non-scientific, quick survey of 15 startup founders at the Runway co-working space in San Francisco, all said they would take legal action. Another tech employee, who now works for Twitter, agrees: “True market potential is hard to find. That exists in a situation like this and a founder needs to protect that at all costs.” The same employee recalled his work at a startup that had raised more than $10 million dollars before launch. He said they never reached Breathe’s daily active user number. Following introspection, conversations with lawyers, time, and a lot of breathing, Erez made the decision not to pursue Apple for damages. His reason is uncomplicated: “We saw an increase in numbers. I don’t want to be a hypocrite and say they screwed us.” While he saw (his) Breathe’s traffic double and he has enjoyed sharing one of his passions with the world, Erez does have concerns about the precedent Apple’s behavior reinforces. There are difficult questions to be asked about developer abuse and whether stories like this will jeopardize the viability of Apple’s App Store ecosystem.  After all, this is not a one-time incident. There are dozens of app developers who have found themselves in a similar position, some who had as many as ten times the audience that Erez does with Breathe. There was F.lux, which Apple copied and integrated as Night Shade in iOS 10. There was Bump, which allowed the wireless transmission of files and documents, functionality available in iOS as Air Drop. There was Skitch, the online annotation tool that Apple copied and integrated in Mac OS X Yosemite. There were flashlight apps galore before Apple built their own. The Erez story isn’t one of an independent developer being wronged by Apple, it’s the story of Apple repeatedly ripping off their own developers. This is an issue of increasing importance, especially as Apple’s smartphone market share stagnates and competitors gain steam. Strong software is what awarded Apple the industry lead when they arrived on the smartphone scene in 2007. The iPhone App Store offered software that users had never dreamed of, with more than 10,000 releases by the end of 2008. This made the switch from smartphone standards like Blackberry a no-brainer. Apple’s App Store minted overnight millionaires (and billionaires) from ideas large and small, from the individual who released the number two paid app of 2008, a $0.99 Texas Hold’em release, to everybody’s favorite $66-billion transportation company, Uber. The past eight years have been a thrilling time for mobile developers but the enthusiasm for iOS appears to be fading. Apple allegedly helping itself to developer’s ideas can’t be helping. Andrew J.

Unsatisfactory yields for the foundry's 10nm process could disrupt the schedule.   TSMC reportedly will also manufacture Apple's A11 chips for use in the iPhone 8 with volume production scheduled to kick off in the second quarter of 2017, the sources said.   The problem with 10nm yields isn't restricted to TSMC. The report notes that Samsung is experiencing similar rampup problems. The lower yields have forced Samsung's customer Qualcomm to alter its product lineup for 2017.   Qualcomm originally planned for the Snapdragon 835 and other chips including the 660 (code-named 8976 Plus) to be built using Samsung's 10nm process, but now says it will scale that back so that only the 835-series will be made using the newer node technology.   Qualcomm will still have several 14nm chips including the Snapdragon 660-series slated for launch in 2017, the sources identified.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Just moments before, however, OBJ, the most emotional player in the league, had a meltdown a few feet outside the Giants locker room in the tunnel leading from the field. He stood facing a metal door with his helmet off and in full uniform. He was growling loudly and flexing his arms. He is such an intense player and such a competitor, but this was even a bit much for him. Team security came over and ushered him back towards the locker room. He was walked part way by Giants co-owner John Mara. Reporters were able to catch part of his outburst on their camera phones, leading Frank Mara, a team executive, to mutter, “Let’s make sure we tweet that one.” Inside the locker room following the 24-19 loss, I asked Beckham about his behavior in the tunnel. He looked the other way without answering. A few minutes later, I asked him if there was a reason he ignored my question. He ignored it again. Some Giants puzzled over questionable calls in loss to Eagles Odell Beckham let his emotions fly after Thursday's loss to the Eagles.  (Al Bello/Getty Images) Beckham was targeted 20 times by Eli Manning and caught 11 passes for 150 yards, but Philly kept him out of the end zone. “We had our own destiny in our hands,” he said. “We just didn’t come up with it.” The locker room was quiet. The Giants were looking to clinch their first playoff appearance since 2011, but now will have to wait at least until Saturday. They will still likely clinch the No. 1 wild-card spot and the No. 5 seed on Saturday if the Packers or Bucs lose or tie, the Falcons lose or the Lions lose to or tie the Cowboys on Monday night. But any slim hope they had of making up the two-game difference on the Cowboys in the NFC East is over. Dallas clinched the division and the NFC’s No. 1 seed with the Giants loss. Odell Beckham was growling to himself, losing it outside locker room. Team security & John Mara guided him into locker room eventually pic.twitter.com/ebdB8dH787— Pat Leonard (@PLeonardNYDN) December 23, 2016 The Giants will make it to the wild card round unless everything works against them the next 10 days, but they wanted to do the work on their own and celebrate in the locker room and on the bus ride home. They don’t want to back in. Ultimately, it doesn’t matter as long as they get in. In all likelihood, the last game of the regular season on New Year’s Day in Washington will be meaningless. Janoris Jenkins ruled out for Giants' game vs. Eagles But instead of relaxing on the holiday weekend, they will be scoreboard watching. “We came in here expecting to win and we didn’t get it done,” Olivier Vernon said. “That’s on us. The Eagles played good football and we just didn’t get the job done.” 22 photos view gallery From Kate Upton to Noah Syndergaard: The Sports Tweets of the Year On a night when nothing went right for Big Blue, Eli Manning couldn’t bail them out in the last couple of minutes as he had done so many times in his career, including two Super Bowls. He had a miserable game, tossing three interceptions, the first one a Pick-6 to put the Giants in a 14-0 hole in the first quarter and the last one when he couldn’t get anything on a throw to Will Tye, who didn’t come back and fight for the ball, and it was picked off at the Eagles 11 with five seconds left. John Jerry had a crucial false start on a fourth-and-1 at the Eagles’ 32 on the second to last drive after an instant replay reversal correctly took away a first down by Beckham. Jerry’s jump led to Manning throwing incomplete to Sterling Shepard, who didn’t draw a flag when it appeared he was interfered with on the play. Follow the Daily News Sports on Facebook. "Like" us here. Earlier, Eli Apple and Vernon were hit with roughing calls that added to a bad year all around by the officials. Apple tried to fall out of the way of Carson Wentz, who was sliding. Wentz’s helmet smacked into Apple’s chest and Apple was flagged. On the next play, Apple was beaten for a 40-yard TD by Nelson Agholor to give the Eagles a 21-6 lead in the second quarter. Olivier Vernon says Giants didn't play up to their expectations. (Rich Schultz/Getty Images) Vernon’s third quarter penalty didn’t cost the Giants any points, but it did cost them 15 yards. He had Wentz wrapped up and was in the process of taking him down. As Wentz was about to start falling, he threw the ball away. Vernon was called for roughing. It’s hard to say which call was worse: The one on Apple or Vernon. “My arms were around him and my face was at his back,” Vernon said. “I don’t know what they want me to do.” Either the NFL goes ahead and puts the quarterbacks in red jerseys or they start letting the defense play tackle football. Of course, if Cam Newton was watching, he had to be wondering when he will ever get one of these calls. 20 photos view gallery The Daily News' Best Back Pages of 2016 One play before his final interception, Manning tried to hit Beckham in the end zone. The ball sailed past him. But Beckham blamed himself for not catching up to it. “I just didn’t make the play,” he said. “It was out where it needed to be. I just needed a little more gas in me to go get it. When you get into that two-minute situation at the end of the game and you run a 30-yard route, you come back and run another 30-yard route and then you come back and try to get it again — I just didn’t have enough gas to go get it.” The Giants wasted an opportunity to clinch on their own and it hurt. “We wanted to come in here and take care of business,” Beckham said, “We didn’t do that. But it’s not the end of the season.” The Giants were still beating themselves up for losing this game. Nobody more than Beckham.  Tags: nfl new york giants philadelphia eagles nfl playoffs odell beckham jr. eli manning olivier vernon Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories, delivered to your inbox.

Back in February, a federal magistrate judge in the US District Court for the Central District of California issued an order requiring Apple to assist the FBI in obtaining encrypted data from an iPhone related to a 2015 shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. Apple resisted the order, but the FBI pursued a different method to access the data stored on the device. Nevertheless the case, and the heated rhetoric exchanged by parties on all sides, reignited a decades-old debate about government access to encrypted data. The group acknowledged the position of Apple and other entities as it explained the rationale for protecting encryption: Representatives of the national security community told the EWG that strong encryption is vital to the national defense and to securing vital assets, such as critical infrastructure. Civil society organizations highlighted the importance of encryption for individual privacy, freedom of speech, human rights, and protection against government intrusion at home and abroad. Private sector stakeholders—in particular, their information security officers—and members of the academic community approached the question from an engineering perspective—against a wide array of threats, foreign and domestic, encryption is one of the strongest cybersecurity tools available. However, the group also noted that encryption policy must address the legitimate concerns of the law enforcement and intelligence communities. “To be clear, the widespread adoption of encryption has had a profound impact on the law enforcement community,” the report noted. “Even with a lawful court order, even in dire circumstances, the authorities may not have access to encrypted data. To this end, Congress should explore proposals that have so far received little attention in the committees, but may offer valuable assistance to law enforcement agencies in a digital landscape where default strong encryption is ubiquitous.” Some ideas include collaboration between the law enforcement community and the technology sector, and information-sharing between different elements of the law enforcement community. “Public perception and recent tensions notwithstanding, there is already substantial cooperation between the private sector and law enforcement,” the report said. “Private company stakeholders demonstrated an ability to assist federal, state, and local agencies with access to information to the extent possible and with service of a lawful order, and expressed a willingness to explore ways to improve and enhance that collaboration.” Stakeholders from all sides were nearly unanimous in describing a significant gap in the technical knowledge and capabilities of the law enforcement community, particularly at the state and local levels. “This results in a range of negative consequences that not only hinder law enforcement’s ability to pursue investigations but also contribute to its tension with the technology community,” the report concluded. “For example, from the perspective of law enforcement, routine requests for data are often challenged by the companies, unnecessarily delayed, or simply go unanswered. From the perspective of the companies, these requests often lack appropriate legal process, are technically deficient, or are directed to the wrong company altogether.” The working group also noted that a Congressional mandate requiring companies to maintain exceptional access to data for law enforcement agencies would apply only to companies within the United States. “The consequences for such a policy may be profound, but they are not likely to prevent bad actors from using encryption,” the report stated. “Representatives of various private companies told the EWG that a mandate compromising encryption in the US technology sector would simply shift consumers to products offered by foreign companies. These forces might incentivize larger companies to leave the United States, and render small business and other innovators in the field obsolete.” Above all, the group warned against engendering a binary debate between law enforcement and private entities. “Encryption is inexorably tied to our national interests,” the report concluded. “It is a safeguard for our personal secrets and economic prosperity. It helps to prevent crime and protect national security. The widespread use of encryption technologies also complicates the missions of the law enforcement and intelligence communities. As described in this report, those complications cannot be ignored. This is the reality of modern society. We must strive to find common ground in our collective responsibility: to prevent crime, protect national security and provide the best possible conditions for peace and prosperity.” Photo © Den Rise Why Not Watch? 30 Jun 2016The Journey to GDPR: Your Guide to Data Protection Technology, Tools and Tips 17 Mar 2016Will Encryption Save Europe’s Privacy Plans? 8 Sep 2016In an Uncertain Era of Brexit and GDPR, What is the Best Approach for Protected Data Transfers? 28 Jul 2016Virtually Solving the Path to GDPR Compliance Related to This Story 2016 : Two Steps Forward, Three Steps Back Edge Computing & Security: Rethinking Compliance & Data Protection in a Mobile-First Environment Tor Slams Mass Hacking Amendments ICO Fines Nursing Home Over Data Breach Hack Hillary Clinton’s Email?

Charles Wenzelberg More On: new york giants Giants-Packers Part 3: Because this was too perfect not to happen How Ben McAdoo helped create the monster he must stop McAdoo stunned when asked if partiers would be punished Giants stars' crazy party with Bieber before playoffs begin PHILADELPHIA — Too bad the Giants weren’t playing Cam Newton here Thursday night. Eagles rookie Carson Wentz twice got the roughing call that an outraged Newton has pleaded for all season, and both controversial flags proved pivotal in a 24-19 loss to their NFC East rivals at Lincoln Financial Field. The setback kept the Giants’ bid for a playoff berth on hold for at least a couple of days and ended their long-shot hopes of a division title and the No. 1 seed, and Big Blue could point to the two iffy calls — and a seemingly glaring no-call — as big reasons. The no-call came on fourth down with 1:54 left, when rookie Sterling Shepard was seemingly manhandled by Eagles cornerback Nolan Carroll directly in front of an official but couldn’t draw a flag. The two roughing calls on the Giants, though, were much more controversial. The first roughing flag came late in the second quarter against rookie corner Eli Apple, who tried to pull up at the end of a Wentz first-down scramble to the Philadelphia 45-yard line and was hit with a late flag by referee Clete Blakeman’s crew. The penalty came despite Wentz appearing to initiate the contact on the play by falling into the chest of Apple. “I tried to let up, but the ref didn’t see it that way,” Apple said. “I didn’t try to hit him at all. You always want to make the play on defense, but it’s tough with quarterbacks.” Apple was obviously rattled by the penalty, and the Eagles didn’t waste any time taking advantage. On the very next play, wide receiver Nelson Agholor blew past Apple down the left sideline and corralled a 40-yard TD pass to give Philly a 21-6 lead. The second roughing call on Wentz wasn’t as easy for the Giants to dispute, but was no less controversial. After rallying to within 21-16 and forcing a third-and-long late in the third quarter, the Giants thought they had harassed Wentz into an incompletion near midfield when defensive end Olivier Vernon was flagged for driving Wentz into the ground at the end of the play. Replays showed Wentz still had the ball when Vernon left his feet to make the tackle, but Blakeman signed off on the flag because of the force of the hit at end of the play. There was indeed no disputing the violence of Vernon’s hit. Wentz was slow to get up and then sent off to go through the concussion protocol while being replaced by Chase Daniel. But Vernon defended his hit by saying he couldn’t see the ball at the time of the hit. “My arms were around him and my face was at his back, so I don’t know what they want me to do in that situation,” said Vernon, who added that he is steeling himself for “a hell of a fine” from the NFL. Asked what he could have done to change the situation, Vernon turned sarcastic. “I could have stopped in midair and reversed time,” he said. “That probably would have worked. I should have just stopped time, reversed him a little bit, then hit him at a different angle.” Despite the new life given to Philly by the second call, the Giants stuffed the Eagles on fourth-and-goal from the 1 at the end of that possession when Ryan Mathews was gang-tackled for a loss. But the flag on Vernon ended up costing the Giants almost four minutes that would have come in handy in the fourth quarter in a game ultimately decided by just five points. “It’s very disappointing,” Vernon said. “We came in here expecting to win and didn’t get it done, and that’s on us.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under carson wentz ,  new york giants ,  philadelphia eagles ,  sterling shepard Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Odell Beckham rues the one key play he couldn't make Read Next Odell Beckham rues the one key play he couldn't make Most Popular This Week 1 Science says these are the men who will make you orgasm 2 Mariah Carey closes 2016 with disastrous NYE performance 3 Massive 'anomaly' lurks beneath ice in Antarctica 4 How this home intruder got what he deserved 5 Obama’s ugly bid to snub voters and tie Trump’s hands 6 Debbie Reynolds rushed to the hospital Share Selection Columnists Mike Vaccaro Giants-Packers Part 3: Because this was too perfect not to happen Steve Serby How Ben McAdoo helped create the monster he must stop SEE ALL COLUMNISTS The Post Line NBA NCAAB NHL NCAAF NFL Monday Favorite Line Underdog CLEVELAND OFF (OFF) New Orleans MILWAUKEE 2 (211) Oklahoma City Utah 6½ (207½) BROOKLYN NEW YORK OFF (OFF) Orlando HOUSTON OFF (OFF) Washington Charlotte 1 (203) CHICAGO GOLDEN STATE 15 (227½) Denver LA CLIPPERS OFF (OFF) Phoenix Monday Favorite Line Underdog HOFSTRA 2½ William & Mary Northeastern 4 DREXEL OLD DOMINION 14½ North Texas Towson St 3½ JAMES MADISON UNC-WILMINGTON 13 Elon Rice 1½ CHARLOTTE FIU PK W Kentucky Marshall 5½ FAU Louisiana-Lafayette 2 UALR Coll.

Just moments before, however, OBJ, the most emotional player in the league, had a meltdown a few feet outside the Giants locker room in the tunnel leading from the field. He stood facing a metal door with his helmet off and in full uniform. He was growling loudly and flexing his arms. He is such an intense player and such a competitor, but this was even a bit much for him. Team security came over and ushered him back towards the locker room. He was walked part way by Giants co-owner John Mara. Reporters were able to catch part of his outburst on their camera phones, leading Frank Mara, a team executive, to mutter, “Let’s make sure we tweet that one.” Inside the locker room following the 24-19 loss, I asked Beckham about his behavior in the tunnel. He looked the other way without answering. A few minutes later, I asked him if there was a reason he ignored my question. He ignored it again. Some Giants puzzled over questionable calls in loss to Eagles Odell Beckham let his emotions fly after Thursday's loss to the Eagles.  (Al Bello/Getty Images) Beckham was targeted 20 times by Eli Manning and caught 11 passes for 150 yards, but Philly kept him out of the end zone. “We had our own destiny in our hands,” he said. “We just didn’t come up with it.” The locker room was quiet. The Giants were looking to clinch their first playoff appearance since 2011, but now will have to wait at least until Saturday. They will still likely clinch the No. 1 wild-card spot and the No. 5 seed on Saturday if the Packers or Bucs lose or tie, the Falcons lose or the Lions lose to or tie the Cowboys on Monday night. But any slim hope they had of making up the two-game difference on the Cowboys in the NFC East is over. Dallas clinched the division and the NFC’s No. 1 seed with the Giants loss. Odell Beckham was growling to himself, losing it outside locker room.

They don’t want to back in. Ultimately, it doesn’t matter as long as they get in. In all likelihood, the last game of the regular season on New Year’s Day in Washington will be meaningless. Janoris Jenkins ruled out for Giants' game vs. Eagles But instead of relaxing on the holiday weekend, they will be scoreboard watching. “We came in here expecting to win and we didn’t get it done,” Olivier Vernon said. “That’s on us. The Eagles played good football and we just didn’t get the job done.” 22 photos view gallery From Kate Upton to Noah Syndergaard: The Sports Tweets of the Year On a night when nothing went right for Big Blue, Eli Manning couldn’t bail them out in the last couple of minutes as he had done so many times in his career, including two Super Bowls. He had a miserable game, tossing three interceptions, the first one a Pick-6 to put the Giants in a 14-0 hole in the first quarter and the last one when he couldn’t get anything on a throw to Will Tye, who didn’t come back and fight for the ball, and it was picked off at the Eagles 11 with five seconds left. John Jerry had a crucial false start on a fourth-and-1 at the Eagles’ 32 on the second to last drive after an instant replay reversal correctly took away a first down by Beckham. Jerry’s jump led to Manning throwing incomplete to Sterling Shepard, who didn’t draw a flag when it appeared he was interfered with on the play. Follow the Daily News Sports on Facebook. "Like" us here. Earlier, Eli Apple and Vernon were hit with roughing calls that added to a bad year all around by the officials. Apple tried to fall out of the way of Carson Wentz, who was sliding. Wentz’s helmet smacked into Apple’s chest and Apple was flagged. On the next play, Apple was beaten for a 40-yard TD by Nelson Agholor to give the Eagles a 21-6 lead in the second quarter. Olivier Vernon says Giants didn't play up to their expectations. (Rich Schultz/Getty Images) Vernon’s third quarter penalty didn’t cost the Giants any points, but it did cost them 15 yards. He had Wentz wrapped up and was in the process of taking him down. As Wentz was about to start falling, he threw the ball away. Vernon was called for roughing. It’s hard to say which call was worse: The one on Apple or Vernon. “My arms were around him and my face was at his back,” Vernon said. “I don’t know what they want me to do.” Either the NFL goes ahead and puts the quarterbacks in red jerseys or they start letting the defense play tackle football. Of course, if Cam Newton was watching, he had to be wondering when he will ever get one of these calls. 20 photos view gallery The Daily News' Best Back Pages of 2016 One play before his final interception, Manning tried to hit Beckham in the end zone. The ball sailed past him. But Beckham blamed himself for not catching up to it. “I just didn’t make the play,” he said. “It was out where it needed to be. I just needed a little more gas in me to go get it. When you get into that two-minute situation at the end of the game and you run a 30-yard route, you come back and run another 30-yard route and then you come back and try to get it again — I just didn’t have enough gas to go get it.” The Giants wasted an opportunity to clinch on their own and it hurt. “We wanted to come in here and take care of business,” Beckham said, “We didn’t do that. But it’s not the end of the season.” The Giants were still beating themselves up for losing this game. Nobody more than Beckham.  Tags: nfl new york giants philadelphia eagles nfl playoffs odell beckham jr. eli manning olivier vernon Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories, delivered to your inbox.

She knows how nasty Eagles fans are because this is home. She knows how tough Lincoln Financial Field, and before it, the Vet, is for visiting players. And she knows that Eagles fans, especially around this time of year, are especially ornery. "These are the same people who booed Santa," Annie Apple wrote this week on SI.com. But instead of Santa, they booed her son Thursday night. Even if Eli Apple gave those angry Philly fans plenty to cheer about as the Giants failed to clinch the playoffs with a 24-19 loss. Odell Beckham freaks out near Giants’ locker room after loss "It's not a good feeling, ever," Eli Apple said of the loss. Eli Apple blows coverage and allows a touchdown to Nelson Agholor. (Michael Perez/AP) This was not the homecoming the Apples envisioned. The Giants' rookie was burned by both the refs and the Eagles in his first game back as a pro, a nightmarish set of events he won't soon forget, that contributed to the loss. Apple was born in Philly and grew up about 30 minutes outside the city. With Janoris Jenkins out with a back injury, he got the start at left corner, opposite Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. Apple grew up in the suburb of Voorhees, N.J., and played high school ball at Eastern Regional High School before going to Ohio State. He helped the Eagles build a 21-6 lead they would never relinquish. Eli Manning throws three picks in Giants' loss to Eagles He was first flagged for unnecessary roughness when his hand appeared to glance a sliding Carson Wentz at the tail end of a long run by the Eagles' QB. For what it's worth, the call was an awful one by the officials as Apple did everything he could to avoid making contact with Wentz. 22 photos view gallery From Kate Upton to Noah Syndergaard: The Sports Tweets of the Year "You're going full speed," Apple said. "It's tough." The penalty set the Eagles up with a first and 10 from the Giants 40.

Home Technology Pokemon Go for Apple Watch is finally here Pokemon Go for Apple Watch is finally here The wait of hatching eggs on the wrist is now over as Pokemon Go is finally available on Apple Watch. By: IANS | New York | Published: December 23, 2016 1:41 PM With Apple Watch and Pokemon GO integration, users can log each play session as a workout, with gameplay counting toward personal activity rings and receive notifications about nearby Pokemon. (Reuters) The wait of hatching eggs on the wrist is now over as Pokemon Go is finally available on Apple Watch. The announcement of the Apple Watch version of the game by the end of the year was made in September by US-based software company and developer of the gaming app Niantic. On Wednesday, the developers, in an official blog post, announced that the game is finally available. With Apple Watch and Pokemon GO integration, users can log each play session as a workout, with gameplay counting toward personal activity rings and receive notifications about nearby Pokemon. You may also like to watch this: Users can count distance toward hatching Pokemon Eggs and receiving Candy with their Buddy Pokemon. Once they encounter a Pokemon, they can catch it from their iPhone. “You can receive notifications about PokeStops nearby and collect items from them and receive notifications when Eggs hatch and medals are awarded,” the developers said. Recently, an email circulated through Reddit, supposedly sent by a Niantic customer service agent, claimed that the “port for the Apple Watch has been shelved” and that development had been stopped unless the demand increased. But the developers had denied the reports saying, “Development on Pokemon Go continues, as it has since before the Apple announcement. We will have more news on the product soon.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

Nokia's patent licence contract with Apple expires at the end of the year. This week, both sides have taken legal action - with Nokia accusing Apple of violating some technology patents and Apple complaining of being overcharged - suggesting a new deal will be hard to agree. Nokia filed further complaints against Apple on Thursday, saying it had now filed 40 patents suits in 11 countries covering technologies such as displays, software and chipsets. "Nokia has created or contributed to many of the fundamental technologies used in today's mobile devices, including Apple products. After several years of negotiations trying to reach agreement to cover Apple's use of these patents, we are now taking action to defend our rights", " Ilkka Rahnasto, head of Nokia patent business said in a statement. Patent royalties represent a sliver of Nokia's overall revenue, more than 90 percent of which comes from sales of telecoms network equipment. But the licensing payments are highly profitable at a time when the network business is suffering an industry-wide slump. "Nokia will likely be granted a better licence deal from Apple. But because of the dispute, it could take years to reach a new contract, and royalties will likely come (as) retrospective one-time payments," said Inderes analyst Mikael Rautanen, who has an "accumulate" rating on Nokia shares. Once the world's dominant cellphone maker, Nokia sold its handset business to Microsoft in 2014 and focused on its network business as well as a bulging portfolio of mobile device patents. Wells Fargo Securities analyst Maynard Um, who follows both companies, said the lawsuits were negative for Apple and Nokia due to litigation costs and uncertainty over the outcome. "The fact that this did not go to arbitration suggests, to us, that the two sides must be far apart in what each party wants," he wrote in a note to clients. "It appears (Apple) is not arguing the validity of the patents but, rather, the rate it deems fair," he said, adding Nokia could also "choose to file a suit with the International Trade Commission (ITC) to bar Apple from importing handsets into the U.S." Um rates both companies' shares as "market perform". Nokia's patents cover technology that reduces the need for hardware components in a phone, conserves battery life, increases radio reception, helps in recovering lost phones and enables voice recognition, among other features. The Finnish firm has forecast the run-rate of its patent and brand licensing sales will be about 950 million euros ($994 million) by the end of 2016, but that it will fall to about 800 million after the Apple deal expires, in the absence of a new one. Nokia's total sales in 2016 are expected to top 24 billion euros. Its shares in Helsinki closed at 4.5 euros, and are down some 30 percent since the start of 2016. In New York Nokia shares traded down 0.6 percent at 4.73 dollars.

Apple CEO Tim Cook introduces the new iPad Pro during an Apple media event in San Francisco, California, September 9, 2015. Reuters/Beck Diefenbach Raving about hit smartphone game Pokemon GO, Cook stressed that Apple is “high on [augmented reality] for the long-run” and investing heavily. Augmented reality, in which computer-generated content is overlaid on the real world, is one of the latest fixations in the technology business, with Pokemon GO among the first applications to catch on. Cook also highlighted Apple’s investment in artificial intelligence, which the company now uses to recommend content to users and even spot usage patterns to improve a device’s battery life. It was a small glimpse of the future from the notoriously secretive tech giant, which fiercely guards its product pipeline. But analysts said Cook must do more to show his cards as sales of the iPhone slow. Augmented reality and artificial intelligence are often regarded as an uneasy fit for Apple, a hardware maker that tends not to embrace new technology until it matures. And Apple’s habit of keeping quiet until it has a finished product to show – in contrast with rivals such as Google and Facebook FB.O, which iterate products in the open – doesn’t help, said analyst Bob O’Donnell of TECHnalysis Research. “They’re in this weird position where they want the world to know that they are working on it, but they have nothing to show for it,” he said. As rivals such as Google and Facebook double down on augmented reality, Apple has made no public display of its aptitude in the field. But Cook stressed that the company is hard at work behind the scenes. “We have been and continue to invest a lot in this,” Cook said. “We think there’s great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.” Apple has more to show for its efforts in artificial intelligence, where it was an early pioneer with its Siri digital assistant. But the company has been dogged by doubts that it has fallen behind rivals such as Amazon AMZN.O and Google and will be hard-pressed to catch up due to its strict privacy stance. “They are running behind, and they are trying to catch up both in perception but also in fact,” said Oren Etzioni, who is CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence and a professor at the University of Washington. Cook maintained that Apple had found a way to strike the balance between progressing in artificial intelligence and maintaining users’ privacy, detailing features in Apple’s latest operating system. “The deployment of artificial intelligence technology is something that we will excel at because of our focus on user experience,” he said. Ultimately, Cook argued, phenomena such as artificial intelligence and augmented reality will only reinforce the importance of the iPhone. He said the company was working to make sure its products worked well with third-party products like Pokemon Go. “That’s why you see so many iPhones in the wild right now chasing Pokemons,” he said.

PETALING JAYA: News on Malaysian alternative rock bank Estranged invited to perform at the Apple Music Christmas Festival in the UK, alongside names like Metallica and Radiohead, has turned out to be fake. An entertainment and lifestyle site, TheHive.Asia, reported that Estranged had apparently been conned by a Malaysian who represented herself as an Apple Inc publicity manager. A statement issued by Estranged’s lawyers to the site said the band had just discovered that the said Apple Music festival in London does not exist. The site identified by name the Malaysian woman who approached the band. It said at first the band was uncertain whether it should make the information public as it would affect its image. But the three-member band decided to make it public to ensure no other musicians fell prey to the same scam. “We have decided to make this information public in the interest of other innocent fellow musicians who are passionate about their music but are sometimes too gullible when it comes to business. “It is in our nature as musicians sometimes to be too trusting of people. “We have certainly paid a heavy price for this,” the band said, without stating whether any money was paid upfront to the woman. “We have decided to come out publicly because we understand that this con artist is now approaching other musicians. “We cannot in good conscience keep quiet and allow other musicians to fall prey to her.” The band mentioned that its manager had received a letter from the woman, complete with the signature purportedly by Apple Music director Adam TL Wilson, but it soon found out that the letter was forged. “We have been in touch with Apple in UK who have confirmed that she is a fraud. It is important that all people are alerted about this. “We are so affected by this event that there was a moment we considered breaking up and cancelling our upcoming tour starting from Kilang Bateri in Johor Bahru. “But we have decided to be strong for the sake of our fans and will continue with our musical journey with a stronger resolve to be the best that we can,” said Estranged.   Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

Ohio State had a good thing going with its cornerbacks. Lattimore had to go and ruin it. The Buckeyes had a three-year stretch where their No. 1 corner would get drafted, then the No. 2 corner would slide up and get drafted the following year. It's a corner assembly line: From Bradley Roby to Doran Grant to Eli Apple. Apple was supposed to lead to Gareon Conley, and then Conley to Lattimore. Now it looks like both Conley and Lattimore could leave for the NFL after this year. Lattimore was too good, too quick. Heading into the College Football Playoff, Lattimore also has to decide whether or not he's coming back next year or going to the NFL Draft, where's he widely projected as a first-rounder. "It's not hard at all, because I don't know if I'm going or not," Lattimore said. That he has a decision to make is slightly remarkable, because there was a time when you wondered if Lattimore would ever see the field. If you were told two years ago that Lattimore would go from Glenville to the NFL in three years, that would have made sense. He was one of the best players in the country. Of all the Cleveland players Ohio State signed in 2014 -- there were six -- Lattimore was the safe bet to have the fastest rise to stardom. Only he was hamstrung by hamstring injuries that took away his first two seasons. That story's been told. Now it's about how Lattimore has become one of five Cleveland starters on Ohio State's defense -- alongside a close friend from Glenville -- and positioned himself as one of the best corners in the country. How good? ESPN's Todd McShay had him pegged as the No. 5 overall pick in this spring's NFL Draft. Crazy. "From top to bottom I improved anything," Lattimore said. "Just getting faster, stronger, I improved everything." The Marshon Lattimore Profile Year, height, weight: Redshirt sophomore, 6-foot, 192 pounds How he got here: Lattimore was a top-50 national prospect according to some recruiting services when he signed with Ohio State in the 2014 recruiting class. He was one of three Glenville players to sign with the Buckeyes that year, and he's the first one to earn a starting job. Marcelys Jones left the program, and Erick Smith has a key role on special teams. What he's done: Earned a starting spot in the rotation with Gareon Conley and Denzel Ward. Lattimore had been held back by hamstring injuries during his first two seasons in Columbus. Now healthy, he's thriving with four interceptions and talk of being a first-round NFL Draft pick. 2016 stats: Lattimore leads all Ohio State cornerbacks with 38 tackles, and is tied for the team lead with nine pass break-ups. He's second on the team with four interceptions. Defensive tackle Dre'Mont Jones, linebackers Chris Worley and Jerome Baker, and cornerbacks Marshon Lattimore and Denzel Ward are the five Cleveland starters on Ohio State's defense.Rich Exner, cleveland.com Our Cleveland Tough series How Ohio State built a D on Northeast Ohio talent Jerome Baker took an unexpected role, became a star Denzel Ward too good to be left out of CB rotation Which Northeast Ohio Buckeyes are next up at OSU?

Join For Free As 2017 approaches, the major players in the space seem to be competing around a few common themes: artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and a focus on bringing high-end hardware in-house to showcase platform capabilities (the exception here is Apple, which has controlled its entire hardware line from the beginning). I dive into predictions for platform owners Apple, Google, and Microsoft. In a new addition this year, I added Snap, Inc., which has proven to have larger ambitions beyond ephemeral image sharing. Apple Next year is the tenth anniversary of the iPhone, and I suspect Apple has big things in store. Rumors are already swirling on features and functions, but it’s likely we’ll see an OLED display. This will improve battery life since they don’t require a backlight, as well as allow for greater contrast. In addition, they will most likely change the naming scheme to celebrate the anniversary of the iPhone, perhaps calling it the iPhone 10. Finally, Apple may decide to make its iPhone and iPad displays “edge-to-edge” where the glass takes up the majority of the front of the device. I cannot resist my temptation to bring up Apple’s lack of investments thus far in VR. Based on Tim Cook’s public comments, it seems that Apple is more focused on AR. Perhaps 2017 will bring announcements in that area. The W1 chip in the new AirPods is an impressive piece of tech and could pave the way for future Apple IoT devices. Another obvious move for Apple in the IoT space is to release a smart home speaker competitor to the Google Home and Amazon Echo. The speaker would leverage Siri for voice commands and HomeKit to interact with other devices. Google I believe we are seeing a two-pronged approach from Google: invest and leverage their leading AI capabilities on the software side and move hardware in-house to streamline the experience. Recently Google has ramped up its hardware efforts with Google Home, Daydream View VR, Pixel Phones, Google WiFi, and new versions of Chromecast. A great example of this dual approach is the Google Assistant, an upgrade from Google Now capable of two-way conversations. The Assistant was included in the Google Home and Pixel devices. In 2017, expect to see the Google Assistant pushed out to a broader set of Android devices and new integrations into third-party services. We should also see updated versions of these new hardware devices. Will there be a brand new type of hardware device announced? It’s doubtful given the new full lineup just announced this past October, but a prime contender would be Nest. They released an outdoor camera this past summer but have yet to expand beyond their Thermostat, Smoke Detector, and Camera offerings. Finally, one last rumor worth mentioning is Andromeda. This is the rumored codename for a new OS from Google that combines Android and Chrome OS (or rather, it brings Chrome OS features into Android). This would serve to replace Chrome OS. The idea would be to have a unified platform, similar to Microsoft’s efforts with Windows 10. The cloud-centric features of Chrome OS are interesting and could mean Google is looking to make it easier to carry your digital identity across a plethora of devices. Rumors incorrectly suggested an Andromeda announcement during Google’s October event so perhaps we’ll see an announcement in 2017. Microsoft 2017 is a critical year for Microsoft. They have failed in the phone market with less than 1% market share, took a $7.6 billion writedown on their Nokia acquisition, and laid off thousands of employees. It also looks like they will discontinue the Lumia brand. On the flipside, they have found success with their Surface brand, especially the Surface Pro. Most expect Microsoft to introduce a Surface Phone in 2017. Microsoft’s Continuum product makes this especially interesting since your phone becomes your mobile desktop capable of connecting to a larger monitor and input devices like a mouse and keyboard. It’s not clear where Microsoft goes in the smartphone market from here if the Surface Phone fails. They will, of course, continue to develop apps and services that work on iOS and Android. However, the lack of a smartphone footprint pigeonholes them in the productivity and business side of the market — lucrative, yes, but something that leaves them vulnerable to a competitor with mass hardware and software adoption on the consumer side. Although Microsoft has yet to see adoption in the smartphone market, they are also trying to leapfrog it entirely with their investments in the Hololens. If this type of wearable is the future of computing (and telecommunications), then they will be well positioned for the future. Snap We’re seeing initial hype and traction from Snap, Inc. and their Spectacles product. 2017 should bring wider distribution of the video recording sunglasses. The product is currently not integrating into Snapchat’s other augmented reality features (“lenses” for faces and “world lenses”) but expect this to change. It’s unlikely that 2017 will bring a version of Spectacles that overlays these in real-time on the glasses themselves (à la Magic Leap). I think what’s important is that Snap is starting with a simple use case and training consumers to use connected tech wearables. This change in consumer behavior and simple use case is what really hurt the rollout of Google Glass, which never made it beyond the very early adopter stage for consumers. This should benefit the broader industry as wearable computing moves mainstream. Conclusion As artificial intelligence platforms open up and investments continue in wearable computing, we’re just scratching the surface of these brand new technologies. 2017 should be an exciting year!

MacBook Pro delivers on speed and design – for a price First look: The 13-in MacBook Pro's Touch Bar wows I’m going to say no to the new MacBook Pro Video Google Photos tips and tricks Online reviews are a dime a dozen these days, but few outlets so thoroughly test new products as Consumer Reports. That is why it is a big deal that the magazine has denied its coveted "recommended" rating to Apple's newest MacBook Pro lineup. And the devices have failed the Consumer Reports tests for one very specific reason. In IT Blogwatch, we are charged and ready to go.   So what is going on? Kif Leswing has the background: Consumer Reports...says Apple's new MacBook Pros have problems with consistent battery life...As a result, Apple's latest laptops are the first...not to receive a "recommended" rating. ... Apple's latest batch of laptops...have had reports of inconsistent battery life since they were released...It's unusual because Apple was well-known in the past for underpromising...battery life. How does Consumer Reports come to its conclusions? Luckily, they gave us a rundown of the process. Mikey Campbell shares the details: Consumer Reports ran a series of tests on samples of...a 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar. Battery...performance was scattered across the board for each machine. ... The 13-inch model with Touch Bar...ran for 16 hours, 12.75 hours and 3.75 hours in three consecutive tests. Apple's 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar fared...slightly better, running for 19.5 hours in one test only to die in 4.5 hours...the next. Battery life for the...15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar vacillated from 18.5 hours to 8 hours. And how exactly did those big swings in battery life affect the Consumer Reports recommendation? Juli Clover fills us in: Consumer Reports says...a laptop's battery generally varies by less than five percent from test to test, but because of the "disparate figures" found in the MacBook Pro...an average battery life...could not be determined. ... For that reason, Consumer Reports used the lowest battery score, which prevented the MacBook Pro from getting a recommendation. Do these battery problems come as any surprise? Not really. Ina Fried is in the know: In a...software update, Apple removed...a clock icon that showed an estimate of remaining battery time amid complaints the figures varied widely from actual battery life...Apple...told the [Consumer Reports] that customers with concerns should contact Apple’s customer support. ... The battery issues are among several complaints users have...over the new design...the other chief complaint being the lack of different ports...resulting in the need to use an adapter or dongle to connect everything from an iPhone to a flash drive. So did the CR testing come up with anything else interesting? Consumer Reports' Jerry Beilinson had one more thing to add: Once our official testing was done, we experimented by conducting the same battery tests using a Chrome browser, rather than Safari...we ran two trials on each of the laptops, and found battery life to be consistently high on all six runs. That’s not enough data for us to draw a conclusion, and...a test using Chrome wouldn’t affect our ratings, since we only use the default browser to calculate our scores for all laptops. But it’s something that a MacBook Pro owner might choose to try. Anything else? Bob Liles has one more question: Does anyone read Consumer Reports anymore?

That in itself didn’t strike me as too odd. Different users have definitely been reporting very variable results in times of battery life, and some of them have been well below half the ten hours that Apple claims. Our video rundown showed as much and our poll found that the largest group of readers was reporting five hours or less. Given that Consumer Reports was seeing as little as 3.75 hours in its own tests, that would be good enough reason to withhold a recommendation. But it was the high-end results the organization reported that puzzle me … In a series of three consecutive tests, the 13-inch model with the Touch Bar ran for 16 hours in the first trial, 12.75 hours in the second, and just 3.75 hours in the third. The 13-inch model without the Touch Bar worked for 19.5 hours in one trial but only 4.5 hours in the next. And the numbers for the 15-inch laptop ranged from 18.5 down to 8 hours.  The numbers in bold are our emphasis, and it’s these numbers I can’t understand. Apple’s own estimates are certainly close to ideal conditions, and yet the company claims only ten hours while Consumer Reports lists 16, 18.5 and 19.5 hours among its results. I literally haven’t heard a single other report getting anywhere remotely close to these numbers. I don’t know if it could last that long with only the screen on. The organization is a highly credible one with a careful, scientific testing regimen, right down to measuring screen brightness with an external meter. During the tests, we set each laptop screen to remain on. We use an external meter to set the display brightness to 100 nits—a typical level you might use indoors or out. And, we turn off any automatic brightness adjustment in the laptop’s settings. We also update every computer’s operating system before we begin any testing. We began our tests several weeks ago, but repeated the battery tests using macOS Sierra 10.12.2 after it was released. We saw no difference in the results. From that description, it’s hard to see what could explain both the variability reported and the incredibly high maximum numbers. But the numbers seem so hard to believe, I have to think that something must have gone wrong. Given the source, I think we can immediately dismiss schoolboy errors like allowing the screens to auto-dim or even letting the machines go to sleep. But perhaps non-human error is to blame? One possibility is that the meter used to measure screen brightness was faulty. If it was giving inconsistent readings, that could explain the variability, and if it was greatly over-reading brightness in some tests, that could result in the brightness being set to extremely low levels and thus explain the extremely long battery-life reported in some test. If the brightness was set to a really low level, you would have expected the testers to notice this visually and to question the meter readings, but it’s not unknown for people to believe numbers from a machine over the evidence from their own eyes. A second possibility is that the app auto-opening the webpages failed, or even that the timing app failed to register the correct times. Those might seem unlikely events, but I really cannot see any way the high figures can be correct. Consumer Reports has sent the test logs to Apple, so perhaps the mystery will be explained. In the meantime, I’ve suggested that it re-run the tests with a fresh brightness meter to see whether the same high-end numbers are still achieved. We’ll update with any response. Update: Apple says it is looking into it.

TSMC has reportedly obtained 10nm chip orders from Apple, HiSilicon and MediaTek, with volume production set to kick off in the first quarter of 2017. Nevertheless, yield rates for TSMC’s 10nm process technology are not what the foundry expected, the sources said. TSMC is scheduled to start making Apple’s A10X chips for the next-generation iPad series slated for launch in March 2017. Unsatisfactory yields for the foundry’s 10nm process could disrupt the schedule, the sources indicated … Digitimes tends to publish absolutely everything it hears, so its reports always have to be taken with a sizeable pinch of salt. Even if the reports of lower-than-expected yields are accurate, there’s time to identify and resolve the problems prior to A10X production. In the worst of cases, it seems likely that TSMC might prioritize its highest-profile customer over other clients, so even continuing low yields may not impact iPad production. Then there are also other foundries, though Samsung would seem highly unlikely at this point. Apple has recently warmed up to Intel however.  The challenge of creating such densely-packed chips is, however, substantial. The same source reports that Samsung is also seeing low yields, promoting Qualcomm to grow less ambitious in its own plans, so the underlying claim – that yields are so far low – is a credible one. There have been multiple reports that Apple plans to rejig its iPad line-up in early 2017, introducing a new 10.5-inch(ish) machine specifically targeting the enterprise and education sectors. One suggestion is that the existing 9.7-inch line would continue but be pushed downmarket, while the 10.5-inch machine would be the Pro model – alongside the existing 12.9-inch one. A KGI report said that Apple will be sticking with its IPS LCD screens next year, OLED making it into only one iPhone model. 2018 iPads would then feature OLED displays, KGI says.

Despite all the positives associated with the election of Donald Trump, the market is expensive, and investors need to be very selective in the stocks they buy for the new year. One area that should remain solid is technology, and sticking with the large-cap leaders may be the best play. A new RBC research report includes the firm’s top picks for technology, and, like many we cover on Wall Street, RBC seems to favor the large-cap companies. Valuations remain compelling, and new avenues for sales and profitability, especially for the semiconductor leaders, look wide open. Here are the five large-cap tech picks from RBC for 2017. Apple This technology giant has had a rough year, still down over 10% from highs posted in the summer of 2015, in a market making new highs. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984, and it is among the leaders in the world in innovation with the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Apple’s four software platforms — iOS, OS X, watchOS and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services, including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. Apple shares should end the year higher, but volatility has crept into the stock. Analysts note that the latest iPhones performed much better than the prior model, and there is big consumer interest in iPhone 8. They also stress that the company remains committed to its capital allocation program, and RBC sees the possibility for not only an increase in the dividend but continued share buybacks. RBC cited last month the company’s gigantic cash position: The main benefit here would come from lower taxes and more so the cash repatriation given Apple’s $230 billion+ cash reserve, 90%+ of which is offshore. Both Trump and Congress have indicated they want to lower the tax rate on repatriating cash to the United States, with some seeing the rated dropped to as low as 8% to 10%. Apple investors receive a 1.95% dividend. The RBC price target for the stock is $125, but the Wall Street consensus target is $131.96. The stock closed trading on Thursday at $116.29. Broadcom This stock has been on a roll this year and is expected to trade even higher. Broadcom Ltd. (NASDAQ: AVGO) is a leading designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of analog and digital semiconductor connectivity solutions. Its extensive product portfolio serves four primary end markets: wired infrastructure, wireless communications, enterprise storage and industrial and other. Applications for the company’s products in these end markets include data center networking, home connectivity, broadband access, telecommunications equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems and displays. The company produces radio frequency (RF) front-end for LTE-enabled Apple products. Wall Street estimates that the company does 15% of its total business with Apple. Top Wall Street analysts like the leadership in the mobile, data center and broadband markets, and especially in the RF arena. Many on Wall Street see a cyclical rebound in industrial and communications demand. In regards to the company’s recent acquisition, RBC noted: We think the Brocade acquisition could be materially accretive to Broadcom earnings-per-share once the deal closes in late 2017. While purchase accounting rules, acquisition and restructuring costs, and potential divestitures could muddle Brocade’s contribution to Broadcom during the first year post-deal close, on a normalized run-rate basis, we estimate that Brocade would contribute $1.40+ to AVGO EPS in calendar year 2018 estimated when the $250M in run-rate synergies are fully achieved, resulting in ~10% accretion to our current EPS Estimates. Shareholders receive a 2.26% dividend. The $200 RBC price target is lower than the consensus target of $211.68. Shares closed yesterday at $180.60.

Networking | 22 Dec 2016 | Print  | Comment (5) Investigating ChronoSync 4.7 for Cloud Backup by Glenn Fleishman Some Mac users remember Apple’s Backup app more fondly than it deserves because nothing quite took its place. Although it was never a good backup app, Backup went through several versions, and in its best-remembered incarnation, it could selectively copy files from your Mac to a MobileMe iDisk, a Finder-mountable version of what would later be called “cloud storage.” iCloud eliminated the Backup app’s iDisk option, and iCloud Drive took years to materialize after that, but only for general file storage. Time Machine filled the gap for local backups but has never offered a cloud-based option. Independent cloud backup options, like Backblaze and CrashPlan, back up your data for a recurring fee. (CrashPlan can also perform local and LAN-based backups.) The nominal successor to Apple’s Backup app may be the 4.7 release of Econ Technologies’ ChronoSync, a long-standing Mac app that offers on-demand and scheduled synchronization and backup. We at TidBITS were excited to see ChronoSync add options to use Amazon’s Simple Storage System (S3) and Google Cloud Storage as sources or destinations. ChronoSync 4.7 also added support for SFTP (Secure FTP), which gives you even more remote file storage options. ChronoSync has a bazillion options, and we generally like how it works. We also like that the $50 price includes lifetime updates (better yet, TidBITS members receive 20 percent off!). In this article, I’ll offer just an overview of ChronoSync’s features, as it would require a book to explore them at any depth. Instead, I focus specifically on whether ChronoSync can serve as an effective offsite backup system. Because of ChronoSync’s extreme flexibility and the complexity of understanding and setting up cloud storage services, the discussion below gets quite involved. The executive summary is that ChronoSync is a great option for those who need the ultimate control over offsite backup, but ends up being more expensive and slower than dedicated cloud backup services. (If you’re looking for more general information about backup strategies and software, consult Joe Kissell’s “Backing Up Your Mac: A Joe On Tech Guide, Second Edition,” which is updated for macOS 10.12 Sierra.) ChronoSync’s Endless Bucket of Options -- Let’s just say that ChronoSync is, uh, feature rich, and Econ Technologies keeps adding features. The app’s primary function is to copy files for synchronization, mirroring, bootable volume cloning, archiving, and backing up. ChronoSync can work with mounted drives, networked volumes, and even with iOS using an additional app. To use it, you create either a “Synchronizer,” which specifies a pair of locations between which to move data, or a “Container,” in which you can group multiple Synchronizers for scheduling and other behavior. Most of the action happens in the Setup view of a Synchronizer window, which is where you specify a source and a destination target. From the Operation dropdown menu, you can set a one-way copy or a bidirectional sync. ChronoSync tries to be as flexible (and international) as possible about identifying the source and destination with one-way operations. It uses tabs above the left and right sides of the operation to help you see how data will flow from one place to another. The tab labels reflect the direction of the operation you selected. For instance, if you choose Backup Left-to-Right from the Operation pop-up menu, the left tab reads Source Target and the right side reads Destination Target. Choose Backup Right-to-Left (because that direction makes more sense to you, or you’ve decided to swap which target is the master), and the tab labels update to reflect that. You can click a tab to customize its name, too, if you want to identify it even more precisely, like “Home Computer” and “Work Computer” or “Updated Local Copy” and “Synced Remote Copy.” The third major option in the Operation menu is Synchronize Bidirectional, which lets you keep two targets up to date with each other. That’s highly useful when you or other people are making changes to a shared set of files. Say a group is working on a project in multiple locations, or you work on the same material at home and work or on a desktop and laptop. You want to sync the files in all locations, no matter where the updates occurred. If files are modified on both targets when a sync takes place, ChronoSync warns about conflicts and lets you resolve them. (Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and other file-sharing services offer smoother continuous multi-location file updating, but when you use a service you’re syncing your data through their servers, which is a point of weakness. Also, these services charge recurring fees for each user who stores more than a few gigabytes, whereas you can use ChronoSync’s Synchronize Bidirectional option with your own servers, which are either free or an already sunk cost.) Bidirectional syncing is easy to understand, but one-way copying involves more complexity: Backup: ChronoSync copies files found on the source and not present on the destination, but doesn’t delete files on the destination that are missing from the source. It also copies any changed files so as to make the destination versions identical. Blind Backup: Same as Backup, except that if a file present on the source is deleted or modified and the source file remains unchanged, the destination file (or absence thereof) will remain. (Yeah, it’s confusing; you’ll know if you need it.) Mirror: Same as Backup, except that files modified on the destination are replaced with the corresponding source files, whether or not the source files have been changed. And, importantly, any files on the destination that aren’t present on the source get deleted. Bootable: Clones the source volume to the destination volume as a bootable drive. This option works only with volumes, not folders. Bootable Mirror: Same as Bootable, except the app overwrites files modified on the destination with the source version, and deletes files from the destination not present on the source. Underneath the Operation pop-up menu, you can select the Synchronize Deletions checkbox. It’s a squirrelly option: if you delete a file from the destination, ChronoSync then deletes that file from the origin, a kind of reverse sync. Most people won’t touch this, but it’s there if you need it. Also available underneath Operations is the Archive Replaced Files checkbox, which stows replaced files in a special folder. The Options view in a Synchronizer lets you control archive options, such as how many versions to maintain and for how long. The Archive view displays older and removed files, and enables you to restore them in a variety of ways. ChronoSync’s Analyze view helps you make sense of all this. It effectively previews what will happen when you run the operation you defined with all its many options. You can also use it to override what happens, including resolving conflicts and excluding items. If you don’t want to include all the subfolders in a path that you chose, you can work in the Analyze tab to right-click the folder and choose Exclude for many operations. You can also set up guidelines in the Rules view to exclude folders, file types, and any number of other elements. To give you a sense of how deep ChronoSync is, the Rules view has Simple, Intermediate, and Advanced methods of creating these matching tests. For a remote backup, you’ll choose one of the Mirror options, select Archive Replaced Files, and leave Synchronize Deletions unchecked. That’s because, for a remote backup, rather than a remote working copy, it’s unlikely that you would ever intentionally modify the destination or want files to remain in the same location in the destination after you’d deleted them from the source. The Archive option would help you recover deleted files. That, in combination with a local Time Machine backup, would provide the most flexibility. The last piece of the puzzle is scheduling, which you can set for an individual Synchronizer. However, you may want to back up several locations or drives, each with separate options. For that, you’d create a Container, and then schedule it. It’s simple to set up and explained well in ChronoSync’s documentation. As with everything else in ChronoSync, there are oodles of tweaky scheduling options. For most people, the simplest approach will be to choose a Daily or Weekly recurring basis from the Run menu and then specify the best time to start it. You can add multiple schedules for the same Synchronizer or Container, and even trigger them based on events, such as when a volume mounts on your system. That’s great for when you plug in a drive you carry around, and you want ChronoSync to back it up or bring it in sync immediately and automatically. With those basics covered — and, believe me, I’ve just scratched ChronoSync’s surface — let’s move on to remote data destinations, which is what’s new in version 4.7. Comparing with Cloud Backup Services -- I started writing this article because I wanted to see if you could use ChronoSync to set up a recurring off-site hosted backup with encryption that was fully under your control. ChronoSync 4.7 now lets you use as a destination Amazon S3 (part of Amazon Web Services) or Google Cloud Storage (part of Google Cloud Platform), which charge by usage and transfers. You can also use SFTP (Secure FTP), which lets you create an encrypted connection to any SFTP server to which you have access. I wanted to compare ChronoSync’s new capability with cloud-based backup services, which have millions of users because they let you back up an unlimited amount of data from one or more computers for a flat monthly or annual rate. For instance, for a single computer, Backblaze charges $5 per month, $50 per year, or $95 for two years with no limit on the amount of data you can store. Restoring online is free; you can pay $99 to get your files back on a 128 GB flash drive or $189 for a 4 TB hard drive. Cloud backup services also track file version changes, and include those backup versions as part of the unlimited price. Cloud-hosted backup services also offer a variety of encryption options, with CrashPlan and SpiderOak among the leaders for Mac users in letting users own and control all the encryption pieces. Backblaze is a bit behind them in some aspects, but also allows user “ownership” of keys. (See my PCWorld article, “The best online backup service for securely encrypting your data,” for details.) Fortunately, with both Amazon and Google, you can specify an encryption key and have the server perform cryptographic scrambling without storing the key. It’s a reasonable compromise that keeps most control in your hand: the files are encrypted at rest and the encryption key isn’t stored with them or held by the cloud provider. Amazon and Google both offer extensive information about how this works. ChronoSync lets you enter any key you choose in the appropriate connection field, and it generates the correct format for the services. (You could also use local encryption, such as encrypted sparse bundle disk images, and just sync the disk image bundle elements, but that can consume a lot more bandwidth and has other drawbacks when restoring files.) I’ll walk through Amazon’s storage offerings first; Google’s are broadly similar, so I won’t need to repeat much of the information you learn from Amazon. One bit of nomenclature: cloud storage like this is designed around what Amazon called “buckets,” and everyone else has followed suit. A bucket is a uniquely named directory across the entire cloud infrastructure: no two buckets owned by anyone, anywhere, can have the same name. Buckets can be assigned to a set of data centers (called a “region,” and geographically defined) or a cloud service can locate it wherever it wants — it doesn’t matter. Depending on the cloud platform, buckets also can be set to use a particular tier of storage, described below; have individual items marked as a specific kind of tier, regardless of the overall bucket’s tier; or have rules applied that shift items from one tier to another. Econ Technologies has published excellent guides to setting up an account with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform, including how to create and configure buckets. That’s great, since the process isn’t trivial. Amazon S3 offers three kinds of storage, which correspond to how rapidly you need to retrieve the data: Standard, Standard–Infrequent Access, and Glacier. (A fourth kind, Reduced Redundancy, has a higher potential failure rate and isn’t appropriate for backups and archives. It’s meant for “easily reproduced” or temporary data.) All three types have the same high level of “durability,” a measure of the likelihood that data will be lost. This durability stems from Amazon replicating all your data across multiple geographically dispersed data centers. The difference in storage types, and thus cost, is how frequently and quickly you need to retrieve data. Standard promises that no more than 1 out of 10,000 file requests will fail, meaning a file request would need to be retrieved again, often as an automatic retry. Infrequent Access drops that to 1 in 1,000, which is great for backups. Glacier is for archival storage you rarely need, and it takes around 4 hours to initiate a request to retrieve files, which are moved to temporary normal S3 storage. You’ll pay a vastly different price for each. In three of four U.S. regions (Oregon, Ohio, and North Virginia), you pay $0.023 per GB per month for stored data with Standard, $0.0125 for Infrequent Access, and $0.004 with Glacier. The price is slightly higher for the Northern California region and in global regions except South America. (Amazon dropped its prices by double-digit percentages in December 2016; cloud prices regularly drop by large amounts.) Amazon charges nothing for uploaded data, but you’ll pay $0.09 per GB for downloads for Standard from U.S. and European data centers, and more from other data centers. For Infrequent Access, the download cost adds $0.01 per GB to regular retrieval prices from any of Amazon’s regions, making it $0.10 per GB at best. There’s also a tiny charge related to each request to upload or retrieve files, charged per 1,000 requests. If you’re uploading one million small files from a Mac, you could wind up paying $5 for Standard or $10 for Infrequent Access ($0.005 per 1,000 and $0.01 per 1,000, respectively). You can set up Infrequent Access as an option when you configure Amazon S3 as a ChronoSync target, after which each item you sync is written using that class of storage and inherits that pricing. ChronoSync can’t write directly to Glacier as such: you have to set up an archive rule within the Amazon Web Services Console on the Web. That sounds complicated, but it’s really just a couple of clicks. And ChronoSync can’t retrieve files from Glacier, either. You have to use the console for that — again, it sounds complicated, but the Console can help guide you through it. Glacier used to have complexities around the cost of retrieving data, because it was based on how much data you have stored. There was even a horror story, in which someone almost racked up vast retrieval fees. Fortunately, Amazon radically simplified this recently, and there are now three tiers of retrieval cost by how quickly Amazon processes your requests. You pay a retrieval fee that can be as little as $0.0025 per GB — that’s just $2.50 per TB — if you can wait from 5 to 12 hours for the retrieval to start. You then pay the regular download rate ($0.09 per GB) to retrieve the data from a temporary storage location within S3. Amazon throws in 10 GB of free Glacier retrieval per month. There’s a lot more detail about using Glacier in a cost-effective manner, including uploading files as ZIP archives or in other monolithic archive formats, found in the Glacier FAQ. To store 200 GB of data in Amazon S3’s cheapest regions, you would pay $4.60, $2.50, and $0.80 per month for Standard, Infrequent Access, and Glacier. That’s just for ongoing storage — retrieving all that data from Standard would cost $18.00, $20.00 from Infrequent Access, and $18.50 ($0.50 for retrieval and $18.00 for the download) at Glacier’s slowest retrieval rate. There would be a bit more of a charge for all the file requests, which could be from a few cents to a few dollars for a large number of files. Excluding storage space used for archived versions, the 1.3 TB of files backed up from my main office Mac would cost me $29.90, $16.25, and $5.20 per month and $117.00, $130.00, and $120.25 to retrieve plus the file request fees. Google offers three kinds of storage that make sense for backups: Multi-Regional, Nearline, and Coldline. Rates listed are for most of the world; it’s slightly more expensive to use Google’s Asia-oriented data centers in Japan and to retrieve Multi-Regional data in China and Australia. These tiers work as follows: Multi-Regional is like Amazon Standard, intended for high-intensity use and not backups unless you’re concerned about having immediate access. (Google also offers Regional and Durable Reduced Availability flavors that have drawbacks similar to Amazon’s Reduced Redundancy tier.) Multi-Regional costs $0.026 per GB for storage; retrieval is $0.12 per GB. Nearline is like Amazon Infrequent Access except that it’s slightly cheaper for storage and slightly more expensive for retrieval. In most regions, it costs $0.01 per GB for storage, but you pay $0.13 per GB for retrieval (as with Amazon, that’s $0.01 above the Multi-Regional retrieval price). Coldline resembles Glacier but has instant retrieval. It’s super cheap for storage, like Glacier, but costs more for interacting with storage and retrieving files. You’ll pay $0.007 per GB for storage and an additional $0.05 per GB over Multi-Regional ($0.17 per GB generally) to retrieve data from most regions. Unlike Glacier, there’s no delay in retrieving Coldline files. Coldline is intended for an inexpensive extra backup of huge amounts of vital data — a kind of last resort, given the costs of retrieval. Google charges similar per-operation prices for uploading or retrieving files, too. To store 200 GB of data in Google Cloud Storage, using the cheapest regions, it would cost $5.20, $2.00, and $1.40 per month for Multi-Regional, Nearline, and Coldline, respectively. Restoring 200 GB would cost $24.00, $26.00, and $34.00, plus the small per-operation fees. For storage, my 1.3 TB of files would run me, in the same order, $33.80, $20.00, and $9.10 per month; for retrieval, $156.00, $169.00, and $221.00. All that is the long way around to say that, Backblaze’s $5 per computer per month fee is almost always low relative to the cost of storage for all but the Glacier/Coldline tiers of Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage, and super low relative to retrieval costs for any significant amount of data. In short, if you’re interested in using ChronoSync as your offsite backup solution, it won’t be for cost reasons unless Glacier suits perfectly for long-term storage and rare retrievals of subsets of data. (By the way, Backblaze offers a cloud file-storage service called B2 with flat-rate $0.005 per GB upload and $0.05 per GB retrieval fees, plus $0.004 per 1,000 requests of any kind. That’s $1 per month for my 200 GB comparison and $6.50 per month for 1.3 TB — cheaper than both Amazon and Google’s cold storage offerings. ChronoSync doesn’t yet support B2, but it’s available for use via the file-transfer app Cyberduck.) What about SFTP? -- You could also consider backing up your data with ChronoSync via SFTP, where you control even more of your data ownership and encryption options, because you have to own or lease a server on the other end of the connection. Because you’re running that server or are paying a firm to do so, you don’t get the redundancy, data-center security, and built-in encryption that comes part and parcel with using Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage. These kinds of generic servers you can reach via SFTP don’t have data encryption for data at rest built in by default. You’d have to run additional software on the server to encrypt incoming files; otherwise, anyone who could log into your server could potentially read all your data. This limitation makes SFTP most useful as DIY option that’s an extra, extra backup — one that’s in addition to your other copies. SFTP is a generic protocol for transferring data using an encrypted tunnel between a client and an SFTP server. If you have a cloud-based virtual private server with extra storage, or want to swap storage with a friend who can run an SFTP server on their computer (and you both have high-speed Internet links), it’s an alternative. It may not be cheap, and it certainly won’t be easy, since you’ll have to set up and maintain the SFTP server, but it could be an alternative if you want complete control. For instance, I have a Linode server for my various Web projects. I already pay $100 per month for it and I have about 100 GB of storage available that I could use for critical documents or files. I also found a similar service that offers 1 TB of SSD storage and 5 TB of monthly throughput for just $25 per month (I haven’t tested it, and thus am not linking to it). Performance Testing -- I set up and tested several kinds of backups and similar operations to see how well ChronoSync worked and how fast it was. I then compared those operations with straight file copying in Transmit (for Amazon S3 and SFTP) and Cyberduck (for Google Cloud and SFTP). I performed all the cloud tests over HTTPS for encrypted transit, but without server-side encryption, as neither Transmit nor Cyberduck supports it. While ChronoSync detected changes and performed backups flawlessly, it lagged in throughput. This unfortunate result stems in part from the fact that I have uncapped symmetrical gigabit Internet service, an extremely unusual situation. I tested with directories of files of varying sizes, some tiny and some in the hundreds of megabytes and to over a gigabyte, as well as using what Econ Technologies’ lead developer recommended: a sparse bundle disk image created in Apple’s Disk Utility. Instead of relying on a single monolithic file, the sparse bundle format divides the disk image into small files of 1–8 MB each, depending on the image’s volume size, which makes backups much easier. Changing a few files might result in updating just one bundle element that’s a few megabytes in size. In every test, ChronoSync suffered from some inefficiency that bogged it down. I reported this to Econ Technologies, and they were very responsive. As a result of my testing, they updated the app from 4.7.0 to 4.7.1 to implement improvements for smaller files that more than doubled throughput with Amazon S3 and tripled it with Google Cloud Storage. The company tells me they are working to crank it up even further in future updates. I created a 2.16 GB sparse bundle disk image and tested it via several methods. I also tested a single monolithic 1.5 GB file to check the difference in throughput for a single-file transfer. I’m in Seattle; the Amazon bucket I created lives in the U.S. West (Oregon) region, and the Multi-Regional Google bucket in my hemisphere. The SFTP server is in a Linode data center in California. At the time I ran these tests, Google’s Fiber speed test showed that my connection could push 300 Mbps upstream. For the sparse bundle image: Amazon S3: 65 Mbps using Transmit, 40 Mbps with ChronoSync Google Cloud Storage: 200 Mbps using Cyberduck, 40 Mbps with ChronoSync SFTP: 140 Mbps with Cyberduck, 190 Mbps with Transmit, and 12 Mbps with ChronoSync For the monolithic file: Amazon S3: 280 Mbps using Transmit, 94 Mbps with ChronoSync Google Cloud Storage: 250 Mbps using Cyberduck, 182 Mbps with ChronoSync SFTP: 140 Mbps with Cyberduck, 190 Mbps with Transmit, and 20 Mbps with ChronoSync With Backblaze backups from the same computer, I routinely hit rates of 200 to 400 Mbps upstream. Although these numbers would seem to be a huge mark against ChronoSync, the reality is that its slower throughput makes a difference only if you have a very high-speed upstream connection and routinely backup more than a few gigabytes a day. Still, that first backup is going to be pain: priming a backup set with 200 GB would take about 1.5 days at 12 Mbps; copying 1 TB would take about 8 days. Speeding this up to come closer to the performance of direct transfers would make ChronoSync a much easier choice. Is ChronoSync Worthwhile for Cloud Backup? -- Cloud-hosted backup services offer an attractive price for automated backups, strong support for retaining older versions, and excellent redundancy. But that all comes at the cost of ceding some level of control, and that’s what you get back with ChronoSync. The key advantages to using ChronoSync and separately contracted storage are that files end up stored in a directly retrievable format, and you control all the encryption options. On the downside, it’s slower and will likely be more expensive, particularly if you have to restore significant amounts of data.

The company had previously announced at its Worldwide Developers’ Conference in June that all apps submitted to the App Store will need support the App Transport Security (ATS) feature starting January 1st, 2017. It has not yet set a new deadline. ATS is a feature first introduced in iOS 9 that forces apps to communicate with internet servers using encrypted HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS) connections. It's an improvement over the third-party frameworks that developers previously used to implement HTTPS because it ensures that only industry-standard encryption protocols and ciphers are used. Even if ATS is enabled by default in iOS, on a technical level app developers can disable some of its features or can opt out of it entirely through various exception settings that ATS makes available. A recent study performed by security firm Appthority on the top 200 apps present on iOS enterprise devices showed that 97 percent of them bypassed at least some ATS requirements and weakened the default and recommended configuration. Apple planned to include ATS compliance as a requirement in its App Store review process starting next year and to require reasonable justifications for any exceptions. However, as the Appthority study showed, many developers are unprepared to fully enable ATS in their apps. "At WWDC 2016 we announced that apps submitted to the App Store will be required to support ATS at the end of the year," Apple said in an announcement on its developer site Wednesday. "To give you additional time to prepare, this deadline has been extended and we will provide another update when a new deadline is confirmed." There are many reasons why developers might not be ready or even able to encrypt all of their apps' traffic. For example, many apps integrate with third-party advertising, analytics and media hosting services and the adoption of HTTPS by those services is not something that app developers can control. As of December 22, the 3 percent ATS readiness figure among iOS apps had grown to only 5 percent, the Appthority researchers said Thursday in a blog post. "We assume that Apple, too, realized that an unacceptably high number of apps would fail to meet the ATS deadline unless it was extended." The researchers believe that even if Apple hasn't abandoned its plans for full ATS compliance, this is not something that can be achieved very soon, which is probably why a new deadline hasn't been announced yet. "In light of this new development, we recommend that enterprises track the state of apps’ ATS compliance and consider alternatives to apps that access sensitive corporate data and don’t secure their network connections using ATS," they said.

Here’s what we know 2016's hottest game is finally combined with wearable wrist technology By GUY BIRCHALL 23rd December 2016, 2:19 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments POKEMON Go is finally available on the Apple Watch having taken the world by storm this summer. Rumours had abounded that Niantic had abandoned plans to make a version of the game for the platform. Niantic / Twitter 2 The Apple Watch version of Pokemon Go has been launched But they were put to bed as the games release on Apple Watch was announced yesterday. Now the questions remain what are gamers going to be able to do with the new platform and how is it going link up with the iPhone. The Sun Online explains. What is Pokemon Go for Apple Watch? The game is an Augmented Reality (AR) and Geosatellite Positioning System (GPS) powered which has so far been downloaded 600 million times as of November 2016. It uses a combination of AR gameplay and physical activity to allow gamers to walk to new locations to find Pokemon and go to Pokestops. The phone version of the game required users to cover a set distance to hatch some of the “eggs” that can be found in the game. The new app is going to incorporate the Apple Watch’s fitness tracking ability and will feed gameplay into users overall physical activity for the day. Niantic / Twitter 2 Push notifications will be fed to the users wrist alerting them to nearby Pokemon, Pokestops and when your eggs hatch New Apple Watch 2 adds Pokemon game play with your walk or run Additionally push notifications will also be fed to the users wrist alerting them to nearby Pokemon, Pokestops and when your eggs hatch. But if you actually want to snare a Squirtle or pick up a Pikachu you will still have to whip out your iPhone. The release of the Apple Watch version of the game comes hot on the heels of updates to the game play. Gamers can now hatch new monsters from the Pokemon Gold and Silver video games as well as adding he elusive Ditto and a special edition Pikachu in a santa hat. When is the release date? The move was announced originally in September in San Francisco by Apple, but it was released on December 22. In September John Hanke, CEO of "Pokemon" creator Niantic Labs, says the idea is to allow you to focus more on your surroundings and not the phone while playing. It's coming later this year. Hanke said at the time people playing had collectively walked 2.9 billion miles. He added: "It's certainly been a busy summer for us."

Recent reports that suggested that Pokemon Go's Apple Watch version had been shelved appear to be wrong - the mobile AR game is now available on Apple Watches, developer Niantic has announced. The Apple Watch version of the game, announced in September, doesn't function like a full version of the game, but more like a peripheral. Niantic says that players will be able to use their Apple Watch to log play sessions as workouts, receive notifications about nearby Pokemon, count distance towards hatching eggs and earning buddy candy, collect from PokeStops, and receive notifications when eggs hatch and medals are earned. You won't, however, be able to catch new Pokemon - but you will be alerted when one is nearby. In other Pokemon Go news, Niantic recently added a few new Pokemon to mobile title Pokemon Go, including Ditto, which can be found in the wild, and Togepi and Pichu, which can each be hatched from eggs, along with a special holiday themed Pikachu.

There have been a ton of rumours about this special iPhone so far. But thanks to cnBeta leaked Apple documents also hint that it has been codenamed ‘Ferrari’ and that it packs in some really exotic tech at an equally exotic price tag. Apple Insider reported a couple of leaked Apple manufacturing documents (possibly from assembly plants) that confirm the rumours and speculations that Apple will be bringing three new iPhones in the coming year. Apart from the usual two (iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus) that are expected to follow the usual design tradition, there’s a third one that has been internally codenamed ‘Ferrari’. This special iPhone has been designed to celebrate Apple’s 10th anniversary and will be a fresh design take with an expected sandwiched glass design below which sits a borderless OLED display. Towards the bottom end of the OLED display will sit an ultrasonic invisible home button. We do know it will be an OLED one, thanks to a report from Bloomberg. However the report from Bloomberg does not state whether all of the 2017 models will feature OLED displays or just the special one. With an all-glass design comes wireless charging as well, a work around that should do well, considering that Apple no longer includes a 3.5mm headphone jack. The display and wireless charging aside, the report from cnBeta also hints that the new design will divide the iPhone’s logic board into two units that will be connected by a flex cable. The reasoning behind this move, is to separate the A11 SoC and storage and hook it up to the front facing unit below the display, while the second unit on back houses all the communications and charging bits. All of the above is different from the 2018 Apple iPhone 8 that is expected to go with an OLED panel with curved screen or a wrap-around screen.

Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Dec 23, 2016 at 9:00AM Image source: Google. I wouldn't go so far as to say that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has failed in catalyzing the smartwatch market over the past year and a half, but I also wouldn't say that Apple Watch has been a blockbuster success. Sure, Apple Watch is easily the most successful smartwatch to date, but that doesn't actually say a whole lot since it's one of the first wearable devices in the nascent category. There isn't much competition to begin with. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) technically beat Apple by a few months, with Android Wear devices becoming available in late 2014. Since then, Apple has taken over and Android Wear has hit a wall. The search giant just re-acqui-hired some smartwatch engineers in preparation of its big 2017 push, as Android Wear 2.0 was recently delayed until next year amid lack of hardware partners. Meanwhile, just days after Google unveiled the Pixel, the first smartphone that it fully designed, rumors surfaced that the search giant was working on its own flagship smartwatches. It turns out those rumors were at least partially true. A tale of two flagship smartwatches  In an exclusive interview yesterday with The Verge, Android Wear product manager Jeff Chang confirmed that the company has two flagship smartwatches in the pipeline for the first quarter. The wearable pair will be the first devices to run Android Wear 2.0. Despite the smartwatch market's recent hesitation, Google still wants to show consumers that smartwatches are viable products that can add value to people's lives. Simply put, Google wants to save the smartwatch market. However, Google isn't designing the smartwatches entirely by itself, nor is it manufacturing them. Instead, Google is taking the same approach that it did with the Nexus phones of yore, where it collaborates with a third-party original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to develop the devices, which will primarily carry that OEM's brand. Chang declined to specify which OEM it is partnering with, beyond noting that it is a current Android Wear partner. That's a sprawling list, but more than likely it'll be one of the familiar Android OEMs like Huawei, Samsung, LG, or Motorola, among a few other candidates. Notably, HTC has not released an Android Wear device (yet), so although it is manufacturing the Pixel, we can safely rule out the Taiwanese company. 2017: The year of the smartwatch? The key to unlocking the smartwatch market's potential will be to empower devices for general purposes. Thus far, manufacturers have focused heavily on fitness functionalities, given wearables' natural applications for tracking activity metrics. Whether or not Android Wear 2.0 can deliver this remains to be seen, although it has potential. The major headliners of the update will be stand-alone apps, additional user customizations, and requisites like messaging and notifications. While Google can't singlehandedly save the smartwatch market, the subsequent and persistent competition will inevitably improve all products within the category, and that may do the trick.

At least that seems to be the atmosphere among component suppliers that are girding up their loins for a drought in the coming months until Apple starts the engines for the 2017 iPhone model. Apple’s Flexible Printed Circuit Board (FPCB) suppliers are preparing products that can be used on Apple’s OLED iPhone screens, further fanning the flames of speculation. Apple is the king of LCD screens for smartphones and tablets, at least as far as DisplayMate is concerned. And yet, the company has long been rumored, or at least wished for, to move over to OLEDs. This relatively younger screen technology has advantages in terms of power efficiency and deeper blacks, but LCDs do have the edge in colors and brightness in some cases. Many have already concluded that Apple will move to OLEDs in the iPhone 8, which many have also predicted to be next year’s model. It seems that its component suppliers think likewise. FPCB makers Zhen Ding Technology and Flexium Interconnect are reported to be preparing products that could be used together with such screens. Sadly, these companies are also reporting weak revenues due to a slowdown in demand for the current iPhone 7. Part of that is perhaps due to the anticipation of the iPhone 8, which could have the design everyone, or at least the vocal majority, have been clamoring for. Aside from a switch to OLED, the iPhone 8’s screen is believed to possess two other characteristics. One is a dual curved edge not unlike the Galaxy S7 edge, the other, perhaps more importantly, is near zero bezels. The iPhone 8 is speculated to employ under-glass fingerprint sensors to make it possible to remove the home button, which takes up a lot of space beneath the screen. The design change isn’t merely aesthetic. By removing bezels and extending the screen to the edges, Apple could, in effect, offer a larger screen size without actually making the iPhone itself bigger. This could very well be the iPhone design fans have been dying to have for years now, though how it will translate to actual use remains to be seen. The iPhone 8 is expected to arrive next year, though there is also some prediction that Apple will wait until 2018 to make such a big leap.

Author Eli Hodapp Posted On2016-12-23 10:02:37 News I got my Apple AirPods bluetooth earbuds first thing Monday morning, and after using them for a while I posted a first impressions piece and mentioned I'd follow up later in the week with a more thorough review as I continue to use them. Five days of use later, and I love 'em to the point that the AirPods case has found a new home in the front pocket of my pants with my keys and wallet, which is about the highest praise I could ever give a piece of portable electronics. Originally announced along side the iPhone 7 back in September, the AirPods have been subject to incredibly harsh criticism from seemingly all corners of the internet prior to their release. "You're going to lose them" was crowed over and over, like Ralphie being told he was going to shoot his eye out. In reality, while I suppose it is possible to misplace the case holding your AirPods, just randomly losing one doesn't seem like a very likely scenario unless you just have really bad habits of not putting things back where they belong. Unlike the plastic case that Apple's wired EarPods have come in (Which was curiously absent with the iPhone 7 pack-in EarPods!) that really only served as a slightly nicer way to store your headphones, the AirPods case is a vital part of the whole AirPods setup. Opening the case triggers the whole AirPods pairing process, and it's also how you charge them, so it seems like I just naturally end up sticking it back in my pocket when I was using them. Then, because you want your AirPods charged up for the next time you use them, you put them back in the case when you're done. It doesn't even really seem like it's something you think about, as it's just where they belong. Aside from just randomly misplacing one, the other fear seemed to be them falling out of your ears. I've made it a point to wear my AirPods whenever I've done physical things this week, deliberately exaggerating movements, and just randomly shaking my head around until I've come close to making myself sick and I can't get these things to come out on their own. Gym routines, snow removal, running, head-banging to hair metal, you name it, and they stay put. Even deliberately flicking the antenna arms that hang down outside your ears doesn't really dislodge them. If you somehow do manage to knock one out, your music stops instantly, so it's hard to really imagine many scenarios where you've got them in your ears and you just randomly lose one unless you're just supremely unobservant. Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel The sound quality of AirPods is great, but they share the same caveat as Apple's wired EarPods: Because they just sort of nestle themselves in your ears, there isn't a whole lot of sound isolation that occurs. Depending on how you're going to be using your AirPods, this could be a good thing or a bad thing. When I'm out running, I like wearing headphones that don't block out all the noise around me so I can hear things like dogs barking, car horns honking, and other things I might need to be aware of. For that use, AirPods are fabulous. If you're listening to music or podcasts in an environment where you want the noise reduction that a big beefy pair of highly insulated headphones offer, AirPods might not be the best solution as your only defense against background noise is to crank the volume. That said, they perform admirably at high volumes without any distortion. If you're curious how the AirPods sound, they're indistinguishably similar to the wired EarPods you're likely already using. One feature that Apple didn't advertise that much that I've found myself loving with the AirPods is you can totally just use one of them if you want and keep the other in the case. Maybe it's a holdover from listening to ancient single-earbud mono AM radios as a kid (which probably really dates me), but my preferred way of listening to podcasts has always been to just have one earbud in with the other dangling around somewhere. Additionally, a single AirPod can totally work just like a traditional Bluetooth headset to make phone calls. It's a cool feature I've been using quite a bit, which never was really possible on the other Bluetooth earbud sets I've used which all are connected to each other with a cord. Of course, if you want to have both AirPods in to place calls that works too. (Although stereo calling has always felt weird to me.) I was able to get the advertised five hours of battery life out of my AirPods via a all-day listening marathon, which I've seen some criticism in that it isn't enough juice to get you through an entire work day. That's true, but they also have the same rapid-charging tricks of other wireless headphones that give you three hours of charge after spending fifteen minutes in the case. A super practical use case if you plan on listening all day is to just drop them back in the case when you take your break or go grab lunch or whatever else and you'll have enough charge to make it through the day. Apple claims the AirPods case holds enough juice for an extra 24 hours of listening, and I've been unsuccessful in using up the charge in the case this week. (That's roughly five hours of listening a day.) $160 seems a little on the expensive side, but pricing is always going to be a highly personal thing for these kinds of personal electronics. The way I look at things, I don't skimp on stuff that I use all the time. I don't mind buying a nice mattress because I spend a third of my life on it. I also buy expensive lens coatings for my glasses since I spend the other 2/3 of my life looking through them. Headphones also exist inside that universe of rationalizing paying more than you usually would because of how often you end up using them. I tend to look at this stuff as a "cost per use," instead of initial purchase price. It's hard to really compare the AirPods to anything else too, as nothing else really comes close to the size and functionality of these, particularly when you add the magical iCloud-enabled pairing that the W1 chip inside of them provides. Switching AirPods in between Apple devices is just as simple as my W1-enabled Beats Solo 3's. The first time you open the case, your iOS device will ask if you want to pair with them, at which point they're just available as an audio output device that you can switch to on any modern iOS device or Mac. It's really slick how it all works, and makes the awkward song and dance you needed to do when you wanted to use a pair of Bluetooth headphones on multiple devices feel really antiquated comparatively. That being said, you can still use AirPods as a Bluetooth audio device on older Apple (and non-Apple) hardware. You just hold down the button on the back of the case to force them into pairing mode and you can connect to them with anything that can connect to Bluetooth audio devices. You'll need to do a similar re-pairing when you want to use them again on your iOS devices, but, that's really not that big of a dealt because the W1 pairing prompts are so simple. Aside from simple pairing, the W1 chip also enables some of the most impressive range I've ever experienced using wireless headphones, easily allowing me to wander around my entire house without losing connection to my iPhone that's plugged in and charging. Really, the only thing that I think is going to be an actual issue for folks with AirPods is that without a wire, there's no place for the in-line volume and play/pause button to go. The only controls you have for the AirPods when they're in your ear is taking one of them out pauses your music, putting it in resumes, and double tapping the side of one invokes Siri. (You can also change it so this double tap works as a play/pause button.) If you want to change the volume of what you're listening to, there's three ways to do it in order of least to most obnoxious: You can just use the side volume buttons on your device, you can use the volume sliders on the screen of your device, or you can use Siri which is slow, stupid, and also requires internet connectivity. Turning your music down by double tapping an AirPod, waiting for Siri to be invoked, then saying "Turn the volume down" and waiting for it to respond is without a doubt the dumbest way I've ever heard of to turn your music down (or up). Crazier yet, it seems like when you ask Siri to do this it only turns your music up (or down) one blip on the on-screen volume display, so more realistically you'd probably be asking Siri multiple times to change your volume. It's incredibly silly, particularly if you keep your iPhone in an arm band or similar while running and depend on headphone controls. (Edit: TouchArcade commenter FuZion pointed out that you can specifically ask Siri to "set the volume to 50%," or any other percentage, which is a real handy tip.) That being said, this hasn't been a problem at all in how I've used them this week, as when I've needed to talk to someone with my headphones in I just take an AirPod out so my iPhone pauses. It's just another really weird thing that makes you wonder if Apple realizes that "Just have Siri do it" isn't as great of a solution as they think it is. Also, if you're somewhere without internet access like on a subway or a plane, or, you know, a lot of places people use headphones, this functionality doesn't work at all. While I haven't subjected my AirPods to any serious stress beyond just normal everyday use, a product release wouldn't be complete without YouTube torture testers doing all sorts of insane things. In particular, short of just purposefully smashing them, AirPods have proven to be incredibly resilient in drop tests. They even made it through the laundry as one YouTuber ran them through both the washer and the dryer and they still continued to work fine. They even worked after being totally submerged under water: Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel Aside from moving the in-line controls a lot of people are likely in the habit of using to annoyingly slow Siri commands, it's really hard to find things I don't like about Apple's new AirPods. I rarely would carry the wired EarPods with me in my pocket as that was just asking for a mess of tangled cords and I've really avoided the social stigma that comes of being one of those people who always has a Bluetooth headset in their ears. Having a pair of tiny, super-convenient headphones that double as a Bluetooth headset that easily fit in my pocket has really changed my usage patterns of how often I've been consuming audio content and communicating using my phone. This was all possible with wires, of course, but there's just something so quick and simple in just removing your AirPods from their case, popping them in your ears, and going about whatever you're doing. RPG Reload Special Edition - The RPG Reload 2016 Christmas Fireside 'Templar Battleforce', 'Her Story', 'HoPiKo', 'Pinball Breaker Forever', and More in Today's Sales Round-Up dancj I wonder why they didn't just sticky he volume controls on the antenna arms. The price in the U.K. is £160 - which really smarts for a $160 product. cyllwynn But that is true of every other piece of camera gear etc. On a plus side, your tvs are so much cheaper than in the US. 🙂 Quaze A 13-paragraph review of a pair of headphones, and the full extent of the review of the sound quality was "the sound quality of AirPods are great,...". InTheAir "Turning your music down by double tapping an AirPod, waiting for Siri to be invoked, then saying 'Turn the volume down' and waiting for it to respond is without a doubt the dumbest way I've ever heard of to turn your music down (or up)." This joke is kind of late, but my voice-control fever dreams didn't mean anything? Mikiesque Can you please confirm the impact on your phone battery life, given it need constant Bluetooth connection? http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp Negligible, I really haven't noticed any additional battery drain when using any modern Bluetooth audio devices. I've never seen any actual scientific testing to verify this, but I've read more than a few discussions on Reddit and in other places of people suggesting that the power drain of recent Bluetooth chipsets is getting to a point where the actual usage over just sending that same power over copper to traditional headphones is getting to the point where the difference is effectively a wash... Which, sort of makes sense? Maybe? nini is utilising Siri really the requirement? I doubt anyone is really using Siri to control the volume, that's just silly. http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp If you want to control your music or volume without using your phone, yes. It's a pretty common use case of having your iPhone in an arm band while working out, in your jacket pocket, or something similar and just using the in-line volume and playback controls, isn't it? I use the ones on the sides of my Beats all the time when running because I keep my phone in a belt pack thing that keeps it snug against my body so it doesn't bounce around. nini I know only too well being a big fan of in-line controls but I wouldn't use Siri for doing that unless you can say "Hey Siri, lower volume by 10%" mstacheef Great review and totally agree. I got them on Monday and consider these more of a game changer than the Apple Watch, which I also love. I've been using a Bluetooth headset for years, really since they first came out, and that's my first and primary use here: for calls. The call quality is better than any BT headset I've used, including my recent favorite the Plantronics Edge. The mics on these and the noise cancellation are excellent. And the ability to use one for music when I'm walking around has My second primary use. Battery life on both the AirPods and phone are great and I'm amazed at how stable these things are in my ears. Literally can't get them to come out or even get loose. Timmy2x How can these be a one size fits all item?? There's so many different size ears lol dancj They're kind of cone-ish shaped so if you've got smaller ears you don't push them on as far. In theory. merrickal How does the airpods fare when listening via the Apple Watch? bilboad Great and helpful review, thanks. I've read a number of reviews now, and yours is the first one to spend more than a sentence discussing the implications of the lack of physical controls, which I think will be a pretty important issue to some people. In particular, several other reviewers even repeated Apple's solution of using Siri for audio controls as if it was a reasonable alternative, so I appreciate that you actually tried it and reported on how poorly it actually works. It sounds like otherwise the headphones are excellent, so it just depends how much someone minds losing the inline controls. Personally, I use headphone controls regularly, not just for pausing and volume, but also for skipping forward and back in the track list, so for me this is a deal breaker. Kind of disappointing since otherwise they seem ideal. countBasil I use my pebble watch to control podcasts. Thank heavens for hardware buttons on a smart watch! Don't know about $160 though ... Timmy2x For me it really comes down to two things that will keep me from buying these, first the price and second...gravity. kickypants But when playing games is there a sound delay like every other wireless headphones http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp I haven't noticed any, but I'm a person who was able to play games on a DLP TV which people always said was the worst kind of TV to have for video games because of input lag... So hopefully someone who is sensitive to these things can chime in. Lamar Taylor There is no delay with audio when watching YouTube or full movies. I've experienced no popping and cracking like you hear with other Bluetooth headphones. Michal Hochmajer Hey Siri (say in rhythm), volume up up up up up (at 170 bpm drum and bass), volume down down down down (at 80 bpm hip hop), volume up down up down up down (at 70/140 bpm dubstep). Functionality one tap - Stop/Play two - Next song three - Previous song four - Next after previous song five -... up to 65535 Who knows. Maybe Apple will add multigesture in next generation. Five fingers to pinch your library etc. 🙂 5 hours is suprisingly long for such a small device. Is it on average volume? http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp Yeah, comfortable listening volume around the house which for me is around 60%. FuZion You can set volume directly, for example simply saying "volume 50%" does exactly that. You can only use denominations of 10 but that should be ample for most cases. Still, I too feel that using Siri is a dumb thing. They should have allowed a slide up/down motion on the side of the EarPods. http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp Oh that's a good tip, I'll add that in. http://chibi-jib.tumblr.com/ SaKo What does Super Mario Run have anything to do with EarPods. What was the point of shoehorning it in the title? CarlRJ One of the most widely discussed complaints about Super Mario Run has been that it needs a constantly-on internet connection in order to play the game. This article spends considerable time talking about how one needs an internet connection to use Siri to do something as simple as _changing the volume_ on the headphones. I thought the connection between the two topics was pretty obvious and natural, not shoehorning. tp015657 I'm sorry for the sods who will actually get this, there are many comparable products with similar sound quality under the $50 mark in the market. http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp For instance? I've not seen any other Bluetooth earbuds that don't have a wire connecting the two of them, get five hours of battery life with a quick-charge case that offers another 24, that also have a absurdly great connection range and seamless automatic connectivity between different iOS devices... But I don't really follow the market that closely. I'd love to check out some sub-$50 competitors. tp015657 First of all not having a wire connecting them both is the worst feature i can point out, basically a gimmick over convenience, there is a reason why previous products who tried this out did not take off as they easily fall off and get lost and you can say goodbye to them if one drops into a drain/driveway which can easily happen when jogging, did i mention they are horrible for jogging/workout and are not sweatproof? 2nd, most earphones give 7-8 hours solid (2-3 more, thanks for jaybird for setting the standard) without the bank and as for the bank i'd prefer to get a proper 22,000 mah battery for $50 or less during sale to charge both my wireless headphones for 48 hours and smartphone twice at the same time. 3rd, for that price they better as hell sound great but by no means is it outstanding as even the newest and cheaper jaybird x3 (x2 even cheaper) can beat it with an app to boot where you can adjust bass, treble, highs and lows and are good for working out and jogging with wingtips to be secure. 4th, range, basically all bluetooth earphones with 4.1 can achieve the same range as Airpods which are everywhere regardless of how much Apple pays for their marketing team to dazzle you about range. 5th, seamless automatic connectivity? What is that? Another marketing gimmick? It only takes me 10s to pair any bluetooth headphones and never worry about it again since you only pair devices once. The only thing going for the Airpods is the housing inside the battery which is pointless anyway since it only adds another bank to carry over other options, as well as the apple branding if you happen to be a big fan of them for "bragging" rights. http://toucharcade.com Eli Hodapp The lack of a wire connecting the earbuds is definitely not a gimmick. I regularly run long distances and a light wire whacking you and rubbing against the back of your neck might not seem like a big deal for the first five minutes, but speaking from experience it gets pretty annoying past the 5K mark- Particularly as you start to get sweaty and the wire starts sticking to your skin and pulling at your earbuds when you turn your head. Again, speaking from experience here, the AirPods are just better to run with than my Jaybird X3's (which I paid $100 for) as they're both lighter and more secure. I really don't think you read anything I wrote here, as not only are they near impossible to knock out of your ear on accident (Hell, watch the video if you don't want to read the text) but playback stops instantly. A scenario where you're running, lose one, somehow don't notice, and it falls down a sewer drain without you noticing just doesn't seem realistic unless you're just the most unobservant and unlucky people on the planet. Also, AirPods are totally waterproof (again, watch the second video if you don't like reading). I'm sort of at a loss as to how "Just carry around a giant external battery if you want more battery life" is a good solution, but, if you're happy with your setup of wired earbuds, battery pack, charging cables, and everything else... More power to you! Your responses just don't make a whole lot of sense though, as it seems like you really don't know that much about them, arguing several things which not only are just objectively wrong but also are explained inside of the review text. It kind of smells like trolling. TP014546 Why would i be trolling? Because i simply had an opinion and preference other than yours? I don't know what bluetooth headphones you have used in the past that had a wire dangling (you make it sound long) but if it was the jaybird X3 then i'd have to disagree with you and choke it up to different experiences as i have never had your "issues" (including sticky wires due to sweat) with the other sets i mentioned in another reply a good example would be the ones from mpowah that have a hard plastic springy wiring stays on with no problems without being affected. I did read your article just disagree with you, my experience with them was abysmal as they kept falling off on me while jogging, you have to realize that one size/shape fits all never works out which is why other brands include wingtips of different sizes. I never said anything about losing and not noticing, those are your words, my example was  if you happen to jog and one falls off to a drain or a ditch or bounces off pavement only to end up under someone's shoes or tires before you can race to salvage them (these are not specific scenarios but examples of anything that can go wrong) which being wired together would have prevented such accidents not to mention lack of wingtips. Regarding the battery banks You do not need to carry them or their wires (both actually smaller than you make them out to be) around when jogging/working out, any other headphone will last 3-4 of 2h sessions from a full charge anyway, my mention of multiple usage battery banks was a counter argument to the Airpod's exclusive usage which you can carry the former around in your backpack along with your laptop and whatnot if you are on the road. Contrary to what you wrote in the article not even apple advertises them as sweat/water resistant/proof (where is the rating?), just because they survived your few test runs does not mean they will last as mine started crackling after it's first week and was told they weren't when i had to return them. I just voiced my opinion and you were the one who replied and asked, not my problem you couldn't make sense of it to start assuming things about me as even the report by business insider echoes my concerns and dismay but if they ultimately end up working for you then good on you just not worth the asking price imo as there are better alternatives. Mind you English is not my 1st nor 2nd spoken language but i do try. So i basically got banned from commenting on this article just because i disagreed with you due to different experiences, good job Eli Hodapp and really mature to delete my comments, basically accused me of trolling then prevented me from replying, bet that made you feel superior on some level. Good to know such behaviour is allowed in Toucharcade. Timmy2x Eli you do come off a bit harsh from time to time just saying let the people speak there minds. puggsly 1) No, it is not. It effectively makes these both headphones and 2 head sets. This may not be a feature for you but it is for some, and for most reviewers they don't fall out and are waterproof. 2) No, most earbud style are in this range and most don't recharge in 15 min. 3) Sounds like they do! and if sound is the only criteria don't buy earbuds, buy over the ear headphones. Sound is one aspect of their cost. 4) Again, no! Bluetooth is also affected by the antenna, and the amount of power used and a host of other things. 5) Well, it is a system where the earbuds pair automatically to iOS devices and then to all other Mac and iOS devices through the iCloud service. It is amazingly cool. Now, I get it! You don't want these, so I recommend you don't buy them but they are some amazing tech that many of us do want to purchase for most of the reasons you are dismissing. Zendorphin Please specify some. Interested. Timmy2x I have a feeling we're not going to get any, my guess is he just doesn't like the price. tp015657 Not to disrespect some fellow users here but i don't camp the app for long periods of time so i either i don't keep refreshing like some or it is that those who reply do so long after i'm gone. On the subject, of course i don't like the price it is outrageous to even ask for that much when the quality is not up for the asking price. As for alternatives check my reply above. tp015657 You can look around at Skullcandy, Jlabs, Plantronics, Taotronics, Phaiser, Mpow, JVC, Samsung, Sony... Etc (many more) Avoid Aukey like the plague they suffer delays. Just be smart when shopping, some models have lag/delay just read the feedback on amazon and check youtube reviews of them. Plantronics, Phaiser, Sony, Samsung, Taotronics and Jaybirds to name a few offer in the 50-100 bracket if you are looking at quality. Apple's earphones are quality as well just not for the asking price, remember with Apple you are also paying for the brand as well which is a waste. http://www.jeandenis.net/ Jean-Denis Haas Nice review, thanks! JoAnn Welsh You can also adjust the volume with an Apple Watch. Garrett Dilley I've read very little from any commentary that discusses the benefits of AirPods with an Apple Watch. Audio controls are potentially as simple as in line controls (arguably better with visual feedback), and more accesible than buttons on your phone. Also, with automatic audio switching, it's super easy to start up your run playlist and leave your phone behind. AirPods are almost a must buy for Apple Watch users if you ask me. They're that brilliant together. mstacheef The lack of music controls is definitely an issue for me. Not a major one but more of an annoyance. I've actually been using Siri to skip, pause & resume when my phone is across the room or in my pocket, which isn't a big deal. Everyone's satisfaction will depend on the use case and what they're comparing the AirPods to. Personally, I use PowerBeat3s for running, but these are a replacement for my Plantronics Voyager Edge as my headset for calls, which is a $129 single-eat headset, so compared to that and all the other high-end headsets the AirPods are competitively priced and perform much better. Add to that you get a second headset for Better music and video and these are a total game changer. Timmy2x Ok I watched the video and they seem secure in the ear which is great but as the guy even said in the video they look very strange in the ear almost like half a headphone. It's probably just me but I always though that people with the Bluetooth headsets seemingly talking to themselves always looked like d bags, would someone in here help a brother out and recommend a great sounding Bluetooth earbud for under $50? There's way too many to research I've tried on amazon with there reviews but no matter which I look at there's always a handful that say stay away from these headphones! I guess for under $50 you just have to take a chance. Eldad So i basically got banned from commenting on this article just because i disagreed with the author, good job Eli Hodapp, basically accused me of trolling then prevented me from replying, bet that made you feel superior on some level. Good to know such behaviour is allowed in Toucharcade. Duane Locsin A simpler solution for volume controls on a wireless headphones is of course swipe gesture, but I think that could be patented already by..maybe Bragg dash. I have been using a Nokia b590 Bluetooth head phone for works out for years, but I am getting this for the more "discrete" use at work. skatter I'm so very glad I own both an Apple Watch and AirPods. I have Siri turned off on the AirPods because a simple pause/play button is all I really need normally. And if I want to adjust the volume and not pull my phone out of my pocket, I can just do it on my watch. Hit the side button, tap Now Playing and adjust to my heart's content. Yet another small but awesome ability of my trusty AW! Lamar Taylor I was skeptical on the AirPods until I tried them on and used them. I went into an Apple Store the day they came and bought a pair and I LOVE them and use them all the time. I'm a guy who never used the iPhone Earbuds cuz they didn't fit my ears but to my surprise the AirPods fit my ears and never fall even while I do sit-ups, arm curls, and jog. Here's what I like so far: 1. Easy to set up and use. My came charged at 70% and were ready to use out of the box. 2. These are great while standing in lines at the grocery store, bank, mall, post office, doctors office, or waiting at the car wash. They also block out those bad kids who cry and disobey their parents in public. 3. These works great with Siri, work great when making phone calls, and when using your voice to type. Most of the time when people call me I use speak phone just to hear but these are a much clearer and better option. 4. I like to wear hats so using my giant over the ear headphones is bulky and not a good look. These AirPods don't look funny at all and nobody stares at you or laughs at you in public. It's just the opposite...attractive women always seem to ask questions about them and say they look nice. At the airport nobody seems to notice and they worked well in that noisy and crowded environment. I thought these were too expensive at first but I've been using them everyday so they are worth it to me. These are probably my favorite gadget right after my iPhone and that comes as a total surprise. Bottom line....try out a pair first to see if they will fit you.

Driver-Free Printing Comes To Ubuntu 17.04, AirPrint Support Written by Michael Larabel in Ubuntu on 23 December 2016 at 09:26 AM EST. 13 Comments With the latest "Zesty" development packages for Ubuntu 17.04, there is initial support for driver-less network printer support. Ubuntu 17.04 is supporting driver-less network printer support for those printers supporting IPP Everywhere and Apple AirPrint. Given the popularity of AirPrint / Apple printer support, this should expand the printer coverage for devices that previously didn't play well with Linux. If you are on a development build of Ubuntu 17.04 today, you can upgrade to the latest CUPS/cups-filters packages to gain this latest driver-less WiFi/wired network printing support for the IPP Everywhere / AirPrint compatible hardware. If you are wondering whether your printer is supported by AirPrint, Apple has a long list of certified devices here. Those wondering about the network printing improvements for Ubuntu 17.04 can find the details via this ubuntu-devel thread. 13 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Consumer Reports: Don't buy the new MacBook Pro by David Goldman   @DavidGoldmanCNN December 23, 2016: 11:31 AM ET Hands on with the MacBook Pro If you've been drooling over Apple's flashy new MacBook Pro, you might want to stuff your stocking with a different laptop. Consumer Reports said Thursday that it has decided not to recommend Apple's new MacBook Pros, because the notebooks' battery life can be miserable. The issue isn't exactly new: Many MacBook Pro owners have been complaining on social media that their computers have short battery life. Consumer Reports' tests confirmed customers' gripes. The MacBook Pro's battery life was "highly inconsistent from one trial to the next," Consumer Reports said in its review. For example one MacBook Pro model ran 16 hours in one test and less than four hours in the next. Another got a stunning 19.5 hours of battery life in its best test, and dropped to a woeful 4.5 hours in its worst. Although battery life can vary from test to test, Consumer Reports said a fluctuation as large as the one it experienced on the MacBook Pro is extremely rare. Usually, laptop battery life only varies about 5% from test to test. Since Consumer Reports said averaging the battery life length would not reflect what a customer would actually experience, it decided to factor in the lowest battery life measured for each model. That resulted in some truly dreadful ratings. The 15-inch version received a score of 56 out of 100. The 13-inch version without the new Touch Bar got a 47, and the 13-inch MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar only got a score of 40. That's well south of the MacBook Air (70 of 100), which is half the price of the cheapest MacBook Pro that Consumer Reports reviewed. The $585 Acer Aspire even scored higher than the new MacBooks. Consumer Reports' best-reviewed model is the Vaio Z, which received an overall score of 81 out of 100. None of the MacBook Pro's scores were high enough for Consumer Reports to recommend them. It marked the first time Consumer Reports said consumers shouldn't buy a MacBook. An Apple (AAPL, Tech30) spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Related: Is the MacBook Pro's Touch Bar a gimmick? Apple claims that the new MacBook Pros get 10 hours of battery life. The new computers' most notable new feature is the Touch Bar, a touch-sensitive strip above the keyboard that changes functions based on the software running on screen. Consumer Reports and Apple have a checkered history. The magazine notoriously failed to recommend the iPhone 4 for its 'antennagate' signal issues, even though it rated the phone higher than any other smartphone on the market. That led to a crabby Steve Jobs giving a press conference, announcing that Apple would give every iPhone 4 customer a free case. But Consumer Reports was the first major publication to throw cold water on Apple's 'bendgate' phone cracking controversy. In lab tests, Consumer Reports found that the iPhone 6 was far more durable than YouTube videos made it appear.

Yet there wasn’t a peep from ministers when Brussels refused to allow us a cent debt in forgiveness for the tens of billions Ireland was forced to cough up to bail out the bust banks and their bondholders. The claims being made that the EU is breaching our sovereignty by insisting the tech giant pays the same amount of tax as other business, must have given the Brussels bureaucrats a good laugh. You can almost hear those officials in the European Commission sneer: “Paddy allows Uncle Sam to use their country as a glorified aircraft carrier and they accuse us of abusing their sovereignty.” Over in Italy, the country’s third-biggest bank is on the brink of collapse and there are plans to burn the bondholders instead of putting the burden on their taxpayers. Kodaline & Glen Hansard during various performances by artists at Apollo House (Photo: Collins) Will Enda Kenny’s omadawns put the same effort into demanding we get retrospective compensation for the €60billion we blew on the banks as they did this week defending Apple’s tax affairs? Little chance when there wasn’t a whimper out of them when the head of the European Central Bank threatened that a bomb would go off in Dublin if we refused to pay taxpayers’ money to private banks and their bondholders. That wasn’t a breach of sovereignty, it was an act of war that should have resulted in a criminal investigation. But there I go again, forgetting that the law doesn’t apply to banks, multinationals and vulture funds. In this country there are different types of financial crimes, soft and hard fraud if you like. If an individual or small business engages in fraudulent transactions which results in others losing their money, they will be prosecuted, risk a criminal conviction and could even go to prison. If a number of banks engages in this type of activity on an industrial scale resulting in families losing tens of thousands of euro and even in some cases their homes, they get a slap on the wrist. It took the authorities just a matter of days to have the occupiers of Apollo House in court, yet eight years after the catastrophic crash not a single banker has appeared in court on charges directly related to one of the biggest banking scandals in history. It was somewhat ironic that the organs of the State were issuing summonses to activists for taking over a vacant building when the Government had just blown €50million commemorating the occupation of another just up the street 100 years ago. If there was one act that was in keeping with the true spirit of Rising, it was the occupation of Apollo House by the Home Sweet Home activists. These activists did more for the homeless in six days than the current Government did for them in six years. For they, just like the men and women of 1916, were acting in the interests of ordinary people and not the monied classes. While the occupiers have been ordered to vacate the building, their actions have drawn attention to the dreadful plight of the homeless and the terror campaign being waged against families by the banks and the vultures with the tacit support of the Government. While they might not realise it yet, the Government is facing another public revolt similar to the one which brought tens of thousands of anti water charge protesters onto the streets. And it is coming just in time because this vulture culture threatens to put tens of thousands more families on the street as the wealth funds invited into the country by Fine Gael and Labour start an aggressive campaign of family home repossessions. The coming year could see an explosion of homelessness if the financial vermin who have been gnawing away at the very fabric of our society are allowed to get their way. Maybe that’s a bit strong but you find me a better description for those who put children out of their homes on Christmas week because they bought their home from under them at a knockdown price and want to make a killing on the deal. The fact they are aided and abetted by the Government and the apparatus of the State makes it all the more disgusting. If our stomachs are not turned at what is happening to these families we should stop this bollocks about Christmas goodwill and sharing because it’s all utter hypocrisy. There’s little point in lamenting the plight of a child being born in a stable 2,000 years ago because we’re looking on like gobshites as children are turfed out of their homes every day of the week.

In it, she referred to music as something “important and rare,” and therefore, “valuable.” She was arguing about something only tangentially related to streaming exclusives, but she was also framing a mindset towards music that would morph into the industry standard over the next two years. And last summer, when she gave only Apple permission to stream her album 1989, she planted the seed of a powerful idea. In 2016, another year of war between the big three on-demand streaming services (Tidal, Apple Music, Spotify), having “important” and “rare” and “valuable” things like exclusive new albums from music’s biggest stars are the ultimate edge. While streaming was meant to make music more accessible and convenient, it’s now creating a series of walled gardens — beautiful houses for rare and important art. Let’s check in on how that’s affecting consumers and the industry at large. Kaitlyn Tiffany: This time last year, you and Jamieson (our dear friend, former co-blogger, long-time Canadian, and Kim K stan) talked about how streaming services like Apple Music, Tidal, and Spotify have made the music industry even more unequal — they solidify the 1 percent status of artists like Drake, Taylor Swift, Adele, etc., and make it even harder for indie bands to make a living off of releasing music. This year, I want to talk about something else streaming services have spent the year doing: exclusive releases. They’ve been solidified as standard practice, and this seems like the way things are going to be for a while. Do you feel like it’s a good solution? Micah Singleton: It’s not a good solution, but it’s the best solution streaming services have come up with so far. Streaming music is a costly business — companies pay millions upfront for the rights to music and then give around 70 percent of that $10 a month you pay them back to the rights holders. That means none of these services — not even Spotify, with its 100 million users — are actually profitable. Apple Music, Tidal, and (to a lesser extent) Amazon Music all have the same goals when it comes to paying for exclusives: to drive subscriptions. But for regular people, exclusives can be a huge inconvenience. it’s the best solution streaming services have come up with so far Kaitlyn: We can all pretty much agree that exclusives are a pain in the butt for consumers. That’s barely even a conversation anymore — obviously it’s not convenient for me to have to pay for Tidal in order to hear the new Rihanna or Kanye album the day it comes out, and then also subscribe to Apple Music to hear the new Drake album the day it comes out, and then also subscribe to Spotify because it’s my personal preference for basically everything else (playlists, usability of the app, social functions, force of habit). These albums all become paid downloads (or in Coloring Book’s case — free!), and pirating still isn’t that hard, especially because someone finally taught me how to torrent! So it’s not that I get cut off of from the music forever, just that it’s a serious imposition on my time or wallet if I want to be part of the first morning of a new album hitting the world. Micah: Yeah it’s definitely a pain, but you and I are already in the streaming ecosystem. It’s unlikely we’re going to leave it anytime soon, and the companies know that. And the companies also know that parents probably aren’t up on torrenting. If Tidal can lock in the moms with the latest Beyoncé release or if Amazon can convince the dads to get their Garth Brooks fix on its service, they may stick around afterwards. It’s hard for me to blame the artists, though — if someone was offering me millions to stream my album exclusively for a week in an industry where album profits keep declining, I’d take the deal too. I think the blame sits with the streaming services themselves that have failed to differentiate their products enough to make people interested in signing up for them without the need for exclusives. (Spotify excluded. Spotify is pretty great… except, of course, for the lack of exclusives. It’s a vicious cycle.) Apple Music has been my main streaming service this year — not because it’s the best, but because it has the most exclusives and I don’t have to keep switching between apps all day. It’s not totally unprecedented -— DirecTV is the only way you can watch NFL games outside of the handful that air on cable — but it’s still annoying. Content is king, and these streaming services have taken that ideal to the furthest extent possible. Kaitlyn: I’m still on Spotify, despite conning my way into more than my fair share of Apple Music and Tidal free trials. (I know there are other services and we’ll definitely get sass in the comments for disregarding them, but this is my lived experience!) That’s for a couple reasons — I respect anyone who spars with Taylor Swift without eventually bending to her will, and it’s just the ecosystem I’ve been living in since early college. The lack of exclusives, while obnoxious, also makes me feel like I’ve sided with the underdog… as much as a global corporation valued at $8 billion can be considered an underdog. Micah: Here’s my thing: exclusives have been around for years with video and no one really complains about it. We all know that Netflix doesn’t have all the content, so there’s Hulu for people who love network sitcoms, HBO Now for everyone who doesn’t have someone else’s cable login, and Amazon Prime Video for… people who already pay for Prime. It’s sort of a given that you need to have access to multiple streaming services for video, so why is the response so different for music? Kaitlyn: Right or wrong, I think we treat music like more of a public utility than we do premium TV or movies. It’s free on the radio; it’s free on YouTube. The modern expectation for someone who is “into” music is to have expansive and varied taste. That is much, much more labor-intensive than having what counts as varied taste for a consumer of TV, or even movies. You have to give at least a cursory listen to what — 15 albums a month? Name for me someone who really watches 15 theatrical release movies per month. Or 15 TV shows. Even in the new golden age of television — 455 scripted shows aired this year alone! — no one expects that extreme a range of reference. And in the era of social media and midnight surprise releases, the speed at which you get around to listening to new music is important too. Apple and Tidal have latched onto that, selling us not just selection but the best available version of completism and timeliness. It almost feels like blackmail: how can I claim any sort of decent perspective or useful opinion on music if I allow myself to be locked out of the internet’s first-day listening party for the latest Beyoncé? Apple and Tidal sell not just selection, but also completism and timeliness At the risk of sounding like an annoying stereotype of a Brooklyn snob-idiot, I recently picked up a copy of Theodor Adorno’s The Culture Industry, which contains his 1938 essay “On the Fetish Character in Music and the Regression of Listening.” Most of it is hyperbolic, and incredibly (often racially) cynical about jazz music and honestly I did not finish reading it. But there’s one bit that jumped out to me as very relevant to this conversation: “Music, with all the attributes of the ethereal and sublime which are generously accorded it, serves in America today as an advertisement for commodities which one must acquire in order to be able to hear music.” I don’t know about 1938, but I can see clear evidence of this in my lifetime. Music videos have Beats headphones or speakers in them as often as they have booty shorts. My first portable music player was a HitClip, for which you paid $3.99 to listen to a one-minute “HitClips special mix” of a song in incredibly low quality. Now, even more explicitly, the biggest albums of the year are not just albums — they’re also advertisements. Lemonade is Tidal’s biggest ad push ever. Coloring Book was a massive billboard for Apple Music. I think both of those albums are masterful artworks that make big statements, but I also think they were constructed and packaged with their distribution quite obviously in mind. Some Drake and Taylor Swift songs have literally been turned into ads. But maybe this doesn’t change anything. After all, pop music and capitalism have always had to walk hand in hand. Micah: Music and commercialism are tied at the hip, and they always will be. The good thing is these exclusives won’t last forever. Once Apple Music gets enough subscribers to become profitable — two to three years would be my guess — these exclusives will stop making financial sense. Tidal’s fate will have been determined by that time as well. Universal Music Group has already pulled the plug on future exclusives after Frank Ocean dropped an independent album with Apple Music days after completing his contract with the label. music and commercialism are tied at the hip Some relationships, like Beyoncé with Tidal (or whatever Tidal will be in a few years) and Drake with Apple Music will stand the test of time. But in a few years’ time, when both Apple Music and Spotify have around 75 million people each paying them $10 a month for music, I expect exclusive releases will no longer be a major inconvenience. Kaitlyn: So 2016 is a limbo year, and we’re still waiting for the market to course-correct? Micah: 2016 has been an unmitigated disaster for everyone, and music fans weren’t exempt. But I think 2017 will be better. Hopefully. Music switches formats every decade or so, and exclusives are just the latest way to make streaming catch on. I think we can safely say by the time Rihanna, Beyoncé, Kanye West, Drake, and Frank Ocean decide to drop “I’m switching streaming services” worthy projects in the same year again, market will have corrected itself.

The game is now fully compatible with the Apple Watch, according to an announcement posted by the game’s official website on Thursday. The launch comes more than three months after Apple and game developer Niantic Labs revealed the game would be coming to the smartwatch, and follows recent speculation that Niantic Labs had shelved plans for the Apple Watch version of Pokémon Go. When playing Pokémon Go on the Apple Watch, gamers will be able to log a Pokémon-hunting session as a workout, giving players a way to count that movement toward their daily fitness goals, according to the game’s website. Any steps logged with the Apple Watch will also bring players closer to hatching their eggs, which usually require gamers to walk a certain distance in order to get a new critter emerge. Users will also receive alerts on their watch that tell them when a Pokémon is approaching, which should help cut down on headlines about gamers wandering into traffic because they were staring down at their phone. Apple Watch wearers won’t be able to totally ditch their phone when playing Pokémon Go, however — players must still use their phone to actually catch a Pokémon.

Credit: flickr / Blogtrepreneur More like this App developers not ready for stricter iOS security requirements What IT needs to know about iOS 10 Why (and how) you should manage Windows PCs like iPhones Video IT security: 3 things you need to know now Apple has backtracked on a plan to force iOS developers to encrypt their app communications by the end of the year. The company had previously announced at its Worldwide Developers’ Conference in June that all apps submitted to the App Store will need to support the App Transport Security (ATS) feature starting on January 1, 2017. It has not yet set a new deadline. ATS is a feature first introduced in iOS 9 that forces apps to communicate with internet servers using encrypted HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS) connections. It's an improvement over the third-party frameworks that developers previously used to implement HTTPS because it ensures that only industry-standard encryption protocols and ciphers are used. Even if ATS is enabled by default in iOS, on a technical level app developers can disable some of its features or can opt out of it entirely through various exception settings that ATS makes available. A recent study performed by security firm Appthority on the top 200 apps present on iOS enterprise devices showed that 97 percent of them bypassed at least some ATS requirements and weakened the default and recommended configurations. Apple planned to include ATS compliance as a requirement in its App Store review process starting next year and to require reasonable justifications for any exceptions. However, as the Appthority study showed, many developers are unprepared to fully enable ATS in their apps. "At WWDC 2016 we announced that apps submitted to the App Store will be required to support ATS at the end of the year," Apple said in an announcement on its developer site Wednesday. "To give you additional time to prepare, this deadline has been extended and we will provide another update when a new deadline is confirmed." There are many reasons why developers might not be ready or even able to encrypt all of their apps' traffic. For example, many apps integrate with third-party advertising, analytics, and media hosting services -- and the adoption of HTTPS by those services is not something that app developers can control. As of December 22, the earlier 3 percent ATS readiness figure among iOS apps had grown to only 5 percent, Appthority researchers said Thursday in a blog post. "We assume that Apple, too, realized that an unacceptably high number of apps would fail to meet the ATS deadline unless it was extended." The researchers believe that even if Apple hasn't abandoned its plans for full ATS compliance, this is not something that can be achieved very soon, which is probably why a new deadline hasn't been announced yet. "In light of this new development, we recommend that enterprises track the state of apps’ ATS compliance and consider alternatives to apps that access sensitive corporate data and don’t secure their network connections using ATS," the Appthority researchers said.

Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Dec 23, 2016 at 9:00AM Image source: Google. I wouldn't go so far as to say that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has failed in catalyzing the smartwatch market over the past year and a half, but I also wouldn't say that Apple Watch has been a blockbuster success. Sure, Apple Watch is easily the most successful smartwatch to date, but that doesn't actually say a whole lot since it's one of the first wearable devices in the nascent category. There isn't much competition to begin with. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) technically beat Apple by a few months, with Android Wear devices becoming available in late 2014. Since then, Apple has taken over and Android Wear has hit a wall. The search giant just re-acqui-hired some smartwatch engineers in preparation of its big 2017 push, as Android Wear 2.0 was recently delayed until next year amid lack of hardware partners. Meanwhile, just days after Google unveiled the Pixel, the first smartphone that it fully designed, rumors surfaced that the search giant was working on its own flagship smartwatches. It turns out those rumors were at least partially true. A tale of two flagship smartwatches  In an exclusive interview yesterday with The Verge, Android Wear product manager Jeff Chang confirmed that the company has two flagship smartwatches in the pipeline for the first quarter. The wearable pair will be the first devices to run Android Wear 2.0. Despite the smartwatch market's recent hesitation, Google still wants to show consumers that smartwatches are viable products that can add value to people's lives. Simply put, Google wants to save the smartwatch market. However, Google isn't designing the smartwatches entirely by itself, nor is it manufacturing them. Instead, Google is taking the same approach that it did with the Nexus phones of yore, where it collaborates with a third-party original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to develop the devices, which will primarily carry that OEM's brand. Chang declined to specify which OEM it is partnering with, beyond noting that it is a current Android Wear partner. That's a sprawling list, but more than likely it'll be one of the familiar Android OEMs like Huawei, Samsung, LG, or Motorola, among a few other candidates. Notably, HTC has not released an Android Wear device (yet), so although it is manufacturing the Pixel, we can safely rule out the Taiwanese company. 2017: The year of the smartwatch? The key to unlocking the smartwatch market's potential will be to empower devices for general purposes. Thus far, manufacturers have focused heavily on fitness functionalities, given wearables' natural applications for tracking activity metrics. Whether or not Android Wear 2.0 can deliver this remains to be seen, although it has potential. The major headliners of the update will be stand-alone apps, additional user customizations, and requisites like messaging and notifications. While Google can't singlehandedly save the smartwatch market, the subsequent and persistent competition will inevitably improve all products within the category, and that may do the trick.

Of course now that AirPods have finally been released, all has been forgiven and forgotten. Well, that’s not entirely true — Apple fans are now agitated for a different reason: AirPods are next to impossible to actually get your hands on. Don't Miss: Behold: The edgeless iPhone 8 you’ve always dreamt of It’s the same old story… Apple launches a new product and it’s out of stock everywhere. The fact that AirPods were delayed by more than a month suggested that supply would likely be extra tight at launch, and that certainly seems to be the case. New AirPods orders placed on Apple’s website won’t ship for an estimated six weeks, and online orders placed for in-store pickup won’t be available until sometime in February, according to Apple’s online store. But there’s something you should know: Apple stores across the country get additional AirPods shipments constantly, so you can score a pair much sooner if you time it right. And now, there’s a new website that takes all the guesswork out of the equation. Reddit user “3picide” created a simple web-based tool called Fruit Basket, which serves a single purpose. Simply enter your postal code and the site will show you whether or not AirPods are in stock in any nearby Apple store locations. The answer is almost always no, of course, so the site constantly rechecks store inventory to see if new shipments have arrived. In the event that AirPods appear in stock at any stores in your area, the site will pop up a notification and play a sound to let you know. Then, it’s off to the races — place an order online for in-store pickup as quickly as you can, or call to see if they’ll hold a pair for you (most Apple store employees won’t but some will). Fruit Basket is completely free to use, but you can donate to the developer using PayPal if you’d like.

Just moments before, however, OBJ, the most emotional player in the league, had a meltdown a few feet outside the Giants locker room in the tunnel leading from the field. He stood facing a metal door with his helmet off and in full uniform. He was growling loudly and flexing his arms. He is such an intense player and such a competitor, but this was even a bit much for him. Team security came over and ushered him back towards the locker room. He was walked part way by Giants co-owner John Mara. Reporters were able to catch part of his outburst on their camera phones, leading Frank Mara, a team executive, to mutter, “Let’s make sure we tweet that one.” Inside the locker room following the 24-19 loss, I asked Beckham about his behavior in the tunnel. He looked the other way without answering. A few minutes later, I asked him if there was a reason he ignored my question. He ignored it again. Some Giants puzzled over questionable calls in loss to Eagles Odell Beckham let his emotions fly after Thursday's loss to the Eagles.  (Al Bello/Getty Images) Beckham was targeted 20 times by Eli Manning and caught 11 passes for 150 yards, but Philly kept him out of the end zone. “We had our own destiny in our hands,” he said. “We just didn’t come up with it.” The locker room was quiet. The Giants were looking to clinch their first playoff appearance since 2011, but now will have to wait at least until Saturday. They will still likely clinch the No. 1 wild-card spot and the No. 5 seed on Saturday if the Packers or Bucs lose or tie, the Falcons lose or the Lions lose to or tie the Cowboys on Monday night. But any slim hope they had of making up the two-game difference on the Cowboys in the NFC East is over. Dallas clinched the division and the NFC’s No. 1 seed with the Giants loss. Odell Beckham was growling to himself, losing it outside locker room. Team security & John Mara guided him into locker room eventually pic.twitter.com/ebdB8dH787— Pat Leonard (@PLeonardNYDN) December 23, 2016 The Giants will make it to the wild card round unless everything works against them the next 10 days, but they wanted to do the work on their own and celebrate in the locker room and on the bus ride home. They don’t want to back in. Ultimately, it doesn’t matter as long as they get in. In all likelihood, the last game of the regular season on New Year’s Day in Washington will be meaningless. Janoris Jenkins ruled out for Giants' game vs. Eagles But instead of relaxing on the holiday weekend, they will be scoreboard watching. “We came in here expecting to win and we didn’t get it done,” Olivier Vernon said. “That’s on us. The Eagles played good football and we just didn’t get the job done.” 22 photos view gallery From Kate Upton to Noah Syndergaard: The Sports Tweets of the Year On a night when nothing went right for Big Blue, Eli Manning couldn’t bail them out in the last couple of minutes as he had done so many times in his career, including two Super Bowls. He had a miserable game, tossing three interceptions, the first one a Pick-6 to put the Giants in a 14-0 hole in the first quarter and the last one when he couldn’t get anything on a throw to Will Tye, who didn’t come back and fight for the ball, and it was picked off at the Eagles 11 with five seconds left. John Jerry had a crucial false start on a fourth-and-1 at the Eagles’ 32 on the second to last drive after an instant replay reversal correctly took away a first down by Beckham. Jerry’s jump led to Manning throwing incomplete to Sterling Shepard, who didn’t draw a flag when it appeared he was interfered with on the play. Follow the Daily News Sports on Facebook. "Like" us here. Earlier, Eli Apple and Vernon were hit with roughing calls that added to a bad year all around by the officials. Apple tried to fall out of the way of Carson Wentz, who was sliding. Wentz’s helmet smacked into Apple’s chest and Apple was flagged. On the next play, Apple was beaten for a 40-yard TD by Nelson Agholor to give the Eagles a 21-6 lead in the second quarter. Olivier Vernon says Giants didn't play up to their expectations. (Rich Schultz/Getty Images) Vernon’s third quarter penalty didn’t cost the Giants any points, but it did cost them 15 yards. He had Wentz wrapped up and was in the process of taking him down. As Wentz was about to start falling, he threw the ball away. Vernon was called for roughing. It’s hard to say which call was worse: The one on Apple or Vernon. “My arms were around him and my face was at his back,” Vernon said. “I don’t know what they want me to do.” Either the NFL goes ahead and puts the quarterbacks in red jerseys or they start letting the defense play tackle football. Of course, if Cam Newton was watching, he had to be wondering when he will ever get one of these calls. 20 photos view gallery The Daily News' Best Back Pages of 2016 One play before his final interception, Manning tried to hit Beckham in the end zone. The ball sailed past him. But Beckham blamed himself for not catching up to it. “I just didn’t make the play,” he said. “It was out where it needed to be. I just needed a little more gas in me to go get it. When you get into that two-minute situation at the end of the game and you run a 30-yard route, you come back and run another 30-yard route and then you come back and try to get it again — I just didn’t have enough gas to go get it.” The Giants wasted an opportunity to clinch on their own and it hurt. “We wanted to come in here and take care of business,” Beckham said, “We didn’t do that. But it’s not the end of the season.” The Giants were still beating themselves up for losing this game. Nobody more than Beckham.  Tags: nfl new york giants philadelphia eagles nfl playoffs odell beckham jr. eli manning olivier vernon Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories, delivered to your inbox.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending Buying Guides iPhone 8 Nintendo Switch Samsung Galaxy S8 MacBook Pro CES 2017 iOS 10.2 News The highs and lows for Microsoft in 2016 The highs and lows for Microsoft in 2016 By Dan Grabham   What do you mean 2016 wasn’t a good year? Despite some difficult decisions, it was a great year for Microsoft Shares There’s no doubt that this year has been a success for Microsoft, as it continues to refine its focus after the mistakes made in the Ballmer era with Windows 8 and the Nokia acquisition. It introduced some great new hardware, too, such as Xbox One S, Surface Studio and Surface Dial, building on the success of Surface Book and continues to reinvent itself as a company almost unrecognisable from the reliance on basics of the Gates era.  Satya Nadella continues to be a CEO to be reckoned with, cutting where necessary and investing effectively in cloud and mobile services.  The Microsoft of today is more robust, able to better react. And still it continues to be one of the world’s most innovative companies. Despite the massive losses on its ill-fated Nokia foray, Microsoft’s finances are doing well due to it being one of the leaders in cloud computing – revenue from Microsoft’s cloud platform, Azure, grew 116 percent last quarter. As a result, its share price hit an all-time high. But there were numerous low points in 2016, too, and we’ve got them all here for you. Without further ado, here are all the highs and lows for Microsoft in 2016! Surface Studio. Wow! This was the year when Microsoft out-Appled Apple. Microsoft’s October Surface event – although lacking some of the focus and soundbites of an Apple Special Event – may turn out to be a watershed moment for the corporation. 24 hours before the MacBook Pro was announced, Microsoft took the wraps off the stunning Surface Studio, that turns the iMac up to 9 and folds down so you can use it for design work. Many creatives were left stunned. The best bit though, is the super Surface Dial (a Bluetooth disk-shaped peripheral) that enables you to control a variable – such as a colour palette – with one hand while working with your other hand. The Surface Keyboard was also pretty cool, too. Microsoft’s message to creatives: you are welcome here. Surface Book no longer ‘the ultimate laptop’ – where is USB-C? The original expensive-but-wonderful Surface Book has been going great guns, generating big revenues for Microsoft. The firm said that Surface sales enjoyed their biggest numbers ever in November, staying strong on both sides of the Atlantic, with the ‘best single week’ ever recorded in the UK. Microsoft has announced that its new Surface Book with Performance Base (the Core i7 revamp of the device) will go on sale in the UK and Australia at the start of next year, having been a success in North America. But it isn’t really an improvement on last year’s model and still lacks USB-C. We no longer think Microsoft can claim the Surface Book is ‘the ultimate laptop’ without it. Microsoft's Surface Book is among the best laptops of 2016 Just don’t mention phones   Although we’re still really rather convinced we’ll get the Surface Phone in 2017, 2016 was the annus horribilis to work in mobile at Microsoft. Around 1,850 jobs were culled in late May, most of whom were ex-Nokiaites in Finland, and cost $950 million (around £650 million, or AU$1.3 billion), around $200 million (around £140 million, or AU$280 million) of which will be in staff severance packages. Microsoft also sold what remained of Nokia’s old feature phones biz to Foxconn. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella did what needed to be done, marking the Nokia acquisition out as a complete mistake. Not only did Microsoft miss the phone rise in the first place, it then came up with a genuinely good mobile OS only to then under develop it. The feeling remains that Microsoft could have made a success of Windows Mobile. Security arguments with Google The year wasn’t without security scares elsewhere (looking at you, Yahoo) but a (slightly amusing) situation occurred in November when Google revealed a critical zero-day Windows vulnerability within Windows. Microsoft wasn’t happy that Google made the flaw public. Terry Myerson, head of the Windows and Devices Group at Microsoft, said: “Google’s decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk.” Presumably Google didn’t really care about that when it saw the opportunity to get on over on Redmond. Still, Microsoft has made strides in security this year, announcing in August that it was making changes to how it vets drivers for the operating system – all of these must now be digitally signed by Microsoft itself. Upgrade woes The Windows 10 free upgrade offer ended in the summer, but it wasn’t before Microsoft forced Windows 10 on everybody it possibly could (including my father-in-law, thanks for that headache, Microsoft). Microsoft pushed the OS hard with its Get Windows 10 software and nag screens, and other measures which meant that some folks ended up having the Windows 10 installation fire up of its own accord (possibly the result of a messy bug which Microsoft admitted to in November 2015).  Others clicked the X at the top of the window thinking that it would bin the update when, in fact, it lined it up. UK consumer watchdog Which had over 1,000 complaints about Windows 10, and that it caused a number of conflicts with hardware – in particular printers, speakers and Wi-Fi were mentioned. The organisation also observed that some consumers had been left with a PC so badly hobbled that they ended up paying a third-party to repair the machine.  Californian Teri Goldstein successfully sued Microsoft to the tune of $10,000 (about £7,515, AU$13,554) after her work computer was supposedly wrecked from an unwarranted Windows 10 upgrade. As a result, changes to the Windows 10 upgrade enabled users to opt out of the update entirely, as well as making it so that closing the dialogue box actually declines the update, rather than sit on standby until it's time to install. Dear LinkedIn: Microsoft's invitation is waiting for your response  Microsoft bought LinkedIn this year, which seems like a logical step – providing everybody continues to use it, that is. The main reason Microsoft wants it is that it’s a ready-made social network that operates in the place that it does – in the corporate and business world. Microsoft clearly wants to integrate it deeply within Office and Windows.  LinkedIn Learning – the recently introduced online education portal which offers thousands of courses – will also be accessible across Office 365, and indeed the rest of the Windows ecosystem. Microsoft’s chief executive also said that LinkedIn notifications would be flagged up in the Action Center under Windows (although, of course, you’ll be able to squash them if you prefer).  Interestingly, news also broke earlier this year that Facebook tried to buy Facebook in 2007 dfor $24 billion. In an interview with CNBC, Ballmer revealed that Microsoft had offered $24 billion for Facebook in 2007 when it was “itsy bitsy.” Microsoft has owned a 1.6 percent stake in the social network since then. Windows 10 got even better The Windows 10 Anniversary Update arrived on August 2. It included improvements to Cortana, the ability to interact with your Android phone, a dark theme, Start menu changes, better Task View, browser extensions in Edge (finally!), Windows Hello fingerprint authentication, a new Skype universal app, Windows Ink and more.  Later preview builds of Windows 10 which incorporates a number of smart embellishments for Windows Ink, including a new Stencils feature and integration with the Photos app. We’ll see more features arrive on Windows 10 in the Spring.  Naturally, the Anniversary Update also caused a few issues which Microsoft hurriedly had to fix.  Windows Defender also gained the ability to augment the features of apps fom third-party security vendors, but the third-party vendors – including Kaspersky - criticised Microsoft for trying to push Windows Defender too heavily. A new Xbox! And another one SOON It’s always good to have a new console and this year we had a truckload of upgrades. It appears that the days of waiting years for a new console generation are now over, with iterative upgrades appearing to be the way forward. The Xbox One S was announced at E3 and has sold well over recent months. It’s a fairly basic upgrade to the Xbox One, featuring HDR support and 4K Blu-ray (bizarrely missing from the PS4 Pro).  The big uptick for Microsoft console gamers should kick in next year, with Project Scorpio – a Xbox capable of 4K gaming that will go up against the 4K-capable PS4 Pro.    Goodbye Microsoft Band Although Microsoft is saying hello to plenty of devices, it’s saying goodbye to others – it looks like actually-not-too-bad Microsoft Band 2 won’t get a follow-up, although with wearable sales tanking that’s not too much of a surprise we guess. The company has supposedly dissolved a team of engineers tasked to getting Windows 10 running on the existing Microsoft Band and Band 2.  The Band 2 was also heavily discounted as well. Instead of producing the next Band 3, Microsoft might be focusing on improving its software as it has also stated "we continue to invest and innovate in the Microsoft Health platform, which is open to all hardware and apps partners across Windows, iOS, and Android devices." Office 365 on the up If you speak to anyone in the media and publishing world, they all use Google stuff. But most companies just aren’t like that. The EMEA Cloud Report from data protection outfit Bitglass surveyed around 8,000 companies and found that 43% of enterprises used Office 365, compared to 22% on Google Apps.  In total, 66% (rounding up) of companies were using one of this pair of heavyweight productivity suites, which was up considerably from 59% in 2015.Turns out that Office 365 is doing rather well thank you. Flexibility and familiarity are key. Microsoft Teams – the jury’s still out That feeling when you think "we should buy a full page in the Times and publish an open letter," and then you do. 💫 pic.twitter.com/BQiEawRA6dNovember 2, 2016 Talking of biz software, Microsoft (finally) revealed its Slack and HipChat challenger in early November. Called Microsoft Teams, it’ll be successful as it’s part of Office 365. And it clearly had Slack worried. I mean, if you take out a newspaper ad saying you’re not worried and giving advice on how to make an app that’s basically a glorified mashup of chatrooms and MSN Messenger, then you’re definitely worried. Windows 10 adoption slows to a crawl Hardly anybody new is upgrading to Windows 10 with the adoption rate around 23 percent according to Netmarketshare. Recent stats showed that Windows 7 is still the clear leader, sitting on 48.38% in October – more than double the market share of Windows 10. The older OS actually gained 0.11% month on month.  While the figures for Windows 10 free upgrades were encouraging, it’s still pretty clear that a lot of people just aren’t interested in a new version of Windows, preferring to stick with what they know. Gamers have traditionally been keener to adopt Windows 10 thanks to DirectX 12 being exclusive to the platform, and around 50% of the denizens of Steam now use the newest operating system. Hope for Cortana Microsoft’s virtual assistant seems a little stuck in no-man’s land as Alexa, Google Assistant and even Siri rake in headlines. News of a Cortana Android and iOS app were met with general non-plussedness, but recent weeks have seen something very interesting – Cortana in third-party hardware products including kitchen appliances and connected home tech like thermostats.  First up in an Echo-esque Harman Kardon speaker. Could Cortana yet stand up for herself?

A patent troll is a term for a company whose business is solely based on licensing the use of patents to other companies. Sometimes these licensing deals are negotiated amicably, and sometimes they’re settled in a protracted legal battle. Photo Trolls have been around for some time, and a few years ago, many in Silicon Valley argued that trolls were a crippling drag on the industry, particularly on start-ups that don’t have the financial resources to fight. But there was thought by people in the tech industry that the most egregious examples of their patent exploitation had eased in recent years, which brings us back to Apple and Nokia. There is little dispute that most of the Nokia patents are legitimate. Before the company came undone mostly because of competition from outfits like Apple, Nokia was a pioneer in mobile phones. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The issue, as is usually the case, is money. For the last five years, Apple has licensed a portfolio of Nokia products. But the two companies have not been able to negotiate a new deal. Adding another wrinkle is Nokia’s intellectual property partners. Nokia has divided its portfolio and transferred parts of it to Acacia Research and Conversant Intellectual Property Management: Both companies find ways to make money from the patents, and then share the proceeds with Nokia. Apple says Acacia and Conversant have filed 52 cases against it around the world, many of which assert violations of Nokia patents. Apple also says that’s an attempt to unfairly increase costs; it has filed an antitrust suit to stop Nokia. But it seems unlikely the fight will be over anytime soon.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming CES 2017 GPS & Sat Nav Mobile Apps Mobile Phone Accessories Mobile Phones Tablets Wearables & Fitness Trending: Christmas Gift Guide Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / News / Fitness News / Could the Apple Watch 3 be the slimmest smartwatch yet? Could the Apple Watch 3 be the slimmest smartwatch yet? by Chris Smith 23 December 2016 0 shares Read Comments The Apple Watch Series 2 is not long out of the gate and folks are already thinking about what the next iteration might bring. Apple is assisting with that speculation courtesy of a newly published patent suggesting it has found a way to make the watch slimmer. The patent explains how the haptic motor within the Apple Watch could be housed by a band attachment in future iterations. Related: Apple Watch Series 2 is wearable of the year The motor, which sends haptic feedback to the wearer, could be a go between between the band and the watch and could also be placed in the watch clasp. In a filing entitled “Band Attachment Mechanism with Haptic Response,” the tech involved in the patent could enable Apple to free up space within the watch face itself. Apple has listed both wired and wireless ways of implementing the idea within the patent filing. Such a method would potentially make it more complicated and more expensive to change watch bands which currently feature no electronics. However, as we learned with the iPhone 7 and MacBook Pro, Apple isn’t shy of inconveniencing folks when it comes to slimming down its tech. Apple Watch vs Apple Watch Series 2 Does the Apple Watch really need to be slimmer?

Players have been hoping for a Pokemon GO Christmas event. With the overwhelming success and appealing features of the Halloween event and the Thanksgiving event offering a lot of the same, many Pokemon GO players were more than a bit miffed to find out that the first big update of December wasn’t as full-featured as expected. But hopes for a Pokemon GO Christmas event were still high, especially since Niantic Labs had rolled out past holiday events on the Monday before the holiday. Miyagi Prefecture generates ¥2 billion from #PokemonGO event →https://t.co/GMorMqlnsx (via @japanese3ds) pic.twitter.com/Mx60FW2bUT — Pokémon GO News (@PokemonGoNews) December 20, 2016 December 19, however, came and went with no Christmas event — there was a Pokemon GO update rolled out, mainly designed to squash a minor bug (vibrating alerts even when there’s no Pokemon sighting), but that didn’t lower buddy distance requirements for candy, double XP, and candy rewards for catching a Pokemon or make certain creatures more common. iDigitalTimes reported on Monday that chances of a Pokemon GO Christmas event didn’t look good, predicting that Niantic would get a lot of backlash from gamers if they were simply going to celebrate the holidays with a festive Pikachu and a few Generation 2 eggs. “Get your pitchforks ready guys, a Niantic hate train is coming.” Then again, it was reported on that same day that Niantic had included some code hinting at a Christmas event. The Silph Road wrote that the code included Apple Watch support, Christmas gift boxes with still-unknown content, and a new shop button design to celebrate the holidays. Yesterday, Niantic began rolling out its latest Pokemon GO update, and just as expected, it comes with Apple Watch support. According to the Verge, the update doesn’t represent a “full game” version for Apple’s smartwatch, but rather a Watch companion app that allows you to perform some in-game actions without having to take your iPhone out of your pocket. #PokemonGO is now available on the Apple Watch! https://t.co/L4cYBGi0oq pic.twitter.com/lmuYLYzsgl — Pokémon GO (@PokemonGoApp) December 22, 2016 The Apple Watch companion app’s features include the ability to get notifications about nearby Pokemon and PokeStops, hatching eggs, and new medals, as well as the ability to count distance required to hatch Pokemon eggs or receive candy through your buddy. There’s also a feature that allows players to log game sessions as workouts. Unfortunately, it looks like the new Pokemon GO update hasn’t triggered a holiday event as many had hoped. There are some minor text updates included, but there haven’t been any signs of a Pokemon GO Christmas event observed since the patch rolled out. There hasn’t been a fix either for a freezing glitch reported by both Android and iOS users. The Inquisitr reported on this glitch earlier this week, and it looks like the best things to do if your game remains stuck on the home screen (the one with Santa Pikachu, Snorlax, and the Christmas lights) are to force-quit the game and restart it or to turn off GPS. These are both unofficial workarounds, as gamers continue waiting for Niantic to squash the bug on a future update. Be that as it may, the one thing most players really want this week is a Pokemon GO Christmas event. The chances of that are still reasonable, given the APK sightings the Silph Road had picked up earlier this week, but Christmas is just two days away and the latest Pokemon GO update, while introducing all-important Apple Watch support, hasn’t coincided with the activation of any such event. Still, as Forbes had pointed out, it may also be possible that Niantic is delaying the update in order to cover all the other December holidays and not just Christmas.

The problem is significant enough that it might just topple Apple's machine from its throne. Consumer Reports decided to pass on recommending Apple's new line of laptops because the battery performance varied wildly during its tests. Apple fans were hoping that this refresh would fix some of the battery problems that plagued the previous line of MacBook Pros, but the results have been disappointing. From Consumer Reports: For instance, in a series of three consecutive tests, the 13-inch model with the Touch Bar ran for 16 hours in the first trial, 12.75 hours in the second, and just 3.75 hours in the third. The 13-inch model without the Touch Bar worked for 19.5 hours in one trial but only 4.5 hours in the next. And the numbers for the 15-inch laptop ranged from 18.5 down to 8 hours. Those were just a few of the results; we tested battery life on these laptops repeatedly.﻿ Jerry Beilinson, the Consumer Reports editor who wrote the report said that laptop's battery life typically varies by about five percent in tests. Obviously, the above MacBook Pro results are slightly more dramatic than five percent. It seems like Apple is making attempts to fix the battery problem via software updates, but the only thing we've really noticed so far is that Apple removed the indicator that shows how much time is left before the battery dies. Ars Technica has some great details on what may be causing some of the latest MacBook's battery woes. One thing that sticks out to me is that all of these new MacBooks come with a dedicated GPU, instead of offering integrated graphics in years past. Sure, the graphics performance is undoubtedly better and takes a little heat off the processor when you're using an external monitor, but it can do some damage on the battery. As Ars notes, the new MacBooks will dynamically switch between using the dedicated GPU and integrated graphics, but there's no way to completely disable the onboard GPU. So for the first time in awhile, it seems like Apple's MacBook Pros might not be the best laptop on the market. Embarrassing for Apple. Might we suggest the Dell XPS 13 instead?

Follow TechnoBuffalo Manufacturers in charge of developing Apple’s new A10X processors, reportedly bound for the company’s iPads due sometime next spring, may be hitting some speed bumps. The result could possibly end up in delays of Apple’s iPads beyond the expected March launch date, DigiTimes said on Friday. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is heading up development of the 10nm chips, DigiTimes said but isn’t able to build as many as it had hoped to at once. “TSMC is scheduled to start making Apple’s A10X chips for the next-generation iPad series slated for launch in March 2017,” DigiTimes explained. “Unsatisfactory yields for the foundry’s 10nm process could disrupt the schedule, the sources indicated.” Apple never promised iPads in March This isn’t necessarily written in stone. For one, Apple can tap other chip-makers to help build processors if it feels that TSMC isn’t able to build enough in time. Also, while we normally expect to iPads in the spring, Apple hasn’t gone on the record promising anything in March just yet, which means there’s really no expectation for it to deliver new iPads in March versus a month or two later. If, though, we get to that point and we still haven’t heard a whisper as to why Apple hasn’t talked about new iPads, then perhaps we’ll be able to look back at this report to get a better understanding as to why.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Dec 23, 2016 at 10:26AM In this segment from Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analyst Dylan Lewis and senior technology specialist Daniel Sparks explain how Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) new autonomous car subsidiary, Waymo, is de-risking its efforts on self-driving car technology, and how this provides both upsides and downsides for the business' potential in the long run. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Dec. 16, 2016. Dylan Lewis: The quote from John, as we'll refer to him: "We're in the business of making better drivers. We're a self-driving car company, not a car company." I think, if you look back at some of the things that have happened in the last month or so, you see that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) seems to be taking kind of a similar route with their autonomous driving ambitions. Daniel Sparks: Right. We see these big tech companies, and then you look at the giant automobile segments, where companies like Alphabet and Apple don't have any significant revenue, and in theory, it looks like this awesome opportunity for Alphabet and Apple to start making these cars. Maybe that's why a lot of the speculation received so much attention, thinking about a Google-branded or Apple-branded car is a really powerful idea. It could open up the companies to huge new revenue opportunities. But, when you actually get down to think about it, especially in Alphabet's case, it would really be out of their core competency to start making cars. Even Apple, by outsourcing their manufacturing and building Apple-branded hardware products, along with their software, cars is just a whole 'nother breed. It's a really capital-intensive business. By Alphabet doing this -- and now, like we're going to talk about, Apple focusing on the software part of the business -- it really de-risks these new segments. But on the other hand, may decrease some of the potential upside if things do go well. Lewis: Yeah, you look at the margin profile for the car business and the smartphone business, and they are dramatically different. It would be very tough to achieve high-30% margins in cars. For as much as I know about the industrials business, I know that. So, you can understand why these huge tech companies are instead choosing to focus on something that's super scalable and can be easily brought into millions of cars without actually having to manufacture them themselves.

BUSINESS 'Pokemon Go' is available on Apple Watch despite rumors Niantic is ditching plans Pokemon Go Roslan Abdul Rahman / AFP/Getty Images "Pokemon Go," and its popular character Pikachu, are now available as an app on the Apple Watch. "Pokemon Go," and its popular character Pikachu, are now available as an app on the Apple Watch. (Roslan Abdul Rahman / AFP/Getty Images) Associated Press The popular mobile game “Pokemon Go” is now available on the Apple Watch, squashing rumors that the game's maker was scrapping such plans. The game involves catching digital pocket monsters in an augmented-reality version of your surroundings. The Apple Watch version will let you discover nearby Pokemon and collect special items, such as potions, from nearby “PokeStops.” But once you encounter a Pokemon, you will need to use your iPhone to catch it. Still, the Apple Watch should make it easier for players to log their steps (needed to advance in the game and to hatch new Pokemon out of eggs), and to avoid walking around with their phones held out to search for nearby monsters. “Pokemon Go” was a huge success when it came out in July. It's not clear how the Apple Watch version will do, especially now that it's too cold in much of the Northern Hemisphere to be outside catching Pokemon. Plans for the watch version had been announced at Apple's iPhone launch event in September. The game's maker, Niantic, hasn't announced any plans for Android Wear and Samsung Gear smartwatches.

Credit: Thinkstock More like this What IT needs to know about iOS 10 Uniting the digital enterprise Why (and how) you should manage Windows PCs like iPhones Video Samsung Galaxy Note7 iris scanner review When Apple in July announced it would require all iOS apps to use a technology called "App Transport Security" by the start of 2017, the move was widely regarded as a positive one for user privacy. Now, just barely a week before the deadline, Apple pulled back and extended the deadline indefinitely. The requirement, if implemented, would fill a significant security hole on iOS devices, according to experts.  Apple takes a strong and public position in favor of protecting its users' privacy. The highest profile example of this is perhaps the company's standoff in January with the FBI over its insistence that data be encrypted on iOS devices at rest, regardless of the owner or reasons for a government's requests to override those protections. (In that case, the intelligence agency wanted access to an alleged terrorist's personal device to scrape it for evidence and other information). What is App Transport Security? App Transport Security requires mobile apps to encrypt data in transit using HTTPS, thereby encrypting all data that is transported across the network via iOS devices, according to Robbie Forkish, vice president of engineering at Appthority, a mobile risk analysis firm that also sells assessment services for mobile devices, apps and APIs.  "To give you additional time to prepare, this deadline has been extended and we will provide another update when a new deadline is confirmed," Apple wrote Wednesday evening in a brief note to developers. The company originally introduced App Transport Security in iOS 9 in September 2015 but uptake has been tepid. Appthority earlier this month concluded in a report that just 3 percent of the top 200 iOS apps installed on enterprise devices worldwide meet Apple's security mandate. During the three weeks since that research was published, four additional apps added support for App Transport Security. "That takes the percentage from 3 percent to 5 percent," Forkish says. "Obviously there's a huge gap between having all the apps comply."  Why Apple wants stronger iOS app encryption Apple is pushing for the security tech to be adopted throughout the app ecosystem, following a trend that began a few years ago when HTTPS became the default in browsers, according to Forkish. "An increasing number of percentages across the web are now fully encrypted end to end," he says. "There's this gap where the majority of apps, in communicating with their backend servers, do so unencrypted. That kind of stands out now as an insecure part of the overall ecosystem." [Related: CIOs assess how Apple and Google approach enterprise apps] Enterprises should be concerned about this gap in security, and CIOs who have relied on Apple to provide necessary security are realizing that strategy is no longer viable, if it ever was, according to Forkish. CIOs need to be aware of the apps that don't support App Transport Security and seek out alternatives that provide the same productivity functions but in a more secure manner, he says. "It's hard to know why developers did not meet this deadline. There certainly was adequate time," he says. "The fact that they haven't announced a new date suggests to me that it's probably not in the next six months."  Forkish speculates that one of the problems could be a lack of security skills among iOS developers, who are more likely pressured to focus on time-to-market, size of the addressable market and quantifying the features of their apps compared to competitors' offerings. "Security may not be a concept that app developers, by and large, are familiar with," he says. "It wasn't an oppressive development challenge to implement App Transport Security." With no further explanation from Apple, the extension should also give enterprises cause for concern, according to Forkish. CIOs need to better understand how apps come to be in enterprise environments, as well as the different participants involved, he says. "A lot of CIOs are thinking more in terms of trust than just security, and if you can't trust that supply chain for your global apps then you really need to take steps to make sure you know how to separate the wheat from the chaff, so to speak."

Today TRVL, a team of a dozen staffers in Amsterdam and eight developers and designers in Rotterdam, announces its updated app for iOS. The update delivers more content, including photo galleries and four or five fresh stories a day (instead of one “magazine” every week, as before). The frequent crashes are supposed to stop. A search function has been added. Maps now load faster. And so forth. The three-year delay in updating the app is partly blamed on many of the tech team having been acqui-hired by Apple to help build out the launch of Apple News. Now they’re back in Europe and working on TRVL again. On the monetization front, TRVL will onboard its booking platform, which nets commissions on hotels and other travel products via Expedia Affiliate Network. In January it will add Booking.com’s inventory of 1 million hotels. It will soon start comparing prices of Booking.com, Expedia, and Hotels.com in real-time with every search result. It will add five currencies, including the euro and the pound, for buying travel. An iPhone version will debut, too. Jochem Wijnands, founder and chief executive, summarized the bigger picture for Tnooz like this: “This update is a first step to turning the TRVL app into a place where you find inspiration, and our booking engine, and meet local experts that can recommend destinations/hotels/neighborhoods ‘just for you.’ It will also be where your travel data lives.” TRVL remains significant as an experiment in presenting magazine-style content in the mobile-first era. In mere months after its debut, it quickly racked up a subscriber base that outpaced the (paying) readerships of many major national travel magazines, though the quality, diversity, and reliability of the content may not have been comparable. The latest changes suggest the final nail in the era of publishers dreaming of building app experiences that readers would pay subscriptions for and that would “keep” readers inside an app’s walls. The new TRVL is free, but it has dropped the magazine format pretensions. Soon TRVL will also publish video. It says it will re-introduce long-form stories, but this will not be the same thing as the old dreams. For a while, traditional print publishers raced to create TRVL-like experiences, often by hiring Adobe, but largely without gaining traction with readers. In a Medium blog post, Wijnands notes that non-traditional companies also struggled. “In September 2015, after we shipped Apple News, I returned from Cupertino. By then, the world of digital publishing had changed dramatically. Newsstand no longer existed. Flipboard was on its way out. Facebook’s instant articles had launched and paid content as a business model for digital publications was officially dead….” “Sadly, the online magazine didn’t survive either. TRVL might be the last manifestation of the hope that once possessed us all when the iPad was invented — ie., that it was possible to publish online magazines to rival or even better print magazines both in popularity and revenue…. “But that’s not what happened. The launch of Newsstand — built to support legacy publishers — was the first sign that things were going wrong. Downloading a 500MB magazine that was nothing more than a PDF of the print version wasn’t a good experience. This wasn’t why people had bought an iPad…. “So, while TRVL as a digital magazine didn’t seem to have much of a future, we decided that the premises that TRVL was built on most definitely did….” Now the industry waits to see if the latest attempts to meet market demands will thrive.

Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About News Apple asked to unlock the iPhone 4s of Russian ambassador’s assassin, report claims Chris Mills @chrisfmills December 22nd, 2016 at 6:12 PM Share Tweet Reports from Turkish media claim that Apple has been asked to help unlock an iPhone belonging to the Russian ambassador’s assassin. The device, a relatively archaic iPhone 4S, was reportedly recovered from 22-year-old Mevlut Mert Altıntas, a 22-year-old police officer who shot and killed Russia’s ambassador to Turkey .  The iPhone is said to be protected with a standard 4-digit passcode. In theory, and depending on the version of iOS installed on the device, the protection should be relatively easy to bypass. MacReports claims that Turkey has asked Apple for help unlocking the device, but “although Apple has not said anything yet, it is clear that Apple will not help.” In addition to Apple’s supposed support, Russia is also apparently sending a team of technical experts to Turkey to help examine the phone. Don't Miss: The best TV shows on Netflix you’ve never heard of The case echoes the long-running Apple vs FBI battle over unlocking the San Bernandino killer’s iPhone 5c earlier this year. There are important differences, however. Apple has historically complied with legal orders to unlock a device, within the limits of its ability. What it objected to in the San Bernandino case was writing software to specifically create a backdoor into iOS, which it said was a slippery slope that could fundamentally damage the security of iOS devices. Depending on the version of iOS in question here, that may not be necessary. Older versions of iOS, lacking full-device encryption and without the hardware protection of the Secure Enclave chip, are far more vulnerable. The iPhone 4S can run iOS 9, although versions of iOS 7 and onwards tend to slow the device down so much that many users stay on older versions.

She knows how nasty Eagles fans are because this is home. She knows how tough Lincoln Financial Field, and before it, the Vet, is for visiting players. And she knows that Eagles fans, especially around this time of year, are especially ornery. "These are the same people who booed Santa," Annie Apple wrote this week on SI.com. But instead of Santa, they booed her son Thursday night. Even if Eli Apple gave those angry Philly fans plenty to cheer about as the Giants failed to clinch the playoffs with a 24-19 loss. Odell Beckham freaks out near Giants’ locker room after loss "It's not a good feeling, ever," Eli Apple said of the loss. Eli Apple blows coverage and allows a touchdown to Nelson Agholor. (Michael Perez/AP) This was not the homecoming the Apples envisioned. The Giants' rookie was burned by both the refs and the Eagles in his first game back as a pro, a nightmarish set of events he won't soon forget, that contributed to the loss. Apple was born in Philly and grew up about 30 minutes outside the city. With Janoris Jenkins out with a back injury, he got the start at left corner, opposite Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. Apple grew up in the suburb of Voorhees, N.J., and played high school ball at Eastern Regional High School before going to Ohio State. He helped the Eagles build a 21-6 lead they would never relinquish. Eli Manning throws three picks in Giants' loss to Eagles He was first flagged for unnecessary roughness when his hand appeared to glance a sliding Carson Wentz at the tail end of a long run by the Eagles' QB. For what it's worth, the call was an awful one by the officials as Apple did everything he could to avoid making contact with Wentz. 22 photos view gallery From Kate Upton to Noah Syndergaard: The Sports Tweets of the Year "You're going full speed," Apple said. "It's tough." The penalty set the Eagles up with a first and 10 from the Giants 40. "I thought Eli was trying to protect the quarterback at the end, he was trying to pull off as the quarterback went down to slide to protect himself," Giants coach Ben McAdoo said. "We will get with the league, get an explanation, and get on the same page." Follow the Daily News Sports on Facebook. "Like" us here. Wentz found Nelson Agholor on the next play for a 40-yard touchdown behind Apple, extending the Philly lead to 15 points. The Giants were never able to overcome that early deficit. Apple walks off the field after taking a big hit. (Matt Rourke/AP) "I was on the other side, it was a zone blitz," Apple said. "I didn't see the guy until late, so that's on me." And in a matter of two plays, the Giants were essentially out of it and Eli Apple's homecoming was officially a nightmare. And he wasn't even dressed as Santa.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Consumer Reports: Don't buy the new MacBook Pro by David Goldman   @DavidGoldmanCNN December 23, 2016: 11:31 AM ET Hands on with the MacBook Pro If you've been drooling over Apple's flashy new MacBook Pro, you might want to stuff your stocking with a different laptop. Consumer Reports said Thursday that it has decided not to recommend Apple's new MacBook Pros, because the notebooks' battery life can be miserable. The issue isn't exactly new: Many MacBook Pro owners have been complaining on social media that their computers have short battery life. Consumer Reports' tests confirmed customers' gripes. The MacBook Pro's battery life was "highly inconsistent from one trial to the next," Consumer Reports said in its review. For example one MacBook Pro model ran 16 hours in one test and less than four hours in the next. Another got a stunning 19.5 hours of battery life in its best test, and dropped to a woeful 4.5 hours in its worst. Although battery life can vary from test to test, Consumer Reports said a fluctuation as large as the one it experienced on the MacBook Pro is extremely rare. Usually, laptop battery life only varies about 5% from test to test. Since Consumer Reports said averaging the battery life length would not reflect what a customer would actually experience, it decided to factor in the lowest battery life measured for each model. That resulted in some truly dreadful ratings. The 15-inch version received a score of 56 out of 100. The 13-inch version without the new Touch Bar got a 47, and the 13-inch MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar only got a score of 40. That's well south of the MacBook Air (70 of 100), which is half the price of the cheapest MacBook Pro that Consumer Reports reviewed. The $585 Acer Aspire even scored higher than the new MacBooks. Consumer Reports' best-reviewed model is the Vaio Z, which received an overall score of 81 out of 100. None of the MacBook Pro's scores were high enough for Consumer Reports to recommend them. It marked the first time Consumer Reports said consumers shouldn't buy a MacBook. An Apple (AAPL, Tech30) spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Related: Is the MacBook Pro's Touch Bar a gimmick? Apple claims that the new MacBook Pros get 10 hours of battery life. The new computers' most notable new feature is the Touch Bar, a touch-sensitive strip above the keyboard that changes functions based on the software running on screen. Consumer Reports and Apple have a checkered history. The magazine notoriously failed to recommend the iPhone 4 for its 'antennagate' signal issues, even though it rated the phone higher than any other smartphone on the market. That led to a crabby Steve Jobs giving a press conference, announcing that Apple would give every iPhone 4 customer a free case. But Consumer Reports was the first major publication to throw cold water on Apple's 'bendgate' phone cracking controversy. In lab tests, Consumer Reports found that the iPhone 6 was far more durable than YouTube videos made it appear.

Tech CES 2017 Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Super Bowl Ads     Are The Apple AirPods Waterproof? Find Out Here Posted: Dec 23 2016, 10:14am CST | by Ahmed Humayun, Updated: Dec 23 2016, 10:23am CST, in News | Apple     Are the Apple Airpods water proof? Lets put them through a water and drop test to check out their durability. Whenever Apple or any other company for that matter releases a new product people have to ask whether the product is water proof or not. Don't Miss: Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2016 As far as the Airpods are concerned Apple has not claimed the Airpods to be waterproof officially. In fact it would be recommended not to submerge them in water at all. However, a Youtuber EverythingApplePro took the Airpods through drop test, submerged them in water and even put them in a detergent laden washing machine. The results show that the Airpods are resistant to impact and water damage. They continue to perform with minor superficial damage after all the tests have been carried out. The Airpods went through the standard drop tests. They were dropped from waist and head height. They fell to the ground, bounced round a bit but inky suffered from minor scratches. Most astonishingly the Airpods managed to survive a detergent laden washing machine test. This was potential real life test as you might actually leave your Airpods in your pocket while your jeans go for a wash.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Hayley Tsukayama December 23, 2016 Follow @htsuka In October, Apple introduced the first overhaul of its MacBook Pro laptop in more than four years. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg) Consumer Reports has some bad news for anyone who bought a new MacBook Pro this holiday season: It is not giving the new Apple laptops its coveted seal of approval. These are the first MacBooks to not get a recommendation from them, the product-testing magazine said. The review cited battery-life problems with the 13- and 15-inch MacBooks that have the new Touch Bar control strip, and the 13-inch model without the Touch Bar. During testing, the review said, the laptops threw up wildly inconsistent battery times: In some trials, the laptops showed battery life readings that exceeded Apple's own 10-hour estimate. In other trials, the battery life readings were less than half of what Apple promises; in one case, the 13-inch MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar ran on battery for a paltry 3.45 hours. The overall battery life average seemed in line with Apple's 10-hour estimate, Consumer Reports's results showed, but that would be cold comfort to someone whose laptop dies on the first leg of a cross-country flight. So, the publication decided to rate the laptops using their shortest battery life times, which dragged down the computers' overall scores. [I’m in love with the Touch Bar. But I’m not sure how much I’ll use it.] Although the laptops "did very well in measures of display quality and performance," wrote Consumer Reports's Jerry Beilinson, those positives weren't enough to outweigh the battery issues. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. So what should people who've already bought (and maybe wrapped) a MacBook Pro do? Consumer Reports offers a tip: Try using a browser other than Apple's own Safari. When the testers ran their trials using Google's Chrome browser, they found that the laptops had "consistently high" battery life. Unfortunately for Apple, those Chrome tests don't count in the product's overall score. Consumer Reports uses only the default browser to score a device. [Apple takes ‘time remaining’ off laptops’ battery life display] That finding flips the conventional wisdom on browsers and Mac battery life -- using Safari instead of Chrome is often recommended to improve battery life. It's not clear why that may have changed with these models. Switching browsers may help in the short term; it may at least give Apple users who've already paid big money for the new models a way to save some battery juice. But the browser issue doesn't explain why the consumer magazine found the laptop batteries so inconsistent in its official tests. There may be a larger underlying problem. The Consumer Reports review follows on the heels of complaints by MacBook Pro users who have had similar battery issues with Apple's newest laptops since they hit shelves in October. I haven't experienced battery life problems on the laptop (without the Touch Bar) that Apple provided me. But in a test trial on the 13-inch Touch Bar model, 9to5Mac found a battery life of eight hours and reported a six-hour battery life for the 15-inch model. Apple responded -- sort of -- to user complaints by removing the part of the battery indicator that shows the "time remaining" in a laptop's charge, saying that those estimates can be inaccurate. But the company said there was no issue with the laptops' battery life in general. Meanwhile, Apple is running a limited replacement program for short-lived batteries on some iPhones. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

Despite looking forward to experiencing Christmas in the middle of winter as it’s meant to be experienced (Christmas falls in summertime back in New Zealand), I wasn’t quite expecting to be left in the freezing cold without electricity (no lights, no TV, no showers) for two merry days starting on Christmas Eve. That was the lovely gift we received at the international students’ dorm of a prominent Shanghai university four years ago: two days without power in the midst of a wintery blast. “We’re sorry for any inconvenience,” a ratty note stuck to the lift doors read — in Chinese only. Merry bloody Christmas! It’s not like I expected Christmas to be a huge thing in China, but you’d at least think the staff of the international dorm would understand that Christmas happens to be one of the Western world’s biggest annual celebrations and put that maintenance work off until at least Boxing Day. I mean, they knew about Christmas enough to deck the lobby with the obligatory tacky Christmas tree and streamers, and they even sprayed the windows with that fake snow. Not that they needed to — it snowed that year, not too common an experience in Shanghai. Fast forward a few years and Christmas in China seems a lot more merry, because it can’t really get much worse! I know I wrote about China borrowing festivals from the West as not that great of a thing just a few weeks ago, but Chinese Christmas is a rare exception, because it has aspects that are very Chinese, which is unique and fun and a little bit exciting. The first aspect of Chinese Christmas that I find quite interesting, as a Westerner, is that Christmas is not a holiday here. This probably sounds crazy, but I actually found it quite novel to go to class while my family back home are going through the motions: opening gifts they pretend to like, having small-talk with extended family you only see once a year, and filling up on chocolate and cake. Another thing I find quite interesting about Christmas in China is that, despite not being considered an actual holiday, you can find huge, beautiful Christmas trees and other displays at all the big malls across Shanghai. My local mall on Jiangpu Road in Yangpu District is one such example, and every night hundreds of people go there to take selfies and enjoy the atmosphere. That Christmas spirit is also overpowering inside malls and many stores, with “Jingle Bells” and other Christmas tunes blasting out of every corner, sure to send even the sturdiest employee on a slow path to insanity. But the cutest thing about Christmas in China — and something that only happens in China — is the giving of a gift called the Peace Apple. You can find these apples for sale in most big supermarkets and fruit shops, but you better get in quick! What’s special about this apple, you ask? Well nothing, really. It’s just a red apple packaged in a beautiful box or other beautiful wrapping, that has become a new custom for Chinese, especially very young Chinese. But why? It started because Chinese people happen to love playing with homophones (words that sound alike). Christmas Eve in Chinese translates to ping’an ye (safe and peaceful night), which sounds a little similar to pingguo (apple), and so the ‘peace apple’ was born, a gift that is given on Christmas Eve, symbolizing the hope that the recipient will stay safe and well. I really like this new element to Christmas that Chinese people have created to help give this otherwise blatant exercise in capitalism a little bit of yiyi (meaning), and I look forward to giving some peace apples this year during my Chinese Christmas here.   EDITOR’S note: Andy Boreham comes from New Zea­land’s capital city, Wellington, and has lived in China, off and on, for the past four years.

HHW Facebook HHW Twitter HHW YouTube HHW Instagram     Features Video News Wired Tracks Politics Bangin Candy Certified Fresh Maurice Garland Music Sports Politics ALL Jimmy Iovine Denies Apple Music Vs. Tidal Beef, Explains Frank Ocean Blonde Deal News   » by Maurice Garland Dec 23 2016, 1:21pm Share This Tweet This Email This Jimmy Iovine cleared the air on a few myths and rumors when it comes to how he’s running Apple Music. In an interview with The New York Times Apple Music executives Larry Jackson and Jimmy Iovine offered their thoughts on the current music landscape. Throughout the talk they reiterated that they are not trying to be a wedge between artists, labels and fans. Instead, they want to find ways where the three can live together seamlessly. Throughout the year Apple Music had been criticized for their “exclusives” with artists like Drake and Frank Ocean that virtually forced fans to subscribe to Apple Music to hear their music since it wasn’t going to be available anywhere else, either for a limited time or forever. They were also accused of joining Ocean is his jugg move where he turned in his throwaway album Endless to Universal one day before coming out with his real album Blonde on Apple Music the next day. There were also rumors of a “beef” among Iovine and Apple and Jay Z and TIDAL. Iovine acknowledged that they were indeed competitors, but went exactly in a competition. On Frank Ocean, Iovine says: We wanted to work with Frank Ocean. We had a deal — we were working with Frank Ocean, and he controlled where his music came out. Why would it be in our interest to be part of a fast one, a slow one or any one? We were getting the record no matter what. Whatever happened with him and Universal is really between him and Universal. It has nothing to do with us. Nothing. On “bad blood” between Apple Music and Tidal: Not even one speck of it. I see Jay all the time. I want him to do great. There was never one record company. When I produced records, I used to ask Quincy [Jones] to come in and help me. We are competitors, yes. But as far as anything more, absolutely not. Iovine and Jackson also talked about Kanye West’s decision to stream The Life Of Pablo on TIDAL instead of their platform. They said that they weren’t surprised by the move since Jay and Kanye had a better working relationship, at the time. In fact, they said they stopped by the studio to hear the album and offer feedback. Check out the rest of the interview here.

Apple continues to maintain that the new MacBook Pro lineup is still doing pretty good as far as overall sales are concerned. However, ever since its launch, many people, including some of the most ardent Apple fans out there have openly criticized the MacBook Pro. Battery issues with the new machines have been one of the major reasons for the flak it has been receiving over the past few weeks. This is of course, apart from the other major issues like the abrupt move to USB Type-C ports, complete removal of the legacy USB ports as well as the MagSafe connector, and lastly, the absence of a micro SD card reader – which is a big downer for photographers who were looking to “upgrade” to the new machines. In fact, many people now dread the prospect of owning the MacBook Pro since they would also have to invest in a plethora of dongles – just to ensure that all their older hardware can continue to work with the new machines. To add to Apple’s woes, a new report by Consumer Reports clearly says that they do not recommend consumers invest their money in buying any of the new MacBook Pro models. In fact, this is the first time since the introduction of the original MacBook Pro back in 2006 that the product has failed to win a Consumer Reports stamp of approval. According to the Consumer Reports article, while the new 2016 MacBook Pro models impressed the reviewers with its great display, build quality and performance, the product let them down with its inconsistent battery performance. For the first time ever, Consumer Reports does not recommend the new MacBook Pro https://t.co/ChDBDbpEsr — David Papp (@DavidPapp) December 23, 2016 Another reason for Consumer Reports to not recommend the new MacBook Pros models is the fact that several complaints about the battery performance of the machines have been popping up online ever since the first of the laptops went on sale back in November. The main bone of contention with regards to the MacBook Pro battery life is the fact that none of the new laptops have been able to deliver the claimed 10 hours of battery life that Apple had advertised at the time of the product announcement. In fact, some people have posted online saying that their laptop’s battery barely last 3 or 4 hours – nowhere close to the claimed 10-hour battery life. Another thing that Consumer Reports noted was the bizarre inconsistency in battery life showcased by the machines under the same circumstances. In one example, they tested the 13-inch model with the touch bar and in the first trial, the battery ran for 16 hours. In the second test, it ran for 12.75 hours while in the third, it only lasted 3.75 hours. Another model, this one without the touch bar, worked for 19.5 hours on the first test, while only lasting 4.5 hours in the second test. The same pattern was noticed across other models as well. Typically, there should not be more than five percent variance in results when you are doing the same tests, under the same circumstances on the same machine. In fact, it became impossible for Consumer Reports to calculate an average battery life score for any of the new MacBook Pro models. This is one of the main reasons that the new MacBook Pros failed to meet their standards for recommended models.

The same, however, cannot be said about the new 2016 MacBook Pros. Were you by any chance looking to upgrade to the the new, 2016 MacBook Pro versions? If your answer was yes, you might want to wait a while and see if these issues are fixed before you invest your hard earned money on these machines.

The new line of MacBook Pro laptops has failed to meet battery life standards, with ‘inconsistent’ test results and, in some cases, power that lasted just four hours. This marks the first time Apple’s MacBooks have not received the recommended ratings, according to Consumer Reports, who says the new series is ‘a real departure from past’ models.

Since their release, users have complained about a number of features, including lack of a traditional USB port, and poor battery life.  According to Apple, these computers should hold a charge for 10 hours. But, the Consumer Reports review found that often, this was not the case. ‘The MacBook Pro battery life results were highly inconsistent from one trial to the next,’ according to Consumer Reports.

The Cupertino firm ditched the F-sharp chord noise, known as the 'Mac chime' in the new laptops - because they automatically boot up when the lid is opened. Pingie.com revealed the change after reviewing a specific FAQ page for the new MacBook Pro, which did not mention the sound and confirmed its disappearance on a working version of the laptop.  The iconic startup sound has been part of the Mac in 1990s and although the Mac has drastically changed, the function was something that remained the same. The F-sharp sound was used in the 2008 Pixar film Wall-E.  The laptops were subjected to repeated tests, Consumer Reports explains, and these are just a handful of the results. Variations in battery life between trials are expected, but this is typically less than 5 percent. The measurements are then averaged to create the final score. But this time around, Consumer Reports says an average would not have been appropriate. ‘With the widely disparate figures we found in the MacBook Pro tests, an average wouldn’t reflect anything a consumer would be likely to experience in the real world,’ the review explains. While the batteries were found to be a problem, the laptops otherwise did well in measures of display and performance ‘For that reason, we are reporting the lowest battery life results, and using those numbers in calculating our final scores. ‘It’s the only time frame we can confidently advise a consumer to rely on if he or she is planning [to] use the product without access to an electrical outlet.’ While the batteries were found to be a problem, the laptops otherwise did well in measures of display and performance. Apple declined to comment on the test results, according to Consumer Reports, but said, ‘Any customer who has a question about their Mac or its operation should contact AppleCare.’ If improvements are made, Consumer Reports says it will run new tests.    Read more: www.consumerrepo...

Technology Apple, Broadcom, Nvidia Among RBC's Top Stock Picks For 2017 Investment bank RBC Capital Markets has come out with its top tech stock picks for 2017 and the list includes such big names as Apple, Broadcom and Nvidia. PATRICK SEITZ 12/23/2016 Reprints Investment bank RBC Capital Markets has come out with its top tech stock picks for 2017 and the list includes such big names as Apple (AAPL), Broadcom (AVGO) and Nvidia (NVDA). In a research report Thursday, RBC analysts Amit Daryanani and Mitch Steves chose those companies along with Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Texas Instruments (TXN) as their top large-cap stock ideas for 2017 in the tech sector. They also made five small and midcap picks: Amphenol (APH), Analog Devices (ADI), Arris International (ARRS), CDW (CDW) and Microsemi (MSCC). RBC likes Apple because of the potential for an iPhone 8 supercycle of upgrade activity, as well as its growing services business (Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud, etc.) and the possible repatriation of foreign profits. It has a price target on Apple of 125. Apple stock rose 0.2% to 116.52 on the stock market today. Apple is building a cup-shaped base with a 118.79 buy point. IBD'S TAKE: Among RBC's top 10 tech stock picks for 2017, two are on the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks: Nvidia and Microsemi. Chipmaker Broadcom is likely to benefit from deal integration and an improved capital structure, RBC said. Broadcom merged with Avago Technologies in February. It is in the process of acquiring Brocade Communications Systems (BRCD). RBC has a price target on Broadcom of 200. The stock rose 0.74% Friday, to 181.94. Broadcom broke out of a flat base with a buy point of 179.52 on Dec. 9 and is trading within a buy range. Cisco is attractive because of its mix shift away from switching and routing, continued M&A and the potential for repatriation, the analysts said. RBC has a price target on Cisco of 35. It rose 0.23% to 30.53 on Friday. Graphics chipmaker Nvidia offers the "cleanest secular growth story" in the group, enjoying tailwinds from virtual reality, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving, RBC said. It has a price target of 115 on Nvidia stock, which jumped 2.5% Friday to 109.78, touching an all-time high for the seventh day in the past eight trading days. Chipmaker Texas Instruments is well positioned for gross-margin upside and sales growth acceleration driven by market share gains, RBC said. It has a price target on TI of 80. The stock rose 0.24% Friday, to 74.38. RBC predicts that "Trumponomics" will help many tech companies in 2017. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to push for lower corporate tax rates and a tax holiday on repatriating foreign profits parked overseas. Apple and U.S. semiconductor firms would be key beneficiaries, they said. "Trumponomics should drive the narrative for 2017 given widespread implications for our coverage group," Daryanani and Steves said. "Beyond that, we think fundamentals will enable a better revenue and margin narrative for most companies in 2017 with continued focus on M&A." The iPhone 8 could trigger a supercycle given the aging installed base of iPhones in use, RBC said. The supercycle also should benefit component suppliers such as Broadcom. Chip suppliers also will be aided by the launch of Samsung's Galaxy S8 handset and growing smartphone sales in India, RBC said. Potential headwinds in the New Year for IT companies include a possible U.S.-China trade war, given Trump's rhetoric about imposing tariffs on imports. Political turmoil in Europe is another possible headwind, RBC said. Loading the player...

For those unaware, Apple has acknowledged a problem with some iPhone 6s units and older iPhone models where the phones shut down once the remaining charge reaches 30%, as if they had run out of power. The hope, of course, was that Apple’s new iOS update would include a fix for the aggravating issue. Sadly for some users, however, the battery problems plaguing many older iPhone models have only gotten worse for some users. Don't Miss: Behold: The edgeless iPhone 8 you’ve always dreamt of After acknowledging a problem that was seemingly impacting only a small number of iPhone 6s devices, Apple admitted earlier this month that the problem was more widespread than it initially thought. “Outside the affected batch, a small number of customers reported an unexpected shutdown,” Apple said in a statement on its website, aimed specifically at the Chinese market. “Some of these shutdowns may be normal because the iPhone will shut down to protect its electronic components. To gather more information, we will add an additional diagnostic feature to the iOS software update that is released next week. This feature collects a variety of information in the coming weeks that may help us improve algorithms for managing battery performance and shut down operations. If such improvements can be achieved, we will deliver them through further software updates.” Apple has launched a battery replacement program for people impacted by the issue, but it is only available to users with an iPhone 6s manufactured in September or October of 2015. That’s upsetting news to begin with, but it because even more upsetting for some people who found that the problems have gotten even worse since iOS 10.2 was released. A Forbes contributor wrote about the issue in a recent blog post, and we’ve heard from several readers who say that their iPhones are affected. Impacted models range from the iPhone 6s all the way back to the iPhone 5, and the newly exacerbated issue presents itself in a few different ways. Phones are still shutting down when they reach 30%, but now users are also reporting that battery readings are getting stuck at a higher percentage. One user said his iPhone 6 sometimes sticks at around 50%, and then suddenly dives to 30% and shuts down. Unfortunately, there’s currently no indication as to when Apple might finally fix the problem or expand its battery replacement program to include all impacted iPhone models.

In my previous reviews of true wireless earbuds, I’ve consistently brought up on-device controls as a positive or a negative. When you remove the wire and the controls so many of us have gotten used to, offering a new means of control is necessary. With the AirPods, the main and only means of audio playback control is by double-tapping above the AirPods’ stem. Based on your settings this either activates Siri, allowing you to speak all of the basic playback commands, or controls play/pause for audio. Double-tapping and only being able to play/pause controls aren’t enough for daily usage, but relying on Siri, especially when internet connections are weaker, makes for a cumbersome experience at best. These issues highlight the need for Apple to introduce an offline mode for Siri. I can’t overstate how much I love true wireless earbuds as a whole. They are the first wearables that I feel can truly connect us to the tech in our pockets in an unobtrusive manner. In some instances, even past what the Apple Watch is able to offer. The biggest qualm I have with all completely wireless earbuds is how to naturally control them. My first concern with the AirPods when I got them was if I was going to enjoy controlling them hands-free. Within range of a solid internet connection and in the privacy of my home, using Siri has already become a norm for me. That norm goes out the window when I step five feet out of my apartment. Between an ever-decreasing Wi-Fi signal strength and iOS’ inability to quickly switch back to cellular, I have zero luck using Siri when walking from my front door to the elevator. Siri needs an internet connection to understand even the most basic of commands, and that’s what frustrates me most. Apple already solved this issue years ago. Voice Control, Siri’s iOS predecessor, could handle offline requests with no issue. In regards to music, Voice Control could play, pause, skip, return, and even play specific playlists all without any internet connection. I had to speak audibly and clearly, but it worked just as well as Siri does for me today. Why these offline functions weren’t built into Siri since day one still baffles me. Using Voice Control’s original commands in combination with Siri, as either the first or even fallback option would help tremendously. To over-simplify the idea: Siri could attempt to process the voice command and if it recognizes an internet connection isn’t available, it can then fallback to Voice Control’s commands. The AirPods are a great successor to Apple’s own EarPods, but the removal of the basic controls in hopes Siri would be enough are already falling short for me. Ironically, I complain about controls while having an iPhone and Apple Watch within hand’s reach, and I think Apple realized this too. When playing audio, the user would most likely never be too far away from alternate means of control. That begs the question, “Than why include Siri at all?” If an alternative means of activating Siri and controlling audio playback are already nearby, why give users bits and pieces instead of a complete solution? Why would Apple implement Siri, a dead alternative when internet connections fail, as a primary means of control? Why give AirPods users a “solution” if the solution doesn’t work better than their own wired EarPods? Take Our Poll If Apple truly hopes that Siri could become the personal assistant they have preached so vocally in the past, then it needs to gain some basic offline functionality. Especially when Siri is the primary means of control for their latest product.

Apple’s latest machines have become the first MacBooks to miss out on the publication’s coveted rating. After evaluating the laptops, the organization concluded that while the displays and performance levels “did very well,” the inconsistent battery life meant it couldn’t recommend them. Both consumers and reviewers have complained about the Pros’ suspect battery life, calling it inferior to previous generation models. Apple’s estimate that they will allow 10 hours normal usage is said to be slightly optimistic – some users have reported only being able to use the MacBooks for three to four hours before the battery ran down. Consumer Reports found the battery life varied dramatically in the 15-inch MacBook Pro and the two 13-inch laptops. In three consecutive tests, the Touch Bar-sporting smaller device ran for 16 hours, 12.75 hours, and 3.75 hours. The 13-inch model without the Touch bar ran for 19.5 hours in one test, then 4.5 hours in another. The 15-inch Pro's life varied from 18.5 hours to 8 hours. The tests used fully charged machines with screen brightness set to 100 nits. A series of ten pre-selected web pages were then downloaded over Wi-Fi using Safari. The trials ran until the laptops shut down. Consumer Reports noted that laptops’ battery life usually varies by less than five percent between tests. The machines were tested again after being upgraded to macOS Sierra 10.12.2, but results were the same. Last week, it was reported that Apple had removed the ‘time remaining’ battery life estimate in this newest version of Sierra, claiming it was too hard to produce an estimate in laptops that use Intel’s latest processors.

Shop Breaking News NYE 2017 Bachelor Carrie Fisher Shopping Beauty HollyBaby Kardashians Rob & Blac Home Apple MacBook Pro: Why ‘Consumer Reports’ Isn’t… MacBook Pro: Why ‘Consumer Reports’ Isn’t Recommending New Apple Product Fri, December 23, 2016 12:55pm EST by Jenna Lemoncelli 1 Comment Image Courtesy of Apple View Gallery 10 Photos Wow! This is the first time EVER, that ‘Consumer Reports’ isn’t recommending Apple’s popular MacBook Pro computer, and you may agree! Find out why the popular device’s new line ‘failed’ to meet the magazine’s standards. Apple can’t be happy today. The ratings, or lack their of, are in for Consumer Reports, Dec. 23, and for the first time ever, the publication is not awarding a positive recommendation for Apple’s MacBook Pro models. The reason? — The the CA technology company’s new line of MacBook Pros with Apple’s new Touch Bar (that sits above the keyboard) feature, “failed to meet our standards for recommended models,”  Jeremy Beilinson of the mag said. This is due to the computer’s battery life. Quickly unlock your MacBook Pro with Touch ID: https://t.co/JbUudrpOPi pic.twitter.com/R1XCHYsuiM — Apple Support (@AppleSupport) November 19, 2016 The three new models released for sale by Apple were: a 13-inch model with Apple’s new Touch Bar, a 13-inch model without the Touch Bar; and a 15-inch model, which has the Touch Bar. Apple launched the new line of MacBook Pro models with Touch Bar back in Oct. 2016. They went on the market for sale in Nov. 2016. And, while the devices “did very well in measures of display quality and performance,” battery life was a different story. Beilinson said that when it came to the trial portion of the battery life, some of the models varied “dramatically.” Consumer Reports tested the three models, and this is what they discovered: After purchasing the models in-store, like any other consumer, each model was “highly inconsistent” when it came to using the device. The models’ poor results were described by Beilinson in a series of three consecutive tests. He said, “The 13-inch model with the Touch Bar ran for 16 hours in the first trial, 12.75 hours in the second, and just 3.75 hours in the third. ” Oh no. The other two models turned out to be just as fickle as the first. “The 13-inch model without the Touch Bar worked for 19.5 hours in one trial but only 4.5 hours in the next,” he said, adding, “And the numbers for the 15-inch laptop ranged from 18.5 down to 8 hours.” Wow. Apple Music Festival 2016 — SEE PICS When the new line first came on the market in Nov. 2016, some users of the product complained that the battery life was extremely short. Apple claims the new MacBook Pro should work for up to 10 hours before users would need to charge it again, however, online complaints said otherwise. Unhappy users said the model only lasted three to four hours before needing to be charged. Getting to work should be as easy as opening your device. Simply open the lid to start up the 2016 MacBook Pro. pic.twitter.com/He6d0YrddW — Apple Support (@AppleSupport) December 21, 2016 Apple refused to comment on the Consumer Reports results until they better gain a better understanding on the issue, according to the mag. They did, however, provide this statement: “Any customer who has a question about their Mac or its operation should contact AppleCare.” HollywoodLifers, would you still buy a new MacBook Pro after ‘Consumer Reports’ rating?

Stock? Even a successful, highly profitable business like Apple isn't risk-free. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Dec 23, 2016 at 1:14AM For many years, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was widely viewed as a "can't lose" investment. The stock handily outpaced the major indices for years as its fundamental business performance continued to dazzle. Image source: Apple.  Indeed, the company struck virtual gold with its iPhone product line, revolutionizing the mobile phone market and, indeed, the computing market as we know it. And investors who got in early could have made fortunes.  However, over the last couple of years, Apple has transformed from a hot growth stock to a mature, megacap technology stock that pays a solid dividend and routinely shrinks its share count through stock buybacks. For many risk-averse investors, a proven company like Apple is exactly the kind of stock that they're looking for. That said, even a highly profitable industry leader like Apple carries investment risks. Let's take a closer look at a couple of those risks. Apple relies so much on a single product category In Apple's most recent fiscal year, it generated approximately $136.7 billion in revenue from sales of its iPhone product line out of a company total of $215.639 billion. That's more than 63% of the company's revenue base coming from a single product line. There are all kinds of risks associated with having this much exposure to the smartphone market. For one thing, the market itself has cooled off quite a bit. Market research company IDC predicts that the smartphone market will grow at a 5% compounded annual growth rate from 2015 through 2020. The smartphone market no longer seems to be a high-growth one. Next, Apple has been having a hard time even growing with the market. In fiscal year 2016, Apple saw its iPhone unit sales drop even in a market that expanded, implying market share loss. There are many potential explanations for why Apple's iPhone business performed so poorly that year, but suffice it to say, if this market share loss continues, it could be tough on Apple's financial performance longer-term. Finding growth elsewhere is tough Apple has certainly been investing in trying to grow out non-iPhone businesses. It has put a lot of effort into its iPad line of tablet computers, it introduced the Apple Watch line of smartwatches not too long ago, and it has been investing heavily in building out its services business with products like Apple Music, Apple Pay, as well as continued growth from its App Store. In fiscal year 2016, Apple saw growth from its Other Products (Apple says this "includes sales of Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, iPod and Apple-branded third party accessories") and its services (Apple explains that this "includes revenue from Internet Services, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services"). However, its iPhone, iPad, and Mac businesses all declined in that fiscal year. Apple is certainly onto something with its services business, and there's a chance that Apple Watch could be a long-term hit, but finding significant, sustained growth outside of its core iPhone/Mac/iPad businesses isn't likely to be easy.  Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Holiday gift guide Chris Keall Holiday Review 2 Share Sony PlayStation VR Play NBR radio on Some tech toys for late Christmas shoppers or January bargain-hunters: Sony PlayStation VR ($629.95) Virtual Reality goggles have been all the rage this year. I’d be lying to you if I said VR headsets from Samsung, HTC and Sony had any business utility at this point but they can be a lot of fun for games – and Sony’s PlayStation VR, which plugs into PlayStation4, has the best games now and the best titles in the pipeline. Sony’s VR World’s title features five VR experiences including the gritty “London Heist” that puts you in a room with a gangster. The effect is stunning and visceral but also a little ropey around the edges. Your field of movement is limited and the onscreen image starts to judder if you try to move beyond it. Another downside: With paraphernalia including a tracking camera, additional control console, two handheld controllers and various USB and power cables, the PlayStation VR quite clutters up your TV/entertainment unit area. Still, an amazing taste of things to come.   Sphero's BB-8 droid (on charger) and Force Band. BB-8 Force Band ($360) One for the kids. Sphero’s latest toy robot is a licensed replica of the BB-8 droid from Star Wars: The Force Awakens. It’s not much larger than a tennis ball and it’s controlled by “The Force” – or at least a sensor you strap around your wrist. You move your hand to move BB-8. Its US inventor, Ian Bernstein, despaired during a demo in NBR’s board room as I repeatedly crashed the droid into our drinks cabinet – but if your children are more co-ordinated, they’ll have a whole lot of fun. Incidentally, as well as hauling in hundreds of millions in venture capital money for his various robotic ventures, Mr Bernstein has become something of a gun at getting manufacturing running smoothly in China, where so many have stumbled – see NBR.co.nz/china A pair of AirPods next to an iPhone 7 and 7 Plus (above) and in situ (below). Apple AirPods ($269) Yes, they look a bit silly but Apple’s Air Pods are the Bluetooth wireless earbuds you’ve been waiting for. Unlike most Bluetooth earpieces, they’re easy to set up and offer a clean, consistent wireless connection to your iPhone, iPad or MacBook. They also sound great and, surprisingly, they’re not prone to falling out. There are no controls on Pods themselves; If you want to adjust volume or skip a track you do so from Siri or your Apple device. The only minor glitch is, if you’ve got your AirPod synced to an iPod or MacBook, there are a few seconds of manual stuffing around before you can take a call. Battery life is a modest five hours but a carrying case that doubles as a mobile charger offers five charging cycles on the go. More: nbr.co.nz/airpods PlayStation4 Pro ($640), Xbox One S (from $499) Game consoles these days are about more than just gaming these days: They’re also a way to access streaming video-on-demand services like Netflix, Neon and Lightbox and watch them on your telly. Sony has just released the “Pro” version of its PlayStation4, which adds support for 4K or “ultra-HD” video and games, plus HDR (or high dynamic range; a very good thing for better picture quality). And Microsoft’s rival Xbox One S  offers 4K for downloads (plus a 4K Blu-Ray player for old-timers) and HDR. That’s just the ticket if you subscribe to Netflix, the only streaming service that offers content in 4K quality and HDR at the moment. Just make sure you’ve also got UFB fibre and an unlimited data plan, as 4K video really chews through your cap. The iPad Pro with an Apple Pencil, and attached to a Smart Keyboard. iPad Pro (from $1219) and Apple Pencil ($159) In an age where we’ve all become pretty jaded these days with lookalike smart devices and their endless upgrades, Apple’s iPad Pro is one of the few models still guaranteed to get a “hey wow!” from the gadget lover in your life. Its sheer size (the display is 12.9-inches) never fails to impress. And if you add the impressively responsive Apple Pencil stylus, the Pro can become a sketch board too. There are lots of apps that can take advantage of the Pencil, including the free Adobe Photoshop Sketch that lets you “paint” in styles such as acrylic, pastel or watercolour. The big screen is superb for video viewing and games, too. A great way to while away your summer and, when work resumes, you could couple it with one of Apple’s Smart Keyboard For iPad Pro covers ($269). It becomes a potential laptop replacement too – and it helps that the Pro has a lot more processor grunt under the bonnet than a regular iPad. (Apple now has a 9.7-inch model of the Pro, too. It sells from $999. Read more from Chris Keall Email Chris: ckeall@nbr.co.nz Follow @@ChrisKeall 2 · Got a question about this story? Leave it in Comments & Questions below.

The Finland-based company said Apple agreed to license patented inventions in 2011 but has refused to extend those expiring agreements. Nokia filed complaints with the German Regional Courts in Dusseldorf, Mannheim and Munich, and in federal court in Texas. The dispute is rooted in Nokia’s demise as the world’s largest phone maker. Since selling its handset business, the company has focused on networking. It’s now tapping its patent portfolio as a source of income, rather than as a cross-licensing tool to protect its own products. Nokia’s intellectual property business added patents through its Alcatel-Lucent acquisition, making it a more significant profit contributor. READ NEXT Shares fall at Nintendo on cost of Mario In the third quarter, Nokia’s technology unit, which licenses its patents, generated about 40% of the company’s total adjusted operating profit. Shares of Nokia have shed about a third of their value this year, while Apple have advanced 11%. “Unfortunately, Nokia has refused to license their patents on a fair basis and is now using the tactics of a patent troll to attempt to extort money from Apple by applying a royalty rate to Apple’s own inventions they had nothing to do with,” Apple said in an e-mailed statement. “We are standing up for inventors everywhere by fighting this flagrant anticompetitive practice.” Nokia and its Alcatel-Lucent US unit filed two lawsuits against Apple in federal court in Marshall, Texas, claiming patent violations related to products including the iPhone, iPad, iPod, Apple Watch, Mac computers and digital media players such as Apple TV. In the first complaint, Nokia said Apple “steadfastly refused” to license its patents for video coding at established industry rates. The second suit accuses Apple of infringing 10 patents, many of which deal with transmitting and amplifying radio signals. Apple is also accused of violating a patent for translating natural language inquiries into database queries. Apple’s Siri digital assistant also violates a patent in this area, according to the complaint.   READ MORE Visit the section home page here KEYWORDS business, finance, economy, technology, mobile, nokia, apple © Irish Examiner Ltd.

Thanks, TC Team 10th Annual Crunchies AwardsDon't Miss The Tech Awards Show Of The Year Get Your Tickets Today Weekly Roundup: Tim Cook explains why he met with Trump, Uber stops self-driving pilot in SF Posted Dec 23, 2016 by Anna Escher (@annaescher) 0 SHARES Next Story After Super Mario Run, Nintendo plans 2 or 3 new mobile games per year Uber took its self-driving vehicle fleet to Arizona after being kicked out of San Francisco, Tim Cook cleared up why he met with Trump, and executive level shakeups occurred at Twitter this week. These are the top tech stories all in one place. You can also get this post as a newsletter in your inbox, if you like. Want more tech news? Subscribe to The Daily Crunch for more frequent updates.  1. Apple CEO Tim Cook was part of a round table of tech leaders that met with Trump last week, and some were confused as to why. Cook sent out an internal memo to employees explaining why he met with Trump. The short of it was that you have to show up in order to have a say. “Personally, I’ve never found being on the sideline a successful place to be,” wrote Cook. “The way that you influence these issues is to be in the arena.” 2. Amid notions that the popularity of Apple’s portable laptops and slower upgrade cycle of desktop products, some have suggested Apple’s commitment to the desktop product. But in a posting to an employee message board, Tim Cook confirmed that Apple is indeed still working on the desktop. “Let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that,” Cook said. 3. Uber’s self-driving pilot in San Francisco came to a hard stop, following a meeting with the California DMV and Attorney General’s office. Uber had been ordered to cease operations due to the lack of a proper state permit. A cyclist advocacy group also warned that the self-driving units could put bikers at risk. Uber will deploy the vehicles in Arizona for the time being. 4. As 2016 comes to a close, we looked at the highs and lows of how top tech companies performed throughout the year. Apple’s bulletproof Wall Street growth story came to a halt as iPhone sales slowed and interest in the Apple Watch declined. Google proved it is more than just a search engine this year as it introduced two major hardware products, the Google Pixel and Google Home. Amazon’s AWS had a breakout year, but 2017 could see an even larger wave for the ecommerce company. Twitter’s future remains uncertain amid layoffs, slowed user growth and a botched acquisition that plagued the network in 2016. This year saw 10 acquisitions and a new Chief Equality Officer position filled for Salesforce.  5. There were a few executive level shakeups this week. A senior staff member of Oracle, George A. Polisner, resigned after the enterprise tech titan’s co-CEO, Safra Catz, joined the Trump transition team and stated her enthusiasm for the president-elect. 6. Twitter just can’t catch a break. Adam Messinger, who has been the company’s CTO for nearly four years, said he was leaving the company. Twitter VP of product Josh McFarland is also leaving to join Greylock Partners. 7. Super Mario Run finally hit the iPhone, crushing mobile gaming download records. But Nintendo did not have a good week. The company’s shares dropped about 15 percent in five days following the launch, which shaved off a significant amount of the company’s market cap. $10 just might be too much to ask for a mobile game. 8. An Uber employee filed a lawsuit accusing the company of misleading employees about their equity compensation. Uber “devised a fraudulent scheme to recruit highly sought software engineers,” according to the case. 9. It looks like Facebook is beginning to take responsibility for its role in informing today’s world. “Facebook is a new kind of platform. It’s not a traditional technology company,” said CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a Live video year-end chat with COO Sheryl Sandberg. “It’s not a traditional media company. You know, we build technology and we feel responsible for how it’s used.” 10. The internet has brought us into a new era where the digital is affecting the real. But the rise of abuse on social networks would lead one to believe that internet users still think the two realities are separate. “Once we could cancel our subscription to the daily paper if we didn’t like the news. How can we cancel our subscription to the defining medium of the 21st century?” writes John Biggs in The rise of 4chan politics. 11. There’s room for one more ride sharing unicorn. Uber’s Middle Eastern rival Careem reported that it raised a $350M funding round at a $1B valuation. 12. Almost a year after six months after it was supposed to arrive on iPhone, the BitTorrent Live app quietly became available on iOS. BitTorrent has done for live video what it did for file downloads: invented peer-to-peer tech that moves data transfer from a centralized source to the people. 13. 2016 was a year of change for Google: It was the first full year after the surprise Google/Alphabet reorg and the year that saw Google get serious about its own hardware, the cloud and the enterprise. Across the industry, 2016 was also the year of AI and machine learning — and Google was at the forefront of this. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Happy New Year from Crunch Report!

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Science Technology  • Computer Industry •  Internet Automotive One News Page > Computer Industry > Apple Adds 21 New Aerial Screen Savers to Apple TV Apple Adds 21 New Aerial Screen Savers to Apple TV Friday, 16 December 2016 (2 weeks ago) One of the best features on the fourth-generation Apple TV is its high-quality aerial screen savers that play on the screen after a short period of inactivity. The Aerial screen saver option on the Apple TV features an aerial view of different locations around the world, which Apple has added to over time to keep content fresh. The Aerial screen saver picks a random video option from a data source maintained by Apple, and that data source was recently updated with 21 new screen savers. iDownloadBlog has parsed the data and shared direct links to each of the new screen savers that can be watched on iOS devices and Macs. Screen savers are time-based and show off various cities and locations in slow motion, with the lighting changing based on the time of day. New screen savers of video captured in China, Dubai, Greenland, Hong Kong, Liwa, and Los Angeles have been added. *China:* - Day 4 - Day 5 - Day 6 *Dubai:* - Day 1 - Day 2 - Day 3 - Day 4 - Night 1 - Night 2 *Greenland:* - Day 1 - Day 2 - Night 1 *Hong Kong:* - Day 1 - Day 2 - Day 3 - Night 1 *Liwa (United Arab Emirates):* - Day 1 *Los Angeles (United States):* - Day 1 - Day 2 - Day 3 - Night 1 These screen savers aren't likely to be immediately available to all users, as the Apple TV downloads new aerial content on a regular basis depending on your Apple TV settings. New screen savers can be set to download on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis in the Settings app on the Apple TV.

Sparxoo_Logo_Solo About Expertise Work Brain Power Careers Contact Categories All Branding Digital Marketing Strategy & Trends Uncategorized These Content Trends Will Dominate the Digital World in 2017 in Strategy & Trends Uncategorized | by Emily Culclasure Visual storytelling. Live video. User-generated content. Interactive media. What do all four of these have in common? They’re some of the content strategies taking the digital marketing world by storm in 2017. This year, emerging technology and market disruption will continue to force brands to move beyond high-quality content creation. In order to succeed in an increasingly competitive market, content marketing strategies are having to think in three dimensions. Let’s take a peek into the crystal ball of content and see what 2017 has in store. Once Upon a Good Content Strategy Storytelling is integral to modern content marketing. And no, we’re not talking about the fairytale picture books you revered as a child (although they can be used for inspiration). Creating content for content’s sake no longer cuts it; people want to connect with your brand on a deeper emotional level. Why wouldn’t you want to include stories in your content marketing? Storytelling is an innate human quality. Cavemen did it with drawings on walls. Children revel in it in fairytales and kindergarten “story times,” and you probably still do it with your friends during happy hour. Here’s why storytelling works: People can connect the dots much faster with a story than they can with cut-and-dry statistics. Statistics are great for backing up arguments, but not for a hard sell. People relate to other people who share a common experience, so when you tell your tale, it builds trust. Moral of the story? Talk with your audience, not to them. Extra tip: Throw in some happy vibes—nostalgia, excitement, surprise, etc.—because people relate more to positive emotions than to negative ones. In 2014, Apple launched the iPad Air to the tune of a campaign titled, “What Will Your Verse Be.” Rather than only marketing the new product, Apple combined technology with humanity and asked consumers to think about their contributions to the world, and how the iPad could help them make a difference. Paired with Robin Williams’ monologue from “Dead Poets Society,” Apple encouraged self-reflection and goal-setting all while sneaking in iPad promotion. You’re Live in 3…2…1… Video on demand will continue to rise in popularity, but watch out for its partner-in-crime, live video, which will make more headway in 2017. As phones become faster and WiFi grows stronger, the ability to interact on a more personal level increases substantially. Audiences want real, unedited content, rather than scripted, staged commercials. Give them what they want with more Facebook, YouTube and Instagram Live videos. Experiment with behind-the-scenes clips of brand production, events or product launches, like Brooks Running did on Global Running Day. Yes, it’s a holiday. And to celebrate, the staff went on a group run and live-streamed the entire workout, adding in a spur of the moment Q&A with employees. This gave audiences a chance to learn more about the company while embracing a quirky holiday. Source: Brooks Running Plan for what you can but embrace time-sensitive opportunities (and imperfections) when they arise. Look to your audience The average consumer has the ability to create your next Instagram post right in the palm of their hands. They just need a little push—and incentive. User-generated content boosts audience engagement, brand credibility and, yes, free content for you to re-use. When used correctly, it’s a win-win. Word-of-mouth marketing resonates with consumers more than other forms of media. When you allow fans to tell their own stories through text, images and videos, you stimulate brand-related discussion in an organic forum. Align digital campaigns with your brand’s lifestyle and encourage participation through incentives such as social media endorsements, discounts or free products. Starbucks’ cup overflowed with participation in its 2014 White Cup Contest. Sorry, we couldn’t resist the pun. Starbucks asked customers to doodle on their cups and post a photo to social media. After more than 4,000 submissions (and a surge of publicity and customer interaction), the winning drawing became a limited-edition cup design. I’m sure they threw in some free coffee for the winner, too.  Source: Starbucks Embrace the lifestyle factor of your brand and brainstorm ways to connect with your audience. From hashtags to crowdsourcing product ideas, smart user-generated campaigns will give you more bang for your content marketing buck. Go interactive Buzzfeed-style quizzes dominated the web in 2016; and my spirit animal is the dolphin, in case you were wondering. The interactive, tech-based content strategy isn’t going away anytime soon. In fact, the increasing demand for engagement has led marketers of all niches (B2B and B2C) to implement interactive content —quizzes, assessments, personalization and games. Interactive content grabs consumer attention, enhancing both product and message retention. Let’s face it: We love being a part of the story. Plus, learning about a brand through interactive media is easier and more enjoyable than reading static content. Even newspapers are taking an interactive approach with their online content. The Washington Post created an interactive map titled, “Scaling Mt. Everest,” which allows users to journey from sea level to summit. They included facts, interviews and pop-outs to bring the story to life. Source: Washington Post Interactive features can be used at every stage of the marketing process, from brand awareness and converting leads, but it should not be a substitute for quality content. Enhance, don’t replace. In 2017, break out of your content routine. Take advantage of the new and engaging platforms available and, most importantly, find unique ways to share your story. Why? Because your success depends on creating new, immersive experiences for your audience.

Xconomy Xperience EXOME National Regions Channels Events Boston Angel Investors → VC Sizes Up Google As Consumer Electronics Challenger To Apple Et Al. Bernadette Tansey December 23rd, 2016 @Tansey_Xconomy @xconomy Like Us Xconomy San Francisco —  It’s the end of the year, and everyone’s getting out their crystal balls. At the Silicon Valley venture capital firm NEA, partner Greg Papadopoulos has a prediction about Google. But it’s so positive that he makes a joking disclaimer at the beginning of our conversation. “I’m not a Google fan boy,” Papadopoulos insists. A veteran executive at Sun Microsystems and engineer for HP and Honeywell before he became a VC, Papadopoulos (pictured) sees a big opening for search and software giant Google to challenge the likes of Apple, Samsung, and Amazon and become a “consumer electronics powerhouse.” That’s not just because of the big recent stumble by Samsung, whose Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones were prone to catching fire, or what Papadopoulos sees as a slower pace of significant innovations in Apple’s iPhones. He says Google has the edge because it’s “the leader in artificial intelligence.” Papadopoulos says that makers of smartphones, cameras, digital assistants, 21st century cars, and other devices need to succeed on three fronts: they need to be connected, they need to be intelligent, and they need to take advantage of the computing power and data storage available from Web-based services (the cloud). Consumers have come to expect devices to detect their environments and anticipate their needs, he says. “If something isn’t connected, it’s broken,’’ Papadopoulos says, summarizing the consumer’s take. “If my device doesn’t have any intelligence in it, it’s stupid.’’ This is the holiday shopping season that may help prove Papadopoulos’s point. TV ads are trying to enchant consumers with the idea that they can speak their search queries and other commands to the AI “smart assistants” that power connected-home hub Amazon Echo and its new competitor, Google Home. These units are sort of a cross between a tabletop hi-fi speaker and a talking robot servant. They play your music on command, answer questions in a soothing voice, and relay your spoken orders to your thermostat and other household devices. Google Assistant is the natural language processing AI inside Google Home, and it’s also an element of the company’s smartphone, Pixel, whose price is in the same neighborhood as higher-end iPhone models. Consumers have been familiar with voice recognition assistants since at least 2011, when Apple introduced Siri in its iPhone 4s. But the connected-home hubs take this verbal relationship with tech into a new hands-free dimension. No need to even pick up a device—-users just talk to the microphones in the tabletop units. Apple is rumored to be working on a similar hub, as is Microsoft, whose voice recognition assistant Cortana is a feature of its Windows software. “Apple is investing so fiercely in AI right now,” Papadopoulos says. But he still thinks Google Home will “blow past anything Apple or Amazon does.” (In addition to his Google fan boy disclaimer, Papadopoulous also offered some disclosures: He says neither he nor NEA have invested in Google, though NEA’s portfolio includes consumer electronics companies such as smartwatch maker Olio, and Sentons, which develops touch interfaces for smartphones and tablets. Papadopoulos says his daughter has worked at Google on user experience assignments for less than two years.) One recent review comparing the two smart home hubs already on the market, Amazon Echo and Google Home, lends some support to Papadopoulos’s view of Google’s superior skills in AI. Tech journalist Swapnil Bhartiya, writing in the publication CIO, found that Google Home could quickly handle conversations in context and answer questions accurately. Bhartiya says Amazon Echo’s voice recognition AI, Alexa, sometimes failed to understand questions, and seemed to steer users toward buying something from Amazon through the device. Comparisons can be difficult with these products, though, because they’re designed to perform better as they get to know the voices and the life patterns of their users. The possible effortlessness of the connected-home life, where users speak their commands rather than typing them, will also depend on the size of a hub’s network—-how many other devices and Web services such as streaming video and shopping sites the hub’s smart assistant can control. Conceivably, one command such as “Romantic dinner” could dim the lights, queue up a music playlist, and schedule delivery of a shrimp risotto feast with arugula walnut salad. Another recent review also pegs Google Home as the most useful product for now, “with a wide range of commands, tasks and integrations with various services,” a reporting team at ITPRO wrote. But the team also pointed to the potential of Amazon’s … Next Page » Single PageCurrently on Page: 1 2 Bernadette Tansey is Xconomy's San Francisco Editor. You can reach her at btansey@xconomy.com.

I only found out because I saw it mentioned on Facebook in a blog post. Then I found the Apple press release online and read our names next to Twitter and the other winners. It was pretty exciting.” Ksebati also gives much of the credit to co-founder Adam Oxner, the company’s lead iOS developer. “He built the watch app from start to finish, and that’s a really cool accomplishment,” he says. MySwimPro offers custom swim workouts, training plans, and coaching for swimmers at all skill levels. Ksebati says the app leverages Apple’s HealthKit technology, and what makes it unique is that it has “redefined personal coaching on a device” through swimming. It’s also the first swimming app designed for the Apple Watch. MySwimPro has been making waves around the region since it launched in 2015. The company has gone through a number of accelerators, including the University of Michigan’s Desai Family Accelerator, DTX Launch, and Techstars’ Startup Next program, and counts four-time Olympic medalist Peter Vanderkaay as an advisor. It was while MySwimPro was at Desai that things really started to take off. “We were featured on the homepage of the Apple store—that was a significant bump,” he says. “Then, we were on the Google Play homepage.” Ksebati says MySwimPro exceeded 100,000 users a few months ago. In 2017, Ksebati says the company will focus on building a worldwide swimming community and adding more personalized features to the app. MySwimPro is also in the middle of raising its first round of investment capital. But most of all, the MySwimPro team is looking forward to seeing what it can accomplish next. “We were recently featured in [Apple CEO] Tim Cook’s keynote address,” Ksebati adds. “We’re super excited.” Sarah Schmid Stevenson is the editor of Xconomy Detroit/Ann Arbor.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple The Galaxy S9 and iPhone 9 might actually fold in half Chris Smith BGR NewsDecember 23, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Samsung may be the first to release a foldable phone next year, according to some reports, but it won’t be the only top company looking to launch such devices. A new report says that foldable smartphones are in the works from several tech giants, Apple included, and they may become more and more popular by 2019. But could Apple release its first foldable iPhone as soon as 2018? Don't Miss: Scientists just discovered a huge cluster of galaxies hidden in Earth’s backyard To make a foldable phone, you need a flexible display, and a flexible type of glass. OLED is flexible, whereas LCD isn’t, and Apple is already expected to launch its first OLED iPhone with a curved display next year. According to The Korea Herald, there’s just one company in the world that can mass produce colorless polyimide, the glass that would protect the foldable OLED screen, and that’s Kolon Industries. “Around three to five tech companies are expected to mass produce foldable phones in 2018 globally. The devices will then grab around 20 percent of the total smartphone market here,” Kolon Industries’ colorless polyimide division head Kang Chung-seok told The Herald. The company is apparently supplying materials to Samsung, LG, and BOE. Apple may also be one of the companies looking at such components. The Kolon exec said the first foldable devices could have a bend radius of 5 millimeters rather than the 1-millimeter radius that would allow a wallet-like smartphone fold, where the glass on the face of the handset would actually touch itself. “The bend radius of 1 millimeter is the most ideal, but that may cause a safety issue. So, tech companies are likely to unveil the bend radius of 5 millimeters first and then gradually unveil devices with less bend radius,” Kang added. Kolon finished the development of its flexible colorless polyimide glass in August and expects to mass produce films for around 100 million units of foldable devices in 2018. Apple has traditionally been very cautious about adopting certain technologies, choosing to only bring some of them to market in the iPhone when they have met its performance and quality standards. It’ll be interesting to see how fast the company will release a foldable iPhone — or iPad, for that matter — especially considering that the iPhone will receive it’s first major redesign in four iPhone generations next year. That said, Apple already has various patents describing foldable devices, including the kind fold just like a wallet.

Apple very briefly accepted orders for the display in late November, possibly by mistake, and some lucky customers who bought one received six to eight week shipping estimates. Apple emailed some of those first-wave customers earlier this week to let them know their order would be shipping sooner than expected, typically with an expected delivery date of December 28 to December 29. But, in the United Kingdom at least, at least a few lucky customers received their displays today. LG UltraFine 5K Display delivered to a lucky customer in the United Kingdom "I ordered literally within seconds of them going on sale, with estimated delivery of December 28-30," said MacRumors forum member Stealth66, who ordered two LG UltraFine 5K displays. "I received a shipping email out of the blue yesterday afternoon, and they were delivered today by UK Mail." "I've used Apple's Thunderbolt Displays for a few years and I must say these LG 5Ks are awesome," he added. "Very bright, incredibly sharp, and worked flawlessly out of the box, just like an Apple product! It works fine with the Belkin Ethernet adapter plugged into the back of the display." The forum member noted the Thunderbolt 3 cable included in the box with one of the displays was defective, prompting him to make a Genius Bar appointment to obtain a replacement cable. MacRumors forum member iBrooker, located in Wales, said his LG UltraFine 5K Display coincidentally arrived today at the same time as his new MacBook Pro, with the deliveries handled separately by couriers DHL and DPD. "I've spent a couple of hours setting it all up and have to say the display itself is stunning," said iBrooker. "However, I'm still a bit peed that there is no headphone out—so I will have to waste one USB-C port for that. I am not fussed on the built in speakers, and didn't really want/need a camera." LG's UltraFine 5K Display, designed in partnership with Apple, connects to the new 15-inch MacBook Pro with a single Thunderbolt 3 cable, which provides up to 85W of power to charge the notebook. The 27-inch IPS LED display has peak brightness of 500 nits and a wide DCI-P3 color gamut for more accurate and vivid colors. The display has an adjustable and removable stand with VESA mount, built-in camera, microphone, stereo speakers, and three downstream USB-C ports at 5 Gbps speeds. It has a 60Hz refresh rate and 217 PPI. The display can be purchased from Apple for $974 until March 31, when it increases to $1,299.95. The majority of orders placed in late November should begin arriving to customers in the United States and elsewhere next week. Orders placed this week were initially estimated to ship in as few as 3-5 business days, but orders quickly became backlogged and shipping estimates slipped to 2-4 weeks. For those still looking into purchasing a 4K or 5K display, be sure to consider the smaller LG UltraFine 4K Display or other USB-C displays available.

Rating: 6 Votes entropys 1 week ago Any any of your rant has what to do with LG? His rant was expressing his concern that the Apple executive seems to not give a rats about a coherent mac setup anymore. This LG monitor screen is fine, the ports are fine, the design is downright ugly. So this Monitor is all function and no form. The MBPs on the other hand, prioritise form over function. The old Apple would ensure that form followed function in a wonderful way. If Apple couldn't be bothered producing its own monitor anymore, the least Ive could have done is help LG make a better design. This is why long term Apple fans are not happy.

Stock? Even a successful, highly profitable business like Apple isn't risk-free. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Dec 23, 2016 at 1:14AM For many years, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was widely viewed as a "can't lose" investment. The stock handily outpaced the major indices for years as its fundamental business performance continued to dazzle. Image source: Apple.  Indeed, the company struck virtual gold with its iPhone product line, revolutionizing the mobile phone market and, indeed, the computing market as we know it. And investors who got in early could have made fortunes.  However, over the last couple of years, Apple has transformed from a hot growth stock to a mature, megacap technology stock that pays a solid dividend and routinely shrinks its share count through stock buybacks. For many risk-averse investors, a proven company like Apple is exactly the kind of stock that they're looking for. That said, even a highly profitable industry leader like Apple carries investment risks. Let's take a closer look at a couple of those risks. Apple relies so much on a single product category In Apple's most recent fiscal year, it generated approximately $136.7 billion in revenue from sales of its iPhone product line out of a company total of $215.639 billion. That's more than 63% of the company's revenue base coming from a single product line. There are all kinds of risks associated with having this much exposure to the smartphone market. For one thing, the market itself has cooled off quite a bit. Market research company IDC predicts that the smartphone market will grow at a 5% compounded annual growth rate from 2015 through 2020. The smartphone market no longer seems to be a high-growth one. Next, Apple has been having a hard time even growing with the market. In fiscal year 2016, Apple saw its iPhone unit sales drop even in a market that expanded, implying market share loss. There are many potential explanations for why Apple's iPhone business performed so poorly that year, but suffice it to say, if this market share loss continues, it could be tough on Apple's financial performance longer-term. Finding growth elsewhere is tough Apple has certainly been investing in trying to grow out non-iPhone businesses. It has put a lot of effort into its iPad line of tablet computers, it introduced the Apple Watch line of smartwatches not too long ago, and it has been investing heavily in building out its services business with products like Apple Music, Apple Pay, as well as continued growth from its App Store. In fiscal year 2016, Apple saw growth from its Other Products (Apple says this "includes sales of Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, iPod and Apple-branded third party accessories") and its services (Apple explains that this "includes revenue from Internet Services, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services"). However, its iPhone, iPad, and Mac businesses all declined in that fiscal year. Apple is certainly onto something with its services business, and there's a chance that Apple Watch could be a long-term hit, but finding significant, sustained growth outside of its core iPhone/Mac/iPad businesses isn't likely to be easy.  Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

In fact just this week, Apple and Nokia locked horns in a patent battle over the use of patents that were not previously included in a licensing deal. But this filing is different. If you're not already familiar with all of the concepts of technology patents, it's important to understand a couple of important concepts, those are SEP (Standard Essential Patents) and FRAND (Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory) usage. SEP and FRAND are close relations. SEPs are the patents themselves, and FRAND is a basic set of terms under which SEPs should be licensed, and SEPs tend to be patents which are considered to be an essential part of a technology standard. An example might be something like GSM or LTE, which could never be widely standardized if one of the component technologies within the standard was licensed for a prohibitively large sum by its inventor. Still with me? One of the few cards that Nokia still holds in the mobile space is patents. Historically, Nokia was a big innovator in the early days of mobile (alongside Ericsson and Motorola), so it still holds patents that companies like Apple need to license in order to be able to create its products. As the patents have been deemed SEPs, Nokia has a responsibility to license them to Apple under FRAND terms. However, the lawsuit filed on Tuesday by Apple indirectly accuses Nokia of colluding with patent assertion entities, such as Acacia Research Corporation and its subsidiary, Conversant Intellectual Property Management, to “extract and extort exorbitant revenues unfairly and anti-competitively from Apple and other innovative suppliers of cell phones”. The reason that Apple is accusing Nokia indirectly, is that Nokia are not actually named as a defendant in the case, though Apple has named it explicitly in their statement: In 2011, Nokia remained a major supplier of cell phones, but, due to its failure to innovate, was facing business prospects so dire that Nokia ultimately exited the cell phone market. As Nokia’s CEO had announced to employees the previous year, Nokia was standing on “a burning platform.” Unable to compete with innovative companies such as Apple — which had developed a revolutionary hardware and software platform — Nokia quickly transformed itself. It changed from a company focused on supplying cell phones and other consumer products to a company bent on exploiting the patents that remain from its years as a successful cellphone supplier. Acacia and its subsidiaries have sued Apple in the US and abroad in excess of 40 times, and the charge that Apple is leveling is that Nokia are essentially using the PAEs as 'mercenaries' to extract in damages much larger sums than would be paid under standard FRAND terms for the licensing of patents. According to the filing, Apple's goal with the case is to seek injunctive relief for itself and others targeted by Acacia and its subsidiaries “and to unwind the patent transfers that have enabled the anti-competitive conduct described herein.” Source: Slashgear | Patent Trolling hammer image by Shutterstock Tags Apple Nokia Acacia Patent Patents Lawsuit Like Tweet Share Share Report a problem with article Previous Story Microsoft's entry-level Surface Pro 4 gets 10% off in the UK, now available for £674 Next Story What do leaked DNC emails and the Ukrainian army have in common?

While Apple typically releases best-of lists every single year, it’s always interesting when the company dives a bit deeper and gives us even more granular sales data. Don't Miss: The best TV shows on Netflix you’ve never heard of Elf Assuming the top spot is the Will Ferrell classic Elf. An oldie but a goodie, Elf hit theaters in 2003 and was a surprise comedic success. National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation Checking in at the number two spot is National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation, arguably Chevy Chase’s second best movie behind 1983’s National Lampoon’s Vacation. While some comedies grow stale with time, National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation holds up remarkably well and is well worth checking out if you haven’t  yet had the pleasure of watching it. Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas Filling up the third spot is Jim Carrey’s 2000 feature,  Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Home Alone An iconic classic for the ages, it’s no surprise to see Home Alone on the list. If anything, I’m surprised that it didn’t rank even higher. The Polar Express The most recent film on the list is 2004’s The Polar Express starring Tom Hanks. Trending right now: Netflix’s worst-rated original TV show cost the company $200 million Some are saying Apple’s iOS 10.2 update made their iPhone battery problems even worse T-Mobile customers tell horror stories of bills full of charges they never asked for See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next 9 tech-friendly gifts for people obsessed with travel Yahoo Tech CNN uses screenshot from ‘Fallout 4’ to show how Russians hack things BGR News Facebook launches live 360-degree video feature Yahoo Tech The battle between SSD and HDD is over, and the winner is clear Digital Trends Celebrity sues Tesla, claims Model X drove itself through a wall and into his house BGR News A theory that challenges Newton’s and Einstein’s gravity and nixes dark matter passed its first test Quartz Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo Finance
Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple This is how Apple Music plans to steal everyone from Spotify Yoni Heisler BGR NewsDecember 23, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Apple Music still has a ways to go before it catches up to Spotify, but with 20 million paying subscribers already on the books, Apple’s relatively new streaming service is doing quite well just 17 months after its release. With an Apple Music subscription costing $9.99 at a minimum, it stands to reason that the company has already recouped the $3 billion it spent to acquire Beats in May of 2014. Don't Miss: This is the worst iPhone 8 rumor we’ve heard so far In a new profile of Apple’s streaming service, The New York Times recently interviewed Apple Music executives Larry Jackson and Jimmy Iovine where the two discussed a wide range of topics, including the company’s never-ending quest to secure exclusives and even Jackson and Iovine’s relationship with Kanye West. Of particular interest is that Apple Music is being positioned as a marketing platform as much as it is a music platform. To this point, Apple’s music executives are eager to point out that many albums that premiere exclusively on Apple Music, coupled with a promotional push from Apple, end up performing exceedingly well on the charts. Drake wasn’t the only one to benefit. Albums this year from Travis Scott, Future and DJ Khaled all debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard chart as Apple Music exclusives, as did “Blonde” by Frank Ocean, who rattled the industry when he ditched his label to work directly with the streaming service. Chance the Rapper’s Grammy-nominated mixtape, “Coloring Book,” was not sold at all and was available to stream only via Apple for two weeks. As far as Apple’s ongoing effort to secure exclusives is concerned, one of the ways the company is able to convince artists to sign on the dotted line is that the company, via its marketing muscle and iTunes footprint, can provide promotional assistance in a manner that Spotify simply can’t match. With Drake in particular, Apple went so far as to sponsor the rapper’s 60-city Summer Sixteen tour this past summer. Of course, Apple can’t always secure every exclusive it sets its eyes on. Iovine, for example, told the Times that he would have loved to get Adele’s most recent album as an Apple Music exclusive but that it just wasn’t feasible. For anyone interested in a behind the scenes look at the individuals largely tasked with driving Apple Music forward, make sure to check out the entire interview via the source link below.

Canon Tokki Corp., surrounded by rice fields in the city of Mitsuke in Niigata prefecture, has a near monopoly on the machines capable of making screens with organic light-emitting diodes, which enable sharp, vibrant displays that use less energy. The Canon Inc. unit with 343 employees has spent more than two decades perfecting the manufacturing equipment used by OLED screen makers. But there’s a problem: Canon Tokki has a growing backlog even after doubling output in 2016. The potential production bottleneck is raising questions over Apple’s ability to feature OLED displays in next year’s iPhones, and whether the Cupertino company will be able to line up additional suppliers. The current wait for a machine, which can cost more than $85 million, is about two years. “We are doing all we can to increase output and make that wait shorter,” said CEO Teruhisa Tsugami, adding that demand from display makers, including Samsung Display Co., LG Display Co. and Sharp Corp., will remain strong for the next three years. Apple has been making preparations to outfit its next iPhone with OLED displays, the latest chapter in its now-familiar strategy of tempting people to upgrade by offering new features. Over the years, the improvements have included sharper screens, fingerprint identification, pressure-sensitive displays and custom-designed chips. That push has also put a spotlight on suppliers of previously obscure technologies, testing their capacity to satisfy the demand for more than 200 million iPhones each year. A couple of years ago, Apple sought to use strong sapphire glass for iPhones, only to abandon the effort when a manufacturer couldn’t deliver enough of acceptable quality and went bankrupt. The scratch-resistant material is now featured on the Apple Watch. Now OLED is the big goal. The technology has been included on top-end smartphones for years, including almost all of Samsung Electronics Co.’s high-end phones. While LCDs rely on a backlight panel, OLED pixels can glow on their own, resulting in thinner displays, better battery life and improved contrast. OLED screens can also be made on flexible plastic, allowing for a wider variety of shapes and applications. “OLEDs aren’t just for flat areas, but can be used on edges, so smartphone makers will challenge themselves by building displays with new shapes,” Tsugami said. “These qualities in OLED will give it an advantage.” The machines that build OLED screens are almost all made by Canon Tokki, founded by the current CEO’s father in 1967 (tokki means “special equipment” in Japanese). The company doesn’t disclose production details and earnings figures. Its current annual output capacity is less than 10 units, according to two people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information is confidential. To call Canon Tokki’s product a machine is something of an understatement. Each one is a vacuum production line 328 feet long. Glass panels, roughly the size of a large TV screen, are propelled by robotic arms through several chambers. Red, green and blue pixels are deposited on the surface by evaporating organic materials. “You don’t make it on an assembly line, but rather custom craft it for your clients like a high-performance supercar,” Alberto Moel, a technology analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., said of Canon Tokki’s machines. “Suddenly everyone wants your car.” One of the challenges is in aligning the glass pane with a fine metal mesh that serves as a stencil for the pixels. Canon Tokki, which has been making OLED machines since 1993, has a patented mechanism that uses camera tracking to achieve a margin of error that’s less than the size of a human red-blood cell. Such precision is critical for display makers because it improves yield. Even for LCDs, which dominate in flat-panel TVs and are used in iPhones, a fraction of output ends up being defective, and discarded. Achieving acceptable yields is even harder with OLEDs. Canon Tokki’s years of experience working with display makers give it a head start against rivals like Ulvac Inc. and Tokyo Electron Ltd., according to Tsugami. The market for small- and medium-size OLED panels will be worth $18.6 billion in 2018, exceeding that for the liquid-crystal counterparts for the first time, according to IHS Markit. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Tokki and they will have the market to themselves for the next two to three years,” Moel said. Apple plans to ship at least one iPhone model with an OLED screen next year, the 10th anniversary of the smartphone’s introduction, people with knowledge of the matter have said. While Samsung is on track to be the sole supplier, the South Korean company may not be able to make enough due to low yield rates combined with increasing iPhone demand. Sharp and Japan Display Inc. are still working on test procedures for OLED screens and have said that they are on track to begin production in 2018. This week, Japan Display got about a $640 million lifeline from a government-backed fund that will let it invest in OLED production. Sharp is investing nearly $490 million for the development of OLED production facilities, thanks to a rescue package from Foxconn this year. Canon Tokki is central to those plans. When Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou addressed employees at Sharp’s display unit after gaining control of the Japanese company this year, he sought to reassure them by saying that he had just traveled to Canon Tokki’s headquarters in Niigata to secure an order, according to a former employee present at the meeting. Other Japanese companies are also expected to play a key role in the OLED supply chain. Dai Nippon Printing Co. and Toppan Printing Co. produce evaporation masks, Nippon Electric Glass Co. and Asahi Glass Co. make the glass substrate, and Idemitsu Kosan Co. produces organic compounds. This web of manufacturers working on critical elements of a supply chain is a “perfect example of Japan’s submerged manufacturing ecosystem,” Bernstein’s Moel said. “It comes up every time there is a quake in Japan and the supply chain is suddenly disrupted. Take vacuum organic deposition. Guess what, it’s some company in Niigata.” Pavel Alpeyev and Takashi Amano are Bloomberg writers.

Apple appears to have pulled the accessories in the last day or two, eliminating Withings products like the Body Cardio Scale, the Smart Body Analyzer, and the Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor. When searching for these products on Apple's site, they are no longer listed as available for purchase. Apple has stopped offering all Withings products because Withings is owned by Nokia following a spring 2016 purchase worth an estimated $192 million. The Withings brand has been integrated into Nokia's Digital Health unit and is led by Cedric Hutchings, formerly the CEO of Withings. A cached version of the listing for the Withings Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor, no longer available from Apple.com Earlier this week, Apple filed an antitrust lawsuit accusing Nokia and several patent assertion entities of illegally transferring patents to attempt to extort excessive royalty fees from the Cupertino company. Apple had established FRAND (Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory) deals with Nokia, but by transferring patents to patent holding companies, additional royalties can be demanded. In response, Nokia filed 40 patent infringement lawsuits against Apple across 11 countries, accusing the Cupertino company of failing to establish licensing deals for Nokia patents that cover displays, user interface, software, antenna, chipsets, and video coding. According to Apple, Nokia has been conspiring with patent assertion entities (Acacia Research and Conversant Property Management) in an "illegal patent transfer scheme" to wring money out of Apple because Nokia's cell phone business is failing. Nokia, meanwhile, says that it has not been able to reach a licensing agreement with Apple and must defend its rights.

If a company is suing you, and doing it in the way described in this article, you are not going to devote space on your shelves, in your retail stores, to that company. Simple.

Rating: 23 Votes britboyj 1 week ago Most companies tend not to enjoy funding lawsuits held against them... It's not about "throwing the toys out with the pram," it's about preventing conflicts of interest. Rating: 22 Votes robeddie 1 week ago I know it's their right, but at the same time, it seems so childish. And let's face it, Apple is suing other companies left and right too. In fact, haven't they battled Samsung? They should cut all ties with Samsung too (yeah, right). Rating: 18 Votes Stella 1 week ago Apple throwing its toys out of the stroller. Grow up. Apple store is the last place I'd personally buy a fitness gadget. Rating: 14 Votes kingchevy7 1 week ago People are calling this childish behavior????? Here's an analogy: You have an employee. That employee tries to scheme against your company to create a lawsuit against your company. Firing the dude is gonna be the first thing you do... It's not childish to pull product from a company that's clearly not playing nice. Think before you post people. Rating: 10 Votes bbeagle 1 week ago Wow. All these anti-Apple trolls. Your neighbor borrows your lawnmower. He injures himself while using it and sues you. Is it petty to not allow him to use your trimmer? Same thing with Apple here: I'm not going to help you if you're trying to hurt me. It would be petty if Apple was trying to pull Nokia stuff from Amazon with some lawsuit.... but they're not... just pulling it from their OWN stores.

Skip the usual, and give the season a bit of a twist with these options, and as always, take care out there and give your designated driver a hug. Mulled white wine: traditionally made with red, last year the folks at Vin Amité introduced me to mulled white. Lighter in style, use chardonnay or viognier, and mull with star anise, fresh orange peel (use the slices for garnish), cloves, and maybe a bit of brandy. Eggnog and bourbon: that about sums it up. Replace the rum with a good bourbon for a change. Non-boozy treat? A shot of espresso in a cup of nog, or half nog and half hot chocolate. Hot gin and tonic: a discovery at the newly opened Knotweed at Legend Distilling. The trick is using tonic syrup. An ounce and a half, equal parts gin (more or less), top with hot water and a cinnamon stick. Throw in a lemon slice for vitamin C. Alchocolates: the combo of hot chocolate and a libation, or combo of libations. Don’t be stingy with the whipped cream on top of good hot chocolate with a shot of kirsch, peppermint schnapps, Frangelico. I may try one with the brand new Lady of the Cask brandy from Maple Leaf Spirits this Boxing Day. Okanagan Mimosa: pour a splash of a late harvest wine, preferably a red for some colour, in the bottom of a glass, top with a sparkling wine, maybe a splash of the nearest fruit juice, for your health. My favourite combo: Rustic Roots Santa Rosa sweet plum wine, Bella Wines sparkling rosé (if you can find a bottle) or 8th Generation Confidence. Apple Pie Punch: for the non-imbibers, combine apple cider, ginger ale, apple slices and a cinnamon stick for garnish, and for the kids, turn this into an apple pie float with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Here is a Christmas recipe favourite of mine that I wanted to share Pair with a bottle of Prosecco or a crème de menthe cocktail! Ingredients Two packages (three oz each) lime-flavoured Jell-o 2 cups boiling water 2 cups cold water ¼ teaspoon peppermint extract 1 envelope Dream Whip or one container (4 ½ ounces) Cool Whip 8 cream-filled chocolate cookies (Oreos), finely crushed Dissolve Jell-o in boiling water, then add cold water and peppermint extract. Chill until slightly thickened, about 60-90 minutes. Prepare Dream Whip as directed on package if not using Cool Whip. Measure 1 ¾ cups gelatin and pour into a 9x5 inch loaf pan and chill 5-10 minutes. Meanwhile, blend whipped topping into the remaining Jell-o. Carefully spoon 1/3 of creamy mixture into the pan, on top of the Jell-o. Sprinkle half of the cookie crumbs on top. Repeat these layers and spoon the remaining creamy mixture on top. Chill until firm, about four hours. Unmold from the pan, garnish with cookie crumbs if desired. Makes six cups or about 10 servings. Cheers to the season!

Do the manufacturers ever update these gadgets? A: Good question, because many people forget their modem even exists, unless there’s a power outage and they have to reboot. The short answer is yes; companies often upgrade their hardware every few years. As download speeds increase, companies have to provide more sophisticated modems. What you want to know is whether your modem is keeping up with the demands of your service. You can contact your cable company, of course, but you may be able to skip the phone call if you know what you’re looking for. Click here to learn about the DOCSIS 3.0 and whether your modem is up to speed. Using Apple for the first time Q: I just switched from Windows to Mac after using Windows for 20 years. Do you have any pointers for this new Apple user? A: Switching to Apple does take some adjustment. You’ll find a lot of things are similar, including many of the programs, but the layout and appearance can be dizzyingly different. You’re so accustomed to the “Start” icon and the “Insert” key that you wonder what you’ll do without them. Don’t worry: Apple is famous for its intuitive design, and you’ll figure everything out in no time. But there are certain tricks to help you through those first few days.

The advantage of deactivating is that you preserve all your information, including photos and statuses, and you can switch it back on whenever you want. Fully deleting your account takes a little more time, but the process will erase every byte of data from your account. Click here for the steps to delete your Facebook account.

The company told developers on Friday, however, that it is extending that deadline. App Transport Security First introduced with iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan, ATS greatly improves device security for Apple customers. It requires apps to use secure network connections over HTTPS, which encrypts that traffic and protects it from third parties. In a short announcement, Apple wrote: “To give you additional time to prepare, this deadline has been extended and we will provide another update when a new deadline is confirmed…” This makes sure that all network communications coming out of iOS is encrypted. And it means that developers will use industry-standard encryption protocols, instead of third-party frameworks. iPhone Encryption Slow Adoption Now that HTTPS is becoming the default standard on the web, Apple wants to do the same for apps. But mobile analytics firm Appthority said that after the technology’s introduction, only 3% of the top 200 apps had support for ATS. At WWDC 2016, Apple said the developers needed to add ATS support to their apps by January 1, 2017. But now the company has changed its mind, and it hasn’t announced a new deadline. This worries CIO, who commented, “It’s hard to know why developers did not meet this deadline. There certainly was adequate time…The fact that they haven’t announced a new date suggests to me that it’s probably not in the next six months.” Absent additional information, that’s a reasonable interpretation of events. We hope, however, that Apple will still push developers to make this change sometime in 2017.

It’s an improvement over the third-party frameworks that developers previously used to implement HTTPS because it ensures that only industry-standard encryption protocols and ciphers are used.

The document includes Apple’s own public PGP key for those verifications. Apple noted that its current PGP key will be valid until May of 2018. PGP, or “pretty good privacy” is one of the most popular encryption schemes in general use today, through both the PGP Corporation and the open source GnuPGP. Apple posted links to both. You can subscribe to Apple’s Security-announce emails at Apple’s website.

Maybe they should just build this into Mail for macOS and iOS as well as Safari, that would leave only 3rd party apps needing to do anything manually. December 23, 2016 at 8:01 EST PM jbruni December 24, 2016 A public key is not used to encrypt emails (unless you are sending an email to Apple), but to validate the digital signature of the email. For Apple to encrypt emails, they would need your (everyone’s) public keys. December 24, 2016 at 1:01 EST PM jbruni December 24, 2016 Apple is been using PGP-signed emails for their security announcement for many years — at least a decade. The macOS email program supports S/MIME but not PGP/MIME which is really weird. There is obviously a disconnect at Apple. Since Mail supports S/MIME, Apple’s security division could easily sign emails using a certificate issued by Apple’s own CA (certificate authority), rather than having to rely on the end user installing a PGP-compatible client. I’d like to see Apple either use S/MIME thoroughly, and maybe provide a way for end users to easily get certificates (perhaps through AppleIDs?), or embrace PGP/MIME, include GnuPG in macOS, like they do other open-source software, and fully integrate PGP into Mail and Finder. December 24, 2016 at 1:09 EST PM gGrant December 25, 2016 I agree – GPG or something like that should be standard for all user mail. Apple’s Mail apps (all mail apps to be fair, but stick to Apple) should have it standard and transparent to users. I’m pretty sure the OS can send mail without using the app, so all mail services in the OS, for that matter. Our Mail is only for the intended recipient. We don’t want intermediate servers being littered with our plain-text. Anyone might be able to hack them. Now a dose of reality – i wonder if end to end encryption for Mail is actually possible. Is iMessage really encrypted? Recent stories cast doubt on that. December 25, 2016 at 9:15 EST AM gGrant December 25, 2016 …Or routers, then it doesn’t matter if Chinese government companies make routers that leak like a sieve. US routers probably do, too, but nobody worries about that. December 25, 2016 at 9:18 EST AM jbruni December 26, 2016 @gGrant, Apple Mail does support end-to-end encryption if you have exchanged certificates with your intended recipient. If that condition is met, Mail shows a lock icon in the new message window allowing you to encrypt the message using S/MIME. For the technically savvy, I recommend getting a free S/MIME email certificate from startssl.com. This allows you to digitally sign your emails. If more people get certificates, then that increases the ability to encrypt. December 26, 2016 at 11:59 EST AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Why did Apple take down the health-related devices in the middle of the holiday season?  ( Withings ) Advertisement Customers looking to purchase Withings products from Apple's stores will not be able to find the health-related devices, as it looks like Apple has pulled them out. Searches for Withings devices such as the Body Cardio Scale, the Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor, and the Smart Body Analyzer on Apple's online store reveals that the items are no longer listed for sale. Presumably, the products have also been taken down from Apple's physical retail stores all over the world. Why Are Withings Products Being Pulled Out Of Apple Stores? Health-related devices such as those being produced by Withings are great holiday gifts, so why would Apple take them down from its physical and online stores? According to a Mac Rumors report, the reason behind the disappearance of Withings products in Apple stores is that the health device company is owned by Nokia, which purchased the accessory maker earlier this year for about $191 million. Withings has been integrated into the Digital Health unit of Nokia, which is led by former Withings CEO Cedric Hutchings. As reported earlier this week, Apple and Nokia are once again engaged in a patent battle, and it does not make sense that Apple will continue helping sell Withings products when it would benefit a company with which it is currently trading lawsuits. Apple And Nokia Patent Battle Apple and Nokia settled a patent lawsuit back in 2011, wherein Nokia accused Apple of infringing on certain patents that it held. The patents come with fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms, known as FRAND, which allow other companies to use them without needing to pay excessive licensing fees due to the patents being widely used in the tech industry. Despite the patents coming with FRAND terms, Apple eventually relented and agreed to pay a one-time fee to Nokia, along with future royalties. However, it seems that the history between Apple and Nokia will not end there. In the new patent battle between the two companies, Apple filed lawsuits against nine Nokia-aligned patent assertion entities, which are at times called patent trolls. Apple claims that the nine PAEs are working to have Apple pay out as much money as possible through exorbitant licensing requirements for patents that should have FRAND terms. In response, Nokia has filed five lawsuits against Apple for 32 counts of patent infringement. It could not yet be determined how this latest legal battle will play out, but Nokia is already said to be suffering from it. Shares for the company fell by almost 5 percent after the lawsuits were reported, as analysts are concerned that the legal battle with Apple will only delay the royalty payments that the company needs to maintain its profits.

Nokia purchased the Withings line of smart devices earlier this year for around $192 million and has since integrated the company into its smart line of products… The removal was first reported by MacRumors. Apple pulled a similar tactic when its Beats unit went toe to toe with Bose over its NFL exclusivity contract in October 2014 and prior patent disagreements. After things were resolved in December 2014, Bose products returned to the Apple Store shelves. Apple Retail Stores and Online Store represent a significant chunk of online sales and Apple apparently feels that it can use it as a strong arm bargaining chip in these types of negotiations. Sadly, we’re big fans of Withings products over here, which now support HomeKit and of course they are available at other outlets. Apple hasn’t pulled the Withings apps from the App Store yet but it probably wouldn’t hurt to download them if you think you will need them…just in case.
