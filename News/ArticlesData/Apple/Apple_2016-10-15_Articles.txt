Here are the seven most important things to remember before doing an iPhone upgrade. Since as of today the iPhone 7 Plus has sold-out and the black iPhone 7 is also sold-out. Customers can continue to preorder all styles and colors from retailers. You have time to look for better deal when stock is replenished. One-Wait for Others to Test It, First It is often better to wait a few weeks or even a month before buying the latest model. Often there are new glitches discovered and many incompatibility issues with other devices. For instance the iOS 10 update this week caused some iPhones to brick. Apple usually fixes the problem immediately but some iPhone users suffered. Two-Research Compatibility The major change for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7S is the removal of the aux jack or audio jack. You may have many devices that you are using with the aux jack on your iPhone such as a car or your favorite headphones. There are new aftermarket devices in development that will adapt the lightning connector to the AUX connector. These will be bulky and they may not be compatible with all your legacy devices. Before you buy an iPhone 7, realize that you may not be able to use your favorite headphones for a while.  The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 + come with lightning connector earbuds, they may not be the style or the quality you like the most. Three-Research Deals The best deals for buying iPhones for trade-ins and longer return policies are around the holiday season. Apple releases the iPhone in September because the biggest sales and the renewal of contracts are typically in late November to December. Carriers often because of the gift-giving process over the holidays give a longer time to reflect on iPhones for returns and exchanges. If you're not sure, or you don't have the time to adapt to the new iPhone if you can wait until the holiday season when you may have some time off you may be able to get better deals. Verizon specials include Get $100 Off Beats Powerbeats2 Wireless in ear headphones with the purchase of any Apple device, (offer applied in cart). Verizon is also offering the  iPhone 7 for $0 when you trade in select iPhone models. 649.99 on device payment req'd. Less $650 credit over 24 months w/trade in of qualified iPhone. Credits begins in 2-3 bill cycles. When you sswitch to Verizon LTE Advanced. 50% faster peak speeds. Save $100 on top smartphones. Use promo code VZWDEAL at checkout. New device payment activation required. You can get iPhone 7 for $0 when you trade in an eligible iPhone to AT&T. Or switch and get a FREE iPhone 7 (32GB) when you have DIRECTV and AT&T. Sprint preorders are now shipping around September 30. When you pre-order iPhone 7 on sprint.com, get a free memory upgrade. Or you can get Get iPhone 7 on Sprint! . There is also iPhone Forever from Sprint! Get the newest iPhone every year + Save up to $120 when you switch to Sprint and lease a new line of service!! Four - Listen for Quality? The iPhone 7 and 7 plus have new stereo speakers which should improve listening quality, they will still be small. If you connect to your car through an aux port, you may have to figure out some kind of adapter. Adapters right now are expensive, using a non-Apple adapter may void your warranty if something breaks. You can go to an Apple store or carrier retailer to listen to the new speakers and see if you like them. Five Call Retail Stores when Preorders Are Back-ordered In the past, preorder servers have gone down for the iPhone. You may have to wait if you order today online, since Apple has sold its current stock. When you phone stores on the day of purchase, they will tell you if they have the color and size you want. Going to an Apple store or crrier store may be faster. Plus the genius of sales associate may copy your files and settings foryou. When we last checked preorders are shipping for AT&T on September 20th to September 27th for the iPhone 7.  iPhone orders from Verizon were set to deliver by October 12th. T-Mobile pre-orders have been four times that of the iPhone 6 the black is the most popular color. Six - Read the Fine Print for Extra Fees When you do buy a new iPhone, be sure to read the exact details of all the deals that are being offered right now for the iPhone 7. Often in the credit will not appear for several months on your bill. The most important thing to realize that a $7000 iPhone 7 will require sales tax and in California that's close to $75 there maybe also activation fees on top of the sales tax that have to paid up front. Seven - Test a Real iPhone 7 or 7 Plus and Look for Quality There is nothing better than seeing and testing a phone in person. To some a thinner iPhone 7 may not make a difference. The black color is not the most popular, but when you see other colors you may like them better. The screen resolution on the iPhone 7 has not improved and doesn't have full HD screen. The iPhone 7 Plus has full HD screen. If you watch precise videos, you may notice a big difference. One major buying reason for the both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus is water resistance.If you use your phone in wet weather, are athletic or go boating, the water resistance may be the most important reason for buying an iPhone as soon as you can. The iPhone is now nine years old. We know there will be another model next year. The upgrades now are incremental. Take the time to make sure the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are the models you really want and need right now.     No Related News.

The Pride of Homeschooling... Home | EconLog | Archives | Permanent Link and Comments I woke up this morning at 4:30 a.m. and, as is my wont, reached for my iPhone. On it was a message I've never seen before. It told me that there was an activation lock on my phone. When I pushed a button or two, I found out that I had to remember my Apple ID and my password. I had written my password in a safe place but couldn't find my Apple ID. When I went on to the web, I found out my Apple ID but it didn't work with my password. This all took a while. I tried various things and started to panic. I'm heading up to San Jose State University late tomorrow afternoon to see historian Phil Magness speak and I usually use that time productively to make calls. Also, what if I went to the wrong building on campus and needed to text someone to find the right building? I started thinking through all the uses of my iPhone--how it's become an important tool for my business and personal life that I use every day. Since I'm an economist, that got me thinking about the enormous consumer surplus I get from my smartphone. I thought about it two ways: (1) the smaller consumer surplus I get if the alternative is another smartphone, and (2) the huge consumer surplus I get it if the alternative is no smartphone. Because it was early in the morning and my panic was contending with my reason, I started thinking about the other thing I've despaired about: the coming election of president of the United States. We have two horrible choices (well, we have a good third choice, and I'm going to vote for him, but I'm realistic about his chances) and I've gone back and forth about which one I would like to lose more. The best case I've seen against Trump is this one by Steven Landsburg. I pretty much agree with it, but he doesn't address Hillary Clinton's hawkishness toward Russia or her pro-war views generally. The best case I've seen for Trump over Hillary is this one by Walter Block. Then, since it was still early morning, I asked myself this: Let's say I figure that I fear Trump more than Clinton or let's say that I figure I fear Clinton more than Trump. Figure out the delta in the value of the outcome for me. And assume I can put aside that Clinton, obviously not intentionally, does something that leads to nuclear war, or that Trump, possibly intentionally if he does it, starts a nuclear war. So no nuclear war. My gut feel is that the delta in outcome for me is less than the consumer surplus I get from my iPhone versus having no smartphone. Epilogue: When my wife woke up, by the way, she suggested that I go online and get Apple to call me. I did, the woman was very nice, she asked me some security questions, and I got my correct Apple ID. It turns out that there's one for my computer and one for my iPhone.

It’s quite good at securely remembering such things across your devices, and while maybe you were out of your phone you’d have access to it via your computer. I’ve used it for what feels like an eternity and it’s never let me down. Posted October 16, 2016 8:08 PM Economic Sophisms writes: [Comment removed. Please consult our comment policies and check your email for explanation.--Econlib Ed.] Posted October 16, 2016 10:30 PM Greg G writes: David, I am disappointed to see you engaging in this false equivalence between Hilary and Donald. Hilary has been around forever and is rightly seen as representative of everything people don't like about the political establishment. That would be the political establishment of what is still (for now) the most free and prosperous country in human history. She is too hawkish for my taste but a whole lot less hawkish and less recklessly impulsive than Trump. Among his remarkably few consistent positions are: That we should go into Iraq and "take their oil." That we should embrace the use of torture. That we should go after the innocent family members of terrorists. That we should admire the "strong leadership" of the world's worst dictators. That we should welcome nuclear proliferation. That we should change libel laws in a way to make it easier to intimidate the press. That we should view as illegitimate any election result he doesn't like. I'm not sure how or why that should be compared to how you feel about your iPhone. Posted October 17, 2016 8:04 AM Khodge writes: @Jeff B: anything that makes it easier to find pw information (especially electronic!) makes it easier to break security. David, I am totally puzzled by the assertion of Block and his interviewer, Daniel, that (guessing at numbers) Trump will be 5% effective at implementing his policy while Clinton will be 95% effective yet they continue their conversation. That discrepancy (or some similar difference) pretty much makes one somewhat harmless and the other radically dangerous. Posted October 17, 2016 12:57 PM David R. Henderson writes: @Greg G, I’m not convinced that he’s less hawkish. But I agree that he’s awful. I hadn’t known that he favored nuclear proliferation, but there’s a reasonable case to be made for that. Notice that of the 3 countries George W. Bush falsely put in his “axis of evil,” the one he hardly threatened at all was the one with nuclear weapons. @Khodge, I am totally puzzled by the assertion of Block and his interviewer, Daniel, that (guessing at numbers) Trump will be 5% effective at implementing his policy while Clinton will be 95% effective yet they continue their conversation. That discrepancy (or some similar difference) pretty much makes one somewhat harmless and the other radically dangerous. I am too. I would put it at Trump 20% successful and Clinton 35% successful. Posted October 18, 2016 1:14 PM Syed Ahsan writes: i saw a lot of energy and decent discussions on campus when i was there during the last elections. It seems quite different now when people are mostly confused and skeptical about both the candidates. Best of luck !

But we now know when we will be. Apple quietly updated its Apple Watch Nike+ website to include a 28 October release date. The Apple Watch Series 2’s upgrades focus relentlessly on fitness tracking, as detailed in Macworld’s comprehensive Apple Watch Series 2 review, and the Apple Watch Nike+ cranks that to 11. This special Watch build has a perforated sports band for enhanced ventilation, and is paired with the Apple Watch Series 2’s lightweight aluminum case. Of course, it still offers core Apple Watch Series 2 features like built-in GPS and water resistance up to 50 metres deep. But this collaboration goes beyond mere physical design. The Apple Watch Nike+ includes numerous runner-centric software touches, such as special active watch faces and the Nike+ Run Club social app, which provides you with motivational prompts, workout comparisons and fist bumps with friends, run scheduling, personalised coaching sessions and more. The Apple Watch Nike+ will be available in a variety of colours, at the same starting price as the Apple Watch Series 2 itself: $529 for the 38mm version, and $579 for the 42mm model.

Apple also took away a couple of things — namely the 3.5mm headphone jack (which upset a lot of people) and a mechanical home button. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus did away with the physical switch mechanism that has been with the home button since the iPhone was introduced in 2007, and instead introduced a stationary, pressure sensitive “button” that is tied to the iPhone’s Taptic engine. Through the use of some clever software, the new home button can somewhat decently mimic the clicking sensation of its predecessor, while at the same time helping to improve water resistance. Doing away with the physical switch also eliminates a common failure point with iPhones, but what happens when the new solid-state home button decides to cough up a lung? Well, Apple has apparently already thought of that. As discovered by MacRumors forum member iwayne, Apple has implement a software workaround that will still allow you to “Get Home” if the button actually malfunctions. In this case, Apple displays a warning prompt that points out a home button issue and automatically enables Assistive Touch (a feature that has been within iOS for quite some time). It’s a little disconcerting to see that the new iPhone 7’s home button, which was supposed to solve the issues of premature button failure, are already experiencing issues this early in the game. But at least Apple has adopted a quick workaround to allows users to limp back to an Apple Store for repair or replacement. And if the early rumors are accurate, next year’s iPhone might not even a home button at all. It’s been reported that Apple will try to minimize the bezels on the 2017 iPhone and go with a software based home button and under-the-glass Touch ID sensor in its place.

By David Dritsas, Brad's Deals October 16, 2016 Save for later Saved The Apple iPhone7 and AirPods are displayed during an Apple media event in San Francisco. Beck Diefenbach/Reuters/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of So you answered Apple's siren call, and upgraded to the iPhone 7. And despite all the cool new features, there's still one thing you can't get over: you hate having just one port for your headphones and charger. To add insult to injury, Apple's solution to this problem, those fancy new  Airpods, cost $160.  We understand your frustration, so we gathered up a few of our favorite Bluetooth alternatives to the Airpods that cost less than $100 each. Even if you don't have an iPhone 7, going wireless is a great option for any smartphone user. It should be noted that the prices in this post are subject to change, but they generally hover around what we've listed here. We should also mention that we regularly see no-name brands run for as low as (or in rare cases lower than) $20, but these brands are no-name for a reason, and we can't vouch for their quality or reliability. The options named here have all been well-reviewed on trusted online review sites by people who really bought them. Recommended: Think you know Steve Jobs? Take our quiz! Plantronics Backbeat Fit Bluetooth Headphones – Lowest price: $75.99 + free shipping at  Target Most review sites consistently rank these at the top of the list for reliable Bluetooth headphones that won't break the bank. You might recognize Plantronics from the mobile phone world, as they're one of the bigger names in mobile audio right now, and they're actually a reputable brand. These headphones are coated to resist sweat during a workout and have a built-in mic for taking calls. The wrap around design isn't as flexible as some of the other models here, but some people prefer that rigidity. Test your knowledge Think you know Steve Jobs? Take our quiz! Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend Beats Powerbeats2 – Lowest price: $99.99 shipped at  Target Our readers love Beats headphones, but in our professional opinion, the price of these headphones doesn't always match their quality. However, the Powerbeats2 may be the exception. Well-reviewed and often on sale, these wireless sport earphones are priced right when they're discounted. They're originally $139.99, but we regularly see them on sale for $100 or less. If you don't see them on sale right now, chances are you won't have to wait long until they are again, so try to avoid paying full price for these. They are designed for sport use with over-the-ear hooks, a water-resistant exterior and a leash between earbuds to keep them on your head. Motorola VerveLoop+ – Lowest Price $79.99 at  B&H Photo Motorola is yet another mobile company that's been making wireless phone accessories for years, so it makes sense for them to have a reliable line of Bluetooth headphones. They get consistently good reviews from Amazon customers and include interesting features, like the Hubble Connect app that locates your earphones where they were last synced, just in case you lose them. The also feature multiple EQ settings, which allow you to adjust for your taste in bass. Jabra Sport Pace – Lowest Price $75.01 at  Amazon (but only a few left), Next best price is  Target These made several "best of" lists for 2016 and Jabra is a good audio brand. These have particularly good ratings for their audio performance, and high marks for good bass response. They are also good for sports use, with a waterproof casing and wrap-around ear hooks. JayBird X2 Sport – Lowest price: $79.99 shipped at  Amazon JayBird is not the best know of audio brand names, but these headphones show up on most of the "best of" lists out there as a great pair of Bluetooth earphones for under $100. They get good marks on audio performance, and while they don't have wrap-around hooks, they have sport ear fins to help lock them in while you are working out.

The new, nonmechanical implementation for the iPhone 7’s Home Button is theoretically much less fragile than its mechanical predecessors, as it is no longer a moving part that can break because of the natural wear and tear during use. Previously, each button press would wear the mechanism until it would eventually stop responding or even break off the phone. Image Credit: Digital Trends However, the solid state button could still fail, but Apple had enough foresight and care to take note of this possibility, especially since just how resistant the new, nonmechanical buttons are in the long run remains to be seen. The software workaround Once the solid state Home Button fails, iOS 10 immediately takes notice, alerting the user that their home button might need repairs, it also offers a software alternative in the meantime. iOS 10 is the operating system running on the latest iPhone 7, and where the programming controlling the Taptic Engine which controls the new Home Button’s feedback is deeply integrated, This previously unknown behavior was noticed by a user of the MacRumors forums, who goes by the username of “iwayne.” He shared a picture of his iPhone 7 displaying the warning — “The Home Button May Need Service. In the meantime, you can use the onscreen Home Button below,” — and software home button, after his solid state button failed for unknown reasons. The user says the warning appeared after his device suddenly powered off while charging. It first appeared when plugged, and even restarting the device did not fix it — the signal would eventually come back. He also reported that the Taptic Engine would fire about three or four times in a row after pressing the button, and another reboot returned it to its previous non-working state. The failure is likely related to the new Taptic Engine, which as the site MacRumors had previously reported, could stop working and become unresponsive should the operating system crash or freeze. This led to Apple changing the iPhone 7’s reset process to avoid this problem. Goodbye, Home Button…? There are rumors that next year’s iPhone — hypothetically, the “iPhone 8” — will ditch the Home Button concept in its entirety, replacing it with a button built directly into an edge-to-edge screen. It has also been rumored that the main reason for changing the traditional mechanic button for the new solid state one in the iPhone 7 is to ease users into these changes. Nothing official has been confirmed yet, however, the way the software replacement appears when the hardware button fails could be a clue to future implementations of the Home Button.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Apple Working On Magic Keyboard 2 With E-Ink Display Keys Posted: Oct 16 2016, 11:43am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, Updated: Oct 18 2016, 6:22pm CDT, in Rumors | Apple   Sonder   Apple might surprise us all with a new Magic Keyboard featuring E-Ink Display Keys. We are looking forward to Apple’s new MacBook Pro which is speculated to include an OLED touch bar with customized function keys. As per the latest reports it may be that Apple is taking that customization and applying it to a Magic keyboard all together. Don't Miss: The Best Black Friday 4K HDR TV Deals An unidentified source has given information which says that Apple is actually working on a second generation Magic keyboard that will include E-Ink displays. This information has been obtained from the Foxconn event in the Tsinghua University campus. We have seen many rumors regarding the OLED screen in the MacBook but this rumor is a first for sure. Sources claim that the novel E-Ink Magic keyboard hardware was actually seen as DFt model which in reality means it is in the testing stage before the actual production or development stage. In addition to this leaked information, we have gained information from a Foxconn executive who claims that Apple is nearly close to finalizing the deal for acquiring Sonder. Luckily the source has also pointed out a video that Sonder showed to him to tease how the new key board could actually be like. As far as the MacBook is concerned we are very much confident of hearing the announcement soon and thus we will be able to get a better insight of this Magic keyboard.

The first-round pick is inactive for Sunday's game against the Ravens with a groin injury. Apple missed the Giants' loss to the Vikings in Week 4 with a hamstring injury. He returned in last week's loss to the Packers, but left early in the game with a groin injury. Apple did not practice all week. Cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie will play on Sunday after hobbling through a groin injury in last week's game. Running back Rashad Jennings (thumb), kick returner Dwayne Harris (toe), defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul (groin) and linebacker Devon Kennard (concussion) are also active after being listed as questionable on the injury report. Must-win game for Giants The Giants are without their top two free safeties, so Andrew Adams will again start next to Landon Collins. Right tackle Bobby Hart will make his fourth straight start in place of Marshall Newhouse. Here's a look at the Giants' seven inactive players with analysis of the moves: •CB Eli Apple: Apple will be out of the lineup for the second time in three weeks. He is inactive on Sunday after injuring his groin last week. •WR Tavarres King: In a bit of a surprise, King is inactive and rookie Roger Lewis is active for Sunday's game. King is the team's fourth receiver, but Lewis plays a bigger role on special teams. King played two snaps on offense and no snaps on special teams last week. Lewis didn't play any offensive snaps, but played 21 special teams snaps last week. •LB Deontae Skinner: Skinner was promoted from the practice squad this week, but will be inactive as the Giants don't have a need at linebacker. •QB Josh Johnson: Johnson is a healthy scratch again. There's little value to dressing three quarterbacks, so Johnson will be inactive for the sixth straight game. •S Darian Thompson: The starting free safety will miss his fourth consecutive game with a sprained foot. Thompson finally got out of a walking boot this week, but he remains week-to-week. •S Nat Berhe: Thompson's backup will miss his third consecutive game with a concussion. Berhe has not practiced in the past three weeks, as he remains in the concussion protocol. There is no word on Berhe will be ready to return. •RT Marshall Newhouse: The starting right tackle will miss his fourth consecutive game with a calf injury. There is no timeline for Newhouse's return. Bobby Hart will make his fourth straight start at right tackle. The Ravens are missing a number of their top players. Here's Baltimore's inactives: WR Steve Smith Sr., OG Marshal Yanda, OT Ronnie Stanley, OLB Elvis Dumervil, KR Devin Hester, ILB C.J. Mosley, DT W.Henry.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) will add all models of its iPhone 4 and other old products to its vintage and obsolete product lists beginning October 31. According to Apple’s support page, vintage products have not been manufactured for more than 5 and less than 7 years. Obsolete products were discontinued more than 7 years. There are some exceptions that are listed on the support page. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624 MacRumors noted that the products listed at the Mac Otakara website specifically addresses Apple’s vintage and obsolete products in Japan. However these additions to the list will likely extend to the United States, Australia, Canada, and the rest of the Asia-Pacific and Europe regions. Other products included on the Japan list are the late-2010 13-inch MacBook Air, the third-generation AirPort Extreme, and the mid-2009 Airport Time Capsule. The CDMA versions of the iPhone 4 were declared obsolete last month and Apple has also recently made other products obsolete, including the mid-2009 iMac, the 2010 Mac mini, and the mid-2010 15-inch and 17-inch MacBook Pro. Here’s more on obsolete Apple products, including non-Apple versions of the Beats headphones: Monster-branded Beats products are considered obsolete regardless of when they were purchased. Apple has discontinued all hardware service for obsolete products with no exceptions. Service providers cannot order parts for obsolete products. All Apple Retail Stores and the Canadian, European, Latin American, and Asia-Pacific operating regions follow the U.S. product list, but make no distinction between vintage and obsolete. When applied to Apple Retail Stores and these operating regions, products on the U.S. vintage list (all models) are considered obsolete.

McIntyre October 16, 2016 9:33 am EST Print Email Tweet Consumers believed that the waiting line, either in stores or online, for the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone 7 jet black version would be long and the phone hard to come by. Even Apple said so. On its website, the phone is not available for three to five weeks. Macrumors has figured out that people can get the jet black version now, if they know where to go, which is not to every Apple Store. That place is website iStockNow, which has a map feature to show where to get each version of the iPhone. Getting a jet black version appears fairly easy, in some areas, and while they last. Macrumors has more advice: iStockNow uses Google Maps to visualize the real-time status of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus availability at Apple Stores in the United States and other countries, likely based on Apple’s reservation system backend. Nevertheless, placing an online reservation or calling your local store ahead of time is highly recommended. Apple Stores with Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus availability will display a green marker upon setting search filters for that model. Clicking on an individual marker opens a window with an expanded model-by-model breakdown of availability, and the time that stock was last updated at that location. Alternatively, people could just wait their turn and not be disappointed. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Douglas A.

Written by Ernie Smith October 16, 2016 // 11:00 AM EST Copy This URL A version of this post originally appeared on Tedium, a twice-weekly newsletter that hunts for the end of the long tail. The big-box technology store isn’t dead yet—and in the case of Best Buy, it’s actually doing pretty well, beating financial estimates by a country mile. But as a whole, the concept of the sprawling electronics chain is far from its peak. In fact, it’s sort of another shade of the office-supply store. Despite that, investors keep trying to revive this idea. Right now, an investor named Ronny Shmoel is trying to bring Circuit City back to life as a physical presence, roughly seven years after the brand was mothballed. These stores have traditionally been pretty huge, somewhat faceless, and built with the same philosophies that defined selling appliances in the 1960s. (To put some numbers into the equation, the average Best Buy is 37,000 square feet, according to an estimate reported by The Star-Tribune in 2012. That’s relatively small compared to the average Walmart SuperCenter, which takes up 179,000 square feet. Both Walmart and Best Buy have been experimenting with smaller formats so as to hit different markets.) Here’s my question about all this: Does the format really make sense at all? When it comes to selling electronics, can we do better? That’s a tough question; here’s my attempt to unpack it. The tale of DIVX, Circuit City’s horrible alternate-universe Netflix competitor In 1997, Circuit City was perhaps at the peak of its powers as a retail chain, and it was in a position to help shape the way we used technology. Problem was, the chain’s big foray into the world of hardware production was horrifyingly inept, driven by film-industry interests, and put into place in partnership with a law firm. A law firm! (That law firm, Ziffren, Brittenham, Branca & Fischer, is one of Hollywood’s most powerful, by the way.) But that 1997 announcement of Digital Video Express, or DIVX, was an attempt to reshape the home video industry in a way most beneficial to the movie studios. The strategy, based on the then-new DVD technology, involved the use of encrypted discs that can be used over a short period of time, but become re-encrypted after the availability window ends. “The DIVX disc is never returned, and so the consumer never has to pay late fees. The disc becomes part of the consumer’s home video library, with additional viewing periods easily purchased through the Divx player,” a 1997 press release explains. “Consumers also will be able, through the player, to convert many titles to unlimited viewing for a one-time fee, and certain titles will be available for purchase in the store as unlimited viewing discs.” Almost immediately, the idea took on a level of hatred that could only be compared to the way that some people talked about Internet Explorer back then. A number of anti-DIVX sites soon showed up on the scene, with passionate screeds that earned notice in the mainstream press. John Giberson, a Texas resident, earned media notices by launching the “National Organization to Ban DIVX” soon after the platform’s announcement. So assured was he that everyone else would dislike the idea of DIVX that he simply linked to Circuit City’s website and told his readers to get informed. “[DIVX] makes early adopters of DVD mad,” Giberson told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel in 1998. “I think it’s a bad idea and so do about 500,000 other people that have hit my Web site. I want to see DVD take off and stay as an affordable product for the mass market.” Giberson and other voices soon helped set the conversation, helped along by the fact that Warner Bros. and Sony both opposed the format. Additionally, once you broke down the value proposition, it was clear that buying a DIVX disc wasn’t as good as going to Blockbuster, made problematic by an unforced error on the studios' part: They didn’t include any of the DVD extras on the DIVX discs, and worse, panned-and-scanned everything, meaning that the integrity of a DIVX offering couldn’t compare to standard DVDs. Image: Mike Kalasnik/Wikimedia Commons Another factor was simply logistical: Circuit City was the only firm selling DIVX throughout most of its life, and Circuit City was a big-box store. It generally wasn’t as close to your house as the average Blockbuster was, and its hours weren’t quite as good, either. But the biggest problem was that it cost Circuit City a lot of money, and that’s what did it in. In mid-1999, the DIVX debacle was shut down, with Circuit City having dropped $233 million in the hole with little to show for it beyond a lot of angry customers. Oh, and this training video. They got a training video out of it. It’s just one example of the problems that arise when you treat electronics like appliances. How CompUSA’s treatment of Apple fans shows just how poorly suited the big box is for technology In 1997, Apple was on the ropes, and needed a new distribution deal to get its products to the public. It went to the arms of a partner that it was familiar with. But ultimately, the lessons it learned from the experience led the computer maker to forge its own path. In 1997, the tech superstore CompUSA agreed to create a store-within-a-store concept for Apple, allowing the company to put a sales rep on the floor who could properly help Apple’s own customers make decisions. “We believe in the future of Apple, and we are making a large investment to show our recommitment to Apple,” CompUSA President and CEO Jim Halpin said in a press release at the time. “These specialized departments within our Superstores will offer a superior buying experience for the Apple customer.” Problem is, Halpin’s concern apparently wasn’t communicated down to individual employees. The Apple enthusiast site MacsOnly ran a page charting various consumer experiences at CompUSAs around the country, and there were a lot of situations where the staff didn’t really understand the platform. Understandable, to a degree, because it was during a period when the Mac had slim uptake. But not for a company that was supposed to be actively promoting Apple. Image: FIshstick/Wikimedia Commons Even famed technology columnist David Pogue, then a writer for MacWorld, had trouble. He went to half a dozen locations around the country, dealing with CompUSA employees at each location who seemed to have little to no interest in selling Mac-based hardware or software. “Whatever the excuse, CompUSA simply isn’t holding up its end of the sweet Apple deal,” Pogue noted. “In steering potential buyers away from Macs, store clerks make a mockery of CompUSA president Jim Halpin’s 1997 promise to make his stores ‘the Apple headquarters for America.’” So no, Apple couldn’t even get a decent presentation from a big-box store, so it eventually started looking into its own retail outlets. Those outlets, smaller and more specialized, did the job much better than a big box ever could. The ceilings are nowhere near as high, either. “Stores will still be necessary to sell products and services and to teach people how to operate in this new digital civilization.” — Carlos Slim, the Mexican billionaire, discussing his 2000 purchase of CompUSA for $800 million. Despite that seemingly sound bet, CompUSA faltered by 2007, with Fortune characterizing Slim’s ownership of the firm as “a rare misstep” for the world’s richest man at the time. Turns out, stores apparently weren’t necessary. When CompUSA closed its doors in early 2008, becoming one of many chains that have liquidated over the past couple of decades, the company gained a bizarre reputation on consumer blogs for attempting to sell products that did not work. The Consumerist, then owned by Gawker Media (which did not have a liquidation sale), kept an eye on the bloody toll. DVD players that were labeled “defective,” were being sold for $179.98. Shattered LCD screens, despite being no good, were sold anyway. People, attempting to buy stuff with cash, were turned away by store staff. In some ways, I wonder if the model for the computer superstore deserved to be left on the shelves in liquidation. These stores happened to grow into the behemoths they did not just because the computer industry grew, but because, in many ways, they were competing with every other type of retailer. Bed, Bath, and Beyond has huge stores, too; so does Michaels, IKEA, and even Old Navy. Computing as a medium is simply too mainstream, and a tiny Radio Shack store wasn’t going to cut it. One problem, though: For decades, people who sold computers never really figured out what the retail model wanted to be. Does it want to be built around heavy customization? Does it want to be an intensely personal experience? Should you get the chance to touch the device you’re about to buy, or are you better off just grabbing it in the mail after the fact? Should salespeople be up in your face or should they get completely out of the way? It took probably 20 years to get a reasonable answer to most of those questions. But big-box electronics retailers had to start somewhere, and rather than treating gadgets like some of our most important possessions, retailers long sold them like just another appliance. Computers are not washing machines—we work with them far too intimately, and we shouldn’t sell them the same way. The fact that computers are built through the same sorts of industrial processes that make washing machines must have confused someone down the line. With their boutique stores, Apple, Microsoft, and other big tech firms have figured that out. And even if the context is all wrong, it doesn’t mean the success of an electronics superstore isn’t possible: Best Buy is doing OK right now, but for a while, it was looking pretty shaky. Sure, Amazon could still eat their lunch—they’ve done it before. But I wonder what a totally rethought Best Buy would look like, unshackled from its roots as a stereo retailer. Like the devices they sell, electronics retailers can occasionally use a reboot. Topics: Tedium, circuit city, best buy, electronics, big box stores, CompUSA, DIVX Contact Motherboard by email.

(Photo: cellanr/flickr/cc) Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple and Facebook, America’s most well-known brands and most prosperous firms, are demanding that states and localities provide them ever-larger economic development subsidies to support their data centers. Last year these five tech giants reported nearly $120 billion in pre-tax profits, and yet they told states and localities they needed financial help to build new data centers, structures essential to their business operations. Their efforts resulted in more than $2 billion in public support to build 11 new data centers. The facilities would create 1,174 long term jobs, amounting to an enormous per job subsidy of $1.95 million, according to Money Lost to the Cloud, a new report from Good Jobs First which I authored.  "Last year these five tech giants reported nearly $120 billion in pre-tax profits, and yet they told states and localities they needed financial help to build new data centers." Data centers have enormous footprints. Apple’s one in Maiden, NC has 500,000 feet of floor space, enough to fit nine football fields inside. And it is expensive – costing more than $1 billion, most of it for the endless racks of expensive servers and the powerful air conditioning required to keep the heat-spewing electronics cool. But despite this cost, the data center will employ fewer than 50 permanent workers, a subsidy of $6.4 million per employee, the most of any deal in our survey.  After Apple threatened to take the deal to neighboring Virginia, North Carolina officials changed tax rules that applied only to Apple to win the deal. Maiden, a city that struggled with high unemployment after the once-thriving furniture industry closed its last plant, agreed to partial property tax abatements. Economic development officials argued that drawing Apple to Maiden would create new jobs and diversify the local economy. But the high-tech computer maintenance jobs weren’t well suited for blue-collar workers whose talent was furniture construction. Though few locals wound up working for Apple, the company will nonetheless save $300 million in taxes over the next three decades.  Tech companies have grown skillful at dangling the prospect of jobs and playing one community off against one another. But the amount of tax subsidy is never what seals the deal in determining where a new data center is located. Data centers consume two percent of the nation’s supply of electricity, enough to power 6.4 million homes. Low energy costs – and for brand-conscious firms, energy derived from renewable sources – is the most important factor in locating new data centers. Positioning these vital centers far from the threats of hurricanes, earthquakes and floods and close to fiber infrastructure are other important considerations.  "Tech companies have grown skillful at dangling the prospect of jobs and playing one community off against one another." And yet, tech giants continue to push states to provide subsidies, lest they fall into another suitor’s arms. They do so in part, through an insistence on secrecy. Many projects are negotiated with code names that disguise corporate identities. Lawmakers are compelled to vote on deals without even knowing to whom they are giving tens or hundreds of millions of taxpayer-financed subsidy dollars. Offering seven-figure per jobs subsidies is a losing proposition for taxpayers and communities. Utah officials realized this when they backed out of a recent $260 million 20-year data center subsidy deal with Facebook. They understand there were other opportunities for the industrial land where the project would be located, opportunities that would result in more jobs for local residents. The State Board of Education worried that the loss of property tax revenue would deprive schools of necessary funding as they quashed the overly generous deal.  Facebook went to New Mexico, Utah’s competitor,  that offered  a package of tax exempt industrial revenue bonds and other tax subsidies to locate its data center in their already heavily subsidized Los Lunas project.  "In many communities, budget cuts have left class sizes expanding, longer wait lists for public housing, and growing lines at church food pantries. All the while there are no lines at the corporate subsidy window." It doesn’t have to be this way. States and cities don’t need to sacrifice good schools and high-quality public services for the prospect of a few good jobs. States that offer subsidies to data centers should establish reasonable per job caps of $50,000. They should mandate that subsidy deals should be negotiated in the light of day with no concealed corporate identities. And they should learn from Utah and know when to fold their hands and walk away from high-stakes bidding wars.  Data centers can be a good addition to local economies and a big factor in strengthening local fiscal conditions, but only if they pay their fair share of taxes. In many communities, budget cuts have left class sizes expanding, longer wait lists for public housing, and growing lines at church food pantries. All the while there are no lines at the corporate subsidy window.

Projecting the Giants' inactives Rashad Jennings Giants running back Rashad Jennings has missed the past three games with a thumb injury. (John Munson | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com) Print Email Dan Duggan | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com By Dan Duggan | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 16, 2016 at 9:31 AM comments EAST RUTHERFORD — The Giants' injury report lists a handful of key players as questionable for Sunday's game against the Ravens. The good news is that most of those players are expected to play. The concern is how effective they will be as they deal with their injuries. The running game should get a boost from the expected return of Rashad Jennings, who has missed the past three games with a thumb injury. Jennings said this week that he's "rocking this week" and the Giants need him after combining for just 121 yards rushing in the previous two games. Other questionable players I expect to play: KR Dwayne Harris (toe), DE Jason Pierre-Paul (groin), LB Devon Kennard (concussion) and CB Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie (groin). The only questionable player I don't expect to be active is CB Eli Apple (groin). Eli set for 200th straight The Giants will officially announce their inactive list 90 minutes before Sunday's 1 p.m. kickoff. Here's my projection for who will be inactive: •CB Eli Apple: Apple didn't practice all week after injuring his groin early in last Sunday's game against the Packers. Apple had just returned from a hamstring injury. Apple is listed as questionable, but I'd be shocked if the Giants put their first-round pick on the field on Sunday. •WR Roger Lewis: Lewis has been active for the past two games, playing on special teams. Assuming the majority of the questionable players can play, there doesn't appear to be room for Lewis on the active roster. •LB Deontae Skinner: Skinner was promoted from the practice squad this week to potentially fill a roll on special teams. But with six healthy linebackers ahead of him and greater needs for backups at other positions, I can't see Skinner being active for Sunday's game. •QB Josh Johnson: Johnson figures to remain a healthy scratch all season unless there is an injury to starter Eli Manning or backup Ryan Nassib. •S Darian Thompson: The starting free safety has been ruled out for the fourth consecutive game with a sprained foot. Thompson finally got out of a walking boot this week, but he remains week-to-week. •S Nat Berhe: Thompson's backup has been ruled out for his third consecutive game with a concussion. Berhe has not practiced in the past three weeks, as he remains in the concussion protocol. There is no word on Berhe will be ready to return. Rookie Andrew Adams is in line to make his third straight start at free safety. •RT Marshall Newhouse: The starting right tackle has been ruled out for the fourth consecutive game with a calf injury. There is no timeline for Newhouse's return. Bobby Hart will make his fourth straight start at right tackle. Dan Duggan may be reached at dduggan@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @DDuggan21.

Home News Mobile Devices, Tablets & Phones The new iPhone is just a 'clear piece of glass', with AI The new iPhone will be powered by AI-capable Siri, and will be just a 'clear piece of glass' By: Anthony Garreffa | Mobile Devices, Tablets & Phones News | Posted: Oct 16, 2016 1:35 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Apple changed the entire technology industry with the release of the original iPhone, and then plotted along with some good upgrades through to the iPhone 4, which did it again. Since then, Apple has been behind - and falling more and more behind to the likes of Google's new Pixel smartphone, and Samsung's various, and sometimes explosive, smartphones.     According to Robert Scoble, an entrepreneur and the co-founder of UploadVR (amongst a truly scroll-worthy list of achievements, partnerships, past employers, startups and more) said on his Facebook page: "Just had a source that I trust tell me it is a clear piece of glass. With the compute in a strip at the bottom". He added that translating this talk of it being an all-glass wonderous next level device into saying that the iPhone 8 does mixed reality, VR, AR and AI.   Scoble's source also talked about Siri, asking him "why did Viv.ai sell to Samsung? I know the founders didn't want to do that". He said that Apple showed the Viv.ai founders their new Siri for "mixed reality", and what Scoble said next put shivers up my spine... adding "and the game was over". Viv.ai sold to Samsung, and Samsung continued on into the Galaxy S7 and Note 7, and eventually whatever phones they released in 2017.   He said that he is working with his team at UploadVR on a deeper piece on Apple's future with VR next week, finishing off with all of his "timelines move up, we are getting mixed reality in 2017".   So now we have a possible next big thing from Apple to be excited about, and it's in more than one way:   Apple's big shift into VR will make VR "mainstream". It won't just be VR - but mixed reality and AR, so we could expect a larger Google Glass-like headset accessory. AI is the next big leap, and if Apple can do it right - judging by Scoble's contact, AI will be in center focus for iPhone 8. An all-glass iPhone 8? That would truly be revolutionary in design, and explains the shift to Lightning only on iPhone 7. The 'compute in a strip at the bottom' sounds beyond exciting, almost too futuristic for 2017. It explains all of the iterative updates to the iPhone, as Apple were waiting for the big leap. Siri lags behind Google Now in a huge way, Apple needs a miracle for AI. Google's new Assistant on Pixel is a big step towards more 'AI' like intelligence at your fingertips.

Most eyes are fixed on the purported October launch of new MacBook Pro and MacBook Air devices, which might turn things around.  ( Sean Gallup | Getty Images ) Advertisement The PC industry is at a historical low, and the decline does not seem to slow down anytime soon. Apple is in an even worse situation than most PC manufacturers, as the company's revenue from selling computer shows. The IDC and Gartner have issued reports that indicate that the PC market has been shrinking for eight uninterrupted quarters. Specifically, enterprise and consumers bought about 68 million PCs during the Q3 2016. In comparison with last year's numbers, that represents a 3.9 percent drop, according to the IDC. If you ask Gartner, things are even bleaker, as the firm claims that the drop is actually 5.7 percent. Apple is in an extra tight spot, as its computer sales are toppling even faster than the sector average. Gartner reports that Apple currently owns only 7.2 percent of market share, after it saw its shipments lose 13.4 percent. This places Apple in second to worse place, after Acer, which lost 14.1 percent of shipments and now commands only 6.7 percent of overall market share. Rumors are rampant about Apple preparing a great upgrade for its MacBook Pro and MacBook Air laptops this October. This makes fans of the brand hold on to their wallets, and most hope that Apple soon roll out new laptops to put their money in. The MacBook Pro and MacBook Air lines were last upgraded during the spring of 2015. Keep in mind that the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air used to be on the top of sales in former years, but the trend seems to have reversed. Another reason why Apple no longer leads the pack in PC sales might be that the latest back-to-school season was bleak for PCs overall. Parents don't seem to be as motivated to invest in new rigs for their children, as older models handle school-oriented tasks just as well. The pressure from the younglings is lower than in previous years as well, as their focus goes mainly to smartphones and tablets. Gartner mentions that the general tendency is for people to upgrade their laptops more slowly than before, as the mobile devices are gaining more processing power and can handle more complex features. This means that Apple is in dire need to push out its new MacBooks if it wants to reclaim some market share. The broader perspective shows that PC upgrades are slowing down, with a majority of users getting all they want from touch screen devices. The MacBook manufacturer has to take that into account when it tweaks its upcoming PC building strategy.

(Associated Press files) By ANICK JESDANUN, Associated Press Published: October 16, 2016, 6:05 AM A   A If you’re like many people, you have thousands of photos on your phone, long forgotten after you’ve posted a few on Instagram or Facebook. They don’t have to stay forgotten. Apple and Google are both applying a form of artificial intelligence called “machine learning” to organize your pictures and video — and along the way, help you rediscover last year’s vacation, dinner with close friends and a casual summer outing to the park. Apple’s tools are part of last month’s iOS 10 system update for iPhones and iPads. The Google Photos app for Apple and Android devices has a digital assistant to automatically organize these memories — and Google signaled recently that it will only get smarter. And on Wednesday, Google introduced additional features for rediscovery. Here’s a look at how they take you down memory lane: • APPLE’S MEMORIES. Apple’s new Memories feature automatically generates video highlights around a theme, such as a trip or birthday party. Individual photos and snippets from video are chosen for you, as is the music, though you can change it to reflect a different mood. This isn’t just a slideshow. There’s slow zooming and panning, reminiscent of Ken Burns historical documentaries. Some of the photos also come to life, at least on newer iPhones that automatically take three seconds of video with every photo. When you’re ready to share, the app creates a standard movie file — so it works on Windows and Android devices, too. For me, Apple’s app created a “Florida to Illinois” package for a three-week trip in January and one for a day trip to Philadelphia last November. But Apple goes beyond date and location. Apple created a “Together” package for shots with family over the past two years. It also created an “At The Beach” package with beach photos since 2013. Other scenic themes could include mountains, lakes and sunsets. Apple offers up to three new Memories a day. You can create more based on photos you add to an album and generate new automated ones by scrolling down to “Related.” You can also add or delete images within Memories — in my experience, a few included mundane screenshots I had to get rid of. Nothing will ever replace the human touch. But let’s face it, even though I keep meaning to organize my photos, I never find the time. The machine-generated selections aren’t necessarily ones I’d choose myself, but with a small amount of tweaking, they’re presentable and will tide me over until I get around to catching up manually … someday. • GOOGLE’S ASSISTANT. Google Photos has been at this longer and offers more types of packages. With collages, Google combines smaller versions of several shots into one layout . Animations combine a bunch of photos taken in succession so that they resemble as a moving image. Unlike typical “GIF” animation files, Google applies its magic to align successive shots, so buildings and bridges look steady — without the shake common with handheld video. Google also offers albums and video highlights, though without the Ken Burns effect. Google’s Assistant generates much of this for you automatically. You can edit auto-generated albums and video highlights, but not collages or animation — although you can create your own from scratch. (That does defeat the purpose of letting the robots do the work, though.) Sharing is easy and doesn’t require recipients to have Google Photos. The results vary in quality. I tend to take several shots of the same subject, just in case some are blurry. Yet I get collages and animations out of those repetitive shots. The albums and video highlights I got are grouped by location and date, though Google says it will be doing more with themes, such as following a kid growing up. Most of my computer-generated creations are animations and collages. As with Apple, Google’s choices aren’t necessarily ones I’d make, if only I had the time. But some are good enough that I look forward to alerts for new ones to check out. I also enjoyed a feature called “Rediscover this day.” Google will automatically create collages from shots taken on a day, say, two years ago. On Wednesday, Google said it will apply that to people, too, so you’ll get collages of you with a specific friend or family member. • SEARCHING. Apple and Google are both getting better at image recognition. Apple’s version tends to be more conservative. While Apple found four photos in a search for fireworks, Google found dozens. Google also found more photos with hats, though one was actually a strange hairdo and a few were of a headband. Then again, Apple thought an illustration of a hut was a hat. Google is also bolder with face recognition. Its technology is smart enough to recognize the same child at 2 months and 6 years, while Apple often separates the same child into multiple identities (you can merge them, and things will be fine after that). Google has an edge over Apple in part because it taps its powerful servers to process photos. Apple leaves all the machine thinking to your device as a privacy measure. But Apple says it also favors being right more than complete to reduce the work people need to do to fix things. Being wrong can also have consequences: Google had to apologize last year after its software got too aggressive and mistakenly labeled two black people as gorillas. • STORAGE. To free up space, both services will automatically clear photos from your phone after uploading them to the internet, once you activate the option. You still have a lower-resolution version on the device and can get the sharper image anytime, as long as you’re online. Google Photos offers unlimited online storage of photos at up to 16 megapixels and videos at 1080p high definition — good enough for most people. It will compress larger photos, or you can store the original and have it count toward your Google Drive limit, which starts at 15 gigabytes for free. Apple’s iCloud Photo Library requires paying once you exceed 5 gigabytes, which is enough for a few thousand photos.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « The Invention behind the Integrated Antenna Lines in Current & Future iPhones Surface | Main | Major Business Trade Show in Dubai has Cisco and Gulf Partner Showcasing Apple Enterprise Solutions » October 16, 2016 Apple's iPhone 7 Pre-Orders sold out in Record Time in Korea Friday while Anger over the Note 7's Demise Still Lingers   Apple's iPhone 7 pre-orders in South Korea began on Friday, one week prior to the official launch as previously reported. According to a new Korean report today, "Apple's latest smartphone model iPhone 7 is enjoying unprecedented popularity at least partially due to the tribulation suffered by its rival Samsung Electronics in relation to its Galaxy Note 7. Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were sold out as soon as the three major mobile telecom service providers began taking pre-orders at 9 am on October 14." The fact the iPhone 7's have sold out so quickly shouldn't surprise anyone being that back in July Patently Apple reported that a Gallup poll revealed that South Koreans in their 20's preferred Apple's iPhone over Samsung's Galaxy.   The report further noted that "KT, for example, closed its online application for 50,000 iPhone's within 15 minutes after launching the site. SK Telecom saw its first and second pre-orders sold out within 20 minutes and 1 hour each. A telecom company official said, 'Comparing to the iPhone 6s debuted a year ago, pre-order volumes have doubled for the iPhone 7. It's like Apple is having a field day in a situation where its rival is incapacitated due to the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 saga." The iPhone 7 series will make a debut in the Korean market on October 21."   Apple wants to further tap into South Korea's fever for their iPhone and is currently scouting top locations in Seoul to open their first flagship store.   While Apple's iPhone 7 is enjoying unprecedented pre-order sales in South Korea, it's being reported today that "Samsung has advised an estimated 1 million Galaxy Note 7 users to stop using the device, citing a recent emergency order from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) that banned all Note 7 smartphones on airline flights there."   The Korea Times further noted that Samsung said in a statement Saturday that "We encourage any Note 7 users to be sure to get a refund or change the device with other models before any flight. We apologize for causing inconvenience following orders from the DOT and Korea's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport."   Samsung further noted that "it had been running Samsung Electronics' rental phone booths at Korea's major airports in Incheon, Gimpo and Gimhae for people who had yet to return Note 7 devices. According to data from predictive app intelligence company Apteligent, more than 1 million Note 7 devices were still being used as of Wednesday."   That stubbornness of not returning and/or exchanging the Note 7 could cost any customer flying on a U.S. flight a heavy fine or prosecution.   In early September Patently Apple reported on the anger expressed by the Korean press for the first Note 7 recall stating that it was a protectionist move to promote Apple over Samsung.   Now that Samsung has honestly acknowledged that the Note 7 had a serious enough problem that they had to end production and that they still don't know what the root of the problem is to this day, some in the Korean press are still seething over U.S. authorities push to kill the Note 7, even in light of a Note 7 exploding into flames on a recent airline flight in the U.S. In a report posted on Friday, Business Korea pointed to four iPhones catching on fire in the last two years.   Business Korea has pathetically tried to equate four iPhone fires over two years to dozens for the Note 7 in a matter of weeks. In one incident, it put an aircraft and its passengers in serious danger. In that light, you'd expect a business publication to be far more rational and balanced.   The Business Korea report further stated that "Cases where the iPhone burst into flames have been steadily reported since its early models. Since late last year, at least four cases where the iPhone caught fire have been reported through media at home and abroad. The cases involve iPhone models launched over the past two years such as the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. According to media reports, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is looking into what caused such fire."   They even went so far as to bring up that "Apple also experienced 'humiliation.' It was a global recall of batteries in the iPhone 5 in 2013. At that time, Apple replaced batteries of the iPhone 5 free of charge.'"   Even that aspect of their story is a complete stretch. Apple officially stated in 2014 that "Apple has determined that a very small percentage of iPhone 5 devices may suddenly experience shorter battery life or need to be charged more frequently."   There was no humiliation on Apple's part and it wasn't about their smartphones exploding and catching on fire causing injury or burning out a car or causing an expensive evacuation of an airline flight. This is the second time a South Korean reporter has irrationally covered Samsung's crisis in a light where the U.S. was unfairly handling the Samsung Crisis.   In the end, it's the Korean press that should be humiliated for being shown to be callous and disrespectful to Samsung's U.S. customers who have suffered trauma and burns due to the blatant defect in the Note7 smartphone. These Samsung fans should be offered an apology rather than receiving scorn for hurting Samsung's reputation that is well deserved at this time.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

The news continues to get worse for electronics giant Samsung (OTC:SSNLF). After multiple reports of Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 catching fire, Samsung offered to exchange the devices. But Samsung had to scrap the exchange program, because some of those phones caught fire as well, leading to the complete Samsung recall. All four major U.S. carriers decided on their own to stop exchanging the devices, and Samsung has now halted production of the Note 7. Samsung has already said its operating profit will be $2.3 billion lower than previously anticipated because of the recall. But the Samsung recall damage will likely be much longer-lasting. Samsung’s brand image with consumers is about to take a major blow—which means Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) could be a huge winner. Apple Ready to Profit This is a huge problem for Samsung. The Samsung recall completely erases the momentum that Samsung had been building in 2016, which was due mostly to the Note 7. Samsung was taking market share against Apple and other smartphone manufacturers this year. According to market research firm IDC, Samsung held the No. 1 spot in global smartphone market share last quarter thanks in large part to the Note 7—but now all that is undone. Samsung held 22% smartphone market share last quarter. Growth of the Note 7 drove 6% device shipment growth for the period, which was far stronger growth than even Apple this year. By contrast, Apple’s market share was 12% last quarter. As a result, Apple could reap significant benefits from Samsung’s recall. Samsung and Apple compete fiercely at the high end of the smartphone market. They both sell premium, high-quality devices, which means switching over to Apple is a likely scenario. This is particularly true in China, where Samsung has a strong foothold, but where Apple has struggled this year. Apple’s sales in China fell 29% last quarter, compared with the previous quarter. It badly needs a boost there, because China is a key emerging market with a population of 1 billion and a rising middle class. What’s Good for the iPhone is Good for Apple The other reason why this is a huge opportunity for Apple is because Samsung’s recall coincides with the release of the iPhone 7. This is a new full model, which only happens every few years, and the iPhone itself represents more than half of Apple’s total sales. Apple’s total revenue declined 15% over the first three quarters of the current fiscal year. A big reason for this is the saturation of the iPhone 6. Apple released new versions of the iPhone 6, but these new iterations typically do not sell as well as new whole-number models do. Apple is seeing strong growth across its other segments, specifically its services business. Services revenue, which includes platforms like iTunes and the App Store, grew 19% last quarter, year over year. The App Store itself posted 37% revenue growth. Apple’s total services revenue reached $23 billion in the past one year. However, Apple’s biggest growth driver remains the iPhone, which is why the confluence of factors over the past several weeks is such a compelling catalyst for the company. The stars appear to be aligning for a very successful iPhone 7 launch, which would be great news for Apple and its shareholders. Disclosure: The author is personally long AAPL.

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Apple MacBook Pro 2016 Could Arrive with a Slim Form Factor as Rumors of Reductions in Company’s Device Line Rise Again! Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: October 17, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» Apple have been surrounded by some strange rumors lately, and there is speculation that the company might be looking into reducing the number of devices they have on the market. The reason, according to the rumors, is that they want to move efficiently focus on a smaller set of products, and some of their fans seem to agree. First the rumors targeted the iPod, but after it became clear that Apple have no plans to kill off that line (at least for now), now we’ve been seeing similar statements about the MacBook and iPad. More specifically, the claim is that Apple might want to combine the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air into one device, as they’ve been both inching towards each other in various ways. It’s true that the MacBook Air has been getting more powerful and capable, while on the other hand the Pro is seemingly slimmer and more compact with each release, so there might be some sense in those statements. Current rumors about the MacBook Pro 2016 claim that the new notebook is going to arrive with an even lighter and slimmer form factor, putting it even closer to its Air counterpart. And with that, the rumors claim, the MacBook Air might actually not see any further releases. The MacBook Air was a controversial release in the first place, with some fans questioning the use of the device. Things became even worse for the line after tablets took over the market and became truly prevalent, and now it looks like the laptop really might be on its way out. As for the MacBook Pro 2016, there are some conflicting claims about the release date of the device. Apple are rumored to be preparing for a major announcement in just a matter of weeks, and if the rumors turn out to be true, this should be a huge surprise for their fans. It’s not very typical of Apple to release their major products in this way, but on the other hand they’ve also changed their style significantly in the last few years, so it’s hard to say what they might be planning. Still, most of the company’s fans are a bit skeptical that the new notebook will arrive this year, and the general consensus in Apple’s community is that the model should be ready in the beginning of 2017, if it’s actually in active development right now. We’re mostly inclined to agree with that, but on the other hand, it also wouldn’t surprise us if Apple really did decide to drop a surprise release by the end of this year. At least an announcement would be a nice way to stir things up, and it should generate sufficient excitement about the device to last until the early months of next year. Some of the more interesting rumors about the new model claim that it could have an extra screen with touch capabilities, as well as some additional productivity features. Apple are also reportedly moving on to USB Type-C in full force, which would definitely be nice to see in the new MacBook Pro. Combined with the allegedly slim design of the laptop, it should be a great machine for work on the go, as well as of course entertainment whenever the user wants it.

If Apple is searching for another reason why its share of the PC market has recently declined -- besides aging hardware -- it should take a look at the Windows competition. While those laptops may lack the cache of the Mac name, they've clearly caught up in the look-and-feel department. Apple once cornered the market on skinny, chic laptops that were in stark contrast to the boxy ones running Windows. But manufacturers have responded with models that out-svelte MacBooks while managing to include the latest hardware. Six months ago, HP debuted its Spectre laptop, which was just 0.41 inches thick and delivered the luxurious features of an Apple system -- at a MacBook-like starting price of $1,149. At that time, HP touted the Spectre as the world's thinnest notebook. Fast forward to October, and Acer is claiming to steal that title away with its new Swift 7 laptop family. The company has managed to shave 0.2 inches off the height of its chassis, though at 2.48 pounds, it still is slightly heavier than Apple's MacBook (as is the Spectre). Like the Spectre, the Swift 7 is clearly targeting the upscale with its features and design. It may not be as flashy as the Spectre, but Acer's offering has a matte black aluminum exterior with a gold interior. The first available Swift 7 model, the SF713-51-M90J, includes a Core i5-7Y54 Kaby Lake processor, 8GB of RAM, a 256GB solid-state drive, and a full HD 13.3-inch protected by Corning Gorilla Glass. It also comes with MU-MIMO 802.11 ac Wi-Fi for what Acer says is three times faster wireless performance, and the company claims up to 9 hours of battery life for the Swift 7. In addition to being ever-so-thinner, the Swift 7 is slightly less expensive than the similarly spec'd Spectre. The Spectre starts at $1,169.99, and the Acer laptop is now available at $1,099.99. If you're not ready to purchase either one of these now, don't worry: Some other manufacturer will find a way to shave off a fraction of an inch off another new laptop soon enough -- whether it's useful or not.         LATEST STORIES (9) Anti-Trump Protests Bring People To Streets around US Syrian Army Continue to Advance in Southwestern Aleppo Syrian Army in Battle with Terrorists in Southern Aleppo Before Winning Full Control over Region Iranian Shiites Begin Long Walk to Visit Imam Hossein's Shrine in Iraq's Karbala Syrian Army in Full Control of Dhahiyat al-Assad District in Southwestern Aleppo Syrian Army, Air Force Strike Terrorist Centers in Southwestern Damascus USA: Anti-Trump Protesters March in Portland for 5th Night in a Row Terrorists Experience Great Defeat in Southern Aleppo Millions March in 4th Day of Anti-Trump Protests Putting out the Candle of the Wicked: God Never Left Syria Iraqi Forces Deploy 3 KM From Eastern Bank of Tigris River Iraqi Army Enters Key District in Eastern Mosul Iraqi Volunteer Forces' Spokesman Announces Imminent Operations to Liberate Tal Afar Syrian Army, Air Force Strike Terrorist Centers in Southwestern Damascus Portland Police Declare Curfew for Minors amid Anti-Trump Protests Anti-Trump Protests Bring People To Streets around US TEHRAN (FNA)- Chanting “Not my president” and “love trumps hate,” hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in cities across the United States to protest against President-elect Donald Trump, who they say threatens their civil and human rights.

Apple is exploring the use of the Apple Watch's heart-rate sensor to identify users by their vascular signature. A US Apple patent published on Thursday and spotted by AppleInsider details how the company could add an identification function to the heart-rate sensor on the back of the Apple Watch. The heart-rate sensor is an example of photoplethysmography and in the Watch's case, relies on a set of LED light emitters and light sensors to measure the amount of blood flowing through the user's wrist and calculate heart rate. However, as Apple describes in the patent, the emitter and sensor combination could also be used to determine the unique way a user's blood vessels are arranged and so be employed as a method of biometric identification. "Light emitters and light sensors can be used to perform biometric identification of a user based on identifying characteristics of the user's vasculature," Apple notes. "For example, light information can be obtained at one or more light sensors, and the information can be compared with stored information associated with a user identity. Based on the comparison, the user of the device can be identified as having the user identity." The feature could serve the same function that Touch ID does today, preventing anyone but the owner from activating the device, or for example, to log into an online banking account. The patent was actually filed in 2013, well ahead of the Apple Watch's 2015 launch. It doesn't mention the Apple Watch, merely a device that can be strapped to the user's wrist, but it does add some color to how Apple was thinking of the hardware during its development. It's not clear why Apple hasn't enabled such a feature given the Watch has the hardware to do it and could, if implemented, reduce the Watch's dependence on the iPhone. The patent also explores using sensors to enable gestures for identification, such as a person rapidly moving their hand from the waist to the side of their head. "The gesture may be recognized as a gesture associated with the identification process. Additionally, the first time period of the identification gesture may be determined. That is, once the gesture is recognized from the motion information, an initiation time and a finish time of the gesture can be determined." The same patent surfaced in Europe last year as reported at the time by Patently Apple.         LATEST STORIES (9) Anti-Trump Protests Bring People To Streets around US Syrian Army Continue to Advance in Southwestern Aleppo Syrian Army in Battle with Terrorists in Southern Aleppo Before Winning Full Control over Region Iranian Shiites Begin Long Walk to Visit Imam Hossein's Shrine in Iraq's Karbala Syrian Army in Full Control of Dhahiyat al-Assad District in Southwestern Aleppo Syrian Army, Air Force Strike Terrorist Centers in Southwestern Damascus USA: Anti-Trump Protesters March in Portland for 5th Night in a Row Terrorists Experience Great Defeat in Southern Aleppo Millions March in 4th Day of Anti-Trump Protests Putting out the Candle of the Wicked: God Never Left Syria Iraqi Forces Deploy 3 KM From Eastern Bank of Tigris River Iraqi Army Enters Key District in Eastern Mosul Iraqi Volunteer Forces' Spokesman Announces Imminent Operations to Liberate Tal Afar Syrian Army, Air Force Strike Terrorist Centers in Southwestern Damascus Portland Police Declare Curfew for Minors amid Anti-Trump Protests Anti-Trump Protests Bring People To Streets around US TEHRAN (FNA)- Chanting “Not my president” and “love trumps hate,” hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in cities across the United States to protest against President-elect Donald Trump, who they say threatens their civil and human rights.

Added by Staff Reporter on 16 October 2016. Saved under News, Top Tags: Antony Seeff, Apple, Cell C, MTN, Tariffic, Telkom, Vodacom Tweet iPhone 7 Plus Cell C is “very definitively” offering the best deals for consumers looking to get their hands on Apple’s new iPhone 7. Tariffic, a company that helps retail consumers and businesses save money on their cellphone bills, has used its online contract optimisation tool to find the best iPhone 7 deals in the market. The results show that Cell C is “back in the game”, the company said. Tariffic identified the best iPhone 7 32GB and iPhone 7 Plus 32GB deals for three different hypothetical users — Susanne who uses 200 minutes and 1GB of data; Dineo who uses 350 minutes and 2,5GB of data; and Tshepo who uses 500 minutes and 5GB of data. Tariffic calculated the optimal all-in price that each user would pay every month, which includes their subscription (with any additional handset instalment), add-on bundles and out-of-bundle spend. The company listed the promotional extras that the mobile network operators are offering as well. “Tariffic’s results were astonishing in their uniformity. In five out of six cases, Cell C offered the best iPhone 7 deals, followed by Telkom, MTN, and then Vodacom,” it said. “The only exception was for the user who wanted the iPhone 7 Plus for 200 minutes and 1GB of usage, in which case Telkom and Cell C switched places, with Telkom coming in most affordable.” Vodacom’s deals are the most expensive in every case, which, Tariffic said, is “no surprise” given that the company “intentionally chooses to compete on network quality rather than price”. “It looks like Cell C is shaking up the market once again, offering the most competitive iPhone 7 deals in nearly every case we explored,” said Tariffic CEO Antony Seeff. Source: Tariffic Source: Tariffic “Cell C is blowing everyone out of the water with the promotional value it’s offering until the end of January 2017 on its just-released Pinnacle packages,” Seeff said. These Pinnacle packages offer three times the regular amount of voice minutes and SMSes for users who sign up before the end of January 2017, with the additional value valid for the lifetime of the contract. This does not extend to the data component of the offering but is “nonetheless still a great deal”. “In addition, Cell C is offering cash-back with certain of their new Pinnacle contracts, which means that customers can receive a gift card with a value of up to R10 000 (depending on the contract chosen), just for signing up.”  — (c) 2016 NewsCentral Media Share this article Tweet Nicholas Hunt Yeah that’s why my Vodacom contract is cheaper per month than Cell C… Good job on picking the most expensive contracts for other providers and comparing it Cell C cheaper offerings Lindsay Cammay MTN offer the iPhone 7 32GB at R699 on MTNChoice + S (100 minutes, 100 SMS & 2GB data pm x 24) or iPhone 7 Plus 32GB at R799 on MTNChoice + S (100 minutes, 100 SMS & 2GB data pm x 24) Also includes 30GB data for the first month only. Add 1GB valid for 1 Week at R65, 1GB valid for 2 weeks at R89 or 1GB for 1 month at R160. Who only uses 1GB extra so go for 2 X bundle at R89 (Total: R178) or 4 X bundle at R65 (Total: R260).

The upcoming iOS 10 Jailbreak tool is expected to arrive anytime soon. (Photo: Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images) Pangu seems to be losing the battle for piracy in jailbreaking the iOS 10 as Apple is now cracking down. Pangu and other group of hackers are continuously being stumped  by the tech giant company as they still can't figure out how to jailbreak the latest update. The iOS 10.0.2 is the most up-to-date operating system of Apple. However, hackers from all over the world seem unhappy as the company is not giving them enough time. In a nutshell, the latest update has impressively covered up whatever security-related weak spots of the previous version. The new iOS 10.0.2 was released in a bid to solve the call audio issue of both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Prior to this version, the old update iOS 10.0.1 solved the security exploit. A lot of Apple fans were already excited with the rumors circulating online about Pangu being close to finally jailbreaking the iOS 10. Unfortunately, the rumors just remain rumors and everything just fell apart when the iOS 10.0.1 was released. The iOS 10.0.1 scrapped everything in the previous progress, forcing Pangu and other hackers to begin all over again from scratch. The iOS 10.0.2, on the other hand, also did the same but this time, hackers will not even have ample time to reach at least half of the progress they already had prior to the iOS 10.0.1 update, Tech Crunch reported. Essentially, it takes a lot of time and huge effort for tech savvy people to manage jailbreaking the iOS. But with the tech giant's speed and effort in pushing out updates to combat all attempted hacks against the iOS, a jailbreak seems to be hard to achieve at the moment.

They don’t have to stay forgotten. Apple and Google are both applying a form of artificial intelligence called “machine learning” to organize your pictures and video – and along the way, help you rediscover last year’s vacation, dinner with close friends and a casual summer outing to the park. Apple’s tools are part of last month’s iOS 10 system update for iPhones and iPads. The Google Photos app for Apple and Android devices has a digital assistant to automatically organize these memories – and Google signaled last week that it will only get smarter. And on Wednesday, Google introduced additional features for rediscovery. Here’s a look at how they take you down memory lane: Apple’s Memories Apple’s new Memories feature automatically generates video highlights around a theme, such as a trip or birthday party. Individual photos and snippets from video are chosen for you, as is the music, though you can change it to reflect a different mood. This isn’t just a slideshow. There’s slow zooming and panning, reminiscent of Ken Burns historical documentaries. Some of the photos also come to life, at least on newer iPhones that automatically take three seconds of video with every photo. When you’re ready to share, the app creates a standard movie file – so it works on Windows and Android devices, too. For me, Apple’s app created a “Florida to Illinois” package for a three-week trip in January and one for a day trip to Philadelphia last November. But Apple goes beyond date and location. Apple created a “Together” package for shots with family over the past two years. It also created an “At The Beach” package with beach photos since 2013. Other scenic themes could include mountains, lakes and sunsets. Apple offers up to three new Memories a day. You can create more based on photos you add to an album and generate new automated ones by scrolling down to “Related.” You can also add or delete images within Memories – in my experience, a few included mundane screenshots I had to get rid of. Nothing will ever replace the human touch. But let’s face it, even though I keep meaning to organize my photos, I never find the time. The machine-generated selections aren’t necessarily ones I’d choose myself, but with a small amount of tweaking, they’re presentable and will tide me over until I get around to catching up manually … someday. Google’s Assistant Google Photos has been at this longer and offers more types of packages. With collages, Google combines smaller versions of several shots into one layout. Animations combine a bunch of photos taken in succession so they resemble a moving image. Unlike typical “GIF” animation files, Google applies its magic to align successive shots, so buildings and bridges look steady – without the shake common with handheld video. Google also offers albums and video highlights, though without the Ken Burns effect. Google’s Assistant generates much of this for you automatically. You can edit auto-generated albums and video highlights, but not collages or animation – although you can create your own from scratch. (That does defeat the purpose of letting the robots do the work, though.) Sharing is easy and doesn’t require recipients to have Google Photos. The results vary in quality. I tend to take several shots of the same subject, just in case some are blurry. Yet I get collages and animations out of those repetitive shots. The albums and video highlights I got are grouped by location and date, though Google says it will be doing more with themes, such as following a kid growing up. Most of my computer-generated creations are animations and collages. As with Apple, Google’s choices aren’t necessarily ones I’d make, if only I had the time. But some are good enough that I look forward to alerts for new ones to check out. I also enjoyed a feature called “Rediscover this day.” Google will automatically create collages from shots taken on a day, say, two years ago. On Wednesday, Google said it will apply that to people, too, so you’ll get collages of you with a specific friend or family member. Searching Apple and Google are both getting better at image recognition. Apple’s version tends to be more conservative. While Apple found four photos in a search for fireworks, Google found dozens. Google also found more photos with hats, though one was actually a strange hairdo and a few were of a headband. Then again, Apple thought an illustration of a hut was a hat. Google is also bolder with face recognition. Its technology is smart enough to recognize the same child at 2 months and 6 years, while Apple often separates the same child into multiple identities (you can merge them, and things will be fine after that). Google has an edge over Apple in part because it taps its powerful servers to process photos. Apple leaves all the machine thinking to your device as a privacy measure. But Apple says it also favors being right more than complete to reduce the work people need to do to fix things. Being wrong can also have consequences: Google had to apologize last year after its software got too aggressive and mistakenly labeled two black people as gorillas. Storage To free up space, both services will automatically clear photos from your phone after uploading them to the internet, once you activate the option. You still have a lower-resolution version on the device and can get the sharper image anytime, as long as you’re online. Google Photos offers unlimited online storage of photos at up to 16 megapixels and videos at 1080p high definition – good enough for most people. It will compress larger photos, or you can store the original and have it count toward your Google Drive limit, which starts at 15 gigabytes for free. Apple’s iCloud Photo Library requires paying once you exceed 5 gigabytes, which is enough for a few thousand photos.

By: Tech Desk | Published:October 16, 2016 11:10 am Apple’s App Distribution page shows data measured by the App Store on October 7; with iOS 10 running on majority of devices. Apple iOS 10 is now running on 54 per cent devices, reveals company’s OS distribution data of App Store. The Cupertino giant’s App Distribution page shows data measured by the App Store on October 7; with iOS 10 running on majority of devices (iPhone, iPad and iPod touch). Apple has put out the percentage of devices running on iOS 9 and earlier OS versions as well. While iOS 9 is now running on 38 per cent devices; devices running on earlier versions comprise of just 8 per cent. Interestingly Apple’s latest OS now runs on more than 50 per cent of devices just within a month of its release. Initial reports showed a high adoption rate of iOS 10 with 14.53 per cent users downloading the same after 24 hours of the release. According to data from Mixpanel,  iOS 10 surpassed iOS 9’s adoption rate for under 24 hours. However, Mixpanel’s data was based on apps that use the company’s SDK, as opposed to Apple’s latest data which bases results on App Store visit. To recall, the highlights of iOS 10 include a new lock screen, Siri being opened to third-party apps, new iMessage features, and changes to Photos app. The new lock screen now has widgets for most of the apps in the phone. It is a good way to access quick information without actually opening an app. Also, iMessages now has an app store of its own and a whole bunch of cool add-ons from scribbling to animations. Apple iOS 10 has more of Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence being used across the OS. Read: Apple iOS 10 adoption rate higher than what it was for iOS 9 in 24 hours: Report Apple iOS 10 was rolled out early September, but the OS didn’t have the smoothest start with users complaining of their devices getting bricked after the tried to install the update. Users also reported issues with lightning based headphones preventing audio controls from working.

But consumers need to understand the trade-offs of abandoning paper money entirely. Consumer Reports offers this overview. Mobile Wallets What do they do? Let you pay for purchases at physical retail stores and online. Noteworthy brands: Android Pay, Apple Pay, PayPal, Samsung Pay. Cost: No direct fees. What Consumer Reports likes: Apple Pay is now accepted at 3 million stores in the United States because retailers are equipped with new EMV chip card readers that also have near-field communication (NFC) technology. Android Pay and Apple Pay need NFC to transact with cash registers. Samsung Pay can be used at more than 10 million U.S. merchants, because it employs NFC plus a second technology that lets it communicate via magnetic strip with readers that don’t have functioning NFC. Caveats: PayPal is mostly for online shopping and has very limited acceptance at retail stores. Apple Pay works only on certain, more recent iPhones; Samsung Pay works only on certain Samsung devices. Electronic Toll Tags What do they do? Let you pay for highway, express lane, bridge and tunnel tolls, as well as parking at some airports. Noteworthy brands: EXpressToll, E-ZPass, FasTrak, Good To Go!, MnPASS, SunPass, TxTag. Cost: No fees beyond the toll itself. What Consumer Reports likes: Commuters can knock 20 minutes to an hour off their daily drive, says J.J. Eden, president of the Alliance for Toll Interoperability. No stopping. No need to scramble for cash or change. Caveats: High traffic volume can clog up even the toll tag lanes. And now the discounts, used to lure new customers, are starting to go away. Person-to-Person (P2P) Payments What do they do? Let you send money to another person via the app, email or text. Noteworthy brands: BBVA/Dwolla, Chase QuickPay, clearXchange, Facebook Payments in Messenger, Popmoney, Snapcash, Square Cash and Venmo. Cost: Usually recipients never pay, and fees for sending vary from free to up to 3 percent or more if paid for with a credit card or some debit cards. What Consumer Reports likes:It’s super easy. Can transfer money fast (but see caveats). All the services take steps to ensure security. Caveats: How quickly recipients get their money varies, depending on the service. For example, money moves instantly via Facebook Payments in Messenger and by clearXchange, but your bank may take up to five business days to make the funds available to you. Branded Payment Apps What do they do? Let you pay for purchases only at the merchant brand’s physical stores and service providers, and their online counterparts. Noteworthy brands: Dunkin’ Donuts, Lyft, PayByPhone, Starbucks, Uber, Wal-Mart Pay. Cost: Generally no direct fees. What Consumer Reports likes: These apps combine payment, loyalty programs and ordering capabilities. Uber automatically charges you for your ride. PayByPhone lets you extend parking meter minutes wherever you are. Caveats: Can be used for only one merchant brand. You can’t pay if your phone runs out of power.

The subject: Donald Trump’s tax returns. Hammered by Hillary Clinton over the disclosure that he’d paid no federal tax, possibly for 18 years, Trump was unable to restrain himself. There was no apology. That would have been out of character. Instead, the Republican nominee blurted out four words: “That makes me smart.” For once Trump – serial liar and alleged serial groper – had inadvertently revealed a great truth. Offshore secrets of Brexit backer Arron Banks revealed in Panama Papers Read more In the 21st century those who dutifully pay taxes are dupes. We are the losers in a modern game in which only “smart people”, as Trump indelicately put it, know the rules. In fact, the rich and powerful quietly exited from the business of paying tax a long time ago. The evidence is all around. A new study of America’s leading Fortune 500 companies reveals that 367 of them – some 73% – have at least one or more subsidiaries in tax havens. Some have hundreds. This allows them to legally ship profits offshore. In Britain, meanwhile, it emerged that eBay paid just £1.1m in tax last year, despite telling US investors that the UK was its second largest market, generating revenues of £1.1bn. The cash originating in the UK flows to a parent company in Switzerland. The mind-boggling scale of the problem is laid bare in a slew of books and reports that reveal the way in which multinational companies have excused themselves from paying vast amounts of tax. The companies are a who’s who of global brands: Apple, Nike, Google, Pepsi, Pfizer, Walmart, Goldman Sachs, and practically every other multinational in business. The detail can be complicated, but the method is simple – and legal. Companies set up subsidiaries in low or no-tax jurisdictions. These subsidiaries then charge the onshore parent for services or intellectual property or whatever, with the profits then funnelled legally offshore. US companies are only obliged to pay tax when they bring the money back. Which they don’t. The study of America’s Fortune 500 companies shows that they collectively avoid an estimated $100bn in federal taxes each year. The most popular tax haven is the Netherlands. Bermuda and the Cayman Islands are not far behind. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tim Cook said the EU ruling that Apple had to pay $14.5bn in back taxes to Ireland was ‘political crap’. Photograph: Toru Hanai/Reuters The worst offender is Apple. It has booked $214.9bn offshore, a sum greater than any other company’s offshore cash pile. If these profits were held in the US they would incur $65.4bn in tax. The European Commission recently ordered Apple to pay Ireland $14.5 billion in back taxes; its Irish subsidiaries were paying an effective tax rate of 0.005%. Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, dismissed the ruling as “political crap”. As a result it is ordinary taxpayers who have to pick up the tab. Last year George Osborne introduced a “diverted profit tax” aimed at large companies that shift income artificially offshore. It’s unclear if the former chancellor’s initiative will work. Last weekend the Observer reported that Facebook had ended up with an £11.3m tax credit on its UK business. This is a company that made a global profit last year of $6.19bn. The new books include a page-turning account of the investigation into the Panama Papers. And an enterprising account of the wealth management industry by a writer who spent two years undercover as a trainee. Published last April, the Panama Papers were the fruits of a thrilling journalistic investigation. The papers – some 11.5m leaked documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca – give an unprecedented insight into the offshore world. They expose something obvious, previously hidden in plain sight. Namely that the global offshore industry – centred in tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands – was not, as had been thought, a shadowy but minor part of our economic system. Rather it was the system. It is this system that has allowed the burden of taxation to move inexorably from multinational corporations and the well-off to the “unsmart”: the dupes; you and me. The journalists who unearthed this bitter truth were Bastian Obermayer and Frederik Obermaier of Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung. (They are not related, but their German and international colleagues fondly nickname them the “brothers Obermay/ier”.) The paper, based in Munich, has an excellent track record of working on difficult and important investigations. Reporters often get offered information, stuff. I know from previous investigations that this often turns out to be disappointing. As Obermayer recounts, in early 2015, late one evening, he received an anonymous message. It said: “Hello. John Doe here. Interested in secret data?” Obermayer replied: “Always interested in secret data. What is it?” The “it” turned out to be bigger than anyone might have imagined. The source – his or her identity remains unknown – had got hold of Mossack Fonseca’s entire internal database. The legal practice was founded in 1977 by an ambitious Panamanian lawyer and the son of a Waffen SS officer. It specialised in setting up anonymous offshore shell companies. The source’s motivation was simple. Like Edward Snowden, who lifted the lid on mass electronic surveillance, John Doe was a whistleblower. He/she wanted to expose the scale of injustice of the offshore tax system. Mossack Fonseca denies any wrongdoing. The leak was an act of bravery and amounted to the biggest data dump ever, delivered in real-time instalments. We got a whopping 2.6 terabytes. This was far larger than the top-secret Snowden files or the diplomatic cables leaked in 2010 by an unhappy US army private, Chelsea Manning, which revealed Washington’s frank views of its global friends and enemies. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Leaked database from the Mossack Fonseca law firm in Panama revealed the extent of the use of offshore shell companies. Photograph: Carlos Jasso/Reuters The Panama Papers include records of 214,000 offshore companies, names of real or “beneficial” owners, and passport scans. There are bank statements, electricity bills and email chains. Often these are between Mossack Fonseca’s head office in Panama and “intermediaries”, typically other lawyers, accountants and banks. Behind them were a large and diverse group of affluent individuals. We looked, naturally enough, for politicians and those holding public office. But the majority of names in the database belonged to what you might call the non-famous international rich. There were French dentists, Spanish lawyers and Swiss aristocrats, all seeking to minimise their taxes. The leak led to a year-long international collaboration in 80 countries. Süddeutsche Zeitung shared its material with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which is based in Washington. The ICIJ in turn gave access to the data to 100 media organisations and nearly 400 reporters. In Britain that was my newspaper the Guardian and the BBC. The journalists gave the leaked files a name. The Panama Papers was a conscious echo of the Pentagon Papers: volumes of secret documents leaked in 1971 by Daniel Ellsberg which revealed the true US war in Vietnam. Ellsberg swiped a mere 7,000 pages. We had enough reading material to last us about 25 years. I found myself back in the Guardian’s investigations “bunker”. (Actually, it had a bucolic view of Regent’s canal in London: houseboats, joggers, coots.) In 2013 I’d been part of a small group which had studied the Snowden files here. We speculated at the time that MI6 had taken up residence in the flats opposite. This project was different. By means of a secure platform, called the iHub, journalists were encouraged not to compete with each other but to share information and to swap leads and tips. We did, in a flurry of encrypted emails. There were clandestine reporter meetings in Washington, Munich, and London. Early on we looked for Trump. Perhaps the database would point us towards his alleged secret fortune? It didn’t. I did dig up a Russian businessman escaping from Moscow who wanted to buy an apartment in the Trump Ocean Club tower in Panama City. (The agent knocked off $200,000, offering the Trump penthouse for a bargain price of $2.31m.) Other themes gradually became clear. Britain, it turned out, didn’t just feature via UK Crown dependencies like Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. Rather, it was the heart of the Mossack Fonseca multiverse. True, many of those diverting funds offshore were located in far-away kleptocracies: Russian oligarchs, African despots, and bagmen for Syria’s murderer-president Bashar al-Assad. But it was British lawyers, banks and company formation agents that were facilitating this global tax avoidance. Often, the enablers were top London law firms. Their websites look eminently respectable: a view of Georgian stucco, offices in exclusive postcodes, a smart Farrow and Ball front door with neatly topiaried trees. Britain didn’t just feature via UK Crown dependencies. Rather, it was the heart of the rotten Mossack Fonseca multiverse The leaked documents told a different story. Sometimes, the lawyers would lie about their clients’ identities and connections. Under banking regulations firms were meant to declare if a client was a politically exposed person or “PEP”. This would lead to stricter checks. The solution was to say nothing in the paperwork about a client’s PEP status. In return, big fees. There may not have been bodies on the streets of Belgravia or Knightsbridge. But it was hard to escape the dispiriting sense that the British were the biggest crooks on the planet. Behind the facade of legal piety we were enabling an orgy of transnational theft, and the looting of entire continents such as Africa. The California-based French economist Gabriel Zucman estimates that 8% of the world’s wealth – $7.6tn (£5.3tn) – is currently stashed in tax havens. Zucman puts the loss to global tax revenues at $200bn per year. That includes $35bn in the US and $78bn in Europe. What might we do instead with this money? As President Obama noted tax avoidance was a huge global problem, made worse by the fact that offshore structures are perfectly legal. Many of these havens operate under British jurisdiction. More than half of Mossack Fonseca’s companies are registered in the British Virgin Islands, a territory administered from London. The BVI has stubbornly rejected calls for greater transparency. Successive British governments have failed to act. We spent most of our bunker hours working the big names. They included David Cameron, who features indirectly, as well as a host of other colourful figures including Iceland’s prime minister and Vladimir Putin’s KGB-turned-oligarch pals. The database revealed that the offshore fund run by Cameron’s late father Ian had paid no British tax. For three decades. The fund, Blairmore Holdings Inc, had gone to absurd lengths to pretend that it was based in the Bahamas, another major tax haven. It hired a small army of Bahamas residents to sign paperwork. One of them was a part-time bishop. All of this was legal – but a pantomime designed to keep Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs at bay. In the run up to publication, slotted for 3 April, we had two worries. One, that our investigation might itself leak. Journalists are a gossipy bunch. Two, that nobody would care. After all, when the Guardian published Snowden’s revelations of state spying in 2013 most people in Britain – the land of James Bond – reacted with a weary shrug. In the end we needn’t have worried. In Iceland the prime minister resigned. In Argentina there were protests. In Azerbaijan a small war suddenly initiated – so some believed – to distract from revelations featuring the president and his daughters. In China censors blocked the words “Panama Papers” and jammed the website of the Guardian. In Russia officials fumed about a western “spy” conspiracy. Downing Street refused to answer questions about Cameron’s tax affairs, saying that they were a “private matter”. Eventually Cameron came clean: he’d owned shares in his father’s tax haven fund. He sold them for £31,500 just before becoming prime minister in 2010. Cameron was reluctant to acknowledge what was obvious: that part of his family’s fortune came from privileged offshore wealth. Facebook Twitter Pinterest More than half of the companies that appear in the Panama Papers are registered in the British Virgin Islands Photograph: Alamy Viewed in retrospect, this was the beginning of the end of Cameron. Weeks later he hosted a global anti-corruption summit in London. He announced a clampdown on offshore havens. The UK would introduce a new register that would compel foreign companies owning British property to declare their owner, thereby cleaning up London as a centre for international money-laundering. It was a start. But Cameron stopped short of compelling British overseas territories from outing the real owners of offshore firms. Without a public register the offshore industry – with its satellites of lawyers and banks – was free to carry on as before. The BVI, meanwhile, boycotted the London summit and stayed at home. The picture, then, is a lousy one. But the Panama Papers offer a few rays of hope. In recent years the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and western governments have tried to clamp down on tax evasion, mindful of the billions being lost during a time of austerity. Pressure has been growing on offshore centres to swap information. Increasingly, the Swiss and others are complying. All this has induced a degree of paranoia among Mossack Fonseca’s well-heeled clients. Emails show that the super-rich have adopted various protective strategies to stop the tax man from knocking. Some of them use fake names. We found Harry Potter, Winnie Pooh and Daniel Radcliffe. (Not the real one.) Plus Isaac Azimov, who turned out to be a tax lawyer from Barcelona. Offshore agents report that their Italian clients are going to desperate lengths to avoid being caught. When visiting Switzerland they leave the Ferrari behind and take a less conspicuous car. They also seek to cover their trail by “layering”: using a chain of offshore companies, rather than just one, to bury an asset. Still, the past six months have seen a victory of sorts for those of us, the little people, who do pay our taxes. From now on, the super-rich and other characters who use exotic offshore structures will be a nervous bunch. How long, they must be wondering, before the next leak?

Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Oct 15, 2016 at 6:00PM Image source: The Motley Fool. According to the recently released 2016 Best Global Brands Ranking from Interbrand, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable brand in the world, with an estimated market value of $178 billion. These kinds of rankings and value estimates are always a matter of discussion, but it's hard to argue the fact that Apple is world-class brand, and this has important implications for investors in the company.  The value of a brand Investing in companies with strong brand value can be a powerful strategy for superior returns over the long term. When a company has a differentiated brand, this means customers are willing to buy that company's products over products from the competition offering a similar price and quality. This protects the business from competitive pressure, and it can also mean above-average pricing power, which has a positive effect on the company's profit margins. Interbrand implements a holistic approach that includes both quantitative financial data and subjective considerations for valuing a brand. Financial analysis incorporates variables such as after-tax operating profits, minus a charge for the capital used to generate the brand's revenue and margins. Interbrand also includes other aspects such as the portion of the purchase decision attributable to the brand, as opposed to factors like price and product features. When it comes to measuring brand strength, the consulting firm also evaluates the brand's ability to to create loyalty and sustained demand in the future.  On the other hand, the Forbes Brand Ranking puts more weight on financial considerations than Interbrand. According to Forbes: "We measure the value of a brand by looking at the financials instead of fuzzy consumer surveys. The most valuable brands are ones that generate significant earnings in industries where branding plays a major role." Forbes also considers Apple the most valuable brand in the world, with a calculated value of $154 billion. Interestingly, both Interbrand and Forbes put competitor Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) brand in the second position among global brands. Interbrand estimates that the Google brand is worth $133 billion, while Forbes has a more conservative valuation of $82.5 billion for Google. Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) is another top player in the industry, even if the company is facing a massive blow after the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 disaster, which will probably take a considerable toll on Samsung's brand value. Interband puts Samsung in the seventh global position, with an estimated value of $51.8 billion. When it comes to the Forbes Brand Ranking, Samsung is ranked in the 11th place, with a brand value calculated at $36.1 billion.  How brand value benefits investors in Apple The consumer electronics industry is notoriously challenging and competitive, and most companies in the sector operate with razor-thin profit margins. Global smartphone demand is slowing down thanks to market saturation across the world, and research firm IDC has recently cut its growth forecast for the industry to an anemic increase of 1.6% in shipments during 2016. In this context, many smartphone manufacturers are aggressively cutting prices to protect market share, which is hurting profit margins across the board.   However, you wouldn't have guessed that by looking at Apple. Even if the company is facing declining revenue, the business still generates enormous profitability for investors during challenging times. According to data from Morningstar, Apple produced an operating profit margin around 28.5% of revenue during the 12-month period ended in June of 2016. This is more than double the 12.8% operating margin produced by Samsung in the same period, and the profitability gap will probably increase over the coming months because of the problems Samsung is facing with the Galaxy Note 7.   Based on data from financial services company Cannacord Genuity, Apple captured a staggering 75% of all operating profits in the smartphone industry during the second quarter of 2016. This is in spite of the fact that the company accounted for a relatively small 11.7 % smartphone unit sales during the period. Because Apple launched the new iPhone 7 in September, and because Samsung is suffering a major setback, chances are good that Apple will grab an even larger share of profits in the industry. It's hard to objectively calculate how much a brand like Apple is worth, so investors need to take these estimations with a grain of salt. However, the main point to consider is that brand value is a crucial return driver for investors in Apple stock.

The Series 2 watches do not.  Apple's Watch Series 2 has been on my wrist for almost a month without causing any problems. You may be thinking: "So what. Isn't that normal"? It depends on your definition of normal. I had a severe allergic reaction to something in Apple's first Watch. My skin itched, I developed a rash and at one point my hand swelled to almost My skin itched, I developed a rash and at one point my hand swelled to almost double normal size. It wasn't toothache painful, but it wasn't comfortable.  A surgeon saw this and told me to take it off immediately or face serious illness. Danger Will Robinson The metallic back of the first Watch could have been the cause. Or it may have been the watch band. Given the dire warning, I wasn't prepared to experiment to find out. There has been no reaction of any description this time around. Whatever caused the reaction is not present in the new Watch. The most likely problem with the earlier watch was the strap. Apple calls it a band. Rubber allergy My review Watch was a 42mm Sports model that came with a black Sport Band. According to Apple it is made from a custom high-performance fluoroelastomer. This is a fluorocarbon-based synthetic rubber. In theory, a fluoroelastomer is less likely to cause an allergic reaction than latex. Note the word: less. There are reports of people getting contact dermatitis from fluoroelastomer, but my reaction went way beyond that. The other possibility was the nickel in the metal on the back of the original Apple Watch. Nickel is known to trouble some people. Of course, I could have been reacting to both. Either way, the reaction was serious. It took weeks for my skin to return to normal. Once bitten twice shy Apple swapped my original review watch for a different model with a leather band. I proceeded with caution. Make that extreme caution. The surgeon warned me not to risk it. By now my skin and hand were back to normal. At first, I only wore the second Watch for a few minutes. No visible reaction. The next day I tried it for an hour. There may have been a reaction, I'm not sure. After all, it could have been a psychological response given the earlier rash. I tried the Watch a few more times and even wore it for a few hours one morning. The experiments were inconclusive. There could have been a rash where the metal touched my wrist, but I wasn't getting the extreme swelling. Apple Watch Series 2 material The new Apple Watch Series 2 on my wrist has a dark grey aluminium case with a ceramic back. That's about as chemically inert as possible. The band is made of woven nylon so it breaths. None of this bothers my skin. So, for the first time, I'm getting to give an Apple Watch a proper long term test. Look out for my month-long road test of the Apple Watch Series 2 later this week.

The Nike+ variant of the Apple Watch will be available, and presumably start shipping, on Oct. 28. Apple added the release date to its website sometime overnight, as first spotted by the French website WatchGeneration (and reported by 9to5Mac). The watch was announced during the Apple's special event in early September, alongside the iPhone 7, Apple Watch Series 2, and wireless earbuds. The Apple Watch Nike+ internal hardware is the same as the Apple Watch Series 2, meaning users will get the same 50m water-resistance rating, improved display, and built-in GPS. Specific to the Nike+ edition watch, users will get exclusive watch faces, and the Nike+ Run Club app will come pre-installed. With the app, users can track runs, get daily encouragement to hit the pavement, and compete with fellow Nike+ users and friends. The Nike+ watch also features different watch bands, similar to Apple's Sports band, but with small holes throughout the band accented with various colors. Pricing for the Apple Watch Nike+ is identical to the Series 2 watch -- starting at $369 -- and is only available in an aluminum housing. On Friday, Apple also updated its website and began selling SIM-free, unlocked iPhone 7 models. The Oct. 28 launch date is a day after Apple is rumored to announce a long overdue refreshed MacBook lineup.         LATEST STORIES (9) Anti-Trump Protests Bring People To Streets around US Syrian Army Continue to Advance in Southwestern Aleppo Syrian Army in Battle with Terrorists in Southern Aleppo Before Winning Full Control over Region Iranian Shiites Begin Long Walk to Visit Imam Hossein's Shrine in Iraq's Karbala Syrian Army in Full Control of Dhahiyat al-Assad District in Southwestern Aleppo Syrian Army, Air Force Strike Terrorist Centers in Southwestern Damascus USA: Anti-Trump Protesters March in Portland for 5th Night in a Row Terrorists Experience Great Defeat in Southern Aleppo Millions March in 4th Day of Anti-Trump Protests Putting out the Candle of the Wicked: God Never Left Syria Iraqi Forces Deploy 3 KM From Eastern Bank of Tigris River Iraqi Army Enters Key District in Eastern Mosul Iraqi Volunteer Forces' Spokesman Announces Imminent Operations to Liberate Tal Afar Syrian Army, Air Force Strike Terrorist Centers in Southwestern Damascus Portland Police Declare Curfew for Minors amid Anti-Trump Protests Anti-Trump Protests Bring People To Streets around US TEHRAN (FNA)- Chanting “Not my president” and “love trumps hate,” hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in cities across the United States to protest against President-elect Donald Trump, who they say threatens their civil and human rights.

Home Computing Digital Life Discovery Space Innovation Health Science News Environment Automotive Tech You are here: Home / Mobile Apps / Robots Can Organize Your Photos Certifications that stand out Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Robots Organize Your Photos, So You Can Procrastinate By Anick Jesdanun PUBLISHED: OCTOBER 15 2016 If you're like many people, you have thousands of photos on your phone, long forgotten after you've posted a few on Instagram or Facebook. They don't have to stay forgotten. Apple and Google are both applying a form of artificial intelligence called "machine learning" to organize your pictures and video -- and along the way, help you rediscover last year's vacation, dinner with close friends and a casual summer outing to the park. Apple's tools are part of last month's iOS 10 system update for iPhones and iPads. The Google Photos app for Apple and Android devices has a digital assistant to automatically organize these memories -- and Google signaled last week that it will only get smarter. And on Wednesday, Google introduced additional features for rediscovery. Here's a look at how they take you down memory lane: Apple's Memories Apple's new Memories feature automatically generates video highlights around a theme, such as a trip or birthday party. Individual photos and snippets from video are chosen for you, as is the music, though you can change it to reflect a different mood. This isn't just a slideshow. There's slow zooming and panning, reminiscent of Ken Burns historical documentaries. Some of the photos also come to life, at least on newer iPhones that automatically take three seconds of video with every photo. When you're ready to share, the app creates a standard movie file -- so it works on Windows and Android devices, too. For me, Apple's app created a "Florida to Illinois" package for a three-week trip in January and one for a day trip to Philadelphia last November. But Apple goes beyond date and location. Apple created a "Together" package for shots with family over the past two years. It also created an "At The Beach" package with beach photos since 2013. Other scenic themes could include mountains, lakes and sunsets. Apple offers up to three new Memories a day. You can create more based on photos you add to an album and generate new automated ones by scrolling down to "Related." You can also add or delete images within Memories -- in my experience, a few included mundane screenshots I had to get rid of. Nothing will ever replace the human touch. But let's face it, even though I keep meaning to organize my photos, I never find the time. The machine-generated selections aren't necessarily ones I'd choose myself, but with a small amount of tweaking, they're presentable and will tide me over until I get around to catching up manually ... someday. Google's Assistant Google Photos has been at this longer and offers more types of packages. With collages, Google combines smaller versions of several shots into one layout . Animations combine a bunch of photos taken in succession so that they resemble as a moving image . Unlike typical "GIF" animation files, Google applies its magic to align successive shots, so buildings and bridges look steady -- without the shake common with handheld video. Google also offers albums and video highlights, though without the Ken Burns effect. Google's Assistant generates much of this for you automatically. You can edit auto-generated albums and video highlights, but not collages or animation -- although you can create your own from scratch. (That does defeat the purpose of letting the robots do the work, though.) Sharing is easy and doesn't require recipients to have Google Photos. The results vary in quality. I tend to take several shots of the same subject, just in case some are blurry. Yet I get collages and animations out of those repetitive shots. The albums and video highlights I got are grouped by location and date, though Google says it will be doing more with themes , such as following a kid growing up. Most of my computer-generated creations are animations and collages. As with Apple, Google's choices aren't necessarily ones I'd make, if only I had the time. But some are good enough that I look forward to alerts for new ones to check out. I also enjoyed a feature called "Rediscover this day." Google will automatically create collages from shots taken on a day, say, two years ago. On Wednesday, Google said it will apply that to people, too, so you'll get collages of you with a specific friend or family member. Searching Apple and Google are both getting better at image recognition. Apple's version tends to be more conservative. While Apple found four photos in a search for fireworks, Google found dozens. Google also found more photos with hats, though one was actually a strange hairdo and a few were of a headband. Then again, Apple thought an illustration of a hut was a hat. Google is also bolder with face recognition. Its technology is smart enough to recognize the same child at 2 months and 6 years, while Apple often separates the same child into multiple identities (you can merge them, and things will be fine after that). Google has an edge over Apple in part because it taps its powerful servers to process photos. Apple leaves all the machine thinking to your device as a privacy measure. But Apple says it also favors being right more than complete to reduce the work people need to do to fix things. Being wrong can also have consequences: Google had to apologize last year after its software got too aggressive and mistakenly labeled two black people as gorillas. Storage To free up space, both services will automatically clear photos from your phone after uploading them to the internet, once you activate the option. You still have a lower-resolution version on the device and can get the sharper image anytime, as long as you're online. Google Photos offers unlimited online storage of photos at up to 16 megapixels and videos at 1080p high definition -- good enough for most people. It will compress larger photos, or you can store the original and have it count toward your Google Drive limit, which starts at 15 gigabytes for free. Apple's iCloud Photo Library requires paying once you exceed 5 gigabytes, which is enough for a few thousand photos. © 2016 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

The iPhone 4 is about to fall into obsolescence, along with some other Apple productshttps://t.co/t3oLxunCkZ pic.twitter.com/mdSSOqm45s — MacLife (@MacLife) October 15, 2016 Starting on October 31 of this year — so at the end of this month — Apple will no longer provide technical support for the iPhone 4. This isn’t the only device that is being labeled “obsolete.” According to Mac Otakara, along with the iPhone 4 is the late 2010 13-inch MacBook Air, the third-generation AirPort Extreme (sometimes referred to as the AirMac Extreme), and the second-generation Time Capsule. These devices will get the coveted — or vetted, depending on your position — title of “vintage.” There are exceptions to the rule, however: California and Turkey are required to continue supporting products for up to seven years, so you should have a couple of years left if you live in either of those places. This has not been officially announced by Apple just yet, but Mac Otakara has been a reliable source in the past. As previously referenced here on the Inquisitr, while “[the Japanese site] does not have a perfect track record with Apple rumors, [their] sources have proven accurate on multiple occasions in the past.” Specifically, back in November of 2015, the site hinted at Apple removing the headphone jack — which evidently came true. Furthermore, the site seemed to confirm the rumored iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus “Jet Black” color option, as well as “accurately [leaking] the iPhone 7’s naming scheme, pressure-sensitive Home button, and larger earpiece cutout,” which all came true. We’ll see if their sources prove true this time as well. These devices have been around for nearly six years, so it makes sense, and they’ve all had a good run. All good things must come to an end eventually. What Does This Mean? Well, if you have any of these devices — particularly the iPhone 4 or the late 2010 13-inch MacBook Air — you should think about upgrading to the latest device. If not the latest, then perhaps the last iteration of the device. This way, you’ll continue to get the most recent iOS and macOS updates and security patches as they become available. Since Apple is labeling these devices as “obsolete,” they will not be issued the newest OS updates and security patches anymore. Of course, if your devices are running just fine, then continue to use them until they break or stop working; just don’t expect Apple to repair them for you. A Brief Reflection Of Apple’s Past [Image by Paul Sakuma/AP Images] The iPhone 4 was announced on June 7, 2010, during their annual World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC) at the Moscone West in San Francisco, California. Steve Jobs sauntered on stage in his trademark black turtleneck and stone-washed jeans, presenting the future of the iPhone, “The Most Amazing iPhone Yet,” in typical Apple hyperbole. The iPhone 4 was made available for pre-order on June 15, 2010, and was unleashed to the public on June 24, 2010. Unfortunately, three years later, on September 10, 2013, Apple discontinued the iPhone 4 amid hardware defects: The device was not holding calls, something that became known as “antennagate.” Though Apple didn’t sell the iPhone 4 anymore, it was still a widely popular device, and they continued support for the hardware by way of software updates and cases that provided antenna support for those who didn’t upgrade to the iPhone 4s. On October 20, 2010, during Apple’s October Mac Keynote, they announced and released a redesigned 13-inch MacBook Air. This provided an improved enclosure, a better screen resolution, a longer battery life, and flash storage instead of a hard drive. This netbook was significantly more powerful than the mid-2009 MacBook Air, and its specifications provided power and efficiency in a compact, lightweight chassis — the best of both worlds. Sometime in 2011, when Apple unveiled and released the mid-2011 MacBook Air, the late-2010 13-inch MacBook Air was discontinued. Much like the iPhone 4, the late-2010 13-inch MacBook Air was still a popular device, and Apple continued to support it via software updates to increase performance and efficiency to the best of their ability considering the outdated technology. The AirPort Extreme was released on March 3, 2009, with simultaneous dual-band 802.11 Draft-N radios. This allowed full 802.11 Draft-N 2×2 communication in both 802.11 Draft-N bands at the same time. In other words, the AirPort Extreme — which functioned as router, network switch, wireless access point, network-attached storage (or NAS) — was the most efficient device that increased the bandwidth of wireless access networks, while also making them faster and easier to access and manipulate. The AirPort Time Capsule (or Time Capsule for short), a wireless router, debuted in early 2009. It offered simultaneous 802.11n dual-band operation, which allowed older devices to use slower wireless speeds, without affecting the overall performance of devices that can use higher 802.11n speeds. In other words, for older devices that didn’t have the faster connectivity options built into their CPUs, the Time Capsule allowed them to access slower wireless speeds without jeopardizing the performance of other connected devices. It is, in essence, another version of the AirPort Extreme. While it’s sad to see these devices leave the Apple lineup, it may mean that Apple has some new products brewing in the headquarters. Only time will tell.

Whether it’s the seemingly far-fetched RFID or NFC implants, or more standard faire like retinal scanning and fingerprint sensors, security that exceeds the common password is on the horizon — or already here. Apple Watch isn’t immune to progress on this front. A new era of tech events has begun We’re back in New York this November for the 4th edition of our growth-focused technology event. Join us In a patent application published today, Apple details a process that would measure the oxygen content in blood. We’re not there yet, but the patent details that it’s at least something the company is interested in exploring. In fact, Apple may have been interested in the technology for a while. A first-generation Apple Watch was determined to include the necessary hardware for doing just this, but was never activated. Now, it seems Apple has a renewed interest in the technology. According to the filing: Light emitters and light sensors can be used to perform biometric identification of a user based on identifying characteristics of the user’s vasculature. For example, light information can be obtained at one or more light sensors, and the information can be compared to stored information associated with a user identity.

January 25 AAPL: 99.44 -1.98 Opinion: What can we expect from the 2016 MacBooks, rumored to be launched by June? Ben Lovejoy - 10 months ago @benlovejoy Feature MacBook Pro Mac MacBook MacBook Air Opinion Comments (89) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit With KGI suggesting that we could see new MacBook models as early as the first half of the year, I thought it would be a good time to expand on the suggestions we made in our 2016 roundup and speculate in a little more detail on what we might expect from those machines. There is rather a lot of speculation involved, for a couple of reasons. First, while we tend to see a number of leaks and rumors for the iPhone – not least from our own Mark Gurman – there are notably fewer for Macs. We’ll likely see some nearer the time, but we could as yet still be six months out. Second, it’s easier to predict what Apple is likely to do with regard to the MacBook range than when it might do it. I’ve argued before that we can at some point expect Apple to drop the MacBook Air label, leaving two ranges known as the MacBook and the MacBook Pro. But whether that will happen this year or next is, I think, harder to guess. But let’s start with what we know about the technology available to Apple this time around … Apple currently uses a mix of Broadwell and Haswell processors in its MacBook Air/Pro range. This year, Intel will have 6th-gen Skylake chips available in time for a June launch. Skylake will offer a significant speed bump over current chips. We’re likely to see gains in the 10-20% range in the CPU, and rather better from the graphics, where improvements of up to 40% are possible. Skylake chips are also notably more power efficient than current-generation processors, offering power savings in the 15-30% range. Apple could use this improved efficiency to boost battery life, reduce battery size or a combination of the two. I’ll share my thoughts on this shortly. The latest kid on the block in terms of ports is of course the USB-C standard which Apple used in the 12-inch MacBook. Since then, Intel gave USB-C a new capability: incorporating Thunderbolt into the chip. Finally, Skylake incorporates a couple of new wireless communication standards, WiDi – Wireless Display – and WiGig, short-range high-speed wireless data of up to 7Gbps. Future versions of the chip will also support wireless charging, but those won’t be available in time for a June launch. These features may influence Apple’s decisions on future monitors and accessories (wireless Thunderbolt Display and external drives, for example), but won’t have any immediate impact on the machines themselves. So, that’s the technology Apple has to play with – what do I think it will do with it? Across the range Apple has to adopt Skylake: it would be silly to launch any new Mac without taking advantage of the sixth-generation Intel chips. For me, the only question here is whether the new MacBook Air gets a full-powered Skylake chip, or the much lower-powered Core M version. More on this when we look specifically at the Air. It’s also a no-brainer that Apple will add USB-C to both MacBook Air and MacBook Pro machines – and given that USB-C now incorporates Thunderbolt, Apple will undoubtedly drop the standalone Thunderbolt port. The only question here is whether Apple will retain any other legacy ports. There’s another piece of technology Apple has had for a while now but not yet added to the Mac: Touch ID. With many of us used to logging in to our iPhone and iPad with our fingerprint, it feels rather clunky to have to type a password when we login to our Macs. Apple first patented fingerprint login to Macs way back in 2007, but adding the hardware to MacBooks is not the only approach it could take. Apple could take a Continuity-style approach and allow us to use Touch ID on our iPhone to login to our Macs. There are already third-party apps that allows us to do this, so there’s no technical barrier to Apple going this route. But one way or the other – hardware or software – I think 2016 is the year Apple needs to allow us to use Touch ID on our Macs. This would not only allow fingerprint login, but would also be a far more convenient way to access the secure Notes facility introduced in OS X 10.11.4, and to add Apple Pay as a payment option on the apple.com website. Finally, I’d expect at least the Air – and possibly also the Pro – to mirror the color options of the 12-inch MacBook, offering a choice of silver, space gray and gold. Just my take. So now let’s talk specifics … 2016 MacBook Air/MacBook I’m going to go out on a limb here and suggest that this will be the year in which Apple drops the Air suffix, so I’m going to use the label MacBook for the machine currently known as the MacBook Air. It would be silly to launch a 12-inch machine only to retain an 11-inch one, so I think we can safely say that the 11-inch MacBook Air will not be replaced. We’ve also heard rumors of a 15-inch MacBook Air, which would give us 12-, 13- and 15-inch models. (My only question here would be whether there’s really a need for both 12- and 13-inch machines? Could Apple instead drop the 13-inch model?) If I’m right about the label, then we can expect the larger machine(s) to adopt the design of the 12-inch MacBook. This will, I suspect, include the single USB-C port (incorporating Thunderbolt). Which brings us back to the Skylake power efficiency question I posed earlier: will Apple boost the battery-life or reduce the battery size? At least where the MacBook range is concerned, I think it will reduce the size to match the much sleeker proportions of the 12-inch model. And, for good or bad, I think that also means we can expect Apple to use the ultra-low-profile butterfly keyboard on the 13- and 15-inch models. There is another messiness in the current MacBook/Air range: the 12-inch model has a Retina display, the current 11- and 13-inch machines don’t. That too needs to be tidied-up, and other manufacturers are using high-resolution displays in their ultrabooks, so I strongly suspect that we can expect Apple to use Retina screens across the entire range. The final question, then, is whether the MacBook range gets the full-fat Skylake processors I expect to see in the MacBook Pro, or the cut-down Core M version whose predecessor was used in the 12-inch machine. This is a very tricky one, as it really depends on how well the 12-inch machine has sold. If it appears to have a niche market only, then the larger machines will probably get the real deal when it comes to their Skylake processors. But if sales of the 12-inch machine have demonstrated that most non-pro buyers are all about the portability, and never mind the power, we could see Core M CPUs across the MacBook range – which would also serve as a strong differentiator between the MacBook and MacBook Pro ranges. 2016 MacBook Pro The 13-inch MacBook Pro currently has Intel’s Broadwell chipset, but the 15-inch has the previous-generation Haswell. The blame here may lay with Intel rather than Apple, but either way Apple definitely needs to set things right by ensuring the new machines get the new Skylake chips with beefier Iris Pro graphics to match. It would be nice to imagine that Apple would also double the entry-level RAM from the present 8/16GB (depending on model) to 16/32GB, but the company has not historically been generous with RAM, so I’m not expecting to see an increase here. SSDs have been falling dramatically in price, so it would also be pleasant to think Apple might bump standard storage capacity from 128/256/512GB on the 13-inch model to 256/512/1TB, with the 15-inch getting 512GB/1TB. But Apple’s thinking of late seems to be that our data should be in the cloud rather than on our machines, so I’m again not optimistic. Apple has form when it comes to getting well ahead of the curve where legacy technology is concerned, dropping first the floppy drive and later the optical drive well before any other mainstream manufacturer. It also didn’t hesitate to drop legacy ports from the 12-inch MacBook. The MacBook Pro is of course aimed at a different market – one where many users do connect a number of peripherals at any one time. For this reason, I definitely don’t expect it to go the same single-port route as the MacBook, but I do expect it to standardize on USB-C. I’ve already mentioned that there’s no longer any need for a separate Thunderbolt port now that USB-C incorporates it, and I suspect we can also wave goodbye to HDMI when either an adapter or AirPlay to Apple TV will do the job. To me, the only questions are whether the MBP retains any USB 3 ports and the SDXC card slot. Users with multiple USB 2/3 devices would undoubtedly by annoyed by Apple losing these ports, but I do suspect that after some initial grumbling at the need to buy and carry adapters, most of us would get over it. And with many of today’s cameras offering Wi-Fi connectivity, Apple could make a case for losing the card slot too. One strong possibility, then, would be to lose all ports bar the headphone socket, replacing them all with four or five USB-C ports and relying on adapters for everything else. I’d personally love to think that another differentiator between MacBook and MacBook Pro ranges would be battery-life. Use the improved power efficiency of the Skylake processors to deliver a sleeker form-factor in the MacBook via smaller batteries, but retain the battery sizing in the Pro to deliver longer battery-life. But once again, I’m not optimistic. I’d instead expect Apple to reduce the battery size in the MacBook Pro to deliver a slimmer, sleeker machine – perhaps partially borrowing the wedge shape of the MacBook range. I’ll end on a wildcard: with Apple having seemingly moved from the 11-inch MacBook Air to a 12-inch MacBook, there is the possibility of a move from 13- and 15-inch machines to 14- and 16-inch, without any increase in the overall dimensions. If Apple did that with the MacBook Pro only, it could further differentiate the ranges. As ever, please take our polls and share your own thoughts in the comments.

I’d instead expect to see the specs gap between Macbook and Air grow a little slimmer over the next few years. Specifically, I think Apple needs to prove it can produce a 12-inch Macbook in its current form without sacrificing so much performance. Also, I expect to see the 12-inch model get a price drop as it falls in line with the Air models’ price points. Perhaps in two or three years we’ll see the “Air” moniker dropped, but I think Apple i still working out the kinks to fit the Air guts in the non-air body.

For 3 reasons: its battery life is ridiculously awesome, it’s much cheaper than the Macbook and because it’s much more powerful than the Macbook. But all 3 issues will be fixed over time. I, as you, expect a price drop for the Mcabook, I’d say a 150-200$ price drop.

Hopefully Apple doesn’t change the MacBook Pro much. It would be nice to see them switch to 14″ and 16″ models with multiple USB-C ports. Apple has to many products in 12″-13″ range.

Maybe they could even throw Beats Audio into the mix and remove the black bar by the fan while they are at it. I do however hope they don’t add butterfly keys to the Pro model at least. And they better not remove the glowing Apple logo, it will ruin the sticker game of the machine.

It’s not 17″ but it gets closer and everybody’s 15″ bags will still accommodate if the chassis form factor is the same. I dislike the storage speculations. When you are crunching / saving / accessing big video and photo files, “The Cloud” is NOT a viable working solution. Perhaps WiFi and other internet access at the Apple Campus is 1 Gb/sec but in the real world (at least in the USA) the term “broadband” is deceptive advertising. For one asymmetrical upload / download speeds make uploading large files tedious if not unfeasible for working graphics professionals. SO, we end up carrying an external drive and it kind of gets away from the whole ‘Field Portable’ thing. Having said that 1 TB of internal storage seems to be adequate (for now) so I think it should be the ‘Minimum’ for the MPB. Minimum DDR should be pretty robust as well … 32 GB. It may seem like a lot but it is called a MacBook ‘PRO’ after all [of course it will ding the battery life].

They will later be replaced completely by the MacBook range, when prices of Retina Displays and SSD will make it possible to get it into MacBook Air prices. The MacBook could gain a 14″, both with moderate power (to differenciate them from the Pro) but still very slim and long battery charge. So no Skylake for the MacBook. The MacBook Pro could loose the 13″ version, keep the 15″ and see the come back of a 17″ version. Form factor would only see minor changes expect making it a bit slimmer, probably by adopting the MacBook Keyboard and trackpad pad, and using same specialy formed batteries. Perhaps, as noticed, also in space-gray and gold. And of course Skylake and USB-C, one on each side. And Touch ID. Possibility for rationalizing the production, the Pro could have same “even” screen sizes logic as the MacBook. It would then be 14″, 16″ and 18″. I don’t see the use of a 12″ MacBook Pro. The current 13″ isn’t Pro anyway So we would have The MBA 11″ and 13″ unchanged for another year for cheap entry level. The MB with 12″ and 14″ for portability. Will replace the Air next year or so.

Then the most logical direction would be to realign the three ranges (MacBook, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro) as three sizes (12″, 14″ and 16″). I believe Apple will stick to the Skylake M processor to keep the 12″ fanless, light and thin, aimed at students, home users and travellers. It may ditch the 2.5mm audio jack (if the iPhone rumours are true) for another USB-C + Thunderbolt port (assuming the first port will also be upgraded to + Thunderbolt). Next, I think Apple will go full Skylake for the 14″ and 16″ models (rather than a 15″ model). The new 14″ with narrow bezels will be similar in size to the current 13″, and the 16″ will resemble a 15″. I think the 14″ will be aimed at office and business users, with 2 USB-C + Thunderbolt ports, whereas the 16″ will be a targeting pro users, filling the gap of the previous 17″ MacBook Pro, with 4 USB-C + Thunderbolt ports. Within each screen size, I expect three levels of processor speed, and three levels of SSD storage, respectively. This would then make it more or less similar to choosing an iPad. For this reason, they may (but probably won’t) call the three versions MacBook Mini, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. This massive simplification will allow for a much easier selection of MacBooks for the not so tech-savvy consumer.

LikeLike just-a-random-dude - 10 months ago Reply > Since then, Intel gave USB-C a new capability: incorporating Thunderbolt into the chip. No, USB-C didn’t get any new capabilities. Just to clarify this, Intel didn’t add this to USB-C, it added TB3 support (and USB 3.1 Gen 2, 10Gbps) to its Alpine Ridge I/O controller that outputs to USB-C. Intel is using the built-in Alt Mode support of USB-C to carry the TB3 data. Skylake CPU also does not mean TB3 is automatically included nor the Alpine Ridge controller, it’s a separate chipset. In fact, Apple could’ve use this controller with Broadwell Intel CPUs as well, there’s no mandate to use it with Skylake. USB-C is a connector standard. It has support for Alt-Mode, allowing the chipset developers to include other technologies via this mode. In this case, Intel has added TB3 to its Alpine Ridge controller to use this Alt Mode. So, in this article, you are referring to adding Intel’s Alpine Ridge controller to Macs and even possible for future iOS devices to have support for it, like iPad Pro. If Sony comes up with a 1tbps data protocol, it can add support for it in its own custom I/O controller that outputs to USB-C and use Alt Mode to carry the custom protocol. That doesn’t mean USB-C has gotten a new capability nor does it mean all USB-C ports would support this new protocol. Is the Alpine Ridge controller small and power efficient enough to include in the Macbook, no clue. However, these were the main reasons TB2 did not take off fast on PCs the last generation, the TB controller was too big and too power hungry. Alpine Ridge is smaller and more power efficient but not to the point it may be enough for the Macbook. May also be the reason iPad Pro does not have this.

LikeLike triankar - 10 months ago Reply Ben, regarding the Air you forgot to factor in one thing: cost. The absolutely cheapest Mac laptop runs at $899 (11″ MBA). The cheapest MacBook 12 is $1299. So, if Apple means to drop the Air models, its entry-level laptop will be nowhere near as affordable. Things I expect to happen: – MacBook 12 prices drop to (slightly) more reasonable levels overall – We see a 4GB/128GB MacBook 12 with a $999 price as the new entry-level Apple laptop – Air models get dropped or at least receive minimal attention (depending on how aggressive Apple wants to be about it) – rMBP loses some fat (hello, Jony), the Thunderbolt ports (easy one) and MagSafe (I’ll miss it), gains USB-C ports (no-brainer) and hopefully retains at least one USB-A port. It would be nice if they at least kept a microSD port, when these cards are the de facto standard out there, but that’s an easy “not happening”. An adapter it is, then – the replacement of the Apple Thunderbolt Display is announced. A 27 inch 5K display with all the much-awaited USB-C / USB-A / TB / Ethernet ports around the back. Firewire? Not really. Price jumps from $999 back to $1299 or thereabouts, just because they can – we start seeing official USB-C to Lightning cables and wall adapters. It’s about time (September at the latest). If the new rMBP is around 1300 grams (MBA-13 levels) and below, that’ll be very nice. It’s my only complaint with my current rMBP13. I also wouldn’t mind if the MB12 gained another USB-C port. I’d argue it’s still much-needed in 2016, but I don’t see it happening.

While it is true that more camera makers are supporting wireless photo transfers, these are for mostly small jpegs created for viewing on a phone, not the large jpegs and definitely not the raw files that are going to be processed. Nikon flat out tells you on their web site that large files are a problem to transfer wirelessly. Other makers do not allow for any transfers other than small jpegs for this reason. Even the upcoming 802.11ad standards do not allow for the bandwidth needed to handle those kinds of transfers. Say you are a photographer that uses their MBP on site to assess their progress and to show their clients a sample of what to expect, so you pull out the five or six 128GB or 256GB sdxc cards you have filled so far on your photo shoot. Trying to ‘wirelessly’ scroll through the samples will be a nightmare that will end you up with dead batteries in your equipment and a client that is annoyed because you wasted their time. Using the sdxc slot for quick large file transfer is as common as usb flash drives. These slots should stay.

The 13″ Macbook Air remains as the cheapest, entry level option. Not sure on processor or USB-C. I have a feeling it will stick around but not get the latest in terms of specs and hardware features. Similiar low-res screen, but maybe gets an IPS panel. If no hardware updates at all, 13″ might drop in price to whatever the 11″ sells for now. Maybe gets some zany new colors. 12″ Macbook will be updated with a new processor, touch ID and 1 additional USB-C port, and a 14″ Macbook will be introduced. Remember inches refers to the diagonal width of the screen, not the actual size of the laptop. The new Macbook’s bezel is so much thinner, a 14″ would be very close in size to the super popular 13″ MBA but with a new sexy, slightly larger screen. Then in a few years as the Macbook becomes commodified the MBA will go away or finally be replaced. I also think it’s totally possible the new Macbook line gets rebranded as Macbook Air 2 or just Macbook Air if the original goes away. This is their big bet for the near future of laptop computing. Once the Core M processors for it get up to snuff, and I think they are very close, this is going to be the laptop everyone wants.

With current technology it is easily doable – it all comes down to battery life (if skylake 30% more power efficient then a quad-core could probably be brought into the 13″ without affecting battery life more than 10%). — If it is just a secondary computer, then just updating the Macbook to Skylake would be fine. LikeLike Jerry Suppan - 9 months ago Reply Thanks for that pretty thorough analysis of what to expect. I think this is pretty much spot on as to what to expect. I would like to see a change in Apple’s overall stingy nature. Ports, memory, storage. Macbook – It would be a lot more appealing if there were minimally two (2) USB Type-C ports. One for charging and a second one to simultaneously be able to use an external peripheral without hanging a large and relatively heavy, clunky adapter or breakout box. Or perhaps to be able to use an external monitor closed lid and external storage. For this reason I still will not consider a Macbook (not to mention it’s power performance) Having said that, as an alternative, I could consider one as a replacement for any iPad (including iPad Pro) to preclude any more iPad purchases. Since it is obvious Apple will not converge OS-X and iOS any time soon, the Macbook could be a consideration in lieu of any iPad. An inexpensive ASUS ZenPad 8″ could be used for any sort of iPad type functionality someone might want. Apple could, and should converge their OSes, but won’t until the competition is doing it so well Apple has no choice but to follow suit to remain competitive. Thus, sooner or later it will have to evolve. Comparatively, Surface pro already offers a powerful (Core i7-based) full-fledge PC as well as it being a tablet. There is also a rumor Google might converge ChromeOS and Android into an Androidbook type of device. Macbook Pro – 16/32 Memory options are definitely in order, especially one is to do ‘heavy lifting’ productions like video edits, conversion, rendering, CAD/CAM, whatever. Also, I would like to see a 2TB option in addition to the 500GB/1TB options for internal storage. Both of these requests are technically doable. So again, it all depends will lighten up on stinginess or not. If we are to call this a ‘Pro’ machine, make it a pro machine with differentiating factors.

Charles Dome of Bellville was attempting to eat his apple fritter, but yellow jackets wanted some, too. A retired firefighter, he was joined by his son-in-law, Mansfield fire Chief Steve Strickling and his wife Heather, who were enjoying a perfect autumn day with their family. Zach Hotz, 11, of Butler, and his brother Garett, 9, were trying the fried apple wedges as they waited to see their brother Hunter pass by in the marching band. "Pretty good," Garett said as he sampled the apples fresh out of the deep fryer. The first-ever Butler Apple Fest Queen was crowned.  Kaitlin King, a senior at Clear Fork High School, waved at the crowd as she rode by in a convertible. There were rides and a lot of people visiting with their friends and neighbors. Kilian Finnegan, 10, a fifth-grader at Butler Elementary School, took a turn on a mechanical bull ride at the festival. "It was pretty rough," he said after falling off into a padded area. lwhitmir@nncogannett.com 419-521-7223 Twitter: @LWhitmir 118 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/2ehq59t TOP VIDEOS OSU cornerback Marshon Lattimore 0:27 Saturday is "payday" for Buckeyes 0:33 OSU offensive coordinator Ed Warinner 0:33 What changed for OSU? 0:20 Lexington at Clyde football 3:11 Lexington wins 0:14 Sleep-Out for the Homeless fundraiser 1:24 Big catch for Buckeyes 0:31 Every week's a dogfight 0:21 Is Samuel being used right? 0:20 Defending his offense 1:10 Halloween parade 0:42 Road to Wrestling: The Tryout 3:35 MANCI Cattle Auction 2:52 Road to Wrestling: Day 40 0:47 Mansfield police mentoring kids at Friendly House 2:25 Make A Difference Day Food Drive 2:49 Butler Apple Festival 2:12 Lillith recovering from being shot 1:52 OSU's Raekwon McMillan 0:38 OSU's Parris Campbell 0:19 Ohio State DB Marshon Lattimore 0:17 Big Guns 20: William vs. Odom 0:53 Big Guns 20: White vs. Johnson 0:30 Big Guns 20: Cody Stevens vs. John De Jesus Highlights 2:59 Road to Wrestling: Day 27 3:25 So much depth at OSU 0:19 Buckeyes act like underdogs 0:23 OSU: competition at WR 0:31 Final Horn Week 6 6:49 Lt.

Adam Levy (adamlevy) Oct 15, 2016 at 2:04PM Image source: Netflix. In January, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) announced its global expansion to 130 additional countries, bringing the streaming service to nearly every market in the world. There is, however, one glaring omission: China. The Chinese government censors much of the media its citizens consume, so media companies like Netflix must work closely with the government before entering the market. At The New Yorker TechFest earlier this month, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings told the audience that the likelihood of it entering China "doesn't look good." He cites the recent shutdown of the Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) movie services as a sign that Chinese regulators are cracking down on foreign media companies. Instead, he's focused on the rest of the world right now. The recent shutdowns Both Disney and Apple were forced to shut down their online services earlier this year after new regulations went into effect limiting online delivery of foreign content. Disney had to ditch its DisneyLife streaming service, which offers access to its catalog of Disney films, television, music, and books. The service was online for just five months before Chinese regulators shut it down -- customers who bought a yearlong subscription have been reimbursed. Apple, meanwhile, was forced to shut down its iTunes Movies and iBooks stores to comply with the new regulations. The digital media stores were also short-lived, opening just six months prior to the new regulations taking effect. Considering that Netflix's global strategy relies on its growing amount of original content for which it owns global rights, an entry into China with its current regulations isn't going to work. Netflix would have to develop a whole new service with local content, and even then, it's no guarantee it will get government approval. The importance of China Perhaps the most significant part of China's shutdowns of both Apple and Disney's online services is that both companies have a significant presence in the country already. Disney recently opened a theme park in Shanghai, spending $5.5 billion on the park's development. The company estimates that there are 330 million people within a three-hour radius who also have the financial means to come to the park. It's a big bet on the growing Chinese middle class. What's more, Disney movies have proven popular in China. Zootopia, Captain America: Civil War, and The Jungle Book are among the top 10 highest-grossing films for the year in China. The opening of Shanghai Disneyland could help reinforce Disney's success at the box office. Apple, meanwhile, generated 25% of its revenue from Greater China last year. It became the company's second-largest market in sales last year, but it may cede that position back to Europe this year. The value in China is huge. Box office spending in the country could eclipse the U.S. by next year. What's more, the average person in China is spending more and more on entertainment every year. Indeed, missing out on China is a big blow for Netflix. Focusing on what it can control "We're focused on the rest of the world," Hastings told the audience at the TechFest. Netflix is investing heavily in content for international markets including both global licenses and local content. Additionally, it's producing content in local languages for several key markets and, next year, the company plans to spend even more than its 2016 budget of $6 billion. Hastings' focus is on driving subscriber growth. While most analysts understand the strategy, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft recently called into question the consensus estimate for Netflix's cash-flow expectations in light of its aggressive investments in international content rights. He doesn't see Netflix producing positive cash flow until 2020, whereas most analysts are projecting positive cash flow in 2020. As long as subscribers continue to pour in from international markets, Netflix is in a strong position to prove the value of its product and eventually slow content investment and raise prices. Being locked out of the valuable Chinese market will make the task more difficult, but there's still plenty of potential throughout the rest of the world. Adam Levy owns shares of Apple.

Customers will have to pay the full retail price for each variant.  ( Apple ) Advertisement Customers can now purchase iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus without a SIM at Apple's website. This could be significant to consumers who have been waiting for about a month for the unlocked version of the latest handsets. At Apple's online store, buyers will be able to see a SIM-free option in addition to devices that are covered under Sprint, T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon plans. Of course, consumers will have to pay for the whole retail price, which ranges from $649, $749 and $849 for the 32 GB, 128 GB and 256 GB variants, respectively. The case is different when buying through a carrier at the online store because an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus can be purchased on installment basis. This is the burden that comes with the choice to buy a smartphone with no contract commitment whatsoever in addition to the need to buy a nano SIM. Fortunately, Apple has an 18-month promotional financing, which allows customers purchasing the SIM-free handsets to pay in installments using a Barclay Visa credit card. This feature, however, disqualifies an iPhone from Apple's Upgrade program. Certainly, there are several inconveniences when purchasing a carrier-free phone. But there are segments of the market that prefer unlocked handsets. These include those who are traveling overseas or shipping the devices to relatives abroad. It is also possible that Apple hastened the release of the unlocked iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus to meet the demand of customers looking for a Samsung Galaxy Note 7 replacement. Tech Times previously reported that Apple could snag as much as 8 million handset sales for the remaining part of this year due to the Note 7 snafu. "All iPhone models are world phones, so you can use them almost anywhere," Apple said. "Which means you can roam internationally on GSM networks in over 200 countries around the world, whether you are a GSM or CDMA network customer." Consumers should note that the tech company's iPhone Upgrade program will not yet include unlocked iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Apple has not explained this as of this writing. When a customer chooses the Upgrade program option, he is mandated to choose a carrier before proceeding to checkout. Finally, for those concerned about shipping, it seems that demand for the Jet Black model of the iPhone 7 Plus is still high. The waiting time for the device could reach as long as eight weeks in contrast to other variants, which have three to five weeks delivery schedule.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Sued by Tennessee Woman for Overheated Phone 6 scarring her Breast | Main | Apple's iPhone 7 Pre-Orders sold out in Record Time in Korea Friday while Anger over the Note 7's Demise Still Lingers » October 15, 2016 The Invention behind the Integrated Antenna Lines in Current & Future iPhones Surface   Along with the clean new look of the iPhone 6 came the distracting antenna lines that some thought were stylish. While Apple has tried to tone them down a little for the iPhone 7, the antenna lines remain. Today's report covers Apple's invention that relates to how the antenna lines are formed for current and possible future iPhone designs. The location of future antennas may change as well. Apple's invention also supports previous patents about how a cellular antenna structure could be integrated into a future metal MacBook. Cellular antennas can't receive or transmit signals through metal and so Apple's invention details how they meld metal with non-metal materials together so as to form structures for antenna reception while keeping the device housing structures appealing for their customers.    Patent Background   Many computing devices have outer enclosures and coverings with metallic surfaces that give the device enclosures an aesthetically pleasing look and feel, as well as a high durability. Computing devices also generally include any of a number of complex functional components. For example, many mobile phones, tablets and laptops have radio frequency antennas that allow communication via radio frequency transmission.   One design challenge associated with computing devices is maintaining a sleek and consistent appearance of a metallic enclosure for housing the various complex internal components. Since metal is not radio frequency transmissive, metal is generally a poor choice of material when the devices utilize radio frequency transmission for communication.   In addition, metal is generally a high capacitive material, and as a result, not used to cover capacitive touch pads, touch screens and other capacitive sensors. Accordingly, portions of the enclosures that cover antennas and touch sensors are typically made of a non-metallic material such as plastic or glass.   Unfortunately, plastic surfaces and glass surfaces can have different visual and tactile qualities than metallic surfaces, which can result in a visible and tactile break in the metallic surface of the enclosures. These visible breaks can detract from the smooth and continuous look of the metallic enclosures.   Apple Invention: Methods for Electrically Isolating Areas of a Metal Device Body   Apple's invention generally relates to methods of forming unitary structures by rendering portions of a metal substrate non-conductive thereby creating conductive regions that are electrically isolated from each other. The methods can be use in various applications, including forming electrically isolated portions of electronic devices, such as enclosures and housing for electronic devices.   Method Applying to the iPhone 6 (6s and 7)   In the first example below the invention covers the construction of the iPhone 6 and technically the 6s and 7. The enclosure includes a unitary structure. The unitary structure includes a substrate formed of a metal and having a first portion electrically isolated from a second portion by an insulating portion formed of the metal having been rendered electrically insulative.   In Apple's patent FIG. 1B we're able to see the iPhone 6 enclosure #101 after portions of the enclosure are electrically separated. FIG. 1B shows a back view of an iPhone 6. As shown, electrically conductive or metal portions #F102, #104 and #106 are separated from one another by non-electrically conductive or non-metal portions #108 and #110.   Non-metal portions #108 and #110 can also be referred to as an electrically insulating portion. Non-metal portions #108 and #110 noted above on the iPhone 6 are the notable lines that are more apparent on the lighter colored iPhones and almost invisible in the new iPhone 7 black models. It's likely why the new iPhone 7 models are more popular.   Non-metal portions #108 and #110 can be RF transparent in order to allow transmission of RF signals to and/or from antenna(s) housed within enclosure. In this way, non-metal portions #108 and #110 can sometimes be referred to as RF windows, segments or lines. RF transparent materials can be non-conductive materials such as glass, plastic or ceramic (e.g. metal oxide).   In some embodiments, non-metal portions #108 and #110 and metal portions #102, #104 and #106 are molded together using a molding process. In some embodiments, a co-extrusion and molding operation are used in combination. The co-extruding and/or molding process can be customized such that any seams between non-metal portions #108 and #110 and metal portions #102, #104 and #106 are visually and tactilely unperceivable to a user of the iPhone. .   In some embodiments, non-metal portions #108 and #110 are formed by converting selected portions of the iPhone enclosure to a corresponding metal oxide using an oxidizing process, such as anodizing or PEO.   Metal oxide is generally non-conductive and sufficiently RF transparent to allow RF signals to pass therethrough, and therefore can be used as a suitable RF window or segment material for an iPhone. Since the oxidizing process is a conversion process, non-metal portions #108 and #110 can be integrally formed with metal portions #102, #104 and #106 such that transitions between non-metal portions #108 and #110 and metal portions #102, #104 and #106 are virtually seamless. This can improve the look and feel of an iPhone enclosure.   In addition, the manufacturing process for forming the iPhone's enclosure can be simplified since the enclosure can be formed from a single metal piece instead of three separate pieces.   Method Applying to a MacBook   In September Patently Apple posted a report titled "A New Apple Patent Shows their Renewed Interest in a Cellular MacBook," wherein we illustrated an Apple patent figure as noted above where new cellular antenna holes could allow for RF transmissions for an antenna. In this week's patent application Apple describes patent FIG. 2 as being micro holes placed into a metal body like a MacBook that would allow for a cellular antenna.   Apple's patent FIG. 2 shows part or structure #200 that can be part of an electronic component of a larger electronic device like a MacBook. The structure includes a metal substrate #201, which can correspond to a metal material that can form a durable oxide, such as aluminum or aluminum alloy.   In some embodiments, the metal substrate is treated such that portions #202 are oxidized to a corresponding non-electrically conductive metal oxide material. Non-conductive portions #202 can be formed through an entire thickness of metal substrate #201, and can surround metal portions #204 such that metal portions are electrically isolated from one another. Metal portions #204 can be arranged in a predetermined pattern, such as an array or grid. For example, metal portions #204 can be arranged in accordance with a sensor array with each metal portion #204 corresponding to a position of a sensor. Non-conductive portions #202 electrically isolate each metal portion #204 such that the sensor array can function independently. In some embodiments, metal portions #204 can function as button sensors.   Possible Future iPhone Antenna Locations   The last example relates to a possible future iPhone that integrates different antenna locations and/or shapes.   Apple's patent FIG. 5 illustrated below shows us a perspective view of substrate #500 after undergoing an oxidizing process. The substrate can be part of an enclosure for an electronic device, such as a mobile telephone. The substrate includes metal portions 502, 504, 506, 508 separated by intervening metal oxide portions 510, 512, 514.   Metal oxide portions 510, 512, 514 can be electrically non-conductive and RF transparent. Thus, in some embodiments, metal oxide portions 510, 512, 514 can serve as RF windows or RF transparent segments/lines.   Metal oxide material can have a different appearance than metal. In particular, metal oxide material can have a more translucent quality compared to metal.   In some applications, it is desirable for intervening metal oxide portions 510, 512, 514 to appear similar to metal portions 502, 504, 506, 508. Thus, in some embodiments, metal oxide portions 510, 512, 514 can be dyed or colorized to appear similar in color to metal portions 502, 504, 506, 508.   Apple's patent application 20160302319, which surfaced at the U.S. Patent Office on October 13, 2016  was filed by Apple back in Q4 2015. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office.

Instead, he's focused on the rest of the world right now. The recent shutdowns Both Disney and Apple were forced to shut down their online services earlier this year after new regulations went into effect limiting online delivery of foreign content. Disney had to ditch its DisneyLife streaming service, which offers access to its catalog of Disney films, television, music, and books. The service was online for just five months before Chinese regulators shut it down -- customers who bought a yearlong subscription have been reimbursed. Apple, meanwhile, was forced to shut down its iTunes Movies and iBooks stores to comply with the new regulations. The digital media stores were also short-lived, opening just six months prior to the new regulations taking effect. Considering that Netflix's global strategy relies on its growing amount of original content for which it owns global rights, an entry into China with its current regulations isn't going to work. Netflix would have to develop a whole new service with local content, and even then, it's no guarantee it will get government approval. The importance of China Perhaps the most significant part of China's shutdowns of both Apple and Disney's online services is that both companies have a significant presence in the country already. Disney recently opened a theme park in Shanghai, spending $5.5 billion on the park's development. The company estimates that there are 330 million people within a three-hour radius who also have the financial means to come to the park. It's a big bet on the growing Chinese middle class. What's more, Disney movies have proven popular in China. Zootopia, Captain America: Civil War, and The Jungle Book are among the top 10 highest-grossing films for the year in China. The opening of Shanghai Disneyland could help reinforce Disney's success at the box office. Apple, meanwhile, generated 25% of its revenue from Greater China last year. It became the company's second-largest market in sales last year, but it may cede that position back to Europe this year. The value in China is huge. Box office spending in the country could eclipse the U.S. by next year. What's more, the average person in China is spending more and more on entertainment every year. Indeed, missing out on China is a big blow for Netflix. Focusing on what it can control "We're focused on the rest of the world," Hastings told the audience at the TechFest. Netflix is investing heavily in content for international markets including both global licenses and local content. Additionally, it's producing content in local languages for several key markets and, next year, the company plans to spend even more than its 2016 budget of $6 billion. Hastings' focus is on driving subscriber growth. While most analysts understand the strategy, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft recently called into question the consensus estimate for Netflix's cash-flow expectations in light of its aggressive investments in international content rights. He doesn't see Netflix producing positive cash flow until 2020, whereas most analysts are projecting positive cash flow in 2020. As long as subscribers continue to pour in from international markets, Netflix is in a strong position to prove the value of its product and eventually slow content investment and raise prices. Being locked out of the valuable Chinese market will make the task more difficult, but there's still plenty of potential throughout the rest of the world. Adam Levy owns shares of Apple.

(Liz Zabel/The Gazette) Liz Zabel The Gazette More stories from Liz Oct 15, 2016 at 12:00 pm | Print View Paul Rasch is an expert in apples. A fourth-generation orcharder and now chief apple officer and owner of Wilson’s Orchard near Iowa City, Rasch, 57, has been in the apple business his entire life. He grew up farming apples for commercial production on his family farm in Michigan. But with the rise of big-box and supermarket chains in the 1990s, “farmers were getting squeezed,” he said. Stores wanted better quality apples but didn’t want to pay any more for them and “a lot of guys went out of business,” he said. “You just couldn’t make any money.” Thinking he’d escape the business, Rasch studied political science at Oberlin College in Ohio, but was pulled back in after living in India where he planted apples as a rural development project. “Life has a way of roping you into stuff that you don’t anticipate,” he said. “It’s in your blood somehow.” In 1993, Rasch took his apple business to Tianjin, China, where he started a juicing company called Great Lakes Fresh Foods & Juice Company Ltd. He ran the business in China for more than a decade before selling it to Del Monte and moving to Iowa City in 2006. At the time, Wilson’s Orchard was still owned by Robert ‘Chug’ Wilson, who first planted the orchard in 1982. But as Chug’s health declined as he grew older, Rasch began renting and running the orchard, eventually purchasing it in 2009. Chug “had an unswerving devotion to great taste,” Rasch said, explaining he had planted varieties that wouldn’t have been found in supermarkets. “He planted the Honeycrisp before anybody knew it was going to be a great apple. ... Now it’s like cocaine to people,” Rasch said. “Close to half of our sales are Honeycrisp — there’s no way to plant enough.” Even the beavers and Japanese beetles go crazy for it, he said. “There’s just something about that variety that’s magnetic.” Honeycrisps aren’t the only great-tasting apple at the orchard, however, with more than 130 varieties planted over nearly 100 acres — including “antique” varieties you’d find in your great-grandmother’s apple pie recipe to modern ones concocted by university fruit breeding programs. Some are perfect for off-the-tree eating, while others are best for saucing, juicing or baking. Varieties ripen from the beginning of August through late October. “The thing about apples is every apple has its season,” Rasch said. “People are so used to getting whatever they want when they want it. ... They’ve got to broaden their horizons a little bit.” Using Honeycrisps again as an example, Rasch explained that the variety out of season “tastes like a dang potato.” That’s why out-of-season and unripe apples you might find at the supermarket don’t taste like they do when freshly picked. That’s a difference the Wilson’s experience offers. “We’re dedicated to seasonality. When Honeycrisp season is over that doesn’t mean the world shuts down. There’s other great apples you can eat that you’ll probably enjoy more if you open your mind a little bit,” Rasch said. “Us apple snobs prefer apples like Gold Rush,” he continued, noting the “crunchy, complex flavor” of his favorite late-season apple. From the crack of dawn to sunset and sometimes later — especially during the busy fall season — Rasch buzzes around the orchards like a bee, sampling apples to ensure customers get the perfect pick. But that’s not all Rasch does. In fact, much of his days are spent putting out figurative fires, being tapped on the shoulder or called every few minutes for guidance on one of the orchard’s many ongoing projects. In addition to their U-pick operation of apples and pumpkins, Wilson’s commercial orchard churns out apples for grocery stores, apple cider, pies, turnovers, doughnuts, apple chips, hard cider, vinegar, jams and more. Perhaps the most demanding project of late is construction of Rapid Creek Cidery, which Rasch hopes to open to the public next year. When Rasch took over Wilson’s, he never expected it would grow as much as it has. “I thought we’d just have a little U-pick operation,” Rasch said. “But I’m a little restless. ... It’s kind of a hobby that went bad. It got away from me a little bit. But it’s fun. You just gotta go with the flow.” Your next People & Places articles Poinsettia sale benefits kids battling d ...

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « There may be Proof that a Virtual Home Button may be introduced in Next Year's Anniversary iPhone | Main | The Invention behind the Integrated Antenna Lines in Current & Future iPhones Surface » October 15, 2016 Apple Sued by Tennessee Woman for Overheated Phone 6 scarring her Breast   Court documents show that Apple was sued this week by a woman in Nashville for having her breast scarred by her overheated iPhone 6. There's no background of the Plaintiff in the Court document other than her name being Stacie Reasonover. The Plaintiff does in her closing, however, ask the court to be compensated for "loss of wages and/or earning capacity" because of her disfigurement which includes a scar on her right breast due to the overheated iPhone. Unless her job requires her to wear attire exposing her breast, it's difficult to understand how a burn on her breast would hurt her employment. In the end, how the burn occurred is likely where the heart of the case will be focused on by Apple legal. How Apple could be blamed for this incident is very difficult to understand, but that's what courts are for.   According to the filed complaint, on or about October 19, 2015, Stacie Reasonover (The Plaintiff) was using her iPhone 6-Plus when she drifted off to sleep causing the phone to collapse against her chest. Plaintiff's iPhone 6 Plus overheated after it collapsed against her chest.   As a result of the overheating process, Reasonover suffered serious injuries and permanent scarring to her right breast. She did nothing to cause the iPhone device to overheat.   Reasonover was using the iPhone device as intended by the manufacturer and Apple manufactured the device that caused Plaintiff's injuries.   Reasonover's iPhone 6 Plus device had not been altered or otherwise manipulated in any manner as of the purchase date from Apple.   The medical expenses incurred by Reasonover due to the negligent acts or omissions of Apple are reasonable and necessary medical expenses.   Count 1: Strict Liability – Defect in Design   In Count 1, the Plaintiff Reasonover states that Apple (Defendant) manufactured, assembled, inspected, and constructed the product described herein which contained a defective condition because the design was defective and unsafe.   This design defect made the product unreasonably dangerous.   The iPhone 6 Plus device as manufactured and assembled by Defendant remained unchanged and was in the same condition at the time of the injury hereafter alleged.   The defective condition was present at the time it left the control of Defendant.   As a direct and proximate cause of Defendant's assembly and manufacture of the defectively designed product, Plaintiff sustained permanent injury and scarring.   Count 2: Negligent Design and/or Maintenance   In Count 2, Reasonover (The Plaintiff) states that Apple built and sold the iPhone 6 Plus device that had a defective design or was defectively maintained. Apple owed a duty to the Plaintiff that the iPhone 6 Plus device was designed and maintained in such a way that it was safe for its intended purpose.   Apple knew or should have known when manufacturing or assembling this iPhone 6 Plus device that it was designed defectively, creating an unreasonable risk of serious injury with respect to issues of overheating during periods of use and/or inactivity.   As a direct and proximate cause of Apple's breach, Reasonover sustained serious and permanent injury.   Apple's conduct in manufacturing and assembling a defective iPhone 6 Plus device constituted an unreasonably dangerous activity which exposed Plaintiff to an unreasonable risk of harm.   Apple is liable to Reasonover for all damages, harms and losses as a result of creating an unsafe and dangerous product and condition.   Reasonover asks the Court she be awarded a judgment against Apple for compensatory damages in the amount to be determined by the trier of fact to compensate the Plaintiff for medical expenses, pain and suffering, permanent impairment / disfigurement, loss of capacity for the enjoyment of life, loss of wages and/or earning capacity and discretionary costs in this cause.   The personal injury/product liability case presented in today's report was filed in the Tennessee Middle District Court, Nashville office. The Presiding Judge in this case is noted as being Judge Todd J. Campbell.   About Comments: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit comments.

Ogg October 15, 2016 11:35 am EST Print Email Tweet The week of October 14 was a volatile one, considering how there has been a lack of volatility most of the summer. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) ended the week down roughly 102 points at 18,138.38. Still, investors have become prone to buying their favorite stocks any time the market sells off. High valuations, and even the notion that this bull market is now seven and a half years old, have not thwarted investor appetites. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each morning, and this ends up being hundreds of analyst calls each week. Our goal is to find new investing and trading ideas for our readers. Some of these reports cover stocks to buy that are blue chip stocks. When investors hear the word “blue chip” it generally means DJIA stocks with solid dividends. Sometimes this also refers to former Dow stocks, or stocks that might become Dow stocks. Here, we stick by the traditional Dow stocks. Here were six solid Buy ratings (which includes equivalent Outperform or Overweight ratings) issued in the blue chips during the week of October 14. Just remember: sometimes analysts are wrong, and even the great blue chip stocks come with no guarantees. Apple Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been on a serious recovery. The iPhone maker is winning from Samsung’s smartphone recall and cancellation, and Apple finished up 3.1% this week at $117.66, for a 13% gain so far in 2016. It turns out that multiple analysts raised their targets, either on share price targets or on their estimates for sales and earnings. 24/7 Wall St. tracked several major analyst calls this last week, with Credit Suisse even calling for $150 per share next year, and it even shows a trend of more upgraded estimates the prior week as well. Apple has a 52-week trading range of $89.47 to $123.82, and it has a Thomson Reuters consensus analyst price target of $127.59. Most investors do not buy Apple for its yield, but the company is buying back stock rapidly, and it still comes with almost a 2% dividend yield to boot. Caterpillar It would appear that Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) is in a stealth turnaround. The company’s numbers are still bad, and the trends look in decline from prior growth years. Still, sometimes the investing community treats value and serious stock sell-offs differently. Amazingly, Caterpillar is the top performing Dow stock of 2016, with a gain of 33% so far this year, and it still pays a 3.5% dividend yield. Caterpillar was raised to Buy from Neutral with a $112 price target at Goldman Sachs on October 11. The prior close was $88.22, and Caterpillar ended the week at $87.67. Its 52-week range is $56.36 to $89.87, and its consensus analyst target is $77.37. Investors need to consider that this is the highest analyst target of all now, and Goldman Sachs expects margin expansion and an earnings recovery much greater than investors have expected. Merck While Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) remains close to a 52-week high, investors should not overlook the fact that it is up 20.5% so far in 2016. Merrill Lynch raised its rating on the stock to Buy from Neutral on October 13. Its price objective was raised to $70 from $57 as well, and that is above the $67.79 consensus target. Note that the Merrill Lynch call is based on compelling data for its Keytruda first line lung cancer drug. The firm sees it becoming the standard of care and having 25% share. Merck has a 52-week trading range of $47.97 to $64.86, and its dividend yield is right a 3%. Nike Nike Inc. (NYSE: NKE) has been down and out in 2016, logging the worst performance this year of all 30 Dow stocks with close to a 17% negative return. That isn’t the growth engine we were used to. After the latest earnings report offered disappointing futures sales, Susquehanna decided that enough is enough. The firm raised Nike’s rating to Positive from Neutral on October 11, and it assigned a $63 price target too. The prior closing price was $51.79. The consensus price target now is $63.71, though Thomson Reuters showed a consensus of closer to $67 just 90 days ago. Nike close out the week at $51.62 a share, and its 52-week range is $51.48 to $68.19. The dividend yield is currently only 1.25%, but the company has much more room to grow that payout in the years ahead. Procter & Gamble It may still be a boring blue chip in consumer products, but Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) just keeps chugging along. Now it has a brand sale under its belt in the long road of restructuring into a slimmer and more core-focused company. Independent research firm Argus came out swinging here, saying that the street is grossly undervaluing the growth prospects and underestimating its value. Argus raised the stock to a Buy from Hold on October 12, and it assigned a $103 price target as well. This target compared with a prior close of $88.54, as well as a 52-week trading range of $73.50 to $90.33. The consensus price target at Thomson Reuters is $92.28. Procter & Gamble still comes with an impressive 4% dividend yield, and it has been among the few 50-year dividend gainers and likely will keep raising that payout ahead.

By Sean Portnoy for Laptops & Desktops | October 15, 2016 -- 16:34 GMT (09:34 PDT) | Topic: Laptops Acer Swift 7 If Apple is searching for another reason why its share of the PC market has recently declined -- besides aging hardware -- it should take a look at the Windows competition. While those laptops may lack the cachet of the Mac name, they've clearly caught up in the look-and-feel department. cnet Best Budget Laptops Of 2016 The era of the Netbook may be long gone but you can still find their successors. Read More Apple once cornered the market on skinny, chic laptops that were in stark contrast to the boxy ones running Windows. But manufacturers have responded with models that out-svelte MacBooks while managing to include the latest hardware. Six months ago, HP debuted its Spectre laptop, which was just 0.41 inches thick and delivered the luxurious features of an Apple system -- at a MacBook-like starting price of $1,149. At that time, HP touted the Spectre as the world's thinnest notebook. Fast forward to October, and Acer is claiming to steal that title away with its new Swift 7 laptop family. The company has managed to shave 0.02 inches off the height of its chassis, though at 2.48 pounds, it still is slightly heavier than Apple's MacBook (as is the Spectre). Like the Spectre, the Swift 7 is clearly targeting the upscale with its features and design. It may not be as flashy as the Spectre, but Acer's offering has a matte black aluminum exterior with a gold interior. The first available Swift 7 model, the SF713-51-M90J, includes a Core i5-7Y54 Kaby Lake processor, 8GB of RAM, a 256GB solid-state drive, and a full HD 13.3-inch protected by Corning Gorilla Glass. It also comes with MU-MIMO 802.11 ac Wi-Fi for what Acer says is three times faster wireless performance, and the company claims up to 9 hours of battery life for the Swift 7. In addition to being ever-so-thinner, the Swift 7 is slightly less expensive than the similarly spec'd Spectre. The Spectre starts at $1,169.99, and the Acer laptop is now available at $1,099.99. If you're not ready to purchase either one of these now, don't worry: Some other manufacturer will find a way to shave off a fraction of an inch off another new laptop soon enough -- whether it's useful or not.

Rick Munarriz (TMFBreakerRick) Oct 15, 2016 at 10:07AM Image source: Amazon.com. It's hard to stand out in the cutthroat world of premium on-demand music unless your name is Spotify or you have the birthright of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), but Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) may have found a way to crack the code. The leading online retailer unveiled Amazon Music Unlimited on Wednesday, a digital offering that like Spotify and Apple Music gives music buffs ad-free access to a catalog of millions of songs for a monthly ransom.  The service is priced at $9.99 a month, in line with what Apple Music and Spotify Premium charge. The uniformity in pricing makes sense. The major record labels are still waxing nostalgic for the loss of digital download revenue, which in turn wasn't as lucrative as the CD sales that were disrupted. There's no point in being bold enough to call this collusion, but it sure seems like an eerie coincidence that premium on-demand platforms flock to the same price point. However, the reason that Amazon Music Unlimited stands a fighting chance in this seemingly crowded niche with predetermined victors is that it's actually available for less than rival platforms for subscribers of the Amazon Prime loyalty shopping program. Folks who are already paying $10.99 a month or $99 a year for the platform that offers free two-day shipping on Amazon-warehoused goods along with other digital goodies can enjoying Amazon Music Unlimited for just $7.99 a month. Prime numbers Offering its new audio smorgasbord at a 20% discount to rival offerings for Prime subscribers is a shrewd move. It doesn't seem like the first shot of what would otherwise be a long and brutal price war. Record labels can rest easy at $9.99 a month, playing this off as just a promo that's bundled with an already premium-priced subscription program. This is just Amazon subsidizing another digital service for its most active shoppers, something that it has done for years by giving Prime members a growing catalog of online video offerings at no additional cost. However, there are already a lot of Prime shoppers. Amazon has only offered up that there are "tens of millions" but Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that it's now up to 63 million members. That's a pretty big crowd, and when you consider that Prime customers tend to be an affluent lot of web-savvy early adopters -- a well-stocked pond to go fishing for streaming music subscribers -- Amazon has found a way to offer a commoditized product at a discount to the competition. Apple is too worried about restoring margins to their former glory and too bent on high-end consumers to play the cutthroat game. Spotify is too one-dimensional to have anything else to subsidize. Amazon may be late to this niche, but it's in a good position to make up for lost time. Echo chamber Amazon's also introducing a version of Amazon Music Unlimited that costs just $3.99 a month, a great price until you realize that it works only with a single Echo, Echo Dot, or Amazon Tap. This was a silly idea when the rumored offering was first reported two months ago. Outside of hermits, who wouldn't want a service that can go wherever one wanders? However, the $7.99-a-month offering for Prime customers -- something that breaks down to just $6.58 a month for folks paying $79 for an entire year -- is a game changer. Amazon has thrown its hat into a ring where it's hard to stand out, and it's standing out. Rick Munarriz owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Amazon.com and Apple.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 15, 2016 at 8:35AM Image source: Apple.  Whenever Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) releases new flagship smartphones, the prior-generation models are usually discounted by $100. This effectively makes last year's Apple flagship into this year's mid-range offering, allowing Apple to participate at a wider range of price points than it would have otherwise been able to. This strategy has worked reasonably well for Apple as its flagship devices tend to be advanced enough to successfully inhabit those mid-range price points but not so advanced so as to diminish the value proposition of the flagship model. Although the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus were disappointing sellers as flagships (Apple saw its first-ever iPhone sales decline during this product cycle), as this year's mid-range offerings, they are probably the most competitive products that Apple has ever had at these price points. iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus still competitive with Android flagships In prior generations, it'd have been hard to make the case that Apple's previous generation phones were, in meaningful ways, superior to flagship devices from major Android-based competitors. However, this year it's not a hard case to make at all. The A9 processor inside of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus offers better single/dual core CPU performance than what can be found in any other Android smartphone according to the Geekbench 4 performance test (Android flagships have the A9 beaten on multicore performance, but per-core performance is generally more important for the user experience). Both the iPhone 6S and the iPhone 6S Plus also incorporate Apple's 3D Touch functionality. Similar technologies have begun to pop up in a few Android smartphones, but the major flagships from well-known brands such as Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), LG, and HTC have yet to incorporate a similar feature (though I suspect they will in due time). Apple also wisely opted to increase the amount of storage that it offers in these price-reduced iPhone 6S devices. The base iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus models now come with 32 gigabytes of storage and 128 gigabytes in the higher price tier. Those storage increases, coupled with the price cuts, should dramatically improve the value propositions of these former-flagships-turned-mid-range phones. The iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus aren't ahead of current Android flagships in every respect, though. The iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus are behind in terms of display resolution, cellular performance, and the cameras. That being said, the fact that Apple's year-old flagships are as competitive as they are could help the company gain some share at lower price points against the Android makers. iPhone 7 and 7 Plus should hold up extremely well I believe that this year's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are much more competitive as flagship devices than the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus were when they were Apple's top devices. Assuming that Apple's competitors don't advance their phones at a quicker pace than they did in between the iPhone 6S and iPhone 7, then I could actually see the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus holding up even better against Android flagships post-iPhone 8 launch than the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus are now. And, for Apple, gaining smartphone share while keeping its average selling prices healthy (Apple's mid-range phones start at $549) is critical to allowing its iPhone business to deliver profitable growth. Increasingly strong mid-range offerings should allow Apple to do just that.  Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

(Reuters/Issei Kato) Share Written by Marc Bain October 15, 2016 Jet black has been one of the most popular new colors for the iPhone 7 ever since it first went on sale in mid-September. Despite it being incredibly easy to scratch, its popularity meant it quickly sold out, leaving many buyers waiting to get their fix. But according to iStockNow, which tracks the in-store availability of iPhones in real-time, it’s now back in stock at most Apple stores around the US. The site offers a handy map showing the locations of Apple stores and which phones they have in stock. You can sort by phone model, carrier, color, and storage capacity. A quick search for stores carrying the jet-black iPhone 7 shows that numerous locations around the US and Canada have the phone back in stock. (You can check for other colors, too, if you want.) Quartz spot-checked several of the results against Apple’s website, which allows you to determine if a certain phone model is available in-store. In each instance, Apple’s website confirmed iStockNow’s data. Availability of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in jet black, as of the morning of Oct. 15 (Screen capture of iStockNow) Not every store has every version of the jet-black phone though, so check for the specific model you want before making the pilgrimage. (Apple also recommends reserving one for pick-up via their website.) Availability varies depending on which phone you want—the iPhone 7 or the iPhone 7 Plus—carrier, and storage capacity. If you’re one of the many anxious shoppers who have been waiting to get your hands on a shiny black new iPhone, now may be your chance. But be quick: Going by their previous popularity, the stores’ stock levels are likely to quickly deplete. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

You are here Home / Life / Gear & Tech Should Fit Guys Buy the New Apple Watch Nike+? It’ll be available on 10/28—here’s why you should consider getting in line. by Men's Fitness Editors 1 / 5 The first iteration of the Apple Watch offered athletes features like GPS tracking (via your phone), calorie burn tracking, and heart rate monitoring. Speaking of heart rate, a brand new study just compared the Apple Watch to three other wrist worn heart rate monitoring devices and it was deemed most effective (it tied with the Mio Fuse). Will The Apple Watch Save Your Life? >>> Still, the newly-launched Apple Watch Series 2 made us want to upgrade. Now with built-in GPS, you don’t have to take your phone along—and it’s water-resistant up to 50 meters, meaning you can swim with it (great news for triathletes!) You can also now see all your stats together on one screen rather than having to keep swiping to see miles run, calories burned, heart rate, time, etc. What's more, you can share your workout data with friends for a little extra motivation in the form of friendly—or not-so-friendly—competition to get in the most activity. Now, the company has just announced they’ll release the Apple Watch Nike + on October 28th—and we think runners around the world are going to be queuing up to buy ‘em. In addition to all the features of the Series 2, the Nike + version has a few more bells and whistles of interest to fit guys (and girls) in particular. For one, the band itself is lighter and made with compression-molded perforations for breathability (see photo above). (That means no salty sweat streaks on the back of your band like you may have experienced with the traditional band.) 5 Things We Wish the Apple Watch Could Do >>> You’ll also be able to customize the watch face with Nike’s green “volt” color and logo. The Nike+ Run Club also has its own complication on the watch so you can share workouts with friends, set run reminders, see all your data—and more.

It seems Apple’s production of both the larger iPhone 7 model and the new color option are finally catching up to demand, as many of Apple‘s US retail locations are showing they have units on hand — at least for the time being. The handy website iStockNow combines Google Maps with backend data from Apple’s reservation system to offer a near real-time visualization of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus’ availability across the country. As of the start of this weekend, the iPhone 7 Plus in Jet Black is showing up as in-stock at a majority of Apple Stores, and in many big cities as well, including Los Angeles, Chicago, San Diego, New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. Of course, a store’s exact availability depends on the color and storage size of the device you want, not to mention the carrier needed — then again, you now have the option of buying an unlocked iPhone 7. Also, it’s best to call your local store or even place a reservation on Apple’s website before you go there in person, just to double-check. While this appears to be one of the best chances for customers to find a Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus in-store since launch, be sure to keep an eye on iStockNow if you can’t pick one up this weekend. The website allows users to conduct a search for a specific iPhone 7 model and filter results by color, size, and carrier, as well as view a specific store’s availability and the last time their stock was updated.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 15, 2016 at 8:35AM Image source: Apple.  Whenever Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) releases new flagship smartphones, the prior-generation models are usually discounted by $100. This effectively makes last year's Apple flagship into this year's mid-range offering, allowing Apple to participate at a wider range of price points than it would have otherwise been able to. This strategy has worked reasonably well for Apple as its flagship devices tend to be advanced enough to successfully inhabit those mid-range price points but not so advanced so as to diminish the value proposition of the flagship model. Although the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus were disappointing sellers as flagships (Apple saw its first-ever iPhone sales decline during this product cycle), as this year's mid-range offerings, they are probably the most competitive products that Apple has ever had at these price points. iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus still competitive with Android flagships In prior generations, it'd have been hard to make the case that Apple's previous generation phones were, in meaningful ways, superior to flagship devices from major Android-based competitors. However, this year it's not a hard case to make at all. The A9 processor inside of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus offers better single/dual core CPU performance than what can be found in any other Android smartphone according to the Geekbench 4 performance test (Android flagships have the A9 beaten on multicore performance, but per-core performance is generally more important for the user experience). Both the iPhone 6S and the iPhone 6S Plus also incorporate Apple's 3D Touch functionality. Similar technologies have begun to pop up in a few Android smartphones, but the major flagships from well-known brands such as Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), LG, and HTC have yet to incorporate a similar feature (though I suspect they will in due time). Apple also wisely opted to increase the amount of storage that it offers in these price-reduced iPhone 6S devices. The base iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus models now come with 32 gigabytes of storage and 128 gigabytes in the higher price tier. Those storage increases, coupled with the price cuts, should dramatically improve the value propositions of these former-flagships-turned-mid-range phones. The iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus aren't ahead of current Android flagships in every respect, though. The iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus are behind in terms of display resolution, cellular performance, and the cameras. That being said, the fact that Apple's year-old flagships are as competitive as they are could help the company gain some share at lower price points against the Android makers. iPhone 7 and 7 Plus should hold up extremely well I believe that this year's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are much more competitive as flagship devices than the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus were when they were Apple's top devices. Assuming that Apple's competitors don't advance their phones at a quicker pace than they did in between the iPhone 6S and iPhone 7, then I could actually see the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus holding up even better against Android flagships post-iPhone 8 launch than the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus are now. And, for Apple, gaining smartphone share while keeping its average selling prices healthy (Apple's mid-range phones start at $549) is critical to allowing its iPhone business to deliver profitable growth. Increasingly strong mid-range offerings should allow Apple to do just that.  Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

(Image: Siddharth Safaya/ News18.com) Apple iPhone, a smartphone that needs no introduction. Since its inception in 2007 it has continued to woo its fans from around the world irrespective of what tech experts and reviewers have to say about it. The iPhone has seen its ups and downs but still continues to be one of the most potent smartphones in the world despite the influx of good android smartphones. This year Apple introduced the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The iPhone 7 really does not have much to offer in terms of experience for users to upgrade from the iPhone 6S. The 7 Plus, however, packs a punch. With the 256GB storage version of the iPhone 7 Plus priced at Rs 92,000, we put it to test and tell you whether it really gives you the bang for your buck or not.

Yes, it’s no longer there. But Apple is not ignorant of the fact that users still use them. They bundle the lightning to 3.5mm connector inside the box. All Apple wants from you is not to lose it. Moreover, it’s an evolutionary change, just like how Android phones will be getting you CDLA headphones in future. And the audio quality is way better on the lightning connector than a 3.5mm audio jack. Apple iPhone 7 Plus comes with lightning to 3.5mm audio jack inside the box. (Image: Siddharth Safaya/ News18.com) The iPhone 7 Plus comes in two new colours - the Real Black and the Jet black. If you wish to buy the new iPhone these are the only colours to go for. The bigger iPhone 7 Plus is lighter too at 188 grams, compared to the iPhone 6S Plus, which weighed 192 grams. Apple has tinkered around with the design of the iPhone 7 Plus too. It’s smooth and it no longer has a home button. The new taptic engine used on the iPhone 7 Plus makes the home button feel unique. Many who are accustomed to the earlier home button would find the experience refreshing. Apple Macbook users will just love it. The new taptic engine will give you a PlayStation controller type gaming experience with vibrations and feedback that are quite intuitive.

The iPhone 7 Plus is thin at just 6.9mm and packs in a large 5.5-inch IPS LCD touchscreen display with 1080 X 1920 resolution and 401ppi pixel density. It’s a similar display that you get on the 6S Plus. You get a wide colour gamut on the display and, of course, last year’s revolutionary 3D-Touch. The touchscreen is more responsive than what you got on the iPhone 6S Plus and it’s mainly because of many hardware and the iOS 10 factors in play. Apple iPhone 7 Plus in its Jet Black colour. (Image: Siddharth Safaya/ News18.com) The Touch ID for your fingerprints is also more responsive and fast thanks to iOS 10. The iPhone 7 Plus also comes with stereo speaker that offer loudness and clarity while watching videos on the device. 2016 can be regarded as the year of dual-camera smartphones and Apple also gave into it. Apple iPhone 7 Plus packs in a dual-camera system. There are two 12-megapixel cameras with f/1.8 and f/2.8 apertures. The camera also packs optical image stabilisation, phase detection autofocus, two times optical zoom and quad-LED flash. Apple iPhone 7 Plus. (Image: Siddharth Safaya/ News18.com) There are two sensors at the back: one is a 1/3" sensor @ 28mm and another is a 1/3.6" sensor @ 56mm. Both of them work in tandem and deliver great levels of detailing in the images that you click. The iPhone 7 Plus is also capable of shooting videos at 2160p@30fps. Now one trick that is yet to roll out on the camera of the iPhone 7 Plus is the portrait mode. This mode is available in beta right now. When it is publically rolled out, you’ll be able to click images like these. Image Shot on Apple iPhone 7 Plus. (Image:News18.com) Image Shot on Apple iPhone 7 Plus. (Image: News18.com) Image Shot on Apple iPhone 7 Plus. (Image: News18.com) The camera on the iPhone 7 Plus is able to capture more light, details and colours that result in amazing images even in low light. The colour on the images are natural and realistic, unlike many Android smartphones that give you saturated colours. Upfront the iPhone 7 Plus has a 7-megapixel, f/2.2 camera, that has face detection and HDR mode. Apple has integrated body detection, wide colour capture and auto-image stabilization on the front camera now. The results are twice as good as what you got on the iPhone 6S Plus’ front camera. The front-facing camera records in 1080p, while the rear can handle 4K videos. Apple iPhone 7 Plus' 3D-touch. (Image: Siddharth Safaya/ News18.com) Despite the redesign and being thinner than the iPhone 6S Plus, Apple iPhone 7 packs in a 2900mAh battery. The battery life is significantly improved and you will not find yourself looking for a charging cable by evening. The battery management on the iPhone 7 Plus is impressive and after a full charge, it does last for more than a day and a half. We used it extensively and by 8PM every day it still had more than 50% juice left in it. What’s Not So Cool? It’s not all well with the iPhone 7 Plus, though. It is one of the most potent premium 5.5-inch smartphone in the market right now but, if you buy it in the jet black colour, make sure you put it in a cover. The back is shiny which makes it slippery and prone to fingerprint smudges. It’s also not scratch-proof. Our advice to you would be to skip the Jet black colour on the iPhone 7 Plus and buy the matte finish Real Black one instead. Also Read | Apple iPhone 7 Review: The Newest Flagship Is Just Fine, Even If It Doesn't Wow Competitors Apple is not a company that believes in an ‘i’ for an ‘i’ approach. Many do compare iPhones to Android phones. The comparison here is not just on hardware but also on the user experience. Similar things and tasks can be done on both an iPhone and an Android device. What one spends for, is the seamless user experience and secured data. The closest competitor to the iPhone 7 Plus could have been the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, but it was busy exploding in the year 2016. So, for people looking to buy a premium 5.5-inch smartphone, the iPhone 7 Plus is the only option for now. And, we will be getting you a comparison between the iPhone 7 Plus and Google Pixel XL very soon. Apple iPhone 7 Plus. (Image: Siddharth Safaya/ News18.com) Verdict Many years ago, Apple had an advertising campaign that said, ‘If you don’t have an iPhone, you DON’T have an iPhone’. This, in 2016, holds true for the iPhone 7 Plus. They have offered some features that are new and have also improved things that worked seamlessly in the first place. The iPhone 7 Plus is a worthy upgrade to the iPhone 6S Plus and probably the only phone that will give you a hassle-free user experience. Starting at the price tag of Rs 72,000 for the 32GB storage version, the iPhone 7 Plus is not an affordable phone at all and many will say that you get an Android phone for less. But as the saying goes, good things never come cheap, and if you haven’t witnessed the experience on an iPhone 7 Plus, you haven’t really witnessed what a real smartphone is. iPhone 7 Plus Specifications: Display: 5.5-inch LED-backlit IPS LCD 3D Touch Display Home Button With New Taptic Engine Processor: Apple A10 Fusion CPU: 2.33 GHz Quad-core GPU: Six-core Graphics Operating System: Apple iOS 10 Storage: 32GB, 128GB and 256GB Camera: Dual 12 MP Camera Lens: 28mm, f/1.8, OIS & 56mm, f/2.8 Camera Features: 2X Optical Zoom, Slow-motion, 2160p@30fps Video, quad-LED Flash Front Camera: 7 MP, f/2.2 Audio: Stereo Speakers Lacks a 3.5mm Audio Jack Lightning to 3.5mm Connector Included New Colours: Real Black and Jet Black iPhone 7Plus Price: Rs 72,000 (32GB); Rs 82,000 (128GB); Rs 92,000 (256GB) Apple iPhone 7 Apple iPhone 7 Plus Apple iPhone 7 Plus India dual camera Trending Articles First Laughter, Now Tears: Rahul Gandhi Takes a Dig at PM's Speeches Swamy Lashes Out at Finance Ministry, Says Demonetisation Poorly Planned Stop Treating People Like Criminals: Shiv Sena Tells Aurn Jaitley Demonetisation: Queues get Longer at Banks, ATMs Trending Articles First Laughter, Now Tears: Rahul Gandhi Takes a Dig at PM's Speeches Swamy Lashes Out at Finance Ministry, Says Demonetisation Poorly Planned Stop Treating People Like Criminals: Shiv Sena Tells Aurn Jaitley Demonetisation: Queues get Longer at Banks, ATMs Koffee With Karan: 10 Times Twinkle Was The Queen of Wit and Sass On The Show Bigg Boss 10, Day 27: Salman Khan Questions Rahul, Rohan and Karan's Lethargic Attitudes Deepika-Ranbir Attend KJo's Party, Farhan-Shraddha Host Rock On!!

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Samsung's Note 7 is Officially Banned from All U.S. Flights beginning Oct 15 with Violators Risking Prosecution | Main | Apple Sued by Tennessee Woman for Overheated Phone 6 scarring her Breast » October 15, 2016 There may be Proof that a Virtual Home Button may be introduced in Next Year's Anniversary iPhone   Last month Patently Apple posted a report titled "The iPhone 7 is Proving Wildly Popular, but its new Haptics-Based Home Button is a Real Miss." The report basically covered John Gruber's review of the iPhone 7 and his distain for Apple's new Haptics based Home Button. After testing it out myself at my Local Apple Store, I had to agree with Gruber. I stated that I wished Apple would give users the option to turn off the haptics of the Home Button. Who needs them anyways. I want the functionality of the Home Button but don't need a click, a clunk, shake rattle or roll. Apple has discussed a virtual home button solution (one and two); a solution that could come our way as early as next year's iPhone so when the iPhone is turned off, there is no Home Button to see. It would only appear as a virtual button on the screen when the iPhone is on.   To confirm that this is actually being considered by Apple we only need to view the photo below of Apple's new notice regarding a problem with the haptics-based Home Button. The photo was posted in MacRumors forum by iwayne.   In the photo Apple provides a virtual onscreen home button as a work around until the iPhone could be serviced. But once again, who needs a haptics based home button anyways? A nice quite non-haptics home button would be just fine. This is the option that I was hoping for, but unfortunately it only pops up if there's a problem with the haptics-based home button as noted below. That's too bad, because it should be an official option. It's enough of an annoyance for me that I'll wait for Apple's home button solution next year.   Though at the end of the day, iwayne's photo noted below is a winner and definitely shows us what could be coming our way in next year's anniversary iPhone.     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

(Photo: Jefferson Graham, USA TODAY) Q. When I search for old events on my Mac in Sierra’s Calendar app, it doesn’t show anything older than about two years. What’s going on here? A. That’s a glitch in Apple’s new macOS Sierra, also known as version 10.12, and we seem to have been the first to bring it to the attention of the company’s developers. (You’re welcome.) The behavior in question happens when you type a search into the Calendar app for an event that happened more than two years ago: You won’t see it. For example, the CES electronics gathering has been on my schedule every year since 1998 —something one could regard as a cry for help — but in Sierra, Calendar only shows the 2015 and 2016 shows. This happens whether you have your calendars saved on your Mac or synced from a service like Google. But as a post in Apple’s tech-support forum noted, if you try the same search in Sierra’s Spotlight search, you’ll see those older items — but with much less detail visible, and mixed into a list of results from every other app on your Mac. My query to Apple PR yielded an explanation that Sierra’s version of this app, intentionally or not, had picked up on the way Calendar has treated recurring events in searches. Going back to at least last year’s El Capitan release, this program would only show the last two and the next two years’ instances of a repeating event. That makes sense for recurring appointments — who needs to see that you have New Year’s Day on your schedule from now until the end of time? But for separate appointments that have the same title, it’s less than helpful. Apple says it will fix this in an upcoming update to Sierra, although it’s too soon to say how soon. The first patch for Sierra is already in a fourth round of beta testing, so I would not expect this fix to ship with that upcoming “10.12.1” release. Meanwhile, don’t forget that you have alternatives to Apple’s software. Most cost money, but since the operating system itself is free, you shouldn’t make that a sticking point. Among Calendar alternatives, Flexibits’ $40 Fantastical seems particularly well-liked: Macworld’s Glenn Fleishman gave it 4.5 stars out of five in his review, and iMore’s Lory Gil gave it the top ranking in an August roundup of calendar apps. You could also use Google Calendar in a Web browser, but staying on top of your schedule when you’re offline won’t be too satisfying. Using a third-party calendar app makes even more sense in Windows 10, where Microsoft’s built-in Calendar app somehow offers zero support for time zones. That invites chaotic scheduling once you fly too far east or west. The best-liked alternative in the Windows Store appears to be a free app called OneCalendar — but that, too, doesn’t support time zones. If you’ve got a replacement in mind that will let me put different events in different time zones, please submit your nomination in the comments.

  SOFTPEDIA® DESKTOP Windows Games Drivers Mac Linux MOBILE Android APK Phones Tablets WEB Webscripts Web Browsers NEWS Softpedia > News > Reviews > Gadget Reviews FLASH SALE: Driver Booster 4      40% OFF! Apple Watch Series 2 Review GO The original Apple Watch got a facelift… sort of Oct 15, 2016 13:00 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  INTRODUCTION THE SMARTWATCH THE FITNESS TRACKER HARDWARE BATTERY LIFE CONCLUSIONS Apple Watch has quickly become one of the best-selling wearables on the market, with statistics showing that it’s doing well in both the fitness activity tracker and the smartwatch categories. Third-party data shows that Apple Watch is the second best-selling device in combined figures that include smartwatches and activity trackers, after leader Fitbit, while Apple’s own data points to something that’s even more flattering: the Apple Watch is also the second best-selling watch, while Rolex continues to be the leading brand worldwide. The second-generation Apple Watch presented by Cupertino on September 7 during the eagerly-anticipated iPhone 7 launch was supposed to continue the success of the original model and achieve even better sales figures thanks to upgrades that customers have been drooling over for a long time. Apple calls the new model “Apple Watch Series 2,” even though the company could have launched it simply as Apple Watch 2, but given the similarities between the old and the new versions, it probably makes more sense this way. In terms of design, the new Apple Watch is almost exactly the same as its predecessor and it’s basically impossible to tell which one is which when comparing them side by side. The model we've tested and which looks quite exquisite, as you can see for yourselves in the photo gallery below, is the Stainless Steel with Milanese Loop band in 42mm size. Apple Watch Series 2 Digital Crown Hardware Apple claims that the Watch Series 2 comes with substantial hardware upgrades, and while on paper these are very obvious, not the same thing can be said about real-time performance. But let's discuss the hardware for now and scroll down to read more about performance. First and foremost, Apple has upgraded the CPU, just like it does with every new generation of the iPhone. The Watch Series 2 comes with the dual-core S2 chip, whose specs Apple is yet to unveil. Nevertheless, this is a welcome upgrade from the S1 clocked at 520 MHz. The display continues to feature sapphire crystal, which is super tough and durable, and truth be told, we can confirm this is indeed the case after using the first-generation Watch nearly every day since its launch in 2015. Sapphire is also being used on the iPhone 7's camera, so Apple's clearly betting big on this material for durability. The screen, however, got some upgrades too, and Apple says that it's now two times brighter than its predecessor. There's indeed a small difference, especially in direct sunlight, but otherwise, it's very hard to spot. Other than that, there's one major addition to the Apple Watch 2: the GPS sensor. Apple wanted to make the watch work independently from the iPhone, so it comes with a GPS sensor that can monitor your workouts and provide you with information such as route and distance. The GPS can also make the device more accurate, as it can measure distance in a more effective way. Previously, the Apple Watch was using the phone's GPS, when available, to measure distance, but figures were often off target by a big margin. Apple Watch Series 2 sensors The other features are all there, including Bluetooth and Wi-Fi support (wireless networks are being used when the iPhone is connected to the same networks too and Bluetooth is not available). The same sensor lineup continues to be available, including heart rate, gyroscope, accelerometer, and ambient light sensor. One more thing before ending the hardware section: the Apple Watch Series 2 is waterproof, which means that you can finally wear it in the shower and even swim with it because it won't break down. Apple says the Watch can resist in water up to 50 meters deep, and the company also offers some new workout modes for swimming. “Breaking water-ejecting feature.” Waterproofing has been achieved with the same sealing method as on the iPhone 7, with just one exception: the speakers. Because Apple still wanted the Watch to offer crystal clear sound, it used a technology patented in 2014 and which makes it possible for speakers to automatically eject water after a workout using a high-frequency sound that makes the speaker membrane vibrate. Overall, the Watch 2 comes with worthy upgrades, but hardware is not necessarily the star of the show here. The stainless steel version looks super exquisite, feels heavier just like a regular watch, and with the right band, it looks perfect with any outfit. The smartwatch Apple Watch Series 2 comes with watchOS 3.0, a major upgrade for Apple and a small one for users. There are several updates in this new release, but most of them are just minor and are unlikely to make the Apple Watch feel like a completely new product. For example, there's a new Breathe app that's supposed to help you breathe correctly, meditate, and relax, all using instructions that show up on the screen. Interesting, but certainly difficult to become a breaking feature. Additionally, the new OS version also introduces a new face with Minnie Mouse and enables the animated characters to talk the time upon touching the screen. There are some new activity-oriented faces as well, and the companion Apple Watch app on the iPhone comes with a face gallery to let you customize everything from the bigger screen. Apple also claims that the new Watch Series 2 is super fast, but after using it for a few days, it just feels like the original model. You can barely tell the difference between the two and everything seems to be loading exactly the same way on both watches. And yet, watchOS 3.0 doesn't fix some of the biggest annoyances with the Watch and the older version. Apple Watch Series 2 notifications First and foremost, you're still not allowed to configure the way notifications are displayed on your devices. When the Watch is connected, it pulls all notifications and the iPhone is completely dead, and the only way to deal with this is to disable Wrist Detection, which in turn disables some activity tracking. A potential workaround here is to keep the Watch on airplane mode when the iPhone is around you, so alerts will still arrive on your phone. The watch will continue to track your moves, only that it won't buzz on new messages. Then, it's the notification syncing between devices. There are moments when the Apple Watch fails to alert of new notifications, and given the fact that the iPhone doesn't ring because of the aforementioned reason, missing notifications is quite easy. And annoying too. It happened several times during our test to miss notifications just because we weren't aware of them and it most often affects third-party apps such as WhatsApp and Gmail. And last but not least, it's grouping notifications that's utterly annoying. When receiving multiple messages, such as on WhatsApp, a preview is no longer displayed and you're only alerted of new messages on the app with a "Dismiss" button. This isn't happening on Android Wear devices or on Samsung's Tizen, where previews are displayed no matter the number of the same notifications. The other drawbacks of the Apple Watch still exist, though, and there's still no support for third-party faces, which means that customization is kind of limited. There are some new options now, such as Minnie Mouse and other fitness-optimized faces, but support for third-party faces would be a lot more helpful to fight the boredom that many of us are very likely to experience after a while. The fitness tracker In our original Apple Watch review, we complained that the device was more smartwatch and less activity tracker, and although things have improved with the Series 2, it only happened in a rather insignificant way. GPS tracking is certainly a good addition because it can show routes and provide more accurate statistics. Whenever you go for a run, you can leave your iPhone at home because GPS helps the Watch monitor distance, routes, and provide more accurate figures for steps and burned calories. It takes its share of battery, that's true, but this is happening in the case of any other fitness tracker out there. At the same time, the GPS generates mapping data that shows lap times and displays your fastest and slowest zones, helping you to improve in a much more effective way. But that's pretty much all about it. “Swimming? Not there yet.” The swimming support that so many people are praising is just basic and it can hardly impress a professional swimmer. Truth be told, the Apple Watch becomes one of the first devices that's waterproof and comes with support for swimming, but it's really hard to use it if you want to swim on a regular basis. First of all, you have to define the length of the pool, so it can calculate how much you swim. Auto detection would clearly come in handy here and using the other sensors, such as the gyroscope, it can easily calculate the length, but for the moment, such a feature is not available. Then, it can't make a difference between various swimming styles, so no matter how you swim, it still generates the same statistics for distance and burned calories. So basically, what you get is a tracker that doesn't provide you with more than just elapsed times, distance, number of laps, and an estimation of burned calories. The waterproofing, on the other hand, is a little nice feature that certainly comes in handy, not necessarily for swimming, but also for cycling when raining. When it comes to swimming, however, the Watch 2 comes with a neat option to automatically eject the water in the speakers at the end of the workout using high-frequency sounds that make the membrane vibrate. Apple Watch Series 2 info with route generated by GPS sensor Other than that, it's exactly the Apple Watch you know. It comes with rich support for a variety of sports, it lets you set goals for each workout or per day, and thanks to watchOS 3.0, it also supports stats sharing with friends to try to convince you to exercise more. The best thing of all is that the Apple Watch continues to be super comfortable to wear and you won't even feel it on the wrist when exercising. Depending on the band, it can fit pretty much any outfit and given the luxurious look of the Stainless Steel version, you can also wear it even when wearing a suit. Overall, the Apple Watch Series 2 is 90 percent the same as its predecessor and if GPS and waterproofing are really important to you, then it's worth buying. Otherwise, we're not so sure about it. Battery life Apple says the new Watch should be able to provide longer battery life, but the experience pretty much depends on how you use the device. As we've said in our original Apple Watch review, one-day battery life is enough for the majority of customers because most of us recharge their devices during the night, as only a few actually wear them when sleeping to monitor sleep or things like that. And the Apple Watch Series 2 doesn't fall short of Cupertino's promise to offer one day of battery life. If there's an improvement over the first generation, it's only minor and we still got one day and a half (34 hours) per charge at most. “You'll charge it every night anyway.” On the other hand, if you use the new GPS sensor for monitoring workouts, you're not going to achieve the same figures, as this is the main battery hog on the new generation. GPS sensors are battery killers anyway, and the Apple Watch makes no exception. The Apple Watch 2 can be used for approximately 5 hours with GPS turned on and anything beyond that will require a charger. Working out with GPS takes approximately 20 percent per hour, whereas running or cycling without it only uses a few percentage points at most. Without a doubt, most Apple Watch 2 buyers will make use of the GPS sensor because it's there and it provides more advanced stats, so you'd better get used to everyday charging if you want to buy the new model. The bottom line For existing Apple Watch owners, the second generation comes with just two different substantial upgrades: the GPS sensor and the waterproofing. First and foremost, the GPS module is clearly a welcome addition because it provides us with stats that were previously available on devices such as Microsoft Band and Fitbit, but on the other hand, it's nothing that you couldn't live without. If you're running or cycling with the iPhone in your pocket or the backpack, you won't feel such a big difference because the Watch was already using the phone's GPS sensor for more accurate stats. On the other hand, if you want to leave your iPhone at home when working out, the second generation's GPS will certainly come in handy. As far as waterproofing is concerned, it's certainly a welcome addition, not because you can swim with it (because you won't), as the existing implementation of swimming support is still in its early days, but thanks to the fact that you no longer have to be afraid of rain. If you cycle with your Apple Watch on and it starts raining, there are almost zero chances for the new model to break down, so you can safely keep working out no matter what. Are these two features reason enough to spend several hundred dollars on a new Watch? Maybe, but some of those who already have the first-generation model and using it mostly for its smartwatch capabilities might not feel like missing anything. In the end, the number of upgrades and the small differences between the first and the second generation are probably the reason the company didn't launch it as Apple Watch 2. So in the end, yes, Apple Watch Series 2 just makes sense.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (33 Images) #Apple Watch#Apple#Apple Watch review#smartwatch review#Apple review subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Apple Watch Series 2 (33 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news iPhone 7 Plus Review Huawei Honor (MediaPad) X2 Review CHUWI HiBook (Windows 10 and Android) 2-in-1 Review Samsung Gear Fit 2 Review Five Great Calendar Apps for Android HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile: The PC Experience Motorola DROID Turbo 3 with 16MP Hasselblad Camera Leaks in Press Renders New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked Nikon Updates Firmware for Its COOLPIX A300 Camera - Get Version 1.2 Microsoft Releases Interactive Mail Notifications for All Windows 10 Users KDE Neon Users Urged to Upgrade Their Systems or Reinstall the Linux Distro Budgie 11 Desktop Environment to Feature a Dock Mode for the Panel, Richer UI - Exclusive 33 photos    Apple Watch Series 2 Minnie Mouse face New Apps dbMigration .NET: Selectively transfer items between two databases of different types with this intuitive application that supports SQLITE, MDB and SQL items VMware Workstation Player: Run several operating systems simultaneously on the same computer without any conflict by creating virtual machines or importing external images Bandizip: Fast compression and decompression tool with extensive file type support, archive spanning, encryption, multiple compression levels, integrity checker, context menu integration, and more BD Rebuilder: Back up DVD movies and shrink Blu-ray clips, create bulk jobs, configure encoding settings, apply filters, and set post-task actions using this advanced tool for seasoned PC users Batch XLS and XLSX Converter: Simple-to-configure program that helps you convert XLS files to XLSX file format or vice versa, while allowing you to pause or stop the process Type light: Providing you with basic drawing tools, this OpenType font editor enables you to create and edit unique fonts that you can use in various projects gSyncit: An application that enables you to sync your Microsoft Outlook data with various other services around the Internet, such as Google Calendar or Dropbox Reader comments Fitbit Blaze Review - Jack of All Trades, Master of One more on: Fitbit i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

It's already hit a snag: Samsung's deal to acquire Viv Labs, a startup building its own AI voice-based assistant. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)   Mark Bergen Bloomberg     Google just debuted a digital assistant, which it hopes to place inside smartphones, watches, cars and every other imaginable internet-connected device. It's already hit a snag. The Alphabet Inc. division launched new smartphones last week with the artificially intelligent assistant deeply embedded. It also rolled out a speaker with the feature at its core and announced plans to let other companies tie their apps and services to the assistant. A day later, Samsung Electronics Co., one of the largest manufacturers of smartphones and other consumer devices, said it was acquiring Viv Labs, a startup building its own AI voice-based assistant. At first, the deal looked like a counterpunch to Samsung rival Apple -- Viv is run by the creators of Apple's Siri assistant. But buying Viv may be more of a problem for Google, because Samsung is the biggest maker of phones running Google's Android mobile operating system. Google strategy is now centered on the assistant, rather than its search engine, because it's a more natural way for people to interact with smartphones and other connected devices. Getting all Android phone makers to put the Google assistant on their devices would get the technology into millions of hands quickly. But Samsung's Viv deal suggests assistants are too important for phone makers to let other companies supply this feature. Last week, Samsung executive Injong Rhee said the company plans to put Viv's technology in its smartphones next year and then embed it into other electronics and home appliances. A Samsung representative and a Google spokeswoman declined to comment. That's a necessity for Samsung, according to some analysts and industry insiders. "As AI is becoming more sophisticated and valuable to the consumer, there's no question it will be important for hardware companies," said Kirt McMaster, executive chairman of Cyanogen, a startup that makes Android software. McMaster, a frequent Google critic, said other Android handset makers will likely follow Samsung's move. "If you don't have an AI asset, you're not going to have a brain," he added. Google may already have known that some Android phone makers -- known as original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs -- were reluctant to embrace its assistant. "Other OEMs may want to differentiate" Google's Android chief Hiroshi Lockheimer told Bloomberg before it released its own smartphones. "They may want to do their own thing -- their own assistant, for example." Samsung and Google have sparred in the past over distribution. Google requires Android handset makers to pre-install 11 apps, yet Samsung often puts its own services on its phones. And the South Korean company has released devices that run on its own operating system, called Tizen, not Android. Viv was frequently on the short-list of startups that could help larger tech companies build assistant technology. Founded four-years ago by Dag Kittlaus, Adam Cheyer and Chris Brigham, the startup was working on voice technology to handle more complex queries than existing offerings. While it drummed up considerable attention and investment, Viv has not yet released its product to the public. And some analysts are skeptical of Samsung's ability to convert the technology into a credible service, given its mixed record with software applications. "It will be very hard to compete with Google's strength in data and their AI acquisitions," said Jitendra Waral, senior analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. "Samsung would need to prove that its AI solutions are superior to that of Google's. They are handicapped in this race." Samsung is also focused on handling the fallout from its exploding Galaxy Note 7 phones, potentially taking management time away from its Viv integration. But it's a race Samsung has to join. In recent years, Samsung acquired mobile-payments and connected-device startups to keep up with Apple, Google and Amazon.com Inc. Digital voice-based assistants may be more important, if they become the main way people interact with devices. Silicon Valley titans are rushing into the space because of this potential. Amazon is trying to sign up developers for its Alexa voice technology. Apple has recently touted more Siri capabilities and opened the technology to other developers. And now Google, considered the leader in artificial intelligence, is making its own push. "I don't ever remember a time when every single major consumer tech company -- and even enterprise companies -- have been singularly focused on an identical strategy," said Tim Tuttle, chief executive officer of MindMeld Inc., a startup working on voice interaction software. "They're all following the exact same playbook." --- Jungah Lee contributed.

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Apple iPad Air 3 Still Surrounded by Conflicting Rumors, Are Apple Continuing the Line? Let’s See Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: October 16, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» There is still no information on the horizon about the Apple iPad Air 3, and of course, Apple themselves are keeping completely quiet on the issue. Meanwhile, we’ve seen various rumors around the Internet, and some paint the development of the device in quite the negative light. In fact, some of the rumors imply that Apple are going to cancel the iPad Air line completely. The reason, according to these rumors, is that the company is getting a bit overwhelmed trying to maintain their multiple lines at the moment, and they want to optimize their production by focusing on a smaller number of products more efficiently. And considering that the iPad Air has long had an overlap with certain other devices by the company, those rumors say, it makes sense that Apple would want to cut it out. However, others are saying that Apple have no such plans on their mind right now, and that the company is actually looking to actively work on all of their current lines. It’s a messy situation for sure. And without an official statement from Apple, it’s only going to get worse, especially with the holiday season approaching. It’s a great period for people to propagate the most ridiculous rumors they come across, and we have no doubt that Apple’s products are going to be affected by this. What are the more positive rumors saying about the iPad Air 3? The device could pack some impressive specifications if those claims are correct, particularly on the physical design side. It’s possible that we may see an iPad Air 3 with an even slimmer and more lightweight frame than before, as Apple’s engineers have been working hard in that direction. This won’t come at the cost of processing power though, as some of the predictions for the iPad Air 3 speak of an A10 processor. This will bring the device in line with Apple’s current flagship mobile products, and it should offer more than enough power for not only everyday use, but also more advanced tasks suitable for “power users”. As for the most important question – the release date – there is no information from Apple so far. Nobody expects the tablet to hit the market in 2016 at this point though, but nobody seems to have a good idea when in 2017 we can expect it either. If Apple really are working on the iPad Air 3 though, they should probably try to get the device ready by the spring season, or at least by the first half of the year in the latest. Competition in this market segment has been growing steadily, and Apple no longer have the advantage of having such a unique form factor. Other manufacturers have been going after the same idea, some quite successfully, and some are saying that this could also explain Apple’s delay in releasing their own new tablet. The company could be waiting for their competitors to make a more serious move, after which they would try to compete with the new product directly. If this rumor turns out to be true, it’s probably not a bad idea to watch out for interesting events in other areas of the market for hints about Apple’s own moves. In other words, the release of an attractive-looking slim tablet by another company could be the trigger that Apple are waiting for.

To the editor: Following the 48th Annual Apple Harvest, we wanted to thank our Community for another successful Apple Harvest Festival. The event is a tradition that exemplifies the great community of Southington. The Apple Harvest Festival Committee would like to thank all of the volunteers that make the festival a success. There are numerous individuals and organizations in town that put forth a tremendous amount of effort throughout the two-weekend event. We would also like to send appreciation for all of our sponsors. Our platinum sponsors this year were Liberty Bank and Cox Communications.  Without the support of our Sponsors, the Festival would not be sustainable.  I hope that our community will support our sponsors the same way they have supported the town and the festival. Our entire committee and all of the volunteers take great pride in giving back to the community to ensure that the Apple Harvest Festival is a place filled with fun, enjoyment and memories. We hope that you enjoyed the 48th Annual Apple Harvest Festival, and we look forward to seeing you next year. Thank you.

The programming that controls the Taptic Engine-powered feedback is deeply integrated into iOS 10, so much so that it appears Apple's latest iPhone is able to automatically offer a temporary workaround when its diagnostic software senses that the technology is playing up. MacRumors forum member 'iwayne' shared the above picture of his iPhone 7 display after the device unexpectedly turned itself off while charging and the haptic feedback began malfunctioning after a restart. A dialog prompt warns that the home button is in need of repair, but presents an alternative onscreen home button for temporary use until the phone has been turned in to Apple for servicing. MacRumors has previously noted that the Taptic Engine can become unresponsive if the OS freezes, which forced Apple to change the reset process for the iPhone 7 series. Apple has also apparently safeguarded against instances when the button's haptic sensor system breaks completely, but whether or not its failure rate is any better than a physical button remains to be seen. Rumors suggest Apple will ditch the iconic home button entirely for next year's "iPhone 8" in favor of one built directly into an edge-to-edge display, but it's unclear if Apple intends to implement the same button-based recovery methods for instances in which devices freeze or stop responding completely.

Physical buttons are best in many instances! The physical button of the iPhone has constantly been a point of failure, to the point that in Far Eastern countries often it isn't used at all to preserve the resale value (they use Accessibility features instead). The car manufactures began using touch controls for volume, temperature, etc a few years back until, unsurprisingly, they started returning to physical buttons shortly thereafter In the car, touch controls are bad for a completely different reason: because you can't find them without looking.

Why is a device so new already popping up such errors? iPhone 7 is truly an experimental device release. Looking forward to 2017's all new device. You know how many iPhone 7's have been sold, right? Millions. If only one of 1 million iPhones has this problem it means 0.0001 %. But yeah this iPhone is such an experimental device. Please stop posting this nonsense. [doublepost=1476529947][/doublepost] Never heard that. Why would people in the Far East be more sensitive to preserving their home buttons than in the West? That's one reason, certainly, but it's also because of higher failure rates & poor feedback.

MacRumors has previously noted that the Taptic Engine can become unresponsive if the OS freezes, Isn't that just trading one simple problem for a more complex one ? Physical buttons can break, but so can the IMO more complex eccentric rotating mass vibration motor. Electric motors, even miniature ones are surely more complex beasts than a simple trigger button, no ? If previously the physical button was working independent of OS freeze ups and able to reset the phone in conjunction with the power button, then why remove the button and place a surely more costly device like this haptic engine in its place, including a pressure sensitive button to activate the motor via software and in addition remove the headphone jack because of it. Seems a bit convoluted to me. Rating: 17 Votes Douglas B 4 weeks ago I firmly believed that the new Home button had no 'moving parts' and would therefore be less prone to failure.

Search News Southwell From pies to poetry - focus falls on the Bramley Poll  From pies to poetry - focus falls on the Bramley 8:00am Sat Oct 15, 2016 Tweet   The new Dean of Southwell, the Very Rev Nicola Sullivan, will open the Bramley Apple Festival in Southwell Minster a week on Saturday. The chairman, Mr Roger Merryweather said the festival would focus on everything Bramley, from the WI apple pie competition to arts and crafts, as well as the festival of food and drink. “With the declining health of the original Bramley apple tree very much on people’s minds, Southwell’s popular Bramley Apple Festival has increased significance this year,” he said. The event is being supported by Veolia Envirogrant as well as Nottinghamshire County Council, Southwell Town Council, the NFU and Kenwood, which has enabled the festival to have events in and around the town. There will be apple-themed activities at the National Trust’s Southwell Workhouse and cookery demonstrations in the Recycle for Nottinghamshire Cookery Area. There will be more than 30 stalls featuring local produce, as well as a Young Bramley Chef Of The Year competition. The minster will display different varieties of apples from John Hempsall’s East Markham Heritage Orchard, and there will be children’s crafts and cookery demonstrations in the Archbishop’s Palace and Education Centre. The WI apple pie competition and apple day stalls will be in the Bramley Centre. Southwell Library is organising apple-themed activities and will host the prize-giving ceremony in the WI competition on the Saturday, and for painting and poetry competitions the following day. A Bramley apple king, queen, prince and princess will be crowned on the Saturday afternoon. Shops have been asked to have apple-themed window display, and visitors to the town are being encouraged to go on a Southwell Bramley Apple Heritage walk. The festival will also feature music and dance by the Lord Conyers Morris Men and the Minster School Ceilidh Band.

The super-slim tablet is said by some to crack too easily. And when the tech giant charges £566 for a repair, is it being unfair? Just three months after Jonathan Hassid bought his iPad, it developed a crack on its screen. Miles Brignall Saturday 15 October 2016 02.00 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Apple’s swishest iPad yet – the ultra-slim Pro – is thinner, lighter and has an “amazing screen”, according to reviews. But some buyers are finding that the screens crack too easily and are flabbergasted when Apple demands £556 to repair it. One customer, Londoner Jonathan Hassid, paid £1,086 for his 12.9 inch iPad Pro, plus £150 for Apple’s own screen protector. But just three months later the iPad developed a crack on its screen, even though, Hassid says, it had never been bashed or dropped. What stunned him was the reaction from Apple. The businessman, who spends several weeks at a time in Italy, taking his iPad with him, now questions whether the super-thin tablet is robust enough to be carried around and, in the words of the Consumer Rights Act, is “fit for purpose”. He also wants to know how the company can justify such a high repair bill for something he reckons is likely to happen to many other buyers. Apple launched the Pro just under a year ago, claiming that it offered the thinnest and lightest iPad screen yet. It is now sold in two sizes – one with a 9.7-inch screen and the larger 12.9-inch. It is set to be upgraded in the next few weeks when the Pro 2 is launched. In May, Hassid chose the then most expensive Pro and paid the Apple website £1,086 for the 256GB version, plus extra for the screen-protecting cover. He says he used the iPad normally – although he admits he let his children use it to watch films – and says he was bemused to open the cover a few months into his ownership to see a large crack in the screen. “Obviously, I can’t be certain that we didn’t cause it, but there is no evidence of any other damage. What shocked me was the reaction of the AppleCare person when I called. “They were utterly contemptuous on the phone, refusing to countenance the idea that the crack may be a manufacturing defect or offering any practical help other than telling me to give them £556 for the repair. Having patronised me, they eventually hung up,” he says. A search of the web suggests Hassid is not alone, although the number of people complaining about cracked screens is few, relative to the number of sales. For some people Apple has replaced them free of charge, while others are told they must pay. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The recently refurbished Apple store on London’s Regent Street. Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images “I have had three iPads that have taken much abuse and never cracked a screen. The iPad Pro is very flimsy and has a weak screen,” wrote one customer on Apple’s discussion page. Another reported buying her husband one for Christmas and, by Boxing Day, it had cracked. “We did NOT drop it and placed it straight into a protective case, and we can only figure that the case itself (made of plastic) has exerted enough pressure to cause the screen to crack in one place then another … Apple wanted me to pay 80% of the cost to replace it, this is all within a five-day period. I definitely think there are some serious quality issues. Is one meant to wrap the device up in cotton wool?” she asked. Kyle Wiens, who runs iFixit.com, a US-based website that helps tech fans repair their products, notes the original iPads had a much thicker screen. Under the hood: discover 13 hidden iPad features Read more “Apple is making a trade-off between thinness and durability. They want it to be light enough so you can hold it with one hand without tiring, but that comes at a cost. The part is expensive because you have to buy a new LCD, as well as the glass. “We always mention this in our repairability scores when the device comes out. But, alas, people tend to ignore our scores and buy them anyway,” he says. A spokesman for Apple told Guardian Money: “It’s always been the case that we need to inspect units to assess damage. Looking at them helps determine the extent of the repair, and get an understanding of whether there’s a material defect or other mechanical failure under warranty. Customers can send it to us or visit an Apple store or authorised repair centre. In the event damage is not found to be accidental, we will repair or replace the device without fee.” He defended the high cost of repairs and said this is a result of the screen’s sophistication. He also pointed out that the company offers AppleCare+ for iPad – an £89 insurance product that provides up to two incidents of accidental damage, subject to a £39 excess. Meanwhile, following Money’s intervention, Hassid was invited to take his cracked Pro into the Rome Apple store, where staff were much more helpful and have agreed to replace it for free. “Obviously, I am relieved that I will be getting a new one, but I still think this needs to be aired. A tablet is designed to be carried around, but is this one up to it? I’d like to know how Apple thinks it is reasonable to design a product in this way. I was told the glass can no longer be replaced, instead the whole unit must be chucked in the bin and replaced. If this is true then I think this is utterly outrageous from both a consumer and environmental perspective – it’s absurd,” he says. Peeling away the prices at Apple Out-of-warranty screen repairs to an iPad Pro may set the price bar eye-wateringly high, but it doesn’t end there with Apple. In most cases, if you are happy to look beyond branded items there are cheaper alternatives both for repairs and Apple compatible add-ons. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo iPad Pro 12.9-inch smart cover Apple: £59 eBay: £10 A basic smart cover for this iPad will set you back £59 on the Apple website, but on eBay or Amazon they typically cost between £10 and £15, and in some cases less. Some will wonder if they come from the same Chinese factory. USB/Lightning cable (1m) Apple: £19 eBay: £2.08 This is one of the prices that really annoys customers – how much money does Apple make out of charging £19 (£35 for the 2m version) for a cable that costs just £2 elsewhere? Ironically, if you think paying Apple £19 will at least guarantee a decent product, think again. Some buyers report that their cable only worked for a few weeks/months before they had to buy another. iPhone 5 replacement screen Apple: £126 iMend.com: £60 Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Liz McBurney Why pay Apple £126 to replace the screen on your iPhone 5 – or £255 if the local genius deems there is additional damage. Instead, why not take it to a third-party repairer such as iMend.com, which will charge you £60 if you send it in or, for £75, will send out its local techie who will carry out the repair at your home or workplace. The same company quoted £350 this week to repair the screen on an iPad Pro 12.9 – again, a big saving on the £556 Apple wanted, although in this case you have to send it in for repair. iPad Pro 12.9-inch smart keyboard Apple: £169 Logitech: £110 Switch from Apple to the well-regarded Logitech keyboard and you will save almost £60 (or 35%), plus you get a two-year warranty. Headphone adapter iPhone 7 Apple: £9 eBay: £3.60 The latest iPhone has ditched the old 3.5mm headphone socket, meaning you need one of these to use your favourite old headphones. Lose yours and Apple wants £9. Head elsewhere and you’ll pay less than half price. Mac Mouse Apple: £40 Logitech: £9.80 Mac users who want to replace their traditional mouse will face a £40 bill at Apple, while the wizzier Magic Mouse 2 will set them back £65. The popular Logitech B100 is an Amazon best-seller for £6.12 in black or £9.80 if you prefer a matching white model. Apple’s own Magic Mouse 2 is £55 on Amazon.

Fast-forward to today, it's now back at most Apple stores in the United States. This goes without saying, but there's a good chance that supplies will be quickly cleaned out, considering that the larger iPhone 7 with that particular color option has plenty of fans out there. This news comes from Mac Rumors, and using the dedicated website for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus availability iStockNow, the Apple-focused outlet found that the smartphone in question started hitting shelves at several retail stores of the Cupertino brand. At the time of this writing, the Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus is up for grabs across a couple of states, including Nevada, Colorado and Kansas, to name a few. A quick word on how iStockNow tracks availability of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus: It uses Google Maps to provide info in real time regarding the two handsets at Apple stores, and it goes beyond the United States too. Mac Rumors notes that the details are likely based on the "reservation system backend" of the smartphone maker. Interestingly enough, the 128 GB variant appears to be the more popular option compared with the 256 GB model. Now, as mentioned earlier, stocks will probably sell like hotcakes. That said, it's advised to phone in a reservation at a local retailer or place a reservation online as soon as possible. As a little refresher, the 128 GB iPhone 7 Plus in Jet Black will hold buyers back by $869, and the 256 GB variant by $969, and it's available across the four major U.S. carriers AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon. It's also worth pointing out that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus recently became available without a carrier directly from Apple, allowing users to have the option to choose which service provider they prefer at a later date. Long story short, the highly coveted Apple-branded flagship clad in what proved to be the most popular color option is now widespread, and those who have been itching to get their hands on it better act quick. With all said and done, will you be grabbing the Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus now that it has become pretty much widely available? If so, feel free to hit us up in the comments section to let us know.

The SIM-free versions of the latest models will work with any US network, Apple says, with prices starting at $649 for the iPhone 7, and $769 for the larger iPhone 7 Plus. The unlocked devices come in the full range of iPhone 7 colors and storage capacities, but are only available from Apple's online store at the moment, and there's no option for in-store pickup yet. Device stocks appear to be low, too, with delivery expectations of three to four weeks for most models, and six to eight weeks for the jet black version. That should improve with time, however, as the unlocked phones are also likely to filter into Apple's retail stores.

LATEST VIDEOS More Videos: Rates from Bankrate.com Mortgage Credit Cards Auto Consumer Reports: A guide to mobile money 10/14/2016 - 2:00 AM EDT New technologies are making the convenience of living cash-free a reality. But consumers need to understand the trade-offs of abandoning paper money entirely. Consumer Reports offers this overview. • Mobile Wallets More Headlines Zuckerberg: 'Crazy' to say Facebook influenced election Disney embraces streaming as ratings sag Macy's says clothing sales strong, gives better outlook Little People, Dungeons & Dragons top Toy Hall of Fame class Stocks mixed as investors seek clarity on Trump policies What do they do? Let you pay for purchases at physical retail stores and online. Noteworthy brands. Android Pay, Apple Pay, PayPal, Samsung Pay. Cost. No direct fees. What Consumer Reports likes. Apple Pay is now accepted at 3 million stores in the United States because retailers are equipped with new EMV chip card readers that also have near-field communication (NFC) technology. Android Pay and Apple Pay need NFC to transact with cash registers. Samsung Pay can be used at more than 10 million U.S. merchants, because it employs NFC plus a second technology that lets it communicate via magnetic strip with readers that don't have functioning NFC. Caveats. PayPal is mostly for online shopping and has very limited acceptance at retail stores. Apple Pay works only on certain, more recent iPhones; Samsung Pay works only on certain Samsung devices. • Electronic Toll Tags What do they do? Let you pay for highway, express lane, bridge and tunnel tolls, as well as parking at some airports. Noteworthy brands. EXpressToll, E-ZPass, FasTrak, Good To Go!, MnPASS, SunPass, TxTag. Cost. No fees beyond the toll itself. What Consumer Reports likes. Commuters can knock 20 minutes to an hour off their daily drive, says J.J. Eden, president of the Alliance for Toll Interoperability. No stopping. No need to scramble for cash or change. Caveats. High traffic volume can clog up even the toll tag lanes. And now the discounts, used to lure new customers, are starting to go away. • Person-to-Person (P2P) Payments What do they do? Let you send money to another person via the app, email or text. Noteworthy brands. BBVA/Dwolla, Chase QuickPay, clearXchange, Facebook Payments in Messenger, Popmoney, Snapcash, Square Cash and Venmo. Cost. Usually recipients never pay, and fees for sending vary from free to up to 3 percent or more if paid for with a credit card or some debit cards. What Consumer Reports likes. It's super easy. Can transfer money fast (but see caveats). All the services take steps to ensure security. Caveats. How quickly recipients get their money varies, depending on the service. For example, money moves instantly via Facebook Payments in Messenger and by clearXchange, but your bank may take up to five business days to make the funds available to you. • Branded Payment Apps What do they do? Let you pay for purchases only at the merchant brand's physical stores and service providers, and their online counterparts. Noteworthy brands. Dunkin' Donuts, Lyft, PayByPhone, Starbucks, Uber, Wal-Mart Pay. Cost. Generally no direct fees. What Consumer Reports likes. These apps combine payment, loyalty programs and ordering capabilities. Uber automatically charges you for your ride. PayByPhone lets you extend parking meter minutes from wherever you are. 1 2 next  last »

 Apple's limit ad tracking feature sees uptick in the US BI Intelligence Oct. 14, 2016, 9:30 PM 1,488 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also The startup behind these sheets wants to fix how guys treat their beds If you're new to coding, this is the programming language you should learn first Google has shut down a malicious ad attack on its AdSense network This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Digital Media Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. More Apple users in the US are opting out of targeted advertising since the release of the company’s latest update, iOS 10, in mid-September, according to new data from app-marketing platform Adjust. Building upon its Limit Ad Tracking (LAT) feature, which has been available since 2012, Apple rolled out a more stringent privacy setting last month, allowing users to go incognito from advertisers by completely avoiding a unique ID number called “Identifier for Advertising” (IDFA). This unique ID is used by advertisers and ad networks (such as Google and Facebook) to track a user’s mobile app activity to deliver targeted messages. In the US alone, an additional two million users activated the LAT feature since the iOS 10 update. Here are some takeaways from the report:    US LAT rates rise to one in five users. Just over 20% of users implemented Limit Ad Tracking on their mobile devices as of October 4, up from 17% circa iOS 10 update in mid September. However, global penetration remains stable. Penetration among all iOS users has remained stagnant, hovering around 18% since the release of iOS 10. Asian countries represent some of the world’s lowest LAT rates. The Philippines (6.9%) and Indonesia (7.2%) exhibit the lowest rates across all reported countries. Coincidentally, these are areas that exhibit some of the highest percentages of mobile ad blocking in the world. In Indonesia alone, there are 38 million monthly users that use ad blocking on their mobile devices, which is the third largest in the world, according to PageFair.  Mobile is poised to dominate digital ad growth over the foreseeable future, but faces tough hurdles in the process. Indeed, mobile ad revenue is expected to more than double in the next five years, according to BI Intelligence estimates, rising to $55 billion by 2021 from $27.4 billion this year. However, the industry must address the surge in ad blocking and features such as Limit Ad Tracking in order to sustain this growth.    Consumers continue to increase their time spent consuming digital media, while advertisers continue to increase their ad budgets into digital channels. The influx is not expected to let up in the near future. The US digital advertising industry will continue to experience remarkable growth through 2021 to reach nearly $100 billion in annual revenue, driven primarily by the sustained migration of ad dollars from traditional TV to digital video and the continued increase of social spending.  Overall, the strong growth of the US digital ad market can largely be attributed to increased time spent by consumers on digital media and brands' increased comfort with allocating budgets to digital formats, particularly on digital video. In a recent 2016 survey of almost 400 US ad agencies and marketers, the IAB found that two-thirds of respondents plan on increasing spending on digital video in the next year.  Moreover, mobile will become the top destination for digital ad spending as advertisers continue to attempt to resolve the disconnect between the rapid growth in time spent on phones and tablets and the relatively small share of ad budgets that are allocated to such platforms — known as the mobile opportunity gap. In fact, mobile is set to eclipse desktop ad spend by 2018. Dylan Mortensen, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on U.S. digital media ad revenue that forecasts revenue trends over the next five years and outlines the key growth drivers for overall digital ad revenue in the U.S. Here are some key points from the report: US digital ad revenue is expected to reach nearly $100 billion by 2021, according to BI Intelligence estimates. This represents compound annual growth of 8% from the $68.9 billion expected in 2016.  Mobile is positioned to become the top destination for digital ad spending as advertisers continue to attempt to close the "mobile opportunity gap." Digital video advertising will grow faster than any other segment over the next five years, as consumers shift time spent online to phones and tablets. Revenue in this category is forecast to rise from $8.5 billion in 2016 to $23 billion in 2021. Social advertising in all formats is gaining traction and will be among the key drivers of digital ad growth in the next five years. Social ad revenue is poised to climb to $30.8 billion by 2021, up from $15.5 billion this year. Artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, and sponsored content will help propel further digital ad growth in the next decade. In full, the report: Forecasts US digital ad revenue through 2021. Highlights the rising popularity of digital media with consumers and brands. Explores why digital video advertising growth will exceed all other formats over the next five years. Outlines emerging technologies that will help propel ad growth in the next decade.

This is essentially at its core the same Apple Watch Series 2 device, except that it will feature a more sporty look and will come with certain exclusive features. However when the Apple Watch Series 2 was released, the Nike+ was still missing from that list, and now we know as Apple has quietly announced that the Apple Watch Nike+ will be available for purchase starting from the 28th of October. The price of the watch will start at $369 for the 38mm model, and $399 for the 42mm model. Just in case you missed the announcement from Apple’s event, the Nike+ will be similar to the Apple Watch Series 2 in terms of features. However like we said, there are certain exclusives such as watch faces, software, a Nike+ Run Club complication, and a special sports band that will set it apart from the other Apple Watches. Whether or not these features are enough to make the Nike+ more appealing remains to be seen, but if you are interested you can keep an eye out for its availability via Apple’s website.

Macy's launched an Apple shop Friday at its Herald Square store, the first U.S. department store with a hub devoted to the brand. (Photo: Anne D'Innocenzio / AP) Customers at Macy’s flagship store in New York will be able to wander over from eyeliner to iPads. Macy’s launched an Apple shop Friday at its Herald Square store, the first U.S. department store with a hub devoted to the brand. The shop features a range of products including iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, and the new Nike-branded Apple watch. Staffed by Apple associates, it’s on the main floor in the heart of the busy cosmetics and fragrance area. “This is one of the most sought-after products,” Terry Lundgren, the outgoing CEO of Macy’s, told The Associated Press. “We really cater to women better than most retail stores do. I do think that we are going to end up creating a business that is more female-friendly.” Beyond the Apple shop, Macy’s is also moving to highlight consumer tech at 180 stores. It’s rolling out dedicated areas before the holiday season that will include Apple watches but also Fitbits and other “smart” watches. The Herald Square store will have this section as well. The Apple partnership comes as Macy’s is collaborating with other brands to create almost a mini-mall. Macy’s and Luxottica Group have a partnership to open LensCrafters optical shops in as many as 500 stores over the next three years. That builds on its collaboration with the eyewear conglomerate’s Sunglass Hut brand that has led to Sunglass shops in nearly 700 Macy’s locations. Macy’s, once a stellar performer, is aiming to reverse six straight quarters of declines for a key sales measure. It’s said it plans to close 100 stores next year and boost its online investments. Like many department stores, Macy’s is wrestling with shoppers’ shift in spending to home improvement and technology, and away from clothing. As more shoppers move online, it’s also trying to create more excitement in the stores. The partnership with Apple to open a shop, Lundgren said, is “something we’ve worked on for years.” He expects the Apple area to be the most densely staffed space. The area, near the main 34th Street entrance, has four light wood Apple tables displaying the products similar to those at standalone Apple stores and features bold graphics of the watches on the wall. The flagship store usually attracts 35,000 to 40,000 customers per week, and about 75,000 during the holidays. 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

It's how they look. Apple claims that Samsung copied many of the distinctive design features of the iPhone, including its rectangular shape with rounded corners, black translucent front screen, and grid display of colorful icons for applications. Two lower courts have ruled in Apple's favor. An employee poses for photographs with Samsung Electronics' Galaxy Note 7, sales of which have now been halted over concerns about battery safety. The justices must decide how much Samsung should pay for that infringement — just an amount based on the value of the design features themselves, or the total profit Samsung has earned from the sale of eleven different versions of its smartphones? Related: Note 7 Fiasco Could Cost Samsung $17 Billion The lower courts said Samsung must give up all its profits from the smartphone sales, which a jury found to be nearly $400 million. The rulings were based on a federal law that says anyone who copies and applies a patented design to "any article of manufacture" is liable "to the extent of his total profit." Customers take a look at the new iPhone 7 inside of an Apple Inc. store in New York on Sept, 16. EDUARDO MUNOZ / Reuters Samsung argues that the law, written in the 19th century, was meant to apply to things like wallpaper or carpet that derive their value and appeal from design. It makes no sense, the company says, to apply the law to a complicated product like a smartphone. Under the logic of the lower courts, "an infringer of a patented cup-holder design must pay its entire profits on a car," said Kathleen Sullivan, the former Stanford Law School dean representing Samsung. Related: iPhone Mania Hits With the Release of Apple's 7 Plus Smartphone People buy smartphones, she said, for their functions, such as their apps, cameras, and web capabilities, "not as decorative objects to be used as paperweights or hung on a wall." It cannot be, she said, that a company has to give up all its profits, no matter how complex the product and how minor the patented design is to the product as a whole. But Apple claims its rival is fear-mongering. "Samsung, a global 500 company with worldwide reach, deliberately chose to copy the innovations of its fiercest competitor" and "profited enormously from that infringement," said William Lee, a lawyer representing Apple. Related: Samsung Halts Sales, Exchanges of Replacement Galaxy Note 7s The iPhone revolutionized the smartphone market when it was introduced in 2007, he said, and the design was a key part of its appeal. A ruling for Samsung, Lee argued, would blunt a powerful tool for punishing companies that steal a competitor's design and would "empower counterfeiters and producers of knock-offs."

Computer makers, including Dell and Hewlett-Packard, urge the justices to rule for Samsung. A victory for Apple, they said in a friend of court brief, would have "a devastating impact on companies that spend billions of dollars annually on research and development for complex technological products and their components." Those products, they said, "are not purchased primarily for the design of one or more isolated components." But more than 100 designers who have worked for major companies said "design drives sales of consumer and commercial products. Indeed, a product's visual design becomes the product itself in the minds of consumers." In their friend of court brief, they urged the court not to underrate the importance of design, which they said outranks all other considerations for people buying cars. A decision is expected by late June.

However it does open the door to other problems, like what if the home button actually fails for whatever reason? What are iPhone 7 users supposed to do then? Thankfully Apple has thought about it and has actually created a workaround that was recently discovered. In a post on the MacRumors forum, user ‘iwayne’ revealed how Apple plans to offer users a temporary workaround should the home button fail and they don’t have time to drop by the store to get it fixed. As you can see in the screenshot above, when iOS detects that the home button is not functioning properly, it will offer users an onscreen home button that pretty much does the same thing. The onscreen home button isn’t new as it can be accessed via the Accessibility options in the iOS settings, but for Apple to offer it up as a temporary alternative is a clever implementation of it. We’re not sure what might cause the home button to stop functioning since there are no moving parts, but if and when it does, this feature will no doubt come in handy. Filed in Apple >Cellphones.

Put that bourbon to good use with salmon Noelle Rulseh, For USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin 5:02 p.m. CDT October 16, 2016 Salmon with bourbon glaze (Photo: Courtesy of Noelle Rulseh) My favorite fish is probably salmon, though walleye caught fresh from our lake comes in a close second. Salmon can be used in so many ways: as a main entrée, in salads, in spreads or in dips. I could sit down and just eat a whole platter of really good smoked salmon. RELATED: A lunch-box treat RELATED: Apple cookies by the handful RELATED: The ultimate apple dessert Salmon is also nutritious. Nutrients in salmon include protein, Vitamin D, the B Vitamins and Omega-3 fatty acids. The marinade for this recipe has a wonderful blend of bourbon and honey. It is so delicious, you may have to double the recipe! SALMON WITH BOURBON GLAZE 1      (one-pound) salmon steak ¾     cup bourbon ½     cup brown sugar 2       tablespoons honey 2       teaspoons soy sauce ½      teaspoon dry ginger salt/pepper to taste Place the salmon in a Ziplock-style baggie and place that into a bowl. In a separate bowl, mix together the bourbon, brown sugar, honey, soy sauce, ginger, salt and pepper. Pour half the mixture into the baggie with the salmon steak. Place the salmon in the refrigerator for one hour to marinate. Place the remaining marinade in the refrigerator to use when grilling. Grill salmon (throw that marinade away) until fish begins to flake. Brush the other half of reserved marinade on the salmon while grilling.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Siri’s problem: not quite human enough, yet Dan Moren 17 October, 2016 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News These days, our lives are littered with the half-built scaffoldings of intelligent assistants and virtual agents. Voice-based interfaces are at a level with technologies like home automation and virtual reality: popular enough to have seeped into our lives, but not yet refined enough that they have become fixtures for most of us. Apple’s version of Siri turns five years old this month, but as I’ve discussed before, it doesn’t seem to have progressed as much as one may have hoped. This week, veteran tech journalist Walt Mossberg penned a scathing indictment of Apple’s voice-based assistant, in which he posed the question that most of us have asked at one time or another: “why does Siri seem so dumb?” He’s not wrong. While I’ve had better luck than Mossberg in some of my interactions with the feature, I run up against rough edges pretty much every single time I try to use Siri for anything. Most of my iPhone-using friends tend to view Siri as more of a curiosity than a useful tool. Last year I put forth some ideas about what a Siri 2.0 should include, but let’s take a step back and look at the bigger issues here. Putting out fires Mossberg’s article brings up a number of specific issues: Siri’s inability to identify the presidential candidates, cluelessness about the date of the presidential debates and even providing weather for the town of Crete, Illinois instead of Crete, the island. But it’s less the problem than the cure that bugs me here, as Mossberg says: If you try most of these broken examples right now, they’ll work properly, because Apple fixed them after I tweeted screenshots of most of them in exasperation and asked the company about them. Here’s the thing: if that’s what it takes to get new functionality in Siri, then – permit me to wax only slightly hyperbolic – it’s doomed. This isn’t the kind of feature you can address on a case-by-case basis. It’s a bit like the trouble that Apple had when it first transitioned away from Google Maps to its own system: if people ask once and get the wrong answer – or, in the case of Siri, no answer at all – they’re going to be dubious from there on out. Even more so with a feature that’s less tried and true, such as voice-based assistants. Apple did tell Mossberg that it’s constantly working behind the scenes to try and make Siri better for the tasks people use it for the most: Apple stressed to me that it’s constantly improving Siri, and also stressed that it focuses its Siri efforts on the kinds of tasks that it says millions of people ask every day: placing phone calls, sending texts and finding places. It puts much less emphasis on what it calls ‘long tail’ questions, like the ones I’ve cited above, which, in some cases, Apple says, number in only the hundreds each day. To my mind, that just raises more questions. Do people use it less for those ‘long tail’ questions because it doesn’t tend to give helpful answers? And if Apple doesn’t improve the handling of those kinds of queries, will people just give up on asking them, thus meaning they end up using Siri less as a whole? It’s somewhere between a self-fulfilling prophecy and a chicken-and-egg problem. ‘And’ Right now, Siri and most of the other voice-based assistants on the markets are still far from that ‘uncanny valley’ moment where they’re so close to humans that people get creeped out by their interactions. It’s still abundantly clear that you’re talking to a machine, because they have roughly the same level of intelligence as, say, your dog. (No disrespect meant to our canine companions.) A dog, like Alexa or Siri, knows his name, and can perk up when he hears it. You can give a dog a specific command and have him understand you, but his ability to interpolate new instructions based on what he already knows is generally pretty low. For example, if I could point to one thing that I find holds back Siri and its competing intelligent agents, it’d be pretty simple. Just a little word that we use probably dozens if not hundreds of times a day (25 times in this article alone!): ‘and’. The idea of ‘and’ is simple to our human brains, and yet incredibly complex to a virtual agent. Tell your significant other to put milk and orange juice and bananas on the shopping list and chances are they’ll do what you’re expecting. Tell Siri and, well, you end up with something pretty different – and far less useful. Similarly, try joining two commands together. If you tell your kids to turn off the lights and the television, they can probably handle that (at least past a certain age). When I do that with my Amazon Echo, it means issuing a command, waiting until it’s resolved and then issuing a second command. It’s a bit eyeroll-inducing. If you’re so smart, why aren’t you rich? Apple’s put a lot of energy into machine learning and AI. Back in August, veteran tech journalist Steven Levy did a deep dive into Apple’s efforts in those arenas. Perhaps the most interesting revelation was just how small a part of it Siri seems to be – maybe, given Siri’s current powers, a bit too small. Right now it may be OK that our virtual assistants aren’t smarter than the average fifth-grader – we probably wouldn’t want fifth graders overthrowing our society either. (Although cake at every meal sounds pretty great.) But in order to get these intelligent agents to the point where they’re as useful as they’ve been envisioned, it’ll take a significant leap from where we are today. And, frankly, they’re probably going to need to know the meaning of the word ‘and’. Related Tags:  Share: Comments Related Posts Random Posts How much would Forrest Gump’s Apple stock be worth today?

Opinion Anna Scantlin Contributing Editor | October 16, 2016 259 shares 215 29 0 9 0 0 2 2 2               Browsing through the news today, I stumbled upon the latest leaks for the rumored HTC Bolt, a large mid-range device that resembles the Taiwanese company’s flagship, the HTC 10, quite a bit. I feel that HTC is tackling a part of the market that could use a little TLC. Between Google going premium with Pixel and leaving Nexus behind, as well as Lenovo apparently going the route of planned obsolesce with the once-adored Moto series, the mid-range market for Android, while still saturated, is missing a couple of its best front-runners. With HTC stepping in with the Bolt, there’s potential for the company to fill in that gap. As long as the specs are decent and the price is right (which is questionable, given how HTC initially priced the HTC 10), HTC has a solid chance of gaining a following with the Bolt. According to the reports, a decent amount of specs have already been leaked: a 5.5-inch 1080p display, 3GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage, 18-megapixel rear-facing camera with f/2.0 and 4K video, and an 8-megapixel front-facing camera. The phone is also said to charge via USB Type-C, which is expected these days; however, the Type-C port will apparently serve two functions: charging and serving as the new headphone jack. According to leaks, the HTC Bolt appears to have no 3.5mm headphone jack. Having no 3.5mm headphone jack isn’t the end of the world, as we’ve seen. It’s not like you can’t plug in headphones if you really wanted to, and there are still adapters out there if you want to keep using a 3.5mm headphone jack. Still, the move is still considered extremely inconvenient. According to companies who chose to nix the 3.5mm headphone jack, it was done in the name of “superior sound” due to digital connection. While this may be true to some degree, the increased quality is marginal at best, and it’s certainly not advanced enough for most people to feel that they’re getting a good deal out of this “ripping off the bandage” method of moving towards the future. Apple removing the 3.5mm headphone jack in the iPhone 7 is not only the most recent, but also the most controversial example of this issue, was put on the back-burner when Samsung’s Note 7 fiasco began (and persisted). I don’t think Apple could have introduced this removal at a better time, truly; but now that the Note 7 news and jokes are starting to die down, I can’t help but focus on this trivial aspect of the industry again, which appears to be spreading to other manufacturers quite rapidly now that Apple has made the move. Really, my problem isn’t that the 3.5mm headphone jack is gone. My problem is that they just take it away and don’t offer a true replacement. You can use the USB-C or Lightning port to listen to music, and you can use an adapter to use your 3.5mm headphone jack, but that still takes away the ability to natively charge the phone while listening to music at the same time. It takes away convenience. Third party options have been introduced to alleviate this issue, but it shouldn’t be an issue for third party companies to fix in the first place. At the very least, if Type-C or Lightning ports are that important for high-quality audio, add a second Type-C or Lightning port.  But back to the Bolt. The HTC Bolt seems like a decent mid-range device. The removal of the headphone jack is disappointing, and probably even more disappointing is that HTC’s iconic BoomSound technology is apparently a feature, it’s only a feature through… the headphones. For external audio, the Bolt allegedly features a single stereo speaker on the bottom edge of the device. I think the best hope for the Bolt to make it big as a mid-range device is to have an extremely tempting price tag. We still don’t know when the Bolt will debut, but it’s expected to be available worldwide when it does. As for the headphone jack issue, I feel that it's only going to happen more frequently now. My only hope is that manufacturers at least add a second port at some point. Readers, what are your thoughts on the growing trend of removing the 3.5mm headphone jack? Do you think this move is key for future audio improvements, or do you think it’s a trend that shouldn’t be trending? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!

A new version of iOS means change, and changing the way we use our everyday tech can be tough. Even though you can get used to changes, it takes time and frustration. But frustrated iOS 10 users, don't give up hope. There are fixes for iOS 10's more annoying features and we have them all right here. No more swipe to unlock We've been swiping to unlock our iPhones for as long as there's been an iPhone, but in iOS 10 swipe to unlock is no more. The default behavior is now to press the home button to unlock the phone, then either using Touch ID or entering your passcode to get to your home screen. While there's no bringing back swipe to unlock, iOS devices with Touch ID—the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone SE, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 3, iPad mini 4, iPad Pro, iPad Pro 9.7, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus—can be unlocked more easily. Instead of pressing the home button, you can just rest your finger to on it and the phone will unlock automatically via Touch ID. Here's how to turn it on: 1.       Open Settings 2.       Click on General 3.       Click on Accessibility 4.       Scroll down until you find the Home Button option, then click it 5.       The last Home Button option is Rest Finger to Open. Click the slider next to it (it should change from white to green) Next time you need to unlock your phone, you can just press your finger to the home button, no clicking required. Get rid of useless Apple apps This one actually isn't an annoyance added in iOS 10—it's an annoyance removed by iOS 10. There are tons of apps Apple conveniently includes on your phone, and chances are you don't use all of them. But whether you use them or not, up until now there was no way to get rid of them, prompting plenty of users to shuffle them off into their own special folders out of the way. Now you can get rid of those icons cluttering up your screen the same way you would with any app: 1.       Press and hold on the app you want to delete until an X pops up in the upper-left corner 2.       Press the X to remove the app You can get rid of most (but not all) built-in apps this way, including: ·         Calculator ·         Calendar ·         Compass ·         Contacts ·         FaceTime ·         Find My Friends ·         Home ·         iBooks ·         iCloud Drive ·         iBooks ·         Mail ·         Maps ·         Music ·         News ·         Notes ·         Podcasts ·         Reminders ·         Stocks ·         Tips ·         Videos ·         Voice Memos ·         Watch app ·         Weather However, be aware that getting rid of some of these will impact your device's functionality because iOS won't always recognize third-party apps as replacements. Regret your decision to delete? You can redownload any of these apps from the app store. Prevent apps from adding themselves to Messages The Messages app may have gotten more changes than anything else in iOS 10, adding tons of features for iMessages. Now there are stickers, a handwriting mode, animated effects, Digital Touch for quick doodles, suggested emoji, the ability to search for the perfect response GIF, and apps that can integrate with messages. App integration can be convenient, letting you access and share information from another app—features vary depending on the app—without leaving Messages. However, there are plenty of apps that you probably aren't interested in—and having a ton of them will make it tough to find the ones you're actually interested in. iMessage apps are stand-alone apps just for Messages, but iOS 10 will helpfully download apps that pair with anything you already use. Don't want them? 1.       Open Messages 2.       Open an iMessage (any will do) 3.       Click on the A-shaped app store icon next to the text box (if it's not there, click on the arrow icon to bring it up) 4.       Click on the four circles in the lower left 5.       Click Store 6.       Click the Manage tab 7.       Click the slider next to Automatically Add Apps to disable adding new apps without asking (it should change from white to green) From this screen, you can also enable or disable apps you already have (just click the slider next to them). You can also shop for new Messages apps by clicking the Featured or Categories tabs. The interface is just like the regular app store—the only difference is that these are all apps designed to add features to iMessage. Stop handwriting mode from popping up Handwriting mode in Messages is pretty nifty, letting you send out messages with more of a personal touch than text. However, there's one big snag: it activates automatically whenever you turn your phone into landscape orientation while you're in Messages. That means i can take over your screen unintentionally, which is a real nuisance. Fortunately, it's simple to turn off: 1.       Open Messages 2.       Rotate your phone to landscape to bring up the handwriting screen 3.       Tap the keyboard icon in the lower right of the screen This should send you back to the keyboard layout and, next time you put your phone in landscape, it will stay that way. If you want to get to handwriting mode, tap the squiggle in the lower right of the keyboard when you're in landscape. (Just remember to toggle it back off again when you're done, or it will pop up next time.) Why aren't Message effects working? One of the cool new features Messages adds to iMessages is flashy animated effects. But depending on your settings, they may just not work. The culprit is most likely the Reduce Motion setting. Without Reduce Motion enabled, your iOS device plays some visual tricks to add more depth perception to your phone—icons shift slightly as you tilt your phone and apps appear to zoom forward and backward as you open and close them. Some people love these effects, but for others they can induce motion sickness-like effects and are best disabled. However, the full-screen animations in Messages just don't work if Reduce Motion is enabled. If you have it turned on but you just have to have full-screen iMessage animations, here's how to turn it off: 1.       Open Settings 2.       Click General 3.       Click Accessibility 4.       Click the slider next to Reduce Motion to disable it (the slider should change from green to white) As to which setting is the "right" one, you'll have to make your own call: do you want iMessage effects on more than you want home screen motion effects off? Turn off Message replying from lock screen Replying to messages without even unlocking your phone is awfully convenient—and in iOS 10 you can do just that either using 3D Touch or a swipe. However, what if your phone were in the wrong hands? You might not want just anyone replying to your messages. However, this feature easy to disable once you know what you're looking for: 1.       Open Settings 2.       Click Touch ID & Passcode 3.       Enter your PIN 4.       Scroll down to the Allow Access When Locked section 5.       Click the slider next to Reply with Message (and anything else you wouldn't like just anyone to be able to see) to disable the feature (it should change from white to green) You'll still be able to reply to messages—even by tapping or swiping from the lock screen—but you'll have to use Touch ID or your passcode to unlock your phone before you do. Turn off Raise to Wake Now we're getting into settings that will only affect certain iPhone users. Raise to Wake is a feature added in iOS 10 that activates your iPhone's screen when you pick it up, letting you see your notifications without a single click. It's supported by the iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone SE, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus—if you have any of these phones, Raise to Wake will be on automatically as soon as iOS 10 is installed. There are people who love Raise to Wake and people who hate Raise to Wake. If you're in the latter camp, you can shut it off: 1.       Open Settings 2.       Click on Display and Brightness 3.       Find the Raise to Wake icon, about half-way down the screen, and click the slider next to it—it should change from green to white Clear all of your notifications at once This is another annoyance iOS 10 is removing rather than adding, but it's easy to overlook—and, like Raise to Wake, only works on certain devices. Anyone with a smartphone knows that notifications can pile up, and sometimes you just don't care. You want them all to go away in the minimum number of clicks. To delete everything at once: 1.       Open your notifications screen (swiping down from your home screen is the quickest way) 2.       Press and hold the X on the upper right of your topmost notification. 3.       Tap Clear All Notifications However, this is a gesture that only works on phones with 3D touch, which is the iPhone 6s and newer, including the iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone SE, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Older iPhone owners don't have to worry about this one because it just doesn't exist—but they will have to clear out old notifications manually, one day's notifications at a time.

You now have to physically press on the button and I don’t like that. For those of you who feel the need to remove it, I suggest this tutorial http://www.cydiageeks.com/slide-to-unlock-ios-10-for-iphone-no-home-button.html Reply Missing Email Arrows From Anne Maxfield on October 17, 2016 :: 12:48 pm My biggest pet peeve with the new operating system is the absence of the up and down arrows in email on my iPad. I prefer to do everything on my iPad in vertical mode and now that the arrows are gone, you have to go back to the inbox to skip over stuff which makes skimming email a slower process. Reply NO MORE SWIPE TO UNLOCK From tedstrutz on October 17, 2016 :: 9:04 pm THANK YOU!!!  THANK YOU!!! THANK YOU!!! Reply Mail threads.. the biggest ios 10 issue From dan g on October 20, 2016 :: 11:26 am Whatever they did to mail threads with Exchange in IOS 10 makes long threads mail confusing and unusable in my opinion.  I hope this is a defect and that no one thought this was a good idea. You can turn off threads in settings under mail.  It isn’t as good as IOS 9 but as least it makes mail usable again.

With plans starting at just $4 per month, Amazon's new streaming service sounds like an affordable alternative to the likes of Spotify. But is it really? Is Amazon Music Unlimited a good deal? 0 Share: Smart Home by Rick Broida October 13, 2016 11:15 AM PDT @cheapskateblog Up Next What a Trump presidency means for tech Amazon is coming for you, Apple Music. And Spotify. And Google Play Music. Yesterday, the e-commerce giant rolled out Amazon Music Unlimited, an ad-free streaming service that aims to compete with those established heavyweights. How? With lower prices. Sort of. Not to be confused with Prime Music, which affords Prime subscribers a fairly limited catalog, Music Unlimited offers "tens of millions" of songs, according to Amazon. (Its competitors get a little more specific, each claiming at least 30 million.) Let's just say it's Amazon's answer to Spotify. Beyond that, Music Unlimited offers tight integration with Amazon's Echo products. In fact, Echo owners can take advantage of special pricing. Let's take a look at the various subscription options and whether or not they're really a good deal. If you already have Amazon Prime You paid $99 for your Prime subscription, which works out to $8.25 per month. Sure, it affords lots of benefits beyond just Prime Music, but you still have to consider that as part of the equation. Existing Prime subscribers can add Music Unlimited for $7.99 per month -- or $79, if you pay annually. All the competing services charge $9.99 per month for a single-user subscription. So if you're paying for Prime already, another $7.99/month (or an effective $6.58 from an annual payment) is a decent deal -- though hardly a great one. If you already have an Amazon Echo Here's where it gets interesting. Echo owners can get Music Unlimited for just $3.99 per month. But -- and this is a big "but" -- that subscription will play your music only via Echo -- and only a single Echo at that. You don't get to listen on the web, and you don't get to use the mobile apps. Verdict: no, thanks. This might be a bigger deal if you had no other options for unlimited music via Echo. But you do: Spotify. And obviously that service doesn't limit you to a single device. Admittedly, $3.99 per month is the single cheapest streaming-music option out there, but remember, you still need an Echo, which isn't free. If you don't have Amazon anything "Civilians" can get Amazon Music Unlimited for $9.99 per month -- the same price you'd pay for Apple Music, Spotify or the like. So then the question is, how is Music Unlimited better than the competition? At first blush, it appears to be very similar: big catalog, curated playlists, personalized stations and so on. Perhaps the best argument for choosing it is if you think you'll purchase Prime and/or an Echo at some point down the road. But if you go with, say, Spotify from the start, you'll still enjoy Echo integration. If you have a family That $9.99 per month is for a single user. If you want a family plan -- even if you already subscribe to Prime -- will cost you $14.99 per month. That allows up to six users to share the service, on par with what you get from Apple, Google and Spotify family plans. However, Amazon also offers an annual payment option for Music Unlimited: $149, which works out to $12.42 per month. That would make it the least-expensive of the major music services. (I didn't find a discounted annual-payment option for any of the others.) But, as with the individual plan, the savings are pretty slim -- just a couple of bucks every month. I definitely don't see the value in Amazon's Echo-only plan, which is way too limiting, and unless you already have a subscription to Prime that you like for reasons other than music, the standard $9.99 rate is unexciting. If you do have that subscription, though, $7.99 per month is a solid single-user deal. And for families of six willing to prepay by the year, the $149 rate is definitely worth considering.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Top 7 Secret Features Of MacOS Sierra Posted: Oct 16 2016, 11:36am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, Updated: Oct 18 2016, 6:24pm CDT, in News | Apple     Here is a list of 7 hidden features of Apple's latest and greatest macOS Sierra. Now all you proud Mac owners probably use the latest macOS given by Apple most efficiently. But the fact is that there are great chances that you simply interact with features that are up front and centre. You will not be aware of the hidden options that are much powerful and interesting and thus we want you use to your macOS to its full potential. How To: Find Pokemon Go Plus In Stock Most of you must be aware that the macOS Sierra is actually an evolution of the OS X platform and in reality the platform is now more aligned with the mobile platform which is iOS. Now if you don’t have much knowledge of the non publicized features of the macOS sierra and are yet to update your Macbook or iMac do not worry because we have them listed just here for you. Below are some features you just have to know. Hey Siri!! Siri is one great addition to MAC but the process of loading is pretty troublesome for some which actually nullifies the whole reason of Siri. Well, the simple solution is you can bring Siri to life much more quickly by holding the buttons CMD + Space for a little more time. However, that’s not all; you can actually set up a voice command through System preferences which will immediately launch the program. This command is very much similar to the ‘hey Siri’ voice command on iOS. Positioning PiP Window We all appreciate that macOS Sierra gives us a Picture-in-Picture mode for most of the video streaming website. This feature is great in itself but one thing that irritates many users is that PIP windows only snaps to one corner of the display screen. This is pretty problematic especially if you have a big screen. The solution to this irritating problem is to hold down the CMD button when you position the PIP window. This will allow you to place it anywhere without having to snap the corners. Space Bar Feature The iOS gives us a lot to learn and many of the things that have come across to Sierra have made iOS users very much delighted. For those of you who give sheer significance to product gain you are in for good news as Apple has added a double-tap space bar. This will allow to add a period feature in to the macOS platform. You just have to make sure your ‘Add period’ and ‘double space’ is checked in your keyboard settings. You can find those under System preferences. Notes App Collaboration Google Drive has had this facility for years. Apple has included it in iWork for the first time. macOs Sierra allows many people to pool resources using the Native Notes similar to what is found in its iOS 10 counterpart. Notes is going to be the most comprehensive editing software but the highlight remains its ability to allow multiple people for modification. You will also be able to share your document over Mail, Messages and major social media websites by simply copy and pasting the link. You can start off by simply clicking on ‘Add people’ on the right side of the interface and your ready to work. Universal Clipboard This is an interesting feature which allows information to be copied on a Mac operating on the macOS Sierra and paste it on to an iOS device which is running on iOS 10 and vice versa. It is an absolutely amazing feature but sadly is not known by many. Hidden Library Folder Many of us usually pay attention the parts of the system which Apple makes pretty much evident and the Hidden library folder is for those who have much of an inquisitive nature. Safari Session Reload The previous versions of OS X allowed you to reopen a closed Safari browser session. You just had to press together CMD + Shift +T button many times to regain your last closed tab. Apple has improved this facility with macOS Sierra and now by pressing the same buttons as before you will get access to multiple closed tabs instead of one. In addition if you have happened to closed a window the same shortcut will allow you to gain access to the same window with all the tabs again. You can also gain those opened tabs even if you quit Safari completely.

Facebook is now enabling users to show on their television monitors live and previously recorded personal videos posted on their news feeds, similar to the way Google and Apple allow streaming video clips using Google's Chromecast and Cast devices and Apple TV and AirPlay devices. Facebook users now can cast videos to a TV from a browser or their iOS smartphones or tablets as they already do to an Apple TV or any other AirPlay-enabled device, as well as the Chromecast and Google Cast-enabled devices. The new iOS app, announced Oct. 13, gives the social network a new dimension for advertising—a larger-scale venue for generating ad revenue. Users can expect to see pre-roll ads connected to their videos at some point. Facebook is expecting that the larger screens, higher resolution and increased viewing time for users and their viewers ostensibly to provide an attractive environment for advertisers. The Android version of the app is expected to become available soon, Facebook said. Whatever version someone uses, it's pretty easy to deploy: Simply find a video in the feed on your phone, tablet or desktop, touch the TV button in the top right, then select the device you want to use for the stream. In a few seconds the video will be playing on the TV. Facebook Live videos will include real-time reactions and comments that can be streamed across the screen. Users can also type in their reactions on the app while watching the video on their TV. User can scroll through the feed and continue using Facebook while the video streams. That puts Facebook on two screens for the user, a strategy advertisers certainly will favor. Facebook started testing streaming video to televisions from Android five months ago and iOS in August.         Chris Preimesberger is Editor of Features and Analysis at eWEEK. Twitter: @editingwhiz.

Some of them are discussed on iTech Post. “The hype brought about by the new iPhones is already starting to cool down. Now, people who bought the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are facing their next problems – iPhone 7 bugs. Apparently, new reports suggest that the new iPhones have recurring connection issues that minimize the user experience.” The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are having LTE connection problems. [Image by Daryl Deino] The article adds that quite some Verizon and AT&T subscribers are having serious problems keeping their LTE connection active. This is apparently happening to some people on T-Mobile as well. An article on Mac Rumors originally dealt with the problems Verizon users were having, but updated the article to note people on other carriers are experiencing difficulties as well. However, many commenters after the article say they aren’t having any problems. “Once again, it seems like I’ve dodged the bullet with this device. After having problems with the 6 Plus and 6s, my Jet Black iPhone 7 on Verizon is phenomenal. I’ll watch out for this, but so far I haven’t noticed anything out of the ordinary,” says Macduke. “AT&T here – Black phone. No issues at all with LTE under any circumstance,” says Bbplayer 5. Still, there are some on Twitter who are complaining about the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus LTE issue. So when are we getting a fix for the LTE problem for #iPhone7 @VZWSupport @VerizonSupport ?? This is getting aggravating — Beanz (@delbenz) October 5, 2016 I know this is a first world problem, but is anyone having iPhone and/or Sprint LTE issues over the last month? Cycling airplane mode a lot. — Erik T-Bo Thibault (@ErikThibault) October 12, 2016 There have been some who have reported a hardware failure with the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus Home button. However, as Engadget reports, there is a workaround. “MacRumors forum goer iWayne has shown that the new iPhone will give you an on-screen home button (along with a warning that you may need repairs) if it thinks the physical key is broken. While that’s not much consolation if your phone needs to be fixed, it does mean that you can keep using your device in a relatively normal way while you’re waiting for your Genius Bar appointment.” The iPhone 7 Plus has a new Home button that takes a little bit of getting used to. [Image by Daryl Deino] The non-moving Home button was controversial at first, but users really seem to love it. Even though you are not actually pressing anything, it feels like you are because of the convincing haptic feedback that mimics the press of a button. However, as Engadget notes, Apple may be completely ditching the Home button on 2017’s upcoming iPhones. The iPhone 8 will mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, which was first released in June of 2007 and became one of the most important tech devices in history. Chris Smith of BGR seems to think that the iPhone 8 could be used to provide augmented reality (not virtual reality), since Tim Cook has been talking about it a lot lately. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qREWMHpASQ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Mac Rumors speculates that the iPhone 8 could have an OLED display, a faster A11 processor, a glass body, and allow wireless charging. Others speculate that Apple will finally increase the resolution to make the iPhone 8 with a 1080p display and the iPhone 8 Plus with a Quad HD one. For those of you wishing the headphone jack is coming back, most sources say you shouldn’t count on it. As of right now, Apple really doesn’t have any competition. With the Galaxy Note 7 debacle, Samsung has hurt their brand, but that could be just temporarily. The Galaxy Note 8, expected to be released in early 2017, could really help Samsung challenge Apple again. In any case, 2017 is going to be a very exciting year for smartphones.

 Microsoft employees love Satya Nadella a lot more than they did Steve Ballmer Matt Weinberger Oct. 16, 2016, 11:00 AM 25,786 facebook linkedin twitter email print Left to right: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, former CEO and founder Bill Gates, and former CEO Steve Ballmer.Microsoft A happy company is a productive company, and Microsoft employees are very happy, finds analyst firm UBS in a report issued earlier in October. In fact, Microsoft is a happier company overall than Apple for the first time since UBS started tracking employee sentiment in 2012. The study uses data from Glassdoor to track everything from CEO approval to opportunities for career advancement to overall outlook for the business. "The overall results are supportive of our thesis that MSFT has once again become a destination for top tech talent, with annual ratings consistently improving and ahead of peers," writes UBS. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella looks especially good, by the report's reckoning. At the close of 2013, the final days of former chief executive Steve Ballmer's reign, Microsoft only gave a 51% rating for CEO approval. Nadella took the reigns in February 2014, and the CEO approval rating hit 88% by the end of 2015. This year isn't over just yet, but Microsoft is now performing around 10% higher in employee satisfaction than the industry average, says UBS, which edges out Apple. Jeff Weiner (left), Satya Nadella (middle), Reid Hoffman (right)Microsoft Meanwhile, LinkedIn, which Microsoft bought in a blockbuster $26.2 billion deal earlier in 2016, isn't as happy as it used to be. LinkedIn used to the very best tech company in the UBS rankings, with 17% higher satisfaction levels than the average, and a 95% approval rating for CEO Jeff Weiner. Since the deal was announced, it's down to 11% higher and an 85% CEO approval rating — not bad, and still 3rd overall, but a disappointing comedown for the enterprise social network. Under Nadella, Microsoft has refocused itself around providing services and tools via a subscription model, even when that means delivering products for one-time enemies like the Apple iPhone, Google's Android, or the Linux operating system. That freedom seems to have revitalized the company's developers and engineers.

News Stocks Technology Healthcare Politics World Videos The Tape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeNewsAAPL Stock: Samsung’s GN7 Issues May Be Structurally Beneficial to Apple AAPL Stock: Samsung’s GN7 Issues May Be Structurally Beneficial to Apple Street analysts see a number of indicators pointing to a better than expected iPhone 7 sales cycle. October 16, 2016 WSP Shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) edged up 2 percent this week to print the tape at $117.63 in recent trade Friday, as news of Samsung permanently suspending the sale and production of its Note 7 smartphone deepened overnight. Samsung late Tuesday, issued a revised earnings forecast for Q316, saying it now sees its operating profit at $4.6 billion, down 33 percent from an earlier estimate. “What we have seen in previous share shifts..is that once people shift away, they don’t come back, because Apple has such high customer loyalty ratings, on the order of 90%,” Credit Suisse’s Kulbinder Garcha, who currently rates Apple stock ‘Outperform’, with a $150 price target, told CNBC, noting that Samsung’s problems may be structurally beneficial to Apple. Garcha also said that he sees positive indicators pointing to a good momentum for the iPhone 7 cycle, estimating 48 million/75 million units in C3Q16/C4Q16. Alongside Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS), Goldman Sachs’ (NYSE:GS) analyst Simona Jankowski also issued a research report, arguing that iPhone 7 demand is tracking ahead of expectations driven by the one week earlier than expected launch, better than expected carrier promotions, and Samsung Note 7 issues. Jankowski raised her September and December quarter iPhone unit estimates by 1 million and  2 million [M] units to 45.6M and 78.1M, respectively. It is to be noted though that if the revenues of Apple suppliers are any indicator, then the iPhone 7 may not be doing as well as Apple and its stockholders were hoping the gadget would. According to a ‘Nikkei Asian Review’ report rolled out Wednesday, major Taiwanese tech companies are seeing slumping Sept. sales amid weak iPhone 7 sales. According to the publication, the “revenue of 19 Taiwanese tech companies on the Nikkei Asian Review’s watch list fell 1.52% from a year ago, compared with a year-on-year gain of 5% in August after a prolonged 9-month drop.” Analyst Jeff Pu with Yuanta Investment Consulting estimates Apple’s total iPhone 7 builds to be 74 million in the second half of 2016, compared to 84 million for iPhone 6s in second half of 2015. Meanwhile, in her research Jankowski wrote that she expects Apple to report a solid fourth-quarter-2016 beat on October 25. Wall Street is looking for EPS of $1.66 and revenue of $5.26 billion. Last quarter, the tech giant posted a positive earnings surprise of 2.90%, reporting EPS of $1.42, $0.04 better than the Street’s consensus estimate of $1.38. Revenue however, fell 14.52% year-over-year to $42.4 billion versus the $49.6 billion reported. The GS analyst rates Apple a ‘Buy’ with a $124 price target. Separately, Apple was also raised to $130 from $120 at Mizuho. Apple Stock Action Shares of Apple are on an impressive run. The equity has advanced 8.70% in the last 4 weeks and 19.42% in the past three months. Over the past six months the stock, which currently has 31 analysts rating it a ‘Buy’ versus only 2 rating it a ‘Sell’, has gained 7.08 percent. On a year-over-year basis, AAPL is up 7.21% compared with a 7.15% gain in the S&P 500. The $637.3 billion market cap Cupertino, Calif.-based company currently has a median Street price target of $125 with a high target of $185.

Please use a supported version for the best MSN experience. Apps to keep you in tune with the times The Guardian 10/16/2016 Stuart Dredge © Provided by Guardian News Bruce Springsteen in concert last month. There has, arguably, never been a better time to be a music fan, with more ways to discover, listen to and share music than ever before, even if disputes about how much the artists make from these services continue to rumble. The big streaming services like Spotify, Apple Music and Deezer may be familiar, but a host of other apps lie beyond those, from daily suggestions of new tunes to games that create levels based on your songs – via automated DJs, mobile gig tickets and “lip-dub” videos. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 108.43 +0.64 +0.59% 1 | Vevo (Android/iOS) If you’re looking for music videos, Vevo should be your first port of call: it has a wide selection, along with exclusive live performances and interviews. The more you use it, the better its recommendations get. 2 | Dice (Android/iOS) Dice is a mobile ticketing app: you buy tickets for concerts within it, and then show your phone to enter on the night. The big draw: no booking fees, and also the promise of smart recommendations for new bands you might love. Related: Spotify UK revenues surge to almost £190m as mobile subscriptions take off 3 | Pacemaker (iOS) Pacemaker started as an inventive app to DJ with your Spotify collection. It’s becoming something more interesting though: an artificial-intelligence DJ that does the mixing (and even chooses the songs, if you want) for you. 4 | BBC Music (Android/iOS) The BBC has so much music across its networks, it’s easy to miss things you’d like. This app aims to avoid that, pulling together live sessions and playlists from presenters and shows, tying in with Spotify, Deezer and YouTube as well. 5 | WhoSampled (Android/iOS) If you want to dig deeper into the music you love, WhoSampled will soak up hours of your time. It scans your iTunes or Spotify library and lets you go back in time via the samples in your songs – as well as remixes and cover versions. 6 | Genius (Android/iOS) The perfect companion for WhoSampled: this app provides annotated lyrics for more than 1.7m songs. So, not just the words, but fellow fans’ explanations of what they mean and key people and places referenced within them. 7 | Musical.ly (Android/iOS) In 2016, Musical.ly has become a bona-fide app craze, with more than 120 million users. Teenagers in particular have adopted it to create short “lip-dub” videos, where they dance and mime to their favourite songs. 8 | Combo.fm (iOS) If you like a bit more human in your music recommendations, Combo.fm is excellent. Its team suggests a few songs every day, with text explaining why it’s been chosen, and the ability to save the ones you like to a Spotify playlist.© Provided by Guardian News The Beatles with producer George Martin at Abbey Road Studios, London, 1967. 9 | Inside Abbey Road (Android/iOS) You’ll need a Google Cardboard virtual reality headset to make the most of this app, which gives you a 360-degree guided tour of London’s famous recording studio, including sitting in on a session with the London Symphony Orchestra. 10 | Vibble (iOS) This is another DJ-ing app that promises to do the hard work for you: you create a playlist and then mix smoothly between songs by swiping your finger across the screen. It can use songs from your iTunes collection as well as SoundCloud. 11 | White Label – Hip-Hop (Android / iOS) If you’re looking for a concentrated burst of new hip-hop tracks, White Label is a great place to start. It mines SoundCloud for the freshest tunes, and serves them up as a playable chart. The same developer’s Wonder app focuses on indie. 12 | Riff Racer (iOS) This futuristic racing game has a clever twist: it creates its tracks based on songs in your collection, or (if you’re a subscriber) Apple Music playlists. This is more than a gimmick: you race in time to the music, to gripping effect. 13 | Mimi Music (Android/iOS) This new app is aimed at anybody who has hearing problems – including loss of frequencies if you’ve been to one too many gigs without earplugs. It measures your “earprint” and then tunes music specifically for the way you hear. 14 | Loopimal (iOS) In theory, this app is for children: a creative way to make music with colourful creatures who dance and play loops of audio. It works beautifully but is such fun that parents will find it hard to resist playing when the kids are in bed. 15 | Shazam (Android/iOS/Windows) This app has been downloaded more than a billion times so far, with its core use being to identify a song playing in the real world – whether on a TV soundtrack or in a club. Its newer features include recommendations and the ability to follow artists to see what they’re Shazaming. 16 | Songkick Concerts (Android/iOS) This app is free but it could hit your wallet in the long run – in the best way. Songkick scans your digital-music service of choice to find out who you like, and then pings you whenever they announce a gig nearby, so that you can buy tickets. 17 | Mixcloud (Android/iOS) The big music-streaming services focus on tracks, albums and playlists but Mixcloud is all about radio-like “shows” and mixes from DJs and podcasters. It’s great for whiling away an hour or two at a time with the tastemaker of your choice. 18 | Lost Music (iOS) Like Combo.fm, Lost Music wants to recommend new music to you, and it works with a selection of influential music blogs and brands to do it. There are plenty of new tracks every day, with Spotify and Apple Music subscribers able to listen in full. 19 | RA Guide (iOS) If you’re into dance music, you need RA Guide on your homescreen. Like its parent website, it’s a comprehensive guide to club nights and DJ sets near you, including tracking your favourite artists. You can buy tickets too. 20 | Lumines Puzzle & Music (Android/iOS) Originally a Sony PSP game in 2005, Lumines has returned as an addictive musical-puzzle game for smartphones and tablets. You have to match coloured blocks to make them disappear, playing to the beat of a range of earworm-worthy dance tracks.

By Sarmistha Acharya October 16, 2016 11:36 BST How to reinstall macOS Sierra Reuters If you plan to sell your Mac for some reason you might want to restore it to the out-of-box state. For this, you could consider reinstalling macOS on it, which would clean up your data or Apple ID from your Mac. There are a few more steps you need to perform before reinstalling macOS such as creating a backup of your data and signing out of iTunes, iCloud and iMessage. Once these are done you are ready to proceed. Do note that to download and reinstall macOS using recovery, you will need an internet connection that meets a set of requirements such as the following: The connection should be configured to use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) over Wi-Fi or ethernet. Make sure the connection does not use 802.1X or other certificate-based authentication or proxy server. If the internet connection uses WEP or WPA-Enterprise security protocols, you can use macOS recovery. If it is on a captive network then use macOS recovery not macOS Internet Recovery. Once a proper connection is established, perform the following steps to reinstall macOS. How to reinstall macOS Sierra Start your Mac from recovery. For this hold down Command + R keys immediately after turning on or restarting your device. When you see the utilities window, know that the Startup process is complete Launch Disk Utility from the utilities window then use Disk Utility to erase your built-in hard disk through Mac OS Extended (Journaled) format.

This process will install macOS Sierra When the process is complete, your Mac restarts to a setup assistant. At this moment press Command + Q keys, then click Shut Down. You can now complete the steps of the setup assistant using your details. If you are reinstalling macOS Sierra for reasons other than selling: Put your mac in Recovery by holding down Command-R key soon when you power-on or restart your Mac. Release the keys when the Apple logo appears on the screen If you want to erase your disk after reinstalling, open Disk Utility from the utilities window, then use Disk Utility to erase the disk. Quit Disk Utility when the process is complete Select Reinstall macOS from the utilities window and follow the on-screen prompts There are other ways to reinstall macOS Sierra, one of which is through the Time Machine backup.

The company said of the new freedom that the tethers didn’t allow customers to interact with the product properly, try out cases or see how much space it takes up in their pocket or handbag. But how will Apple deal with unsavory types placing the phone in their pocket and walking out? Alarms will ring if you try to filch the phone, says the company, and if all else fails Apple will turn the smartphone into a paperweight by blocking it. The unleashing test is going on at London’s flagship store, but if successful may be rolled out here next year. Computers and iPads will remain under lock and leash, however.

By Sarmistha Acharya October 16, 2016 10:21 BST You can remove stock apps from the home screen of your device is running iOS 10 Apple If you do not want built-in apps on the home screen of your iOS 10 device, Apple has an option to remove them. Removing apps from the home screen will also remove related user data and the configuration file associated with the particular app. This will also affect related system functions on Apple Watch. If your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch is running iOS 10, you can remove apps such as Calculator, Calendar, Compass, Contacts, FaceTime, Find My Friends, Home, iBooks, iCloud drive, iTunes Store, Mail, Maps, Music, News, Notes, Podcasts, Reminders, Stocks, Tips, Videos, Voice memos, Watch app and Weather. But keep in mind that built-in iOS apps take together less than 150MB of space, hence removing them does not free up space on the device. How to remove built-in iOS apps from home screen • Touch and hold an app on the home screen until it begins to jiggle • Tap the X mark appearing on the app, then tap Remove • Press the Home button to complete If you want to add a built-in app that you have removed previously, follow the steps below: • Go to App Store then search for that particular app. Tap the icon with an arrow facing downward to restore the app • Wait for the restore process to finish. Now open the app from the home screen. What happens after you remove apps? If you remove Contacts, the contact information will remain in the Phone app. If you remove FaceTime app, you can still make and receive calls in Contacts and Phone. You will not be able to use iBooks, Maps, Music or Podcast with CarPlay, if you remove them. When you remove the Watch app from iPhone that is paired with an Apple Watch, you should see an alert asking you to unpair your Apple Watch first. If you remove Stocks or Weather app, they will not be available elsewhere and you will not find them in Notification centre on your iPhone, nor Complications or Glances on Apple Watch. If you remove Calculator, it will not be appear in the Control centre. More from IBTimes UK iPhone 7 review: Return of the king or time to hand over the crown?

The festival was sponsored by the Washington Fire Company and its Martha Washington Auxiliary. Image Gallery for Applefest big draw in Ashland Lightbox link Lightbox link Lightbox link Lightbox link ASHLAND — The lines were long but the food was worth the wait Saturday at the 13th annual Ashland Applefest. The event was held from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. near Eighth and Centre streets and was sponsored by the Washington Fire Company and Martha Washington Ladies Auxiliary. “We are pretty thrilled with the turnout, that’s for sure,” Gail Jones, auxiliary member, said. The fire company and ladies auxiliary took over the event in 2015 from Ashland Downtown Inc. She said that they opened the event up to vendors from outside the area this year to add variety. New additions included Vince’s Famous Cheesesteaks and Wilburton Fire Company, which made bleenies. Meanwhile, returning vendors included Bissinger’s Apple Dumplings, May’s Drive-In, Pasta House Eatery, M&M Sandwich Shop and Boyer’s Food Market. In addition to food, there was pumpkin decorating, a basket raffle and live music. “We didn’t want to see it stop because we know it is important to the residents to have an event like this,” Ray Jones, assistant fire chief and borough manager, said. The event was a fundraiser for the Washington Fire Company to replace their 1959 ladder truck. Ray Jones said community support for the fire companies has always been “fantastic.” “They always supported us,” he said. “Any fundraiser we put on, the people are great.” He said attendance was twice that of last year, possibly due to the nice weather. Erika and Kirstin Evans, Ashland, said they come every year for the apple dumplings. Kirstin’s daughter, Aubrey Pukavage, 3, was eating her second apple while they chatted with friends. “It’s good for Ashland, for the community,” Kirstin said. Jill Zimmerman, Ashland, and Sasha Reigle, Shamokin, also brought their children for apple dumplings. “They should have more events like this,” Zimmerman said. Winter Carnival royalty also attended the event. “I’m excited for the apple dumplings and cheesesteaks,” 2016 Winter Carnival Queen of the Snows Meghan Devlin, Schuylkill Haven, said. Devlin attended the event with Snowdrop Princess Elena Holden, Pottsville. It was their first time at Applefest. She said that they made it a point to be there since Winter Carnival Princess Rachael Cataldo is from Ashland. “I think events like this are fantastic,” Devlin said. Cataldo said she comes to Applefest every year for apple dumplings and french fries. “It’s a great way to bring the community together,” she said. “There is something for every age group.” We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.

Apple Has a Backup Solution If the iPhone 7 Home Button Breaks Down GO iOS 10 warns of the issue and offers a software workaround Oct 16, 2016 07:41 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  One of the changes on the new iPhone 7 is the introduction of a touch-sensitive Home button that replaces the mechanical one available on the previous generations, but although at first glance this brings several advantages, it also leads to a series of problems should it not work correctly. Apple, however, seems to be ready for those moments when the Home button doesn’t react properly and is offering a workaround until the iPhone 7 is brought to the Apple Store for servicing. A user on the MacRumors forums has posted a screenshot of a warning message displayed by iOS 10 after the Home button failed. “The Home button may need service,” this notification reads, adding that “in the meantime, you can use the onscreen Home button below.” A small round Home button appeared on screen at the bottom of the display. The road to the 2017 iPhone Although it’s not clear why the Home button actually failed so soon given the fact that the iPhone 7 launched nearly one month ago, the original poster explains that the Taptic Engine vibrated several times, and rebooting the device didn’t make any difference. “The Haptic engine kept firing 3-4 times in a row for every ‘press.’ I restarted again and it’s back to not working,” he added. What would be more interesting, however, is to find out how the onscreen button trick would actually work in the case of a Home button which not only fails but can no longer detect the fingerprint for authentication. Servicing might be the only option in this case, though. The new Home button is believed to be the first step towards a complete removal on the 2017 iPhone, as Apple is believed to be heading towards a new design that would incorporate it in the screen. Furthermore, the touch-sensitive version means that the iPhone 7 comes with fewer mechanical parts and allows for waterproofing, which the device has indeed achieved with the IP67 rating. iOS 10 warning of faulty Home button   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Apple#iPhone 7#iPhone 7 Home button#iOS 10 subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple to Officially Kill Off the iPhone 4 on October 31 Apple Seeds Third Developer Beta of watchOS 3.1 Apple Watch Operating System iOS Far Behind Android Despite Strong iPhone SE Sales “Good Guy” Samsung: iPhone 7 to Sell 8 Million More Units After Note 7 Fiasco Five Great Calendar Apps for Android HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile: The PC Experience Motorola DROID Turbo 3 with 16MP Hasselblad Camera Leaks in Press Renders New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked Nikon Updates Firmware for Its COOLPIX A300 Camera - Get Version 1.2 Microsoft Releases Interactive Mail Notifications for All Windows 10 Users KDE Neon Users Urged to Upgrade Their Systems or Reinstall the Linux Distro Budgie 11 Desktop Environment to Feature a Dock Mode for the Panel, Richer UI - Exclusive 2 photos    This is the new touch-sensitive Home button on the iPhone 7 new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Load old comments   iPhone 7 Becomes Best-Selling Smartphone, Pushes Apple Closer to Android more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Photograph: IBL/Rex/Shutterstock Stuart Dredge @stuartdredge Sunday 16 October 2016 02.59 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger There has, arguably, never been a better time to be a music fan, with more ways to discover, listen to and share music than ever before, even if disputes about how much the artists make from these services continue to rumble. The big streaming services like Spotify, Apple Music and Deezer may be familiar, but a host of other apps lie beyond those, from daily suggestions of new tunes to games that create levels based on your songs – via automated DJs, mobile gig tickets and “lip-dub” videos. 1 | Vevo (Android/iOS) If you’re looking for music videos, Vevo should be your first port of call: it has a wide selection, along with exclusive live performances and interviews. The more you use it, the better its recommendations get. 2 | Dice (Android/iOS) Dice is a mobile ticketing app: you buy tickets for concerts within it, and then show your phone to enter on the night. The big draw: no booking fees, and also the promise of smart recommendations for new bands you might love. Spotify UK revenues surge to almost £190m as mobile subscriptions take off Read more 3 | Pacemaker (iOS) Pacemaker started as an inventive app to DJ with your Spotify collection. It’s becoming something more interesting though: an artificial-intelligence DJ that does the mixing (and even chooses the songs, if you want) for you. 4 | BBC Music (Android/iOS) The BBC has so much music across its networks, it’s easy to miss things you’d like. This app aims to avoid that, pulling together live sessions and playlists from presenters and shows, tying in with Spotify, Deezer and YouTube as well. 5 | WhoSampled (Android/iOS) If you want to dig deeper into the music you love, WhoSampled will soak up hours of your time. It scans your iTunes or Spotify library and lets you go back in time via the samples in your songs – as well as remixes and cover versions. 6 | Genius (Android/iOS) The perfect companion for WhoSampled: this app provides annotated lyrics for more than 1.7m songs. So, not just the words, but fellow fans’ explanations of what they mean and key people and places referenced within them. 7 | Musical.ly (Android/iOS) In 2016, Musical.ly has become a bona-fide app craze, with more than 120 million users. Teenagers in particular have adopted it to create short “lip-dub” videos, where they dance and mime to their favourite songs. 8 | Combo.fm (iOS) If you like a bit more human in your music recommendations, Combo.fm is excellent. Its team suggests a few songs every day, with text explaining why it’s been chosen, and the ability to save the ones you like to a Spotify playlist. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Beatles with producer George Martin at Abbey Road Studios, London, 1967. Photograph: Copyright Apple Corps 9 | Inside Abbey Road (Android/iOS) You’ll need a Google Cardboard virtual reality headset to make the most of this app, which gives you a 360-degree guided tour of London’s famous recording studio, including sitting in on a session with the London Symphony Orchestra. 10 | Vibble (iOS) This is another DJ-ing app that promises to do the hard work for you: you create a playlist and then mix smoothly between songs by swiping your finger across the screen. It can use songs from your iTunes collection as well as SoundCloud. 11 | White Label – Hip-Hop (Android / iOS) If you’re looking for a concentrated burst of new hip-hop tracks, White Label is a great place to start. It mines SoundCloud for the freshest tunes, and serves them up as a playable chart. The same developer’s Wonder app focuses on indie. 12 | Riff Racer (iOS) This futuristic racing game has a clever twist: it creates its tracks based on songs in your collection, or (if you’re a subscriber) Apple Music playlists. This is more than a gimmick: you race in time to the music, to gripping effect. 13 | Mimi Music (Android/iOS) This new app is aimed at anybody who has hearing problems – including loss of frequencies if you’ve been to one too many gigs without earplugs. It measures your “earprint” and then tunes music specifically for the way you hear. 14 | Loopimal (iOS) In theory, this app is for children: a creative way to make music with colourful creatures who dance and play loops of audio. It works beautifully but is such fun that parents will find it hard to resist playing when the kids are in bed. 15 | Shazam (Android/iOS/Windows) This app has been downloaded more than a billion times so far, with its core use being to identify a song playing in the real world – whether on a TV soundtrack or in a club. Its newer features include recommendations and the ability to follow artists to see what they’re Shazaming. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Bruce Springsteen in concert last month. Photograph: Elizabeth Robertson/AP 16 | Songkick Concerts (Android/iOS) This app is free but it could hit your wallet in the long run – in the best way. Songkick scans your digital-music service of choice to find out who you like, and then pings you whenever they announce a gig nearby, so that you can buy tickets. 17 | Mixcloud (Android/iOS) The big music-streaming services focus on tracks, albums and playlists but Mixcloud is all about radio-like “shows” and mixes from DJs and podcasters. It’s great for whiling away an hour or two at a time with the tastemaker of your choice. 18 | Lost Music (iOS) Like Combo.fm, Lost Music wants to recommend new music to you, and it works with a selection of influential music blogs and brands to do it. There are plenty of new tracks every day, with Spotify and Apple Music subscribers able to listen in full. 19 | RA Guide (iOS) If you’re into dance music, you need RA Guide on your homescreen. Like its parent website, it’s a comprehensive guide to club nights and DJ sets near you, including tracking your favourite artists. You can buy tickets too. 20 | Lumines Puzzle & Music (Android/iOS) Originally a Sony PSP game in 2005, Lumines has returned as an addictive musical-puzzle game for smartphones and tablets. You have to match coloured blocks to make them disappear, playing to the beat of a range of earworm-worthy dance tracks.

By Oliver Cragg , James Billington , James Etherington-Smith October 16, 2016 06:00 BST Which wireless headphones will top the charts?IBTimes UK No one likes cables. They are cumbersome, unwieldy and have a habit of tangling themselves into shapes that circumvent the laws of physics. This goes doubly so for headphone leads, which have an artful knack of catching on rogue coat buttons or bag straps. Wireless headphones carry some innate downsides - charging, occasional disconnects and usually a slight drop in sound quality - but the untethered comfort is often worth the trade-offs. With Apple making the "courageous" decision to jettison the headphone jack from its latest iOS smartphone, the iPhone 7, wireless headphones will receive renewed interest from audiophile shoppers. To see which offer the best sound, comfort, battery, design and price, IBTimes UK has tried and tested the ten best Bluetooth headphones for budgets ranging from £70 to £400. AKG Y50BT AKG Our verdict AKG Y50BT review Comfort and fit: AKG has upped the size of its usual tiny pads and the chunky, synthetic closed-cups are delicate on the ears. Pity about the thin, plastic headband then, which can feel like it's jutting into your skull. Battery: Around 18-20 hours use, with the option to carry on listening via a 3.5mm cable (complete with mic and remote). Sound: 40mm driver delivers weighty bass, but the mids are overpowered during more nuanced songs. Excellent for the price, however, and could pass itself off for a £200 pair with ease. No dedicated noise cancelling, but closed-back, on-ear design keeps out most of the hustle and bustle on busy streets. Design: Minimal sound leakage and the 3D Axis frame can be flipped, twisted and bent into all manner of shapes for stashing it away in a bag. Neoprene carry-pouch included in the box. All caps branding and bright colours may be a bit much for those over the age of 25. Price and value: Steely, brash bass, a neat, pliable design, and an attention-grabbing look - what's not to like for under £150? Sound balance will leave a little to be desired for true audiophiles, but a bargain for indulging in a quick 'banger' or two. Bang & Olufsen BeoPlay H8 Bang & Olufsen Our verdict Bang & Olufsen BeoPlay H8 wireless Comfort and fit: A tight, but comfy fit for on-ear headphones, with lush sheepskin pads. Weighty head-strap can cause some accidental slips while on the go. Battery: Solid, but not spectacular -around 10-12 hours as standard. Has the advantage of a removable battery pack for those looking to pack a spare. Sound: Impressive noise cancelling and a smooth, textured sound, but lacks the dynamic punch of its similarly priced rivals. Design: Classic B&O. Sleek, brushed metal and sturdy hinges, but at the cost of flexibility and portability. No option to fold up for easy storage. Touch controls are a bit fidly. Price and value: At £399 the BeoPlay H8s are in the upper echelon price-wise and there's a sense that the B&O branding is bumping up the cost here. An aspirational product to delight the eyes of onlookers as much as your own senses. Sennheiser Momentum Wireless Sennheiser Our verdict Sennheiser Momentum Wireless headphones Comfort and fit: Memory foam, leather-covered pads provide unparalleled comfort for extended listening sessions. Requires an initial adjustment, but the lightweight, gorgeously snug fit leads the pack. Battery: Even with always-on noise cancelling, the Momentums can almost last an entire 24 hours after a full charge for wireless use (3.5mm cable also included). Sound: Gorgeous mids and layered, meaty bass let soft, vocal-led ballads sing and metal tracks roar. Not quite up to studio standards, but enough texture to mentally zone out a busy commute. Design: The unique, retro-style is both eye-catching and classy. Cups fold up nicely for storage in the bundled carry case. Price and value: Top tier style and comfort comes at a lofty price of £379.99, but with excellent sound quality, NFC connectivity, bold looks and impressive longevity, the Momentum Wireless is money well spent. Skullcandy Grind Wireless Skullcandy Our verdict Skullcandy Grind Wireless Comfort and fit: Inadequate padding can leave your ears aching after even minimal use. Lack of swivel and tilt means your head better be the right shape for these to sit comfortably. Battery: 12 hours claimed, and 12 hours if you don't push them at 100% volume all day. Enough to just about survive a week of work commutes. Sound: Overall decent sound quality, although it could do with a touch more richness in the bass tones. As expected, while listening via Bluetooth, audio quality takes a dip. Design: The build feels sturdy enough in its simplicity. The range of colour combinations should suit most tastes. Foldability and a carry bag would have been a nice touch. Price and value: £69.99 is just about right for the ostentatious looks, decent sound, and wireless freedom offered by the Grind Wireless. Bose QuietComfort 35 Bose Our verdict Bose QuietComfort 35 Comfort and fit: Generous cushions and a faux-leather finish make the earphones very comfortable to use for long periods of time. So comfy you forget you're even wearing them. Battery: Bose claims battery life is 20 hours, which feels about right. 3.5mm cable as an option, which improves sound quality ever-so-slightly. Sound: Phenomenal performance from the QC25s carries over to its wireless sibling - a full and rich sound which is strong when it needs to be, but also delicate and complex. Noise cancelling is sublime. Design: Distinct, yet tasteful. Noise-cancelling toggle, playback controls and NFC-pairing are all a plus. Price and value: A commuter favourite for good reason. Not cheap at £290, but also not obscenely priced, the QC35s are pure aural bliss. Beats Solo 3 Beats by Dre Our verdict Beats Solo 3 Wireless Comfort and fit: Thick faux-leather ear pads and a padded headband create a comfortable feel, but the tight on-ear design can get a little hot and cause inner-ear aches after extended use. Battery: Best in class - up to a whopping 40 hours on one charge, easily two weeks worth of commutes. In a pinch, the Fast Fuel tech gives three hours playback off of five minutes charge. Sound: Robust bass that doesn't wash out the clear mid tones, but high-range and vocals can get swept away. No noise cancelling, but solid design keeps ambient noise at bay. Design: Solid build quality. Media control buttons with tactile feedback seamlessly integrated. Foldable construction and carry case makes a slim footprint in your bag. Optional 3.5mm headphone jack. Price and Value: At £249.95 the Beats Solo 3 Wireless obviously aren't cheap considering the competition, but the phenomenal battery life, solid sound and fashionable looks keep the Solo 3s in contention - especially if you have an iPhone 7, as the W1 connectivity is utterly seamless (also compatible with Bluetooth). Bowers & Wilkins P7 Wireless Bowers & Wilkins Our verdict B&W P7 Wireless Comfort and fit: Memory foam over-ear cushions firmly (yet satisfyingly) clamp onto the head, brilliantly blocking unwanted outside din. They're slightly hefty but there's a lot of space around the ears to keep things airy and sweat-free, which is handy as you'll be wanting to wear these a lot. Battery: 17 hours is a hearty offering of juice, enough or a long-haul trip or keeping commuters happy . When you've quaffed it all they can be recharged via USB. Sound: As athletic an audio performance as you're going to get, this flagship pair can masterfully knock bassy numbers out the park and race along the range to accurately deliver delicate acoustic tracks from its detailed high-end. There's a large soundstage, excellent separation and the inclusion of aptX Bluetooth codec for higher quality wireless results in a class act with pure acoustical adrenalin running through its wires. Design: The design and finish from the P5 and wired P7 carries on here, which is no bad thing as every inch of the black leather and brushed aluminium finish is premium. The look classy and round-off the package with convenient folding design. Price and value: They're £320, but those who love their audio will happily swallow the sizeable price tag and they'll be rewarded – they offer the best quality sound of all pairs on test plus a sophisticated look, which isn't easy to achieve for over-ear headphones. Denon AH-GC20 Denon Our verdict Denon AH-GC20 Comfort and fit: Soft and cushy cups offer one of the nicest fits around ears while the synthetic leather material remains cool under prolonged use. If being lightweight is top of your wish list, these tick the box. Battery: Denon claims you'll get 20-hours from the GC20s. Turning noise cancelling on dramatically reduced this but they still put up respectable numbers to contend.  Sound: With active noise cancellation these go up against the Bose QC35s for the traveller's choice and do a good job at snuffing out layers of outside noise. However, they weren't as effective as the QC35 and when it comes to audio it was a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde affair. With ANC off audio was wooly, overblown with muddy separation. Better when turned on, especially on bass heavy tracks but the mid and high range is nowhere near as clear as we'd want for the price. Design: The AH-GC20 go traditional with a black and metal finish, carrying off an expensive look that'll age well. We like the swivel-and-fold action ready for life in a travel bag and music control buttons are well-placed. Price and value:  At £170 these are around £100 cheaper than the Bose QC35, which makes them a tempting option. Audiophiles will notice the poorer sound quality but for casual listeners who want comfort and convenience these are worth a look. Philips Fidelio M2BT Philips Our verdict Philips Fidelio M2BT Wireless Bluetooth headphones Comfort and fit: The Philips Fidelio M2BT are surprisingly comfortable for an on-ear design, thanks to memory foam cushioning and a woven fabric headband. Battery: 10 hours playback on a full charge is relatively poor, though we found that these went for almost 15 hours when we tested them fresh out of the box. Sound: A rich and balanced sound that offers a suitable follow up to the excellent M1BTs. A lack of active noise-cancelling can allow external sounds to creep in. Design: A simple, sturdy and compact design that holds the controls in the right ear cup. A small wheel adjusts the volume, while a button pauses music and answers calls. Price and value: At £200 the Philips are strong option for anyone looking for a quality pair of on-ear headphones, though no match for most of the higher-end over-ear pairs. Onkyo H500BT Onkyo Our verdict Onkyo H500BT Comfort and fit: lightweight, good padding on the earcups and pivot on the arms makes for a comfy fit, while the tension on the headband is just about right for a secure fit. Battery: You can just about squeeze out the marketed 16 hours of playback, while 350 hours of standby time means you likely won't be caught flat. Sound: Great sound quality with rich bass and clear mids and highs and no hints of buzz and rattle. Closed back design and a good seal on the earcups keeps outside noise where it belongs. Design: The lightweight construction is appreciated but the set does come off feeling plasticky, which is a pity because on inspection it seems quite robust. The touch controls perform admirably. Choose black over the white option as this will instantly become grubby. Price and value: £199 might seem like a bit much for those wanting top quality sound, Bluetooth freedom, and snappy looks. Two out of three isn't bad though.

And yet the category, once considered nothing more than a collection of glorified activity trackers, is starting to see some real traction. Apple, which released the second version of its Apple Watch in early September, may no longer be selling the 18-karat-gold style that retailed for as much as $17,000, but a number of Swiss makers have stepped in to fill its place with more affordably priced models that seamlessly marry tradition and modernity. Taking their style cues from their analog predecessors, the latest connected timepieces make clear that despite centuries of watchmaking heritage, the Swiss are ready and able to evolve. Robbreport.com highlights five new smart watches worthy of the luxury label, and two accessories that add smarts to classic timepieces.  View Slideshow Watches Breitling De Grisogono Montblanc TAG Heuer Frederique Constant Alpina Featured Slideshows 3 Milestone Motorcycles from Ducati While World Ducati Week was taking place in July in Misano, Italy, about 85 miles away in Bologna—where Ducati is based—the company reopened its museum following a months-long renovation.

Coverage of Disruptive Science and Technology Forum About Contact Facebook twitter Google October 13, 2016 Foxconn reaches 40,000 robots of original 1 million robot automation goal apple, artificial intelligence, china, economic impact, ipad, iphone, jobs, robotics, tablets, taiwan Facebook Twitter linkedin google Reddit In 2011, Foxconn had announced a plan to replace 500,000 mainland Chinese workers with 1 million robots over the next 3-5 years. Foxconn is the company that builds Apple's iPhone and iPad hardware and many of the android smartphones as well. Foxconn, has so far installed 40,000 production robots across China as it looks to minimize the number of people it employs. With the exception of some components like servo motors and speed reducers, the robots are being built entirely in-house, Foxconn's Dai Chia-peng told Taiwan's Central News Agency, as quoted by DigiTimes. It's unclear how many of the so-called "Foxbots" are being used to manufacture Apple products. The machines are, however, said to be operating an industrial facility in Zhengzhou, a tablet plant in Chengdu, and computer/peripherals plants in Kunshan and Jiashan. Dai commented that Foxconn is currently manufacturing 10,000 robots per year. Each one can potentially go far towards replacing human labor —in Kunshan alone, Foxconn is known to have cut 60,000 workers. Thirty-five Taiwanese companies, including Apple’s supplier Foxconn, spent a total of 4 billion yuan (HK$4.74 billion) on artificial intelligence last year, according to the Kunshan government’s publicity department. So it was robotics, artificial intelligence, process changes and demand changes that impacted the workforce. As many as 600 major companies in Kunshan have similar plans, according to a government survey. The job cuts do not augur well for Kunshan, which had a population of more than 2.5 million at the end of 2014, two-thirds of whom were migrant workers. Factories and other buildings cover about 46 per cent of the land – a figure which is far higher than the cap set by the central ­government. The local government, which was reshuffled after the blast, has promised to maintain zero growth in land development and decrease its population by 2020. Kunshan’s latest growth figure is far from impressive. The county grew by less than 3 per cent in 2014 and 2015 amid the central leadership’s bid to restructure the world’s second largest economy into a greener, more tech-intensive one. Xu Xujiong, head of a local firm, Huaneng Welding, reflected on the hard times faced by the local units owing to the transition. At its peak, Kunshan manufactured 120 million laptops a year, but output had fallen to only 51 million because of falling demand, said local officials. Smartphone manufacturing, however, is trying to bridge the gap – about 20 million units were made last year. Kunshan is home to about 4,800 Taiwanese companies, which contribute over 60 per cent of its GDP, and the county is encouraging more people from across the strait to start businesses there to boost its economy.

While contracts are a good way for cash-strapped customers to get the phone they want right away, they can also get onerous really fast. For 24 months, you’re tied down to the same carrier, regardless of the quality of service, and forced to pay a fixed monthly fee, plus any surcharges for going over your limits. And should you choose to get out of that contract before it’s done, early termination fees can, and will apply. As such, many consumers would rather pay for their device upfront, never mind the significant dent on their budget, just as long as they don’t have to be stuck to restrictive contracts. Fortunately, both the unlocked iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are now selling in America, allowing buyers to own one of Apple’s 2016 flagship phones without any contractual obligations. If you’re interested in this SIM-free option, which can be used on any carrier’s network, you can go to Apple’s online storefront and use the configurator to choose which size iPhone you want. After that, select “SIM-free” instead of selecting a carrier, and you’re off. You can now buy a completely unlocked, SIM-free #iPhone7: https://t.co/UX0ErViaAr pic.twitter.com/XdZPY6tDs0 — Highsnobiety (@highsnobiety) October 14, 2016 Due to incredible demand for most iPhone 7 variants, shipping may take a while for a lot of buyers. According to Mashable, the SIM-free, unlocked iPhone 7 will ship quickly enough for most color options, and should arrive in one-to-three business days. Those who prefer the Jet Black flavor, however, will have to wait it out for about three-to-five weeks. As for the iPhone 7 Plus, most color choices take three-to-four weeks to arrive, with the Jet Black version especially backordered and having an estimated shipping time of six-to-eight weeks. But what if you really, really would want an on-contract or unlocked iPhone 7 in Jet Black, or no iPhone at all? There are indeed a lot of customers who consider color as one of their key selling points when shopping for new phones, and it does seem as if the all-new Jet Black style has attracted quite a lot of attention from potential buyers. However, a separate report from MacRumors suggests that the new color is “at least temporarily” available at several Apple retail stores in the U.S., with the model in question being the larger and rarer iPhone 7 Plus. Basing its information on an iStockNow spot check, MacRumors reported Friday that the Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus variant has some availability in a number of states, and can also be found in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Houston, and a few other major cities. What’s even rarer than the rarest Pokémon? A jet black iPhone 7 plus! They do exist! #iphone7 #jetblack pic.twitter.com/BACNPqkVi1 — Mehdi Shibahara (@MehdiShibahara) October 5, 2016 The publication also explained the reason why the Jet Black iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have been especially hard to come about in the first few weeks since the devices’ September release, citing well-connected KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. “Jet Black iPhones have faced a global shortage as the new high-gloss finish has proven challenging to manufacture. The models suffer from a low casing production yield rate of 60 to 70 percent, meaning that 30 to 40 percent of units do not pass Apple’s quality standards and must be reworked.” There’s no telling how long the Jet Black color will be available in stores, or when the production yield issues for the color option will be sorted out. But for the meantime, the good news is that the unlocked iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are finally out for U.S. buyers, and that on- and off-contract Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus units are now easier to find in physical stores.

KKK rally planned: Can Trump and the GOP disown the Klan? Dogs sniff out invasive species of mussel in Montana Many Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are donating to support a proposition that will appear on a November ballot in California that ends death penalty. By Zhai Yun Tan, Staff October 15, 2016 Save for later Saved Laurene Powell Jobs, founder and chair of Emerson Collective and widow of the late Apple founder Steve Jobs, along with Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa (R) and Rupert Murdoch (L), chairman and CEO of News Corporation, takes part in a panel discussion titled "Immigration Strategy for the Borderless Economy" at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California April 29, 2013. Gus Ruelas/Reuters/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of Some Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have a new goal: Ending executions in California. A proposition to end the death penalty, on the Nov. 8 ballot, has generated significant interest from the tech billionaires, some of them first-time donors to social causes and ballot measures.  “It feels like now the time is right,” Nicholas McKeown, a computer science professor at Stanford University and founder of four tech companies, tells The Los Angeles Times. “Public opinion has changed a lot, and there’s also the general sense that we need to bring about that change in California so that it sweeps across the country to the Supreme Court and nationwide.” Recommended: Top ten highest rated CEOs of 2015 are not the ones you would expect For Silicon Valley to finance social and political causes that they believe in is not unusual. They have backed – or opposed – gay marriage and the 2016 presidential candidates, for example. Some do it in public, while others have reportedly turned to  "dark money" political contributions. Top ten highest rated CEOs of 2015 are not the ones you would expect Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend “My objection to the death penalty is not based on some abstract principle that it’s bad to kill people,” Paul Graham, co-founder of Y Combinator, Silicon Valley’s largest startup factory, told Bloomberg in July. “It’s because so many of the people who get executed are actually innocent. If you look at the way some of these trials are conducted, it’s shocking.”  According to the Death Penalty Information Center, the number of executions nationwide has been falling since the 90s. California has the most number of death row inmates but ranks 17th in number of executions actually carried out. Proposition 62 will replace death penalties with lifelong prison sentences without parole. Stanford Prof. McKeown tops the list of donors to Proposition 62, followed by Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, Mr. Graham, and Laurene Powell Jobs, widow of the former Apple Inc. CEO. Their support, totaling $4.2 million, puts them in opposition with Proposition 66, another ballot initiative that seeks to speed up the death penalty system. The latter is supported by many police associations, prosecutors and sheriffs, and has contributions totaling $4.3 million. Silicon Valley opposition to the state's death penalty in some ways parallels the tendency of its entrepreneurs to donate more to Democratic candidates and to champion liberal causes. According to a Pew Research survey in September, while support for death penalty has fallen over the decades nationally, 72 percent of Republicans favor it compare to 34 percent of Democrats.  Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg’s immigration reform lobbying group FWD.us, has lobbied for a path to citizenship over mass deportation, as advocated by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Google, Apple, Microsoft and other tech companies publicly opposed North Carolina’s anti-LGBT discrimination law this year.  In July, close to 150 current and former executives at technology firms ranging from Apple to Wikipedia signed an open letter condemning Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.  The liberal leanings of Silicon Valley have made it tough for conservative CEOs to be as politically outspoken. The most famous case may be two years ago when Brendan Eich stepped down as chief executive officer of Mozilla Foundation when it was revealed that he supported an anti-gay marriage proposition.   There are also issues that the tech billionaires are condemned for not speaking out on, such as homelessness in San Francisco, a situation that many say Silicon Valley has indirectly caused by pushing up home prices. As reported by USA Today, the San Francisco metropolitan area is home to Twitter, Salesforce, Uber, and Airbnb - yet it  ranks fifth nationally for homelessness rate. While the companies or their executives may be starting to hold more sway in politics, their donations aren’t necessarily a guarantee for influencing public opinion. This isn't the first time the Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have tried to repeal California's death penalty. In 2012, a similar ballot measure that drew at least $7.2 million in donations, including contributions from McKeown and Hastings, failed to pass. Recent polls by USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times find that the more than half of voters are against abolishing the death penalty in the state, and Proposition 62 only has 40 percent of support.  Next up Top ten highest rated CEOs of 2015 are not the ones you would expect Foreign companies that beat Silicon Valley at its own game With racism case, Supreme Court wades into death penalty debate (+video) Print/Reprints About these ads Sponsored Content by LockerDome About these ads Monitor's Best: Top 5 How Americans are handling post-election hate GOP-controlled Congress will still need Democrats Cover Story Why climate change divides us Minority women make big strides on Election Day The president is commander in chief?

The decision to ban the phones came after “nearly 100 incidents of the devices overheating and sometimes injuring owners,” the transportation department stated Friday, according to USA Today. The Galaxy Note 7 has had a short, but troubled history. As the Inquisitr previously reported, Samsung issued a recall of the phones in early September after initial reports of the phones smoking, catching fire, or even exploding began to circulate. The recall entailed pulling millions of the phones from retailers’ shelves in the United States and nine other countries. Samsung traced the problem to the phones’ batteries, but couldn’t identify the exact cause of why the batteries where overheating. CBS News reported at the time that Samsung’s president of their mobile division, Koh Dong-jin, apologized on behalf of Samsung and promised customers who already purchased Galaxy Note 7s that they could exchange them for new smartphones in approximately two weeks. The impression was that Samsung intended to address the issue with the batteries and then resume selling the Galaxy Note 7. After all, the new phone was expected to become the flagship model of Samsung’s mobile division. Initial reviews suggested that the Note 7 might even catapult Samsung ahead of Apple for the first time in the smartphone market. “This is the worst possible timing for Samsung,” CNET‘s Dan Ackerman told CBS News. “They finally have a hit on their hands and it looked like they were finally going to outmatch Apple. This was finally Samsung’s year, and look what happened.” Those hopes came crashing down Tuesday when Samsung announced that it was abandoning production of the Galaxy Note 7, CBS News announced in a subsequent report. That decision came after replacement models of the Galaxy Note 7 continued to catch fire. Samsung Electronics expands its recall of Galaxy Note 7 smartphones in the US to include all replacement devices. https://t.co/bPfvgbYXc4 — The Associated Press (@AP) October 13, 2016 “The world’s largest smartphone company is struggling to regain consumer trust after a first round of recalls,” CBS noted. Samsung estimates that recalling and abandoning the Galaxy Note 7 will cost the company approximately $5.3 billion, according to USA Today. With the flight ban in place, no one can carry a Galaxy Note 7 onto a plane with them or stow it in luggage, Reuters reports. “The flight ban means the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is now considered a forbidden hazardous material under the Federal Hazardous Material Regulations, which block airline passengers or crew from traveling with lithium cells or batteries or portable electronic devices that are likely to generate a dangerous amount of heat,” USA Today explained. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx acknowledged the concerns the ban will surely raise. “We recognize that banning these phones from airlines will inconvenience some passengers, but the safety of all those aboard an aircraft must take priority,” Foxx said, according to Reuters. “We are taking this additional step because even one fire incident inflight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk.” The Transportation Department further warned that attempting to sneak Galaxy Note 7 phones onto planes poses “a catastrophic incident” and advised that anyone attempting to bring one of the phones onto a plane would be “denied boarding” and could face fines. Air passengers caught with Samsung Note 7 phones face fines https://t.co/AIQ7NQC2uC pic.twitter.com/24kkS6Lg5h — Global Issues Web (@globalissuesweb) October 15, 2016 According to USA Today, Samsung received 96 reports of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phone batteries overheating or catching fire in the U.S. alone. Twenty-three of those reports came after the September 15 recall. There have also been reports of at least 13 people suffering burns as a result of the battery malfunctions, along with 47 reports of property being damaged by fires the phones started. Both Samsung and the Transportation Department are attempting to inform as many travelers as possible of the new ban on Galaxy Note 7 phones on all U.S. flights.

By Julian Chokkattu — October 15, 2016 12:50 PM Subscribe to this topic Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Get our daily Tech News recap Mentioned here Samsung Galaxy S7 edge MSRP $799.99 DT Editors' Choice Learn More Also mentioned LG Nexus 5X Google unveiled a slew of devices at its October 4 event, and two of them are smartphones — the Pixel and Pixel XL. You can pre-order both devices right now (if they’re in stock) and they’ll be available on October 20. The smartphone market is saturated with big displays, but those who want smaller handsets usually must settle for budget or mid-tier specifications. There are exceptions, of course, like the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact and the iPhone SE, but flagship small smartphones are few and far between. Related: Pixel phones, Daydream, Home — Oh my! Everything Google revealed at its Oct. 4 event In comes Google’s Pixel, which shares nearly the exact same specifications as the bigger Pixel XL while retaining a 5-inch display. Last year’s 5.2-inch Nexus 5X was not nearly as powerful as the Nexus 6P, and that’s why it had a lower price tag. With the Pixel, you can finally expect flagship specs on a small display. You’re also getting the very best of Android — and near perfect hardware and software integration. Unlike the Nexus lineup, Google handpicked specific parts from HTC — like how Apple uses Foxconn to manufacture the iPhone. Tighter integration between Android OS and the hardware can make all the difference. Below is our breakdown and analysis of the Nexus 5X and the Pixel, which can help you decide if you should cough up the dough to join Google’s new lineup. Performance Google Pixel Nexus 5X Size 143.8 × 69.5 × 7.3mm (5.61 x 2.74 x 0.31 inches) 147 x 72.6 x 7.9mm (5.79 x 2.86 x 0.31 inches) Weight 5.04 ounces (143 grams) 4.80 ounces (135 grams) Screen 5-inch AMOLED 5.2-inch IPS LCD Resolution 1,920 x 1,080 pixels (441 ppi) 1,920 x 1,080 pixels (423 ppi) OS Android 7.1 Android 7.0 (upgradeable to Android 7.1) Storage 32, 128GB 16, 32GB MicroSD card slot No No NFC support Yes Yes Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 RAM 4GB 2GB Connectivity 4G LTE, GSM, CDMA, HSPA+, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi 4G LTE, GSM, CDMA, HSPA+, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi Camera 12.3MP rear, 8MP front 12.3MP rear, 5MP front Video 4K at 30fps, 1080p at 120, 60 or 30fps, 720p at 240fps 4K at 30fps, 1080p at 30fps, 720p at 120fps Bluetooth Yes, version 4.2 Yes, version 4.2 Fingerprint sensor Yes Yes Other sensors Barometer, gyro, accelerometer, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor Barometer, gyro, accelerometer, proximity sensor Water resistant Yes, IP53 rated No Battery 2,770mAh 2,700mAh Ports USB Type-C USB Type-C Marketplace Google Store Google Store Color offerings Blue, silver, black Black, white, blue Availability AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, Project Fi AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, Project Fi Price $650 $350~ DT review Pending – Hands on here 2.5/5 stars It may look like the Pixel and the Nexus 5X share similar specs — they do, but the Pixel has a leg up where it really matters. Notably, it comes with the latest and greatest from Qualcomm — the Snapdragon 821. This processor supposedly offers a 10 percent increase in performance over the Snapdragon 820, which powered most of this year’s flagships, such as Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge, the LG G5, and the HTC 10. In comparison, the Pixel is well ahead of the Snapdragon 808 processor in the Nexus 5X. You won’t have issues with daily tasks like web browsing, but you will see performance hiccups when doing slightly processor-heavy tasks, like playing Pokémon Go. Not to mention the 5X only has 2GB of RAM — it truly shows when you try to multi-task with several apps. The Pixel has 4GB of RAM and it’s better optimized to run Android, so you shouldn’t run into any issues. The newer device also has better storage options, offering a standard 32GB and a 128GB model, whereas the 5X only comes with options for 16GB and 32GB of internal storage. Both devices also feature a fingerprint sensor. Winner: Pixel Design and durability Google’s latest phone is slightly smaller than the 5.2-inch Nexus 5X, but it’s also a little heavier — that’s thanks to the all-metal build, making the Pixel feel like a high-end device. The 5X is made of hard polymer plastic. Metal is better, but half of the Pixel’s back is glass, which may not make it as durable as the 5X — that’s double the glass you may have to repair. And the glass back is one of the more unique design choices for the Pixel, which mostly looks like an iPhone. The glass is sure to attract fingerprints, but we’re not fans of the front due to the larger-than-usual bottom bezel. The Nexus 5X, on the other hand, has slim bezels, a sleek back with the stylish Nexus brand name, and a front-facing speaker — though it’s not too powerful. The Pixel’s speaker will likely be a little louder, even if there’s only a single, bottom-firing one. Design is subjective, and we like the Pixel’s look but the Nexus 5X may edge out here. The metal build may also protect your Pixel a little more, but the glass on the back is has us worried that you may face a higher repair cost if you drop the device. Winner: Nexus 5X  Display The Pixel’s 5-inch display still holds the same resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 pixels, but it has a higher pixel density at 441 pixels-per-inch — you will hardly be able to tell the difference. What will be easily noticeable is the screen as the Pixel has an AMOLED display, and the Nexus 5X uses an LCD one. The Pixel’s screen will likely be brighter and offer deeper blacks, as well as sharper colors. Winner: Pixel Battery The Pixel XL may feature a sizable difference in battery capacity, but that doesn’t mean the Pixel won’t be able to last you a day. Google claims the Pixel will give you up to 13 hours of internet use on LTE — that’s the same as Apple’s claim for the iPhone 7 Plus, and an hour more than the iPhone 7. Compared to the Nexus 5X, you’ll get five more hours of battery life using internet on LTE with the Pixel. It’s surprising, considering the two have similar batteries. The Pixel has a 2,770mAh battery and the 5X has a 2,700mAh one. The key is software and hardware optimization, and while we doubt we’ll actually get 13 hours of internet use on LTE for the Pixel, you can certainly expect a sizable bump of juice for the device. Winner: Pixel Camera Google’s proud of what it’s done with the Pixel’s camera — it has received the highest score on DXOMark for a smartphone. Google says it rebuilt the experience from the ground up — there’s no optical-image-stabilization, but the search giant has a proprietary gyro-based stabilization software for videos. Google has also improved HDR+ processing, meaning the photo is captured much faster and it also processes incredibly fast. Not to mention that Google says its 12.3-megapixel rear camera on the Pixel has one of the fastest launch to capture times. Compared to the Nexus 5X, we can say this is true thanks to our brief time with the devices at the San Francisco event. The camera on the Pixel also has a few exclusive features, such as white balance presets, exposure compensation, automatic exposure and automatic focus locking, and viewfinder grid modes. If you own a Pixel, you’ll also get free unlimited photo storage in Google Photos at full resolution. This option already exists in the app, but storing at full resolution will eat up Google account storage space for non-Pixel owners. The front-facing camera is packed with 8-megapixels, more than the 5X. Winner: Pixel Software The Nexus 5X will get Android 7.1 Nougat in December, but the Pixel comes with it pre-installed. That means Pixel owners will have early access to new features like Night Light, a night mode; App Shortcuts, similar to iOS’ 3D Touch; improved touch latency; fingerprint gestures that allow you to swipe down to bring down the notification drawer; Daydream VR support, and Seamless A/B Updates. And there are a few Pixel-exclusive features that Nexus 5X owners will not enjoy at all, notably Google Assistant. Press and hold the home button, and you’ll find Google Assistant come up, asking what you need help with. The Assistant can run search queries, order an Uber, and more. The feature may end up on Nexus phones as Google is “exploring” ways to implement it, but it’s unlikely it will come any time soon. There’s also Smart Storage, which automatically removes backed up photos from your device, and the Pixel Launcher won’t be available on the Play Store — there are ways to implement a similar look via third-party launchers, though. You also get 24/7 support built into the phone, complete with screen sharing in case you ever run into an issue. You can learn more about the differences between Android 7.1 Nougat in the Pixel and other Android devices here. Google’s Pixel smartphones are the future, so it’s certain they will endure longer-lasting support than the 5X. Winner: Pixel Pricing and availability The Pixel is a better phone, but we’re also comparing a device that has superior internals to one with mid-range specs. The Nexus 5X debuted for a little under $400, but you can easily find it online for prices ranging from $200 to $300. The Pixel, on the other hand, starts at $650 for the 32GB variant. Google’s asking for a lot more, but it does offer the specs, build, and optimization to match the high cost. The Nexus 5X isn’t sold on the Google Store anymore, but it’s still available from third-party retailers as well as on Project Fi. The Pixel is available for pre-order via Verizon, the Google Store, Best Buy, and Project Fi — you’ll be able to pay the full price or get on the device financing plan for no-interest monthly payments. It may be out of stock at the moment, though. Winner: Nexus 5X Winner: Pixel If you’re on a budget, there are more powerful smartphones you can get for a lower price than the Pixel, and the Nexus 5X is still a decent choice. You shouldn’t even be thinking about a Pixel, as it’s meant to be a high-end smartphone competing with the likes of Samsung and Apple. Still, no-interest device financing options are a plus and you’re getting the latest and greatest of Android, with fast updates and 24/7 support. You’re getting a superior camera, battery, display, vastly improved performance, and the kind of software and hardware integration we have never seen before on Android. What’s more enticing may be the fact that the Pixel may be one of the few high-performing 5-inch Android smartphones, and that’s certain to win over many of you.

But what’s new here is the iOS 10’s software solution in the event the Home button stops working. What happens if the button is non-responsive — how do you use the phone? Via a temporary on-screen Home button. This discovery was made by a MacRumors reader and shared on their forums. Because iPhone 7’s Home button is pressure sensitive and relies on haptic feedback, it’s integration with iOS 10 means the software can automatically detect if something is wrong or malfunctioning, and begin using this workaround. In this case, the user wrote that their iPhone 7’s haptic feedback started acting weird after the device suddenly shut down while charging. The Taptic Engine “kept firing 3-4 times in a row for every ‘press,'” they wrote. After it stopped working again, iOS 10 displayed a notification prompt that said “The Home Button May Need Service,” and instructed the user to use an onscreen, software based Home button at the bottom of the display, just above the hardware button. It’s an interesting solution that some users may not ever need to experience. It also ties in with Apple taking into account that if iOS freezes and becomes unresponsive, the Taptic Engine can also stop working, resulting in the decision to change the hard reset process to holding down the power and lower volume buttons together for several seconds.
