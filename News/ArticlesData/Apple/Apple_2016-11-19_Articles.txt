Apple has finally acknowledged that there is a structural problem with its iPhone 6 Plus which causes the device's screen to freeze and become unresponsive. The condition, which is accompanied by grey flickering bars at the top of the screen, was christened "touch disease" by the US-based iFixit repair advocacy group in August.  Although the existence of the issue had been known for months, Apple had refused to acknowledge that it was widespread or offer any solution beyond its standard out-of-warranty replacement service. The service involves swapping a damaged iPhone 6 Plus for a refurbished one at the cost $519. Under a new policy announced on Friday, Apple will repair iPhone 6 Plus devices affected with the touch screen problems for a service fee of $228.95.  To qualify, however, the device needs to be in "working order" with a screen that is "not cracked or broken". "Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device," the company said. The company has also agreed to reimburse iPhone 6 Plus owners who paid for repairs related to the issue using Apple or Apple Authorised Service Providers. iFixit co-founder Kyle Wiens​ previously told Fairfax Media that because of a design flaw in the iPhone 6 Plus, it was likely that many of the popular devices would eventually succumb to the condition. The issue was caused by what Mr Wiens called "design anorexia" - the imperative to make smartphones ever thinner and lighter. It relates to the 2014 "bend-gate" incident, when some iPhone 6 Plus owners found that their devices had been bent out of shape after carrying them in their back pockets. Ad Feedback Bending or frequent dropping of the phone can cause the touch-screen controller chips to be dislodged from their mounts on the phone's logic board. Apple subsequently upgraded the quality of the aluminium used for the casing on the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in what was seen as a tacit admission that the material used in the earlier model was too flimsy. ​Earlier this year, a number of aggrieved iPhone 6 Plus owners in the US filed a class action suit, accusing Apple of fraud and violating California consumer protection laws and seeking unspecified damages.  - Sydney Morning Herald Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next Gadgets story: Learning your way around 360-degree cameras Technology Homepage technology headlines Shakespeare work discovered Apple agrees to repair malfunction How Facebook will battle fake news Business owners urged to innovate Quake rubberneckers turned away Live: 7.8 NZ quake Earthquake warning system Top 5 plays of the week Hands-on: 360-degree cameras AI to 'blow the roof off of education' Online rights are on the decline NZ's first self-drive vehicle demo SingularityU: The future of medicine Bug sending phone data to China Tinder has 37 new gender options Ad Feedback Most popular Viewed Shared Commented John Key to Mark Zuckerberg: Facebook's tax not a good look Man alone on Mt Fyffe when earthquake hit Recap: Four Nations final: Kiwis v Kangaroos Off-duty officer recounts dramatic rescue after tree crushes woman in car Boy left paralysed after chemo treatment goes wrong Oh Canada!

Falling on 25 November this year, it's the ideal time to buy your holiday-season gifts at lower prices. Hold on. What's Black Friday? Black Friday is now the biggest shopping day of the year in the UK. Introduced to the UK by Amazon, its effect on British stores has increased year on year. Last year’s figures were the most staggering so far: British shops saw an incredible 223 per cent increase in their daily sales average according to insights from technology company Ve. Despite its name the discount day isn’t limited to a one-day event — at least not anymore. In recent years the bargain bonanza has turned into an extended set of sales, partly to attract more customers and partly to ease the strain on shop employees. Black Friday counter Cyber Monday — another term you might have heard bandied about — is part of this longer deals period; falling on Monday 28 November, it’s the online-only equivalent loads of shops also take part in. Last year shops saw their daily sales average rise by 139 per cent on Cyber Monday. So what kind of deals were around last year? Many retailers like to keep their Black Friday cards close to their chests so it's hard to know what deals will be out there this year. We've rounded up the best deals from 2015 to give you an idea of what to expect... Phones Carphone Warehouse sold a Samsung and Apple phone contract every three seconds, while Giffgaff reduced the prices of some of its best selling Samsung and Sony smartphones by up to £100. Mobile phone retailer Three knocked over £100 off the Samsaung Galaxy S6 Edge and reduced the Sony Xperia Z5 from £529 to £370. Black Friday by numbers Play! 01:15 Smartwatches Last year the coveted Apple Watch was on sale at John Lewis for £399 and at Amazon for £309.99. This year the second Apple Watch came out, so with a newer model on the market there could well be discounts on the original.  John Lewis reduced both the Withings Activité and the Withings Pulse Ox by 25 per cent and Currys offered discounts on many of their Pebble smartwatches. Amazon knocked over 50 per cent off the Garmin Vivoactive GPS smartwatch, almost two thirds off the Sony Universal smartwatch 2 and over a third off the waterproof Motorola Moto 360 smartwatch and activity tracker. Laptops Ebuyer, one of the UK’s leading online electrical retailers, offered £110 off HP laptops last year, while Lenovo offered 33 per cent off premium products and Currys PC World knocked £200 off selected HP products. eBay, who launched their Black Friday deals early last year, reduced the 13" Macbook Pro to £749; meanwhile Amazon sold the ASUS 11" chromebook for £129.99, reducing it by £90. Black Friday retailer grid Tablets Amazon reduced the Fire HDX 8.9 tablet — with HDX display, Wi-Fi and 4G — by 38 per cent and cut £30 from the Kindle Paperwhite. The iPad Air was reduced by £70 at Argos and £60 at Tesco, while EE sold the Samsung Galaxy Tab A for only £29.99 upfront, along with a monthly cost of £18.  Gaming Amazon reduced the 500GB PS4 console to £199.99, while GAME offered the PS4 console — plus Call of Duty: Black Ops III, FIFA 16 and The Last Of Us: Remastered — for a total of £299.99. For Xbox devotees, GAME offered the console (along with FIFA 16, Lego Marvel Super Heroes and Goat Simulator) for £249.99. Cameras John Lewis cut £100 from the splash-proof TomTom Bandit action camera, Argos knocked £140 off the GoPro Hero 3+ silver action camera, and Amazon cut an impressive £190 from the Canon EF-S 55-250mm lens. Jessops had a variety of combo deals, including offering the Nikon D7200 with a 18-105mm lens and free battery grip (worth £229) for a total of £889. Plus, Currys sold the Canon EOS 100D with 18-55mm lens for £299 and knocked £90 off the Canon PowerShot S200 advanced compact camera, selling it for just £79. ​ Sound systems LaptopsDirect.co.uk cut two thirds off the iQ Gravity Bluetooth levitating (yes, levitating) speaker, selling it at £34.97, while Argos reduced the highly coveted Beats by Dr. Dre Pill 2.0 wireless speakers by £40 to £129.99. AO.com cut the Samsung HT-J5150 5.1 surround home cinema system by £160 to £199. Plus, John Lewis knocked £130 from their own-brand soundbar and subwoofer set, selling it for £199.95 Drones Argos knocked £268 off the Veho VXD-001-B Muvi drone and 50 per cent off the Revell Control Formula Q Quadcopter drone. Meanwhile, Wex Photographic reduced the DJI Phantom 3 Professional Quadcopter drone by £80 to £1079. Other gadgets Online retailer AO.com had deals across their whole range of house appliances last Black Friday, including discounts on Bosch food processors, Dyson hoovers and coffee machines. Argos reduced the Philips wireless headphones by £70 and John Lewis cut the price of their Bose QuietComfort Noise Cancelling QC20 acoustic in-ear headphones by £110. Black Friday | Consumer rights So when can I get shopping? Amazon have already started reducing prices and plan to end their sales at 23:59 on Friday 25 November. Plus, Debenhams and Tesco will launch their Black Friday deals on Monday 21 November. We'll be reporting on which deals are released when from next Monday, so keep your eye on our Black Friday updates to nab the best deals. The shopping hacks to have up your sleeve You don’t want to miss out on a coveted item because you were too slow off the mark, so make sure you set up online accounts with your favourite retailers ahead of time. Check the opening times of stores you want to visit, download retailer's apps and read customer reviews of products you've got your eye on. It's also a good idea to bookmark products ahead of time, sign up to retailers’ newsletters and start following their social media accounts (just make sure they’re verified by a blue tick to avoid scam deals). Plus, sign up to Amazon Prime to benefit from an exclusive 30-minute early access period to all their Lightning Deals (offers which are only available at certain points of the day and for a short amount of time each). On the day itself remember to shop around: no matter how taken you are by a certain deal, another retailer may have reduced the same product by even more. Use My Supermarket to compare prices and take a look at Flubit, which generates cheaper prices on Amazon products for you within three hours. Black Friday product grid 2 Which shops aren't taking part? Black Friday may only have been in the UK for a couple of years, but it’s already such an annual staple that it seems odd when retailers don’t get in on the action. Apple aren't likely to be cutting prices in-store this year but you should be able to bag iPhone and iPad bargains at places like Currys, John Lewis and Carphone Warehouse.

Smartphone Market Share: for how long can the big to hold on to the dominance? Sun, 2016-11-20 08:37  editor United Kingdom Hemantha Abeywardena writes from London… Samsung and Apple, the pioneers of the smartphone industry, are losing the dominance of the market share, according to the data from the Gartner, which has been monitoring the trend. During the third quarter of this year, the fall has been significant and given the fiasco involving Samsung and the lack of innovation from Apple, the trend appears to be heading towards the point-of-no-return, according to the seasoned analysts. Samsung is the worst hit: it has lost its market share from 23.6%, a year ago to just 19.2% in the third quarter this year, as the above graph illustrates; Apple, which hasn’t got much to celebrate, meanwhile, has lost its market share from 13% to 11.5% during the same period. Samsung’s troubles were expatiated by the bungled launch of its latest phablet, Galaxy Note 7 - with its exploding battery. Having been forced to recall the product twice, the Korean giant finally called it a day, when a worldwide ban on its sale was in the offing and the company lost its poor PR battle. Not only did it cost the company a fortune, but also left a dent on the reputation of the brand in a significant way. Samsung appeared to have launched the Galaxy Note 7 campaign to coincide with that of Apple’s iPhone7, in the hope of making the former the better device in terms of innovative features; at the outset, it appears to be the case too. Then, all of a sudden, there were reports from every corner of the planet about exploding batteries while the device was on charge. Samsung’s initial attempts to make the issue statistically insignificant spectacularly backfired, which in turn led to the inevitable massive financial loss and the brand damage. Although, Apple, its rival in the industry, did not exploit Samsung’s botched PR exercise, the former could not reverse its own decline in sales of its star product, the iPhone. The data clearly indicates that both manufactures seem to be suffering from the falling sales. The vacuum, however, appears to be filling by lesser known, relatively-cheaper Chinese brands and new comers into the market. Huawei, the Chinese manufacturer, for instance has made a remarkable foray into the market by securing its place as the third big player; it is gaining popularity in the Western market as a serious contender. In addition, Oppo and BBK, two other Chinese brands are gaining momentum worldwide. As for the iPhones, the arrival of the new administration in Washington DC does not make things easier for the company: president-elect didn’t mince his words, when he said during the campaign, “We're going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries.” There are reports that Apple may consider building iPhones in the US rather than China without risking a tariff of up to 45% on the iPhones manufactured in China; it will inevitably lead to a hike in price due to high production cost in the US and will not attract many customers in the US or elsewhere, when the cheaper devices are mushrooming everywhere. Moreover, shifting manufacturing base from China to the US will trigger off a trade war between the two countries, which could easily get out of hand with far reaching consequences. Adding insult to the injury, the mobile network providers have started introducing their own products at a fraction of the price charged by Samsung or Apple. Vodafone smart platinum range, introduced by Vodafone is a case in point. It is going to be just a matter of time before other network providers start doing the same, buoyed by the success of Vodafone. Apple and Samsung still can make their influence felt in the realm of smartphones by innovating more rather than disproportionately focusing on their sales figures, something that the visionary founders of the two technological giants used to do at the height of their respective successes. - Asian Tribune - Tweet Login or register to post comments News Headlines 116 Dead as Train Derails in Kanpur, North India; Some Still Trapped Letter From America: Dark Forces Winning the Game!

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive ‘Too early to say’ when vote on Measure V will happen Saturday Nov 19, 2016 at 5:18 PM Nov 19, 2016 at 5:18 PM APPLE VALLEY — No cries of victory echoed in Council chambers. No officials were present on behalf of Liberty Utilities. No one who opposes eminent domain took to the podium during public comment to say, “I told you so.” The only mention of Measure V’s overwhelming passage came from Mayor Barb Stanton, who congratulated the town’s electorate for letting its voice be heard before discussing the uphill financial battle Measure W — which also passed, but with fewer favorable votes than V — faced in the leadup to the Nov. 8 election. But Measure V, which town officials say makes purchasing Liberty’s water system more difficult, is now a part of Apple Valley’s reality. On Tuesday, Town spokeswoman Kathie Martin told the Daily Press the ordinance V assured — a vote of the people before the town can issue public debt in excess of $10 million for the acquisition, improvement or financing of an enterprise — requires no further action from the Town Council and is effective immediately. When that future vote would take place on the debt the town would likely incur — should acquisition of Liberty’s water system prove successful — remains unclear. No tentative date is scheduled, and the dollar amount needed to bankroll a potential purchase is not yet known. According to Martin, it’s “too early to say.” Also too early to say is whether a special election would be held to accommodate the vote. “(That) would depend on timing,” Martin said. Essentially, scheduling hinges on further discussion, and wiggle room exists for the Council to maneuver in the eminent-domain process. The City of Claremont, which set a borrowing amount to buy Golden State Water Company’s system at $135 million, put that number to voters in 2014, nearly two years before its case against the water company went to trial. Claremont voters overwhelmingly backed the bond, and the City Council there continued to pull money from its general fund to pay for acquisition-related costs, including an additional $1 million the day the trial started in June, according to an Inland Valley Daily Bulletin report. City spokeswoman Bevin Handel described the eminent-domain process as two-pronged — the “right to take” trial phase and the compensation phase — before explaining her city’s reasoning for going to the voters early. “We did the financing — that was the revenue bond — as a way to see if the city was willing to finance (a purchase of the water system),” Handel told the Daily Press. “After that moved forward, the city filed resolutions of necessity.” Handel said municipalities can choose to wait to go to a vote, but characterized such a decision as a gamble. “You’re taking that chance that maybe your voters don’t agree with you,” she said. “Our Council took it as we want to make sure this is the will of the people, (but) you could have a different Council that would wait.” Apple Valley’s appears to be that Council given that resolutions of necessity to take Liberty’s system by eminent domain were adopted more than a year ago, when the only calls for a vote came from citizens who oppose the takeover attempt. And yet, there’s no clear best practice concerning which approach — early or later — is more apt, according to San Francisco-based attorney Charles “Chick” Adams. Adams, who specializes in bond law, said there are “practical difficulties” to both setting a bond-debt amount early and waiting for a valuation. The former’s difficulties involve “identifying an authorized amount for the bond.” “The voters have to approve the maximum principal amount,” Adams said, “(so) you’d want a worse-case scenario ... Voters usually vote on a not-to-exceed number, and the one thing the public agency can’t do is go over that amount.” As for the latter, the public agency becomes obligated to pay the price at a certain point in the process, according to Adams, who added, “By that point you want to know that you’ve got funding available.” “That’s the danger in getting too long down the road,” he said. “The agency really has to have the assurance that it has the money to pay for the property being condemned.” With that said, “there’s a lot of ways to skin the cat,” according to Adams, who said he’d “recommend that they go to the voters enough in advance to know you have the money, but not so early that you risk not coming up with the right number.” Meanwhile, the current obstacle facing Claremont has little to do with the $135 million voters approved. A judge tentatively ruled against the city earlier this month, saying municipal ownership of Golden State’s water system was not “a more necessary public use” for myriad reasons laid out in a nearly 40-page document. The tentative ruling surprised Adams — “Usually public agencies win the right-to-take trial,” he said — and was downplayed by town officials who previously said its case against Liberty is more akin to that of Missoula, Montana’s, a city that won the right to purchase a separate system from Liberty Utilities for nearly $89 million. But Sacramento-based attorney Thomas Hiltachk — who drafted Measure V — disagreed, stating when a vote will occur shouldn’t be the focus at this point. “I assume there’s no reason to have a Measure V vote until after you’ve determined you can get over the (right-to-take trial) hurdle,” he said, “(but) based on what happened in Claremont, Measure V is the least of (the town’s) problems.” A trial setting conference in the town’s case against Liberty is scheduled for Jan. 20, according to court records.

Register for an Exam Today> iPhone Touch Disease Much Worse than Apple Admits By Patrick May PUBLISHED: NOVEMBER 19 2016 So Apple has finally fessed up to the existence of the much-dreaded "Touch Disease" -- but users will tell you it's worse that Apple admits, and they aren't happy about the company's plan to deal with it. Touch Disease is the annoying phenomenon that plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit against the Cupertino tech giant have been saying is messing up their iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus phones, leaving a flickering bar at the top of the display and creating all kinds of multi-touch issues. (You all remember "multi-touch," right? All those cool things you can do with your iPhone by touching it in different ways and with different amounts of pressure? And you saw that Apple how-to a while back that said, among other things, "if the Home button doesn't respond as you expect, make sure that your hands are clean and dry..."?) I wrote about the issue back in August, when the lawsuit first became known. "The iPhones are not fit for the purpose of use as smartphones because of the touch-screen defect," said the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in San Jose. At that time, Apple declined comment. Now Apple has officially recognized the problem and announced a new worldwide program where it will fix any affected iPhone 6 Plus devices -- for a $149 service fee. So just how bad is it to have an iPhone beset with problems caused by Touch Disease? Listen: Elizabeth Jackson, having lunch with her husband, told WCPO Cincinnati that using her iPhone 6 Plus has become increasingly frustrating. "There's sometimes when it won't respond when I go to text or open an app. It takes a while to open up." WCPO also got an earful from Brianna Booker, whose iPhone 6 Plus would flash a light gray band at the top of the phone -- and then simply stop responding to her touch. It was, as it were, unswipable: "I wasn't able to swipe. I had notifications coming in, but I wasn't able to answer any text messages or phone calls." It gets worse. Commenting online about my colleague's story this morning on Apple's acknowledgement of the problem, a guy named John Smith complained that he had hit a wall when he tried to get Apple to fix his diseased phone: "I was told 'tough' by the Apple store employees when I brought it in even though they admitted it was also a problem with the 6." Over in Europe, where they were already wide awake and ready to share their tales of woe, "Süddeutsche Zeitung" tweeted "#TouchDisease: @Apple räumt beim iPhone 6 Plus Reparaturrabatte ein, weist aber die Schuld von sich. via @golem" which translates roughly to: "#TouchDisease: @Apple admits iPhone 6 plus repair discounts, but assigns the blame from itself via @golem." The morning was just getting started here in Silicon Valley when a steady chorus of TD complainers began to grow louder. In responses to a story in TechCrunch, readers unloaded: "I have never dropped my 6," said Tommy Ray Pabst at Cornell University, "but it does a LOT of weird things on its own." Bill Thompson wrote that he had a iPhone 6 Plus "until the recent trade in offer on the iPhone 7. I never had an issue with it, but I promptly put it in a tough case that protected against drops and bending. It was tougher to slip in an out of my pocket, but I had little fears about easily breaking it." And a reader named Anono Mouser said Touch Disease was symptomatic of a larger problem: Apple's incessant software updates and the problems they often cause: "Seems like every few days my 6plus wants to update it's OS to something new. It'd be nice if one of those updates made the smartphone smart enough to actually answer a phone call. I mean it is a phone, right? Instead it mocks me to swipe to answer, and then ignores every swipe, push, and curseword that's thrown at it." But if you want to hit the mother lode of Touch Disease-caused agony, go read Jason Koebler's piece at Motherboard. He said his inbox was flooded with TD complaints after he wrote about the problem in September. "In the last 24 hours, I've gotten emails from 27 separate iPhone 6 Plus owners who have encountered this problem and were unaware that Apple internally considers it a known issue," he wrote. " Many of them have been put through lengthy tech support protocols on obviously broken phones only to be told that they would have to pay $329 for a refurbished phone that is still fundamentally flawed. Others have had to put up with months of forcefully bending or twisting the phone in order to get its Touch IC connectors to intermittently work for a few minutes, hours, or days before the problem inevitably resurfaces." Here are just a few of the tales Koebler heard: From Cherish: "Missed a lot of great photos during a friend's wedding weekend because I unfortunately relied on my iPhone to be my camera. Apple called me on August 17, but when they called my screen was frozen and I could not answer the phone. They left a message saying they would call back. I went to my rental car, connected the Bluetooth and used that to answer. I gave them my alternate cell number so that solved the calling issue. I was on the phone with them for an hour after that and they insisted for most of the call that this is a normal occurrence and is often resolved by restoring the OS." From Paul: "I've lived with this problem on and off for almost two years now. It started happening almost as soon as I got it. I got a screen change under warranty, and had to get a refurbished phone the day after because the screen change did nothing. A few months later it started showing the signs again, and now I can't use it." Wait, there's more from Paul: "As a kicker just a couple weeks ago, the phone stopped connecting to my cellular network and AT&T said it was a phone problem, not carrier. I had to order an iPhone 7 Plus but I feel cheated out of my money as I paid full price for my 6 Plus and could've used it at least another year or even two, if it worked properly." And from Katasha: "The top grey bar would almost flicker all the time, and that's when I knew my phone wouldn't respond to my touch. So, after dealing with this for a couple weeks, I ended up at the Apple Store, where I was told yes, it was a problem, but not something that could be fixed, nor was it covered, and I exchanged my phone for $329, to get a new one, because what else was I to do?" © 2016 San Jose Mercury News under contract with NewsEdge.

Pay Apple $149 Philip Michaels Senior Editor Tech Media Network (Tom's Guide)November 19, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share If your iPhone 6 Plus suffers from a flickering screen that's become unresponsive to your touch, Apple has a fix for you. But it'll cost you $149. Apple today (Nov. 17) launched a repair program for iPhone 6 Plus models that have flickering displays or problems registering multi-touch inputs. If your phone is otherwise in working order without a cracked or broken screen, Apple says it will repair affect iPhone 6 Pluses for $149. This iFixit image shows the gray flicker that's a sympton of Touch Disease.The problem with flickering screens has been a source of internet speculation for some time now. Back in August, iFixit reported that it was seeing a rise in the number of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus devices suffering from a gray flicker at the top of the display and an unresponsive tuouchscreen. This iFixit image shows the gray flicker that's a sympton of Touch Disease.More MORE: 23 Essential iPhone 7 Tips and Tricks At the time, iFixit blamed what it called the "Touch Disease" problem on pair of touchscreen controller chips found on the logic board of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. As you may recall, those models were prone to bending, and iPhone repair specialists suggested that the added stress on the logic board was causing problems with the affected sensors. Apple, it seems, does not entirely agree with that diagnosis. In its notice announcing the Multi-Touch repair program, the company said the iPhone 6 Plus might exhibit these problems "after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device." In other words, Apple thinks wear-and-tear is the culprit and not a design flaw, which is probably why you'll have to pay that $149 repair cost. The repair program only covers the iPhone 6 Plus, though some users have reported problems with the smaller iPhone 6 as well. (In its August report on the problem, iFixit said the problem occured more frequently in Plus models, since it was more prone to bending.) If you already paid to have your iPhone 6 Plus fixed, Apple says it will reimburse you for any costs you incurred above $149. Apple says affected iPhone 6 Plus owners should contact an authorized Apple service provider or go to the Apple Store for the repair. Three iPhone owners filed a class-action suit against Apple over their phone's touchscreens in August.

The answer is a streaming box, a valuable addition to your entertainment shelf designed to support the most popular streaming options and channels. So if you are looking for a Netflix box for TV, check out the best on the market – and everything else they have to offer. Note: These boxes assume that you have HDMI ports in your TV or receiver. If your devices are particularly old, you may want to upgrade them before searching for boxes. Read: How much does Netflix cost per month? Best Netflix Boxes 1. Google Chromecast Google Chromecast isn’t exactly a box – which is why it’s one of the best streaming device options around. This little HDMI stick can fit nearly anywhere as long as your TV has an extra HDMI port for you to stick it in. It’s powered via USB tech or AC adapter, and once in and running it can do most of what the big set-top boxes can do, including give you popular streamers like Netflix, YouTube, HBO Go, Hulu Plus, and other important members of the family. The other unique feature of Chromecast is how well it plays with Android and developers in general, giving it access to a very broad selection of apps to tweak your entertainment in all kinds of ways. You can buy Google Chromecast here for $35. 2. Roku 3 Roku was one of the early entrants in the set-top box market, and has had plenty of time to perfect its craft. The Roku 3 is simply one of the best streaming box choices currently available. It offers around 2,000 possible channels, excellent search options that allow you to search content through multiple platforms and devices, and of course access to streamers like Netflix. It comes with its own remote complete with motion controls for games, has a headphone jack for private listening, and has Ethernet, USB, and MicroSD slots. All in all, it makes for a great family box. You can buy the Roku 3 for $99.99. 3. Apple TV Apple has a simpler box than the Roku, but offers many of the same services and more compatibility with other Apple products. This Netflix TV box can handle all the popular streaming apps, as well as high definition iTunes content. However, it’s the interactions with iPhones and iPads that make this streaming box unique. You can flick video or photos up onto your TV at a moment’s notice if you want, thanks to AirPlay features, or used your iPad as a controller for many of the games in the Apple app store. In other words, this is made for Apple fans from the ground up. You can get the Apple TV for $99 4. Google Nexus Player The Nexus Player uses the Android TV OS, and while it will give easy access to Netflix streaming and much more, it will go down easier for those who have experience with Android platforms. Much like Apple TV and Apple software, the Nexus is meant for Android games, Google Play content, and similar features. With an extra gamepad accessory and a voice search function, the Player may be more suited for video game apps than many other boxes…as long as you get your apps from Android. You can also use Google Cast on the Player in conjunction with any other device that also has the Cast app to send content over to your TV. You can pick up the Nexus Player for $99. 5. Amazon Fire TV Amazon Fire TV has several features to recommend it. First, much like Apple TV and the Nexus Player, Fire TV is designed to work well with one specific brand – if you love Amazon and already subscribe to plenty of Amazon content, this device will fit in perfectly with your habits. Second, this Netflix streaming box includes an extra focus on unique features. It lets parents create personal profiles for kids and their favorite cartoons, it has smart buffering to prepare shows ahead of time, and it offers more gaming options than most boxes, with titles that Apple TV and Nexus Player don’t have access to. You can get the Amazon Fire TV for $84 6. Xbox One The Xbox One is a console, not a small set-top box, and so is significantly more expensive. However, it’s the best Netflix streamer if you’re a fan of Microsoft and Windows, and includes, of course, options for all Xbox One games and downloads. The voice search, gesture control, and automatic control of your TV and receiver than come with the Kinect accessory also make this box one of the most advanced: streaming content and finding your shows has never been more fun. The Blu-ray player and 500GB hard drive let you watch the latest hard copy or store video content on the Xbox One for later viewing. You can buy the Xbox One for $349 Tweet It Like It Google + Linkedin Pin it Stumble Tyler Lacoma When he isn't enjoying the beautiful Northwest outdoors, you can find Tyler on business and tech sites, writing about the latest news, analyzing trends, and generally making the Internet a more interesting place.

Toggle navigation Insanely Great Contact Advertising Submit Apple puts out $300 design book November 15th 2016 By Mike Flaminio Titled Designed by Apple in California, the new art book chronicles 20 years of Apple design starting with Steve Jobs' return to the company. The book itself is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs. Designed by Apple in California's forward by Jony Ive: While this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process, or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations, and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. We strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent, and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative. Like many of its products, there are two versions of the book. A small 10.20-inch x 12.75-inch size and large 13-inch x 16.25-inch size that sells for $199 and $299, respectively. At that price, the book appears geared more towards design and art fans than every-day Apple customers, although certainly, Apple's biggest fans likely will shell out the cash. The book will be available online and at select flagship retail stores, where it will also be on display. Apple appeared to go all out in this monument to itself. The book is described as "printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink. This linen-bound, hardcover volume was developed over an eight-year period." On one hand, I get they want to do something really special that will be appreciated by their design peers, but it comes across as an elitist effort. Like the $18,000 gold Apple Watch, Designed by Apple in California is hardly something for the rest of us, which is where the Mac started.

It seems like this year; Apple has already announced their deals for Black Friday, and they will start earlier the shopping event. Retailers Which Offers Great Deals On Apple Devices In this article, we will show you the best offers and discounts for Apple gadgets and where you can find them. The tech company’s website is a place where you can shop for gadgets and also their physical stores will have to be a place where you can purchase them, especially the iPhone 7. On this year’s Black Friday we expect to see from Apple discounts on products such as the iPad Mini, iPad Pro, iPhone and some MacBook models. If you don’t like the deals that the tech company has to offer, you can go to retailers such as Amazon, Best Buy or Target which have their offers for the tech company’s products. Great Offers For iPads On Black Friday Probably the most popular devices from Apple are their iPads. The deals for these gadgets are kind of interesting. For example, the iPad Mini 4 will receive a minimum $100 discount, and the maximum can be $150. Also, the iPad Pro 12.9 will get a $150 price cut which is pretty decent. These are just a few offers for the iPads, but you should keep an eye on other retailer’s deals for the devices. Apple’s MacBook Got An Interesting Discount If you’re a MacBook fan, then you’re a lucky customer because the tech company and the retailers are offering the device at a pretty decent discount. Unfortunately, there won’t be any offers on the new 2016 MacBook Pro model, but instead, there will also be deals on the MacBook Air and previous MacBook Pro versions. For example, the MacBook Air will receive a minimum $100 discount, and it can grow up to $200. Also, the MacBook Pro Retina can get a $200 to 300$ price cut which is nice. These are just a few offer that the tech company and the retailers are offering to their customers for the Apple devices. In the upcoming weeks, we expect to see some deals for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus which fans are also waiting. What are your thoughts on Apple’s 2016 Black Friday discounts and offers?

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     This Is How An Apple Mirror Would Look Posted: Nov 19 2016, 1:28pm CST | by Ahmed Humayun, Updated: Nov 19 2016, 3:04pm CST, in News | Apple     If Apple would make a mirror it could work like this. Apple has a long history of being innovative. Apple always aims to enter new markets and this is very evident from the rumors we hear every other day regarding the work being done on a variety of products. Moving on, there is specifically one product some companies are working on and which is also good enough to enter the market. Don't Miss: Hatchimals Deals on Amazon.com That wonderful product is ‘Mirror’. As bewildering as the name may sound, Apple Mirror will be the next thing to look forward to though it is not developed by Apple. It is a new interactive mirror by Rafael Dymek . It has been built closely to resemble the iOS 10 which makes it look like a big reflective iPad. The operating system details are not known much. It has been skinned enough to look like iOS. It does have desktop-class tropes which also hint a Linux presence. Whatever the details may be one thing is for sure there is much functionality to play around with. You can order Uber, watch movies, browse the internet, text message and much more. This device will not be dedicated for work and play solely but it will be a perfect device to send a text message in the morning too. The Apple Mirror has been designed by Rafael Dymek. It will certainly fit into the background of a modern technological home. However don’t get so excited so soon. This product might not just find its way under production at least for the time being.

Those dollars are roll forward dollars that were unspent last year. We do not foresee any issues receiving those. By the end of this month we should have that in black and white that we have it. We ask that you approve that today, contingent on us receiving that, so that we can get rolling before Christmas,” Williams said. The proposal is to purchase 1,000 32Gb iPad Air 2s from Apple Inc. Education for $359 each for a total of $359,000. The district would then purchase from CDW-G through Region 8 Educational Co-Op 1,000 Griffin All-Terrain Protective Cases for $33 each for a total of $33,000 and 59 Ergotron YES40 charging carts for $1,200 each for a total of $70,800. Overall, that’ll cost SSISD $462,800 to provide enough iPads and cases for each pre-k through second grade student to use in the classroom during school hours, plus one charging cart per classroom.  “Essentially, what this will allow, along with the High Quality Pre-k Grant, most stuff will be Title 1 Part A funded. All students pre-k through second grade will be able to have an iPad with proper protection, and then the cabinet and case to protect  them,” said Williams. “These are supplementary devices in addition to what the districts normally provide. The notion is that it will improve their learning experience. All of these have, this decision has, been approved by campus site-based decision making committees as well, based on the needs assessments.” Overall, the district expects to receive $392,000 in federal Title I funding (pending approval) to apply toward the purchase of 850 iPads, 850 cases and 49 carts. The district has applied for an additional $69,232 in state funding from a High Quality Pre-K Grant to apply toward purchase of 146 additional iPads and cases and 10 additional carts. An additional $784 each would come from budgeted Head Start funding and state/local funding approved by campus site-based decision-making committees for purchase of 2 iPads and 2 cases each, to complete the order. Carts will be used to charge, update and store the iPads. Williams explained that SSISD is part of the Region 8 Co-op, which includes a list of approved vendors the district can use to purchase certain services at co-op rates. The district would purchase the cases and carts through the co-op, but would purchase the iPads themselves from Apple Inc. Education, considere a sole source vendor. “So the net impact or the net that the district would pay is this total minus the $106,000 roll forward amount?” trustee John Prickette asked. “The total district will pay is that $462,800. The Title I portion there —” Williams explained, pointing to a memo with the proposal, including break-down of funding sources, “We have received our entire notice of grant award for this year. We expect that $106,000 to roll over amount from last year. We just want to make sure we receive that as we’re supposed to before we buy these machines.” “So that would actually be more than what the total package is, once we receive the roll forward?” Prickette asked. “Once we receive the roll forward, we’ll be able fund this entire $359,000 Title I  amount as posted,” Williams clarified. “We do have hard cases for these?” queried SSISD Board of Trustees President Leesa Toliver. “Yes, we do have Griffin Survivor all-terrain protective cases, so they should be pre-k proof,” Williams replied. “What are benefit of the iPad Air update as opposed to the basic iPad?” asked trustee Robbin Vaughn. “It’s just the newest generation of iPad,” noted Assistant Superintendent Kristin Monk. “I think that is the basic iPad now,” Prickette noted. “It is the basic. It’s just the newest generation,” Monk affirmed. Lamb noted that over the last few years, while the district has rolled out its technology initiative in stages at the various campuses, is that Apple put out updates regularly. However, as technology advances, updates are no longer available for older devices because they can’t support the new technology after a certain number of years. “We have to get them as modern as we can and hope it lasts for four or five years,” Lamb said. “We have several of the originals. You base them on the charge, or the wide or the narrow,” Monk said of the iPads purchased a few years back when the technology program was piloted. “They are still in use if they will work. We tried to base it on what they already have with the narrow and then add to with this order. So keeping what we have that’s still in good condition and build on that,” Monk said. “Two or three years ago we set out to do a three year plan to be one [computer or device] to one [child from grades] 3-12. This actually makes us one to one pre-k through 12. The high school is in place this year. So once this purchase is made, and those are in hand, we are 1:1 with a device per kid, which has really brought us a long way in three years’ time. It’s pretty phenomenal how they’ve found the money through federal programs and what have you. We’ve taken a dream and made it even bigger than we imagined. It’s exciting,” Lamb noted. The iPads were recommended following local and state assessments, as well as Performance-Based Monitoring Analysis System data, as a means to “improve reading and mathematics instructing” in pre-k through second grade classrooms. The technology will be used as an extension of their learning to access applications such as Reading A-Z, Istation and Brain Pop. It will also allow SSISD to more successfully meet pre-k digital technology guidelines as well as digital technology Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills curriculum. Trustees unanimously approved $462,800 in funding, pending notification of the Title I award, for purchase of 1,000 iPad and cases, and 59 charging carts. Trustees after much discussion approved purchase of a new security vehicle for SSISD security use on a 4-0 vote — two board members absent and Toliver abstaining from voting.

Apple design guru Jony Ive designed a Christmas tree without any decorations Rob Price Nov. 19, 2016, 2:07 PM 152,383 facebook linkedin twitter email print Jony Ive.Kimberly White/Getty Images for Vanity Fair In the autumn of 2015, Apple design guru Jony Ive said that if he wasn't working for Apple, he might create Christmas decorations. "If I wasn't doing this, I think I would just be drawing or making stuff for friends," he told interviewer Charlie Rose. "Maybe it would just be Christmas tree ornaments, I don't know."  Ive, if you're not familiar with him, is the head honcho of design at the Cupertino technology company. He frequently appears as an ethereal, disembodied voiceover on Apple's promotional videos talking about its iconic design. Today, 49-year-old British knight continues to work for Apple. But he's gone and decorated a Christmas tree anyway. Keep scrolling for photos of the tree... View As: One Page Slides This is Claridge's. It's a posh hotel in central London. Rob Price/BI Every year, it gets famous designers to design Christmas trees for its lobby. In 2015, it was Christopher Bailey for Burberry. Claridge's Dolce & Gabanna, Kally Ellis of McQueens, and John Galliano for Dior have also had a go. This is Dalliano's 2010 creation. Claridge's But in 2016, it's Jony Ive's turn! He designed it together with frequent partner-in-crime Marc Newson, as well as set designer Michael Howells. So how does it look? Sir Jonathan Ive, Senior Vice President, Industrial Design, Apple Inc poses with his Honour of Knighthood and designer Mark Newson (right) poses with his Commander of the British Empire (CBE) medal following an Investiture ceremony hosted by the Princess Royal, at Buckingham Palace, on May 23, 2012 in London.Rebecca Naden/Getty Well ... it's a tree. There's nothing on it. Rob Price/BI "Is it finished?" I cautiously asked a Claridge's staff member. The answer: Yes. Rob Price/BI There are smaller trees dotted about too — also without any decorations on. Rob Price/BI But then, what do you expect? Apple is famous for its ultra-minimalist design. Rob Price/BI The unfurnished firs are accompanied by a lobby bedecked to look like a winter wonderland. Fake snow lines the floor alongside real tree trunks, under a leafy canopy and shifting light-scheme. Rob Price/BI "Our aim was to create an all-enveloping magical experience that celebrates our enormous respect for tradition while recognising our excitement about the future and things to come," Ive and Newson said to design mag Wallpaper. Rob Price/BI Source: Wallpaper "There are few things more pure and beautiful than nature, so that was our starting point, layering various iterations of organic forms with technology," they added. Rob Price/BI It is very pretty. And the birdsong and forest noises are a nice touch. Rob Price/BI But the closest thing to a traditional Christmas tree is this little one in the corner with some fake snow on. No decorations to be seen anywhere! Rob Price/BI Visitors seemed to like it, happily posing for photos in the installation room. Rob Price/BI At one point, a choir even turned up (though they're not an official part of the installation). It was positively idyllic. Rob Price/BI But yes — the tree is just a tree. Rob Price/BI There's no headphone jack, wifi, USB-C ports or HDMI output either, which is a bummer. Rob Price/BI Ive's tree comes off the back of another unconventional project — a $300 book containing nothing but photos of Apple products. It was developed over an eight-year period, and Ive said Apple had to invent new kinds of ink and paper to do it justice. Apple Source: Wallpaper So what's next for Jony Ive? It's not clear — Apple is famously secret about unannounced products. Rob Price/BI But rumour has it the legendary designer is working on a beautiful new set of clothes for the emperor.

An order from the European Commission states Ireland charge Apple $14.5 billion in back taxes.More >>    By Kris Wouk Provided by If you’ve ever seen the 1984 family-friendly horror-comedy Gremlins, you know that there are a few rules about keeping the said critters. Don’t get them wet, don’t expose them to bright light, and never feed them after midnight. You won’t want to shove a donut into the sleeve of Mondo’s upcoming vinyl Gremlins soundtrack, no matter what time of day it is, but the other two rules can and absolutely should be broken. Later in November, Mondo will release the two-LP set, which features a gatefold sleeve designed by Phantom City Creative that changes when exposed to sunlight (or any UV light), Entertainment Weekly reports. Normally, the artwork shows a lone evil gremlin — Stripe, to be specific — holding a set of colored lights. When exposed to light, a number of hidden messages like “no bright light” appear, along with additional images, presumably scrawled by one of the creatures. More: ‘Jessica Jones’ and ‘Daredevil’ get to get gorgeous vinyl releases Phantom City Creative also designed the two-disc sleeves, but these are sensitive to water instead of light. One shows the film’s furry hero Gizmo, while the other shows Stripe yet again. Both are alone normally, but exposing the sleeves to water causes them to be surround by other gremlins, something Gizmo does not seem too happy about. To be safe, you will probably want to make sure the records are not in the sleeves when applying water, or in the sleeve when exposing it to sunlight, unless you prefer your records melted. While Mondo sells a number of pop culture items like posters, T-shirts, and other collectibles, it has released a number of vinyl soundtracks to both popular films and cult hits. Recent soundtrack releases include Fight Club, the Back to the Future trilogy, Black Sunday, and The Boxtrolls. The Gremlins soundtrack goes on sale on November 30. No pricing has been announced, but based on the price of other Mondo double album releases, it will likely be around $35.

The book, which features 450 photographs of new and old Apple products, is available now from Apple for $199/$299 depending on the size you choose. Popular YouTuber-er DetroitBorg got his hands on a copy of the book and has shared a video of the experience, showing an in-depth look at what the book has to offer… DetroitBorg purchased both the small and large sizes of the ‘Designed by Apple in California’ book, noting that the price is high but not unreasonable in the grand scheme of design books from architecture firms and the like. He also points out that there’s a considerable amount of attention to detail with the book, such as how the pages going all the way to the edge, the detail of the images, and the quality of the cover. The book covers the last 20 years of Apple design, starting at about the time Jony Ive and Steve Jobs started working together. The book itself is incredibly simplistic. There are several blank pages before you get to the first actual words, which are simply ‘Designed by Apple in California’ in small and out-of-the-way text. The next page is the book’s dedication to Steve Jobs, while the page after that is an intro written by Jony Ive. In terms of product images, the first product featured is the first-gem iMac and its bright vivid color options. From there, we continue with the iBook, the Cinema Display, the G4 Cube, the Power Mac G4, and then the PowerBook G4. The book then delves into the original iPod and the production that went into it. From there, the book continues to focus on the various different Macs introduced during the early 2000s. One product that gets a notable amount of attention in the book is the iPod Hi-Fi. The speaker system gets multiple pages in the book, which seems interesting considering it never really took off in terms of popularity. The book continues by delving into the MacBook, the continued evolution of the iPod line, the iPhone, and eventually the Apple Watch and Apple Pencil. The Apple Watch is shown in great detail, with the book offering a glimpse at some internal parts as well as all of that effort that went into the design in the first place. At the very back of the book is a removable glossary that you can use as a guide as you move through the book, in case you’re not able to recognize all of the products on your own. You can watch DetroitBorg’s full video below.

A potential acquisition was valued at between $1.3 billion and $1.9 billion though McLaren later said it was “not in discussion with Apple in respect of any potential investment.” Saturday, McLaren CEO Mike Flewitt confirmed in an interview with Reuters that his company did hold talks with Apple after all, but said the discussions never progressed towards a definitive proposition. Here’s what Flewitt told Reuters: There wasn’t a bid from Apple. They visited. We talked. We talked about what they did. We talked about what we did. They toured. It never matured to a definitive proposition. The very fact that the luxury sports car maker held a meeting with executives from Apple is a confirmation that the two companies were exploring at least some sort of partnership, if not a full takeover bid from Apple. McLaren is best known as a Formula One constructor, competing as McLaren Honda. The McLaren Formula One team, a wholly owned subsidiary of McLaren Technology Group based at the McLaren Technology Centre in UK’s Woking, Surrey, is the second oldest active team after Ferrari and one of the most successful teams in F1 history, having won 182 races, 12 drivers’ championships and 8 constructors’ championships. Apple’s secretive Project Titan hit a snag when Bob Mansfield, its retired hardware chief, was unretired to oversee the initiative amid a series of executive departures and internal delays. After reportedly shutting down various Project Titan initiatives, the project is understood to have since morphed into autonomous driving software. Apple’s Canadian team is reportedly working on a car OS. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo thinks Apple’s augmented reality solutions it’s been reportedly working on for quite some time now could be part of an autonomous driving system from Apple. For the sake of completeness, Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services at Apple, Eddy Cue, joined Ferrari’s board of directors in November 2012.

As soon as the iPhone 7 was released users began notice a difference in download speeds between the Verizon iPhone 7 which features a Qualcomm MDM9645M LTE modem and the AT&T version which has an Intel XMM7360 modem. Cellular Insights performed tests which concluded that the average performance delta between the two is in the 30% range in favor of the Qualcomm variant. Recently, Bloomberg reported on testing by Twin Prime which determined that although the Verizon model is faster than the Intel model, it still is not as fast as it could be. The Samsung Galaxy S7 which also uses the Qualcomm X12 was about twice as fast as the iPhone 7 running on the same network with the same modem chip. “The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities,” said Gabriel Tavridis, head of product at Twin Prime. “I doubt that Apple is throttling each bit on the Verizon iPhone, but it could have chosen to not enable certain features of the network chip.” Now, sources tell Re/code that it's true, Apple has limited the speed of the Qualcomm modem in the Verizon iPhone 7 to make it perform at about the same speed as the Intel modem. Apple supposedly did this for a simple reason: It wanted the cost savings and flexibility of having two chip sources but also wanted the different versions of the phone to be as similar as possible (to avoid angering AT&T and T-Mobile and their customers in the U.S., for example). Apple's official comment on the matter: “Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple’s wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing,” Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said. “In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models."

Not any more. Also, check out the Facebook page "FireTimCook". It's a chronological record of how Apple is dying under the helm of this exceedingly boring, dull and small-minded idiot. Reply · Like · Mark as Spam The iDevice Pro - 1 hour ago Just like he took the "Pro" out of the MacBook Pro this year, Tim Cook is also destroying the iPhone. It's both sad and disgusting at the same time. If he isn't stopped, the MacBook will become no better than the PC and the iPhone will become no better than an Android. Or maybe it's already to that point, but as an avid Apple supporter for so many years, I just don't want to see or believe it. What's next, Tim? Bastardize OS X (macOS) as well? Make it installable on all platforms just so you can get more money? He is destroying the brand that was once so great. Something needs to be done to stop him before it's too late, if it isn't already. I have never disliked anyone as much as I dislike Tim Cook. To destroy something that was so wonderful, beautiful and cherished by so many for the sake of revenue...no....GREED is atrocious.

Forgot to Mention thing about this article they do not mention that I forgot to put in the last comment is that they disable !!! !! EVS HD voice that tmobile services offer But can no longer get if you purchase the new iPhone 7 or 7+ But possibly disabled the feature for all iPhones my question is did they disable this feature and slow the QUALCOMM speed down on all iPhones Not just the seven ?? ??? Maybe possibly we might see them slowing the operating speed down to the iPhone 2G A.k.a. Known as that iPhone 1 It's hard to even load a webpage or a YouTube video on LTE you can forget about it Apple needs to stop screwing over their customers and give people what they want and do not sell different models with different chips of iPhones But I think there's a more point to this why did they choose to use these phones AT&T and T-Mobile is it because they did not want their services roaming on other networks therefore they do not have to pay the networks that they are roaming on Therefore AT&T and T-Mobile saving money What's really going on ??????

But Apple will still have to push hard to reach supply-demand balance by the end of December. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Nov 19, 2016 at 11:35AM Since launching its latest generation of iPhones two months ago, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has seen solid but not spectacular demand for the smaller iPhone 7. Adoption has been somewhat slower than for the iPhone 6s, but not dramatically so. iPhone 7 shipments have probably peaked already, according to respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. By contrast, iPhone 7 Plus demand has been off the charts, catching Apple off guard. The iPhone maker has been working hard to ramp up iPhone 7 Plus production. These efforts are starting to yield results, but Apple still has a long way to go to meet demand during the key holiday season. iPhone 7 Plus demand still exceeds supply by a wide margin. Image source: The Motley Fool. Supply shortages are common It's not unusual for Apple to face long-running supply shortages for its most popular products. For example, in late 2014, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus demand significantly outpaced Apple's expectations. In the U.S. Apple's online store was quoting a wait of three to four weeks for the iPhone 6 Plus as late as mid-November. Apple ultimately sold 74.5 million iPhones during that quarter, up a stunning 46% year over year. It did so despite supply lagging demand right through the end of the quarter. For the iPhone 7 Plus, 2016 is shaping up to be a repeat of 2014. On Apple's earnings call last month, CEO Tim Cook candidly told analysts that he wasn't sure Apple would be able to meet all of the demand for the iPhone 7 Plus by year-end. To some extent, conservatism in Apple's initial planning may be to blame for the iPhone 7 Plus shortage. Earlier this year, Apple ended up with too much iPhone inventory. In trying to avoid a repeat of that problem, it may have gone too far in the other direction. However, the recall and discontinuation of Samsung's competing Galaxy Note 7 has probably also boosted iPhone 7 Plus demand. The Samsung Galaxy Note 7's demise may be boosting iPhone 7 Plus demand. Image source: Apple. Adoption rises steadily Since the iPhone 7 Plus went on sale two months ago, adoption has been rising steadily. During the first month of availability, iPhone 7 Plus sales easily outpaced the sales pace set by the iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone 6 Plus in the last two years. If anything, the second month of sales was even better. iPhone 7 Plus adoption has sped up somewhat in the last month, according to both Fiksu and Mixpanel. The change is small enough that it could just be the result of measurement error. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that Apple's attempts to increase iPhone production are working. For the iPhone 7, supply has more or less caught up to demand, with good availability both in stores and online. For the iPhone 7 Plus, both the weekly sales rate and retail inventories appear to be rising modestly. A massive iPhone 7 Plus backlog remains Despite some improvements in the past month, iPhone 7 Plus demand still outstrips supply by a wide margin. As of the middle of this week, Apple was still quoting a three- to four-week wait for all iPhone 7 Plus models in its online store. It has since reduced that estimate to two to three weeks. This is almost exactly the same timing as 2014, when the iPhone 6 Plus lead time was quoted as three to four weeks until the week before Thanksgiving. Meanwhile, retail availability appears to be very thin, at least at the Apple Store. A handful of U.S. Apple Stores didn't have a single iPhone 7 Plus in stock as of Friday morning. In general, most Apple Stores are out of stock on most iPhone 7 Plus configurations, especially for the more popular wireless carriers. Will supply catch up to demand by year-end? With less than a week left to Black Friday, iPhone 7 Plus retail inventories are still thin and the wait time for online orders remains quite long. This looks very similar to the situation two years ago, when Apple couldn't fully meet demand during the holiday quarter but caught up during January. Two years ago, iPhone 6 supply didn't catch up to demand until January. Image source: Apple. One potential wrinkle is that several major U.S. retailers are including the iPhone 7 Plus in their Black Friday promotions. For example, both Target and Best Buy are offering $250 gift cards with the purchase of an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus on an installment billing program. Perhaps these third-party retailers have secured more of Apple's scarce iPhone 7 Plus shipments recently to support their Black Friday marketing plans. If so, it's possible that supply at the Apple Store could quickly improve in late November and early December. However, even if that's true, Apple will have to race to catch up to demand by the end of the quarter. Apple is clearly benefiting from strong iPhone 7 Plus demand. This should bolster its gross margin, as well as the iPhone average selling price. But it's still a toss-up as to whether Apple will reap the full benefit this quarter or if some sales will be pushed into January.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « The Touch Disease Class Action Lawsuit to Continue as the Lead Plaintiff Calls Apple's Latest Offer 'Pitiful' | Main November 19, 2016 Taiwan's Largest Industrial Conglomerate now Considering Opening Plants in America if Trump Reintroduces Tariffs   On Thursday Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Reportedly Preparing a Responsible U.S. iPhone Plant Back-Up Business Plan." With President Elect Trump in office he'll be able to reduce business taxes from 35% to 15% because Congress and the Senate have Republican majorities. This will be great for investors, businesses and specifically Apple's bottom line. It would also allow Apple to bring their foreign profits home that are currently parked overseas because of the currently high tax rate that Apple is refusing to accept. The catch, if you will for reducing corporate taxes, is to encourage companies to manufacture their products now being made in Mexico, China, Vietnam and elsewhere where they can tap into slave labor. Trump's win is now sinking in and businesses fear a possible future 35-40% tariff on foreign products. While Apple is at least investigating a U.S. plant with Foxconn, others like Samsung and LG are thinking of moving their plants in Mexico to the U.S. This week we also heard from other Taiwanese businesses considering plant openings in the U.S. instead of Vietnam. This certainly proves that it was always possible but that previous U.S. Presidents supported lobbyist driven one-way trade agreements that killed U.S. jobs. In a flash we see that America's market is so big that no company wants to be left on the outside. America still holds the cards and a negotiator like Trump knows that all too well. America could be back in the driver's seat and bring back jobs for all Americans, not just Silicon Valley.   Now we're learning that instead of investing in Vietnam, some Taiwanese companies who don't want to lose their biggest customers in America are willing to open plants in the U.S. They don't whine like so many in Silicon Valley, because business is business and you change with the reality you're dealt with.   Case in point, a new Asian report on Friday pointed out that "Taiwanese companies across the petrochemical, textile and footwear industries are assessing whether they need to move some production to the U.S., as President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to impose a stiff tariff on imports.   Sandy Wang, a senior executive at Formosa Plastics Group, said Taiwan's largest industrial company is evaluating whether it would be worthwhile to invest more in the world's biggest economy.   Wang told the Asian publication that "We have already created 6,000 job opportunities in the U.S., and we would consider investing more in the U.S. if the environment for investment is welcoming."   The report further noted that "Sandy Wang, daughter of the Taiwanese conglomerate's late founder Wang Yung-ching, described Trump as practical and intelligent."   Wang's words came after her group said earlier this year that it would spend as much as $9.4 billion to build a new ethane cracker in the U.S. state of Louisiana, looking to maximizing the benefits of cheap shale gas. The project is pending approval by local environmental regulators. The plant will process ethane, a component of natural gas found in shale, and extract ethylene, used in the production of plastics.   The Taiwanese group has two similar facilities in Texas that produce 1.66 million tons of ethylene yearly. The company also is building a third manufacturing site in Texas that is set to yield 1.2 million tons of ethylene as of 2018.   Formosa Plastics Group holds a number of local stock market heavyweights under its umbrella, including Formosa Plastics, Formosa Petrochemical and Nanya Technology.   However, the U.S. president-elect's protectionist views and pledge to slap a 45% import duty on goods from China have some Taiwanese textile and footwear manufacturers worried, as their production costs could rise dramatically if Trump fulfills his campaign promise.   As the market closed Friday, shares of major Taiwanese apparel maker Eclat Textile were down almost 10% since Trump's victory Nov. 8. Stock prices also have fallen 5.5% for Pou Chen, the world's largest contract footwear maker, and 11.4% for smaller rival Feng Tay Enterprises over the same period.   Eclat, Pou Chen and Feng Tay all have big manufacturing bases in Vietnam and are expanding operations in the Southeast Asian nation, possibly hoping to benefit from Vietnam's status as a member of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an agreement that aims to create the world's largest free trade block.   However, under a Trump presidency the U.S. is unlikely to ratify the TPP, which was championed by President Barack Obama.   Roger Lo, vice president and spokesperson for Eclat, told the Asian publication that his company is watching whether Trump follows through on campaign pledges and forces more goods to be made at home, carrying the "Made in America" label.   Eclat is a supplier to Nike, Under Armour, Costco, JCPenney and other global retailing brands.   "If the Trump administration does raise tariffs, it's inevitable for almost every textile maker including us to think about it and to conduct a thorough evaluation whether the company should move some plants to the U.S.," Lo said.   Lo said he would not exclude any possibilities as long as business opportunities exist. Instead of investing in Vietnam, the investment would be made in the U.S.   "Nothing is impossible," said an executive with a contract footwear maker. "If it's a trend and if some major clients want us to make more products in the U.S., we would have to move there."   Of course prices would rise if products were to be made in the U.S. to maintain profits, but if it means bringing back jobs to the U.S. the compromise will be worth it to working families. If you don't have a job, you don't buy anything other than basics.   At the end of the day, I find it mind boggling to see how foreign companies are already making it clear in local publications that they will seriously consider opening plants in the U.S. if conditions are right so as to not lose American business.   Just the mere thought of being locked out of America has real and responsible business people in Taiwan and around the world switch on a dime to bringing plants to America. That alone is amazing that Donald Trump could instill this reaction so quickly.   It's a trump-card that America has always held but greedy U.S. companies just couldn't resist returning to the days of slave labor without unions. To move their plants to these slave labor rich countries and sell their products back to Americans tax free was a dream come true.   So it was great to hear that foreign companies see it differently. They don't want to lose the American consumer and they'll put people to work in America to keep that business. What a refreshing story it was to read this week and I'm sure many of you have enjoyed hearing about it too.   Here's to hoping that President-Elect Trump ends these one-way trade deals so that America can bring jobs home and begin paying off its drowning debt.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « California Builder Creates Community Homes with Slick HomeKit Smart Home Packages Available | Main | Taiwan's Largest Industrial Conglomerate now Considering Opening Plants in America if Trump Reintroduces Tariffs » November 19, 2016 The Touch Disease Class Action Lawsuit to Continue as the Lead Plaintiff Calls Apple's Latest Offer 'Pitiful'   Late on Thursday Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Formally Acknowledges the iPhone 6 Plus 'Touch Disease' Issue and Offers Customers with this Problem Some Relief." While Apple opened a new program to deal with the issue this week that would provide some Apple customers a bit of financial relief, I questioned whether that would be enough relief for the law firms handling the class action lawsuits to back off. The answer, at least involving one class action, is clearly no.   A Canadian report published today reacts to Apple's newly announced touch disease program. According to the report, "Apple is finally offering a cure for its iPhone 6 Plus models plagued by so-called "touch disease." The affliction causes the phone's screen to freeze up and no longer respond to touch commands.   The fix will cost American customers $149 US. Canadians will have to shell out $189.   The move follows months of customer complaints about touch disease and multiple proposed class action lawsuits filed against Apple over the issue.   But while Apple is offering a fix, some customers are dismayed to discover the company is charging a fee and placing the blame on them.   According to Apple arises after the phone has been dropped "multiple times on a hard surface" and then is subjected to "further stress."   'Pitiful' Offer   iPhone owner Trina Rae Wiegers from Prince Albert, Sask responded to Apple's offer by saying "I think it's pitiful." She claims that many smartphones get dropped, so if that's the culprit, lots of different iPhone models should be suffering from the same problem – but aren't. "You can't just pick one and say apparently people are just dropping the 6 Pluses."   Wiegers owns an iPhone 6, which she believes also suffers from touch disease. She says it periodically freezes up and becomes useless. "You miss calls, you can't text, it's a horrible piece of crap."   Even if she could get the fix, Wiegers claims she would never pay $189. "It's ridiculous," she says. "It's their problem and they need to own up to it." $189 fee for show?   Wiegers is the lead plaintiff in a proposed Canadian class action lawsuit launched against Apple over touch disease.   A total of four proposed class-actions have been filed, two in Canada and two in the U.S. involving both iPhone 6 and 6 Plus owners.   "It's a design defect, so to charge $189 to fix their problem is simply atrocious," claims Regina lawyer Tony Merchant, who's heading up the Canadian lawsuits.   He alleges both the 6 and 6 Plus were designed in a way that even the slightest bend results in a disconnect in the phone, causing the screen to no longer respond to touch.   Merchant claims Apple came up with a fee for the fix not because it needed the cash but to create the impression touch disease is not its fault.   "Their motive is to maintain the pretense that they didn't design a defective phone," he alleges.   "What they ought to be doing is fixing all of [them] without charge and pay compensation to people who've lost the use of their phone."   In order to proceed, all four class actions must first be certified in court. Apple would not comment on the proposed suits.

Adam Levy (adamlevy) Nov 19, 2016 at 9:27AM Image Source: Fitbit The demand for simple wearables, such as most of Fitbit's (NYSE:FIT) fitness trackers, soared through the first half of the year, as high-end smartwatches from companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell out of favor. But the tide is turning, as Fitbit forecast "softness in overall demand" for the fourth quarter. The timing of Fitbit's lower-than-expected sales forecast coincides with the release of Apple's updated Apple Watch. Apple's wearable sales fell 57% in the second quarter after lapping the launch of the original Apple Watch, and sales fell 72% in the third quarter as customers waited for an update, according to data from IDC. But with the update arriving in September, it could have had a meaningful impact on Fitbit's demand as they compete for similar customers. The problem actually started last quarter While Fitbit in early November reported third-quarter results in line with analysts' expectations, it benefited from pulling forward sales of its Charge 2 device. Fitbit was able to ramp up production of the successor to its best-selling device faster than anticipated, allowing it to ship more units to stores ahead of schedule. At the end of September, Pacific Crest analyst Brad Erickson noted that Charge 2 units were piling up on the shelves. The faster ramp-up in production explains that trend, somewhat countering his conclusion that it was the result of low demand. But Fitbit's fourth-quarter outlook indicates that Erickson was at least partially correct. Although the pull-forward of Charge 2 units offset poor sales of other devices in the third quarter, management's outlook for the fourth quarter shows significantly slowing growth in consumer demand from the year before. CFO Bill Zerellal told analysts, "Our guidance basically assumes 15% to 20% growth -- in dollar growth -- in consumer demand in Q4, year on year." In the fourth quarter of 2015, Fitbit's revenue nearly doubled. Due to the pull-forward of Charge 2 sales, revenue growth will lag consumer demand. Analysts are currently projecting just 4% revenue growth for the fourth quarter. Is Apple to blame? Apple released the update to its Apple Watch in mid-September, and it had much more of a fitness focus than its predecessor. But Apple's device has a much higher starting price than any of Fitbit's products. The Fitbit Blaze, its highest-priced product, starts at just $200, while the Apple Watch Series 2 starts at $369. Fitbit's average selling price was just $93 last quarter. Still, Apple has generally broad appeal and strong brand recognition compared to Fitbit. And it's looking to take advantage of the same market opportunity Fitbit's management was keen to point out during its earnings call. "Sixty-six percent of people in the U.S. care about health and fitness and have a smartphone or computer tablet," CEO James Park told analysts. "However, only 20% of U.S. adults in a recent independent survey indicated that they own a connected health and fitness device." Apple, with U.S. smartphone market share over 40%, is in a much better position than Fitbit to take advantage of that gap. The increased overlap in utility between the Series 2 and Fitbit's products could be dampening demand. Additionally, Park noted, "We believe Fitbit has a key role to play in the healthcare ecosystem in how healthcare is practiced." To that end, Apple is also making progress. On the company's fourth-quarter earnings call, CEO Tim Cook pointed out that Aetna "announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch for individual customers and select large employers." While Apple Watch sales have generally been disappointing to most analysts, that doesn't mean they can't have an impact on Fitbit's sales. Regardless, the outlook from Fitbit is rather bleak, and the stock market responded in kind. Even with the depressed stock price, Fitbit's bleak outlook on demand and vagueness around its ability to compete with Apple and other high-end devices makes its stock unappealing.

 Apple should buy Snap Kif Leswing Nov. 19, 2016, 9:00 AM 8,143 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook has said several times in the last year that his company is willing to look at and consider billion-dollar acquisitions with its $237 billion war chest. Most of the possibilities floated by analysts and the press don't make a lot of sense: Time Warner, Disney, Tesla Motors. Some are saying Apple needs to think differently, and make one big, crazy acquisition, before it's too late. An acquisition that would change the company forever. I think Apple should buy Snap, Snapchat's parent company.  The timing is now Why not? REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson Why would Snap founder Evan Spiegel want to sell his company to Apple? Money.  Snap filed for a confidential IPO earlier this week, Business Insider learned, that could value the company between $20 billion and $25 billion. The actual paperwork, including Snap's revenue, profit (or lack thereof), and assets has yet to surface.  But the fact that Snap filed confidentially reveals one fact: Snap's revenue is less than $1 billion. Even assuming big league revenue growth for the disappearing photo messenger, that's a surprisingly large valuation.  That doesn't matter to Apple, and the company could afford a nice premium over the $25 billion the public market could value Snap at. Apple could afford Snap even if it were valued at $50 billion.  Spiegel has expressed doubt that advertising is the growth engine that will propel Snap to become a massive technology company. "Feed based advertising units will plummet in value ... similar to earlier devaluing of Internet display advertising," he wrote in an email stolen during the Sony hack.  If Snapchat's advertising strategy doesn't work out, it could destroy much of the worth currently locked into Snap shares held by Spiegel and other founders. That's why Spiegel seems to be pivoting his company towards becoming a hardware provider, even going so far as to call Snap a "camera company" on its own website. It's also why Snap has started to sell Spectacles, a surprising new product that combines stylish sunglasses with a camera.  There's no company that understands making and selling premium hardware better than Apple.  First glass Spectacles. Hollis Johnson The hype around Spectacles, Snapchat's first real hardware product, reminds me of the hype that used to surround Apple product launches.  Every time Snap's custom-built, Minion-looking vending machine touches down somewhere — three times in California so far, and once in Oklahoma — a line immediately forms, full of people waiting to buy the $129 glasses.  Apple used to have a following like that, and to some extent still does, but there is an excitement to the Spectacles launch that Apple has not had in a long time. Just look at the lines. That's because Spiegel carefully planned this launch. He understands the importance of marketing, and limited rollouts, and how important it is to make something cool that people want.  And that's the key — Spectacles are the first piece of tech worn on the face that is actually cool.  "From the first moment of opening the lid to pairing the Spectacles with my phone, they were everything I hoped they'd be: well-designed, stylish, fun, and easy to use. Walking around New York City with them, I felt like part of an exclusive club," my colleague Avery Hartmans wrote earlier this week. "Regardless of how you feel about Snapchat's new camera-equipped glasses, one thing is certain: Snapchat's marketing team is genius," she wrote.  News broke this week that Apple is working on a pair of stylish smart glasses that could launch as soon as 2018. It's still early, but it seems like Snap has already solved the biggest problem with wearable computers on the face: getting people to want to wear them. Snapchat's glasses are only a camera for now, but it's not hard to see where the company is going with them — a fully functional AR device that could be competing with Apple Glasses in a few years.  Apple could eliminate a major competitor and gain a great head start to its glasses project at the same time. Why Apple would want Snap  Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel speaks onstage during 'Disrupting Information and Communication' at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts on October 8, 2014 in San Francisco, California. Getty/Michael Kovac The fact that Snap doesn't have much revenue yet actually makes the company attractive to Apple.  Cook says all the time that Apple doesn't buy companies for their cash flow — Apple has plenty of that itself. Instead, Cook says, Apple is looking for "great talent and great intellectual property." Snap has both.  Snap is growing quickly and now has a varied and eclectic pool of talented engineers, especially in the fields of computer vision and AI, two fields which Apple is investing heavily in.  Some of Snap's top employees even used to work at Apple. Snap also has some great intellectual property. People in the augmented reality industry say its in-house developed emoji tracking feature is genuinely impressive, and could be a building block for future applications. Snap's face-transforming Snapchat "Lens" filters are probably the most widely used example of computer vision-powered augmented reality at the moment. via GIPHY That's pretty attractive intellectual property for a company that is is getting into augmented reality in a big way. Plus, it's undeniable that Snap is tapped into young people in a way that Apple, led by its team of mostly older men, is not.   Plus, Apple is reportedly developing a Snapchat-like video app. Why clone, when you can have the original?  Spiegel might not sell — but he does emulate Apple founder Steve Jobs Evan Spiegel/Twitter There are a few issues with this proposal. First, Snap is an LA-based company, so Apple couldn't buy it with overseas cash at a discount — one of the main factors driving the company's M&A strategy at the moment.  But the bigger problem is that Spiegel probably doesn't want to sell. He famously turned down an offer from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to buy his company for billions of dollars in 2013. (He also previously blew off Zuck with a surprisingly cold email.)  If Speigel, who is 26, sold Snap to Apple, Apple should make him the CEO. After all, Apple has had a 26-year old CEO before: Steve Jobs.  The key to Spiegel is that he is a product "Picasso," as people who know him have said. He studied product design at Stanford, and Business Insider has been told that Snap's office vibe is like "a movie director starting a company, with artists flowing in and out" — similar to how Apple's famously secretive industrial design studio operates.  Apple would do well with a product-focused guru at its helm. Cook is fantastic at running the company, but Apple was built around the whims and taste of one man — Jobs — who was intensely focused on building products. A file photo of Steve Jobs with the Snapchat Spectacles filter applied. Reuters/Business Insider Today, with chief design officer Jony Ive increasingly looking backwards and working on side projects, there's a sense that there isn't anyone at Apple who's in charge of the product anymore.  Speigel — who resembles Steve Jobs in his showmanship, his obsession with secrecy, and his focus on products and experience — would be able to give Apple some clarity when it comes to its AR and glasses strategy, and probably has an idea or two about how to make the next iPhone better beyond giving it faster chips and taking away the headphone jack.  But Apple should hurry. Snap could list as soon as March — and in a few years, it could be one of Apple's fiercest competitors.  SEE ALSO: REVIEW: Snapchat's Spectacles AND: Tim Cook laid out the playbook for Apple's next big thing CAN'T MISS: If you think it's crazy that Snapchat might go public at a $40 billion valuation, here's something to consider AND: Meet the power players who run Snapchat DON'T MISS: Apple has a secret team working to make the iPhone's camera a portal to augmented reality PLUS: What it’s like to work at Snapchat, one of the most secretive companies in tech NOW WATCH: The ‘Apple of China’ just unveiled a phone that’s more powerful and better looking than the iPhone Loading video...

Related Apple iPhone 6 Plus 'Touch Disease' repair charges slashed by 50% Apple iPhone 8 tipped to come in three variants According to the report, the iPhone-iPad combo offer went live on Friday and will be available till December 31, 2016. Customers can avail the offer to a maximum of four times, and only two of which can be carried out in a month. This means, customers buying an iPhone and an iPad with Rs. 23,000 discount twice this month will be able to replicate the same next month. But they cannot avail the offer four times in December alone. Since the offer is a combo deal, the iPhone and iPad must be purchased from the same store on the same day, using the same card. The cashback will be credited to the buyer's credit card within 90 days of purchase. If the customer purchases an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus, cashbacks on iPads are as follows: iPad mini 2: Rs. 17,000 cashback iPad mini 4: Rs. 17,000 cashback iPad Pro: Rs. 23,000 cashback iPad Air 2: Rs. 18,000 cashback The cashbacks also work in reverse, which means if customers buy an iPad, the corresponding cashback will be applied for iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus purchase.

Jahns @adamjahns | email Sign-Up for our Sports Newsletter  Sign-Up Adam L. Jahns’ “Inside the Huddle” column appears in game-day editions of the Sun-Times. Rookie outside linebacker Leonard Floyd still remembers what he felt when the Bears traded up to select him in the draft. He was elated but stressed. “It’s a good thing,” Floyd said. “But it’s also a lot of pressure. I mean, they traded up to get you for a reason.” Bears OLB Leonard Floyd celebrates vs. the Vikings. (Getty) That trade takes center stage this week. It’s widely thought that Floyd was a top target for the New York Giants, who owned the 10th pick. In a bold draft-day move, the Bears jumped ahead of the Giants, acquiring the No. 9 pick from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the 11th pick and a fourth-round selection. Coach John Fox downplayed the significance of the decision, referring to all the “bogus” information involved in the draft. But it might go down as one of general manager Ryan Pace’s best moves. Floyd has been that impressive. After some early struggles attributable to minor injuries, Floyd has blossomed into an every-down difference-maker. He’s the main reason to believe in what the Bears are building. In the last three games, Floyd has 4½ sacks and three tackles for loss. He also a forced fumble by Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and recovered it for a touchdown. “He’s obviously a very talented young man,” Giants coach Bob McAdoo said during a conference call with the Chicago media. The story in New York was that the Bears’ trade left the Giants spinning. It was reported that the Giants had Floyd and offensive tackle Jack Conklin in mind for the No. 10 pick. The Tennessee Titans drafted Conklin with the eighth selection after they also traded up. The Giants selected cornerback Eli Apple — a move that was heavily criticized at the time. Apple has had typical growing pains. He responded from a Week  9 benching against the Philadelphia Eagles with a more complete performance in a 21-20 victory last week against the Cincinnati Bengals. “Eli’s done a nice job,” McAdoo said. “He had some bumps in the road a couple of weeks ago. But we dusted him off. We threw him back out there last week, and he played at a high level. He had some production, covered well.” But Apple’s story also includes his mother, Annie, a writer for SI.com, who has criticized the Giants this season. “I try to handle my own messaging with the team and not necessarily worry about the noise,” McAdoo said when asked about Apple and his mother. “But he seems like he’s handling it just fine.” It’s a recurring distraction the Bears don’t have, though. And they also have Floyd’s surging production. The Giants’ defense only has 14 sacks, the second-fewest in the league. Safety Landon Collins is tied with defensive end Olivier Vernon — the Giants’ free-agent prize who received a five-year, $85 million deal — for the team lead with three sacks. Floyd still is improving in one-on-one pass-rush situations. But defensive coordinator Vic Fangio has tapped into his skills through designed pressures and stunts. Overall, Floyd has emerged as a unique and versatile weapon for Fangio, who’s not afraid to have him cover a slot receiver, rush him over a guard or loop him around two teammates on a stunt. “This is probably the longest stretch of practice and the subsequent games that he’s had since he’s been here [because of injuries],” Fangio said, “so you’re seeing progress on the field.” But it’s progress highlighted by the production the Bears envisioned since draft day. “I’ve said all along that there’s an uncoachable skill set that he has, that it’s just a matter of time until he gets comfortable,” Fox said. “He’s going to be a very, very good young player.” EXTRA POINTS Go and get it With Alshon Jeffery suspended, Cameron Meredith is the Bears’ No. 1 receiver, but can he make No. 1-like receiver plays? Quarterback Jay Cutler said he can and that includes 50/50 jump balls. “He’s a long guy in one-on-ones,” Cutler said. “His favorite route is a go route, so he can definitely do it. “We’re going to be in a position going forward in these next four games where we’re going to have to take some shots at some point, and he’s definitely a candidate for that.” Even though he’s 6-3 and has long arms, Meredith really hasn’t shown it yet. When Kevin White was placed on injured reserve, Meredith slid into the No. 2 role and the offense didn’t change. But it will with Jeffery out. Meredith excelled in plays that were typically designed for White. Before his 50-yard Hail Mary touchdown, Meredith’s longest receptions went for 30 and 36 yards, respectively, against the Colts and Jaguars. But both were short completions, not jump balls. The 30-yarder was the result of short curl route and broken tackles. The 36-yarder was a well-executed screen. This rookie will play Rookie defensive lineman Jonathan Bullard will start his second consecutive game with Mitch Unrein sidelined by a back injury. Bullard has improved over time, but he’s still not reacting to plays and his reads as quickly as the Bears want. His coveted fast first-step has been slower because he’s over-thinking. “It’s getting better,” Bullard said. “I still think sometimes about taking certain chances and stuff where they’re telling me to just ahead and play. “I try to just play now. I still think about certain things that I shouldn’t and that they don’t want me thinking about. But that’s just going to come with time.” Let this rookie play Rookie safety Deon Bush’s development has lagged behind other rookies since he injured his hamstring in the preseason. But the Bears are starting to phase in the fourth-round pick, getting him snaps in the dime package. It’s only amounted to eight plays over the past four games, but it’s a start. “He’s doing better, taking baby steps,” defensive coordinator Vic Fangio said. “Maybe he’ll warrant some more action as we move forward.” NUMBERS GAME 75.7 – The average passer rating of opposing quarterbacks have against the Giants. It’s the fourth-best mark in the NFL. 49 – The total number of penalties the Giants offense has this season. It’s tied for the second fewest with the 49ers. 13 – The number of players the Bears have on their official reserve/injured list after placing right guard Kyle Long on it. # bears Leonard Floyd Halas Hall Previously from Sports Blackhawks mailbag: Is the Toews and Kane pairing working out? | Chicago Sun-Times Blackhawks rally from three-goal deficit for OT victory | Chicago Sun-Times Inside the Huddle: Leonard Floyd is Bears' gain, Giants' big loss | Chicago Sun-Times Stan Bowman not worried about looming expansion draft | Chicago Sun-Times Currently Trending dear abby Dear Abby: Surgery overseas leaves her infected and in agony | Chicago Sun-Times chicago Ald.

November 19, 2016 5:28 AM   Subscribe Trying to set up Apple Pay on a new iPhone SE has been a huge and aggravating and unsuccessful time sink. It "Just Fails". If you use Apple Pay, do you like it? How often do you use it? In what circumstances do you still pull out a credit card? After 9+ hours of phone time with Apple support and card issuer support, turns out the card I use daily is not eligible for Apple Pay because it was issued to me several years ago to replace a "partner" card. Apple does not support "partner" cards. Obtained new, the card is fine with Apple Pay. But, my card, in effect, was grandfathered back to the "partner" card. The card issuer has no solution other than applying for a new card. A second card with a different card issuer can't be activated because the card issuer is texting a verification code to the wrong number. They "don't know" why, so they've opened ticket. posted by justcorbly to Computers & Internet (27 answers total)   Apple Pay saves me those annoying seconds waiting for the chip cards to do their thing, and I like having my purchase amount showing up on my phone screen to remind me what I've spent. I use it at the pharmacy and the grocery store. I would have to use it for decades, though, for it to add up to hours of time savings! Sounds like maybe you should wait until you happen to get a new credit card, for other reasons, and then try again. posted by wyzewoman at 6:38 AM on November 19 I do use Apple Pay, started making a point of using it when available. I'd say it works better than a physical card 3/4 of the time. I find it's easier to take my phone out of my pocket than fish my card out of the wallet. I also like that many Apple Pay POS systems have no printed receipt and no signature required. Although that's not consistent. The only thing I don't like is the spooky magic UI for activating the card payment; I'm still not sure what hand gesture is required on the iPhone to bring it up. Double tap the home screen? Unlock the phone? Just hold it close to an Apple Pay device? No idea. I like it, but I wouldn't have jumped through a lot of hoops to set it up. I never had any trouble with the setup, my Visa card just worked. posted by Nelson at 6:39 AM on November 19 I find Apple Pay to be a convenience, but not one that I would go through the inconvenience you're going through to have. The thing I like most is that I don't have to fumble around in my purse to take out/replace my card when I'm also dealing with packages/bags, and it's quick so there's no awkward waiting for the chip to go through. posted by DoubleLune at 7:31 AM on November 19 [1 favorite] I use it fairly often and like it a lot. It does depend a lot on the specific places you shop, though. For example, my main grocery store takes Apple Pay but none of the other grocery stores nearby do. Would I apply for a brand new card just to use Apple Pay? Probably not. But I think it's a good idea in general to have more than just one card, if for no other reason than that it gives you a backup if the main one won't work. So, if I were in your shoes, I'd kill two birds with one stone -- apply for another card that will both serve as a backup, and work with Apple Pay. FWIW, I have six cards in Apple Pay from basically all of the major US issuers, and none took more than a minute or so to set up. posted by primethyme at 7:34 AM on November 19 [3 favorites] Sorry, one other thing. If something is causing the Apple Pay verifications to go to the wrong phone number, I'd be more worried about that than about getting a card that works. I've never heard of that happening, and it would make me worry that something is deeply wrong with the configuration of your device or account somewhere, which may have other implications. Was this a used device? Was the number ported between carriers? Are you using a non-standard SIM card? I don't know what would cause this, but I'd like to revise my "if I were in your shoes." I would prioritize figuring out what is going on there, and getting it fixed, even if you decide you don't care about Apple Pay. If someone else is receiving verification notifications that should be going to you, there are a lot of potentially bad scenarios... posted by primethyme at 7:41 AM on November 19 [3 favorites] primethyme: the bank is (allegedly) sending the verification messages. The Apple device, or Apple itself, is not involved in rhthe verification process. posted by sideshow at 8:04 AM on November 19 I like having a payment method set up on my phone in case I lose or forget my wallet. posted by Candleman at 8:15 AM on November 19 [1 favorite] the bank is (allegedly) sending the verification messages. Yes, sorry, I misread the OP. Disregard that part (though I'd still be wanting to know why one of my banks is sending my info to someone else's number). posted by primethyme at 8:16 AM on November 19 [1 favorite] I use it all the time - all the grocery stores and drug stores I use have it. I use my card instead...when a place doesn't have ApplePay. My phone is quicker than the chip verification process, I don't have to take out my wallet and fumble around, there's no risk I'll forget/drop/lose my card. I had no trouble setting it up. I don't know what a "partner" card is but it sounds like your troubles aren't really about ApplePay. You need to fix whatever is wrong with that 2nd card anyway, so once that's done, just set up ApplePay there. posted by donnagirl at 8:26 AM on November 19 [5 favorites] I use it but only on the Apple Watch. It has never let me down and is probably the best thing about the watch, especially for going on public transport. Recommend. posted by Coda Tronca at 8:33 AM on November 19 [2 favorites] I like it for stuff like uber, hoteltonight, dunkin donuts, starbucks, etc- many of these apps can hit apple pay directly, and the app vendors don't get my CC#, so I can control when the card reloads, etc. posted by jenkinsEar at 8:44 AM on November 19 [2 favorites] I have never had a single problem adding cards to Apple Pay and the only problem using it is that most stores around here don't accept it. Your experience is atypical. Forget that card and try another one. posted by w0mbat at 8:46 AM on November 19 [2 favorites] I like and use Apple Pay. You can use it anywhere the contactless payment symbol appears on the credit card terminal. It's much more convenient than digging in my bag for a wallet, and then waiting for the chip and pin dance. And the retailer doesn't receive you actual card number, so you're not hit by security breaches. Someone above mentioned not being sure how to trigger it. To trigger Apple Pay, from the lock screen double tap the home button to bring up Apple Pay, and then rest your finger on the button to allow Touch ID to validate your fingerprint. Hope that helps! posted by bluloo at 8:53 AM on November 19 Yeah I have Apple Pay on my watch and phone and really love it. It took me less than 5 minutes to set up on both devices. I use it anywhere I can find Apple Pay at a store. I use it because it's faster, more convenient, and from what I've read, more secure. In my experience, the folks I know who had trouble setting it up are using cards from banks that don't support it. My husband can't use his card for example because it's issued from a small bank and they aren't set up for something like this. posted by FireFountain at 9:10 AM on November 19 I love Apple Pay. I would not go through the aggravation you're going through to make it work. posted by Slarty Bartfast at 9:15 AM on November 19 It's nice, but it's no faster than just tapping with your card. I will often have my phone out if I'm waiting in a line, so it's nice to be able to use it to pay, but it's not quicker than regular tap. posted by Nightman at 10:39 AM on November 19 I love Apple pay for the speed it offers for a transaction. What I don't like about it is the reactions some cashiers will have if they are unfamiliar with the technology. A pet peeve of mine is having to explain how it works over and over again. I honestly think Apple needs to do a better job explaining how it works. posted by 81818181818181818181 at 11:56 AM on November 19 What I don't like about it is the reactions some cashiers will have if they are unfamiliar with the technology. I'm in my 40s and I like using Apple Watch to pay in pubs because the London hipster bar staff all think it's pretty silly (Apple Watch is deeply uncool from start to finish). In one pub they even call me 'Iron Man'. posted by Coda Tronca at 12:00 PM on November 19 [4 favorites] It's handy where it works, but it's less than a third of my transactions. posted by wotsac at 12:33 PM on November 19 It's nice, but it's no faster than just tapping with your card. I will often have my phone out if I'm waiting in a line, so it's nice to be able to use it to pay, but it's not quicker than regular tap. If OP is in the US it's unlikely they have the tap chip; which is one of the reasons Apple/Android Pay, etc, are so easily marketed here. Chiming in with "It's great." I use it everywhere that supports it, which in the US should be everyone by the end of 2016, because they'll need the new terminals that support chip & pin, which almost all support NFC pay. posted by sixfootaxolotl at 12:39 PM on November 19 @PrimeThyme: It's an old number of mine that the card issuer wants to text that verification code. Likely the number I had years ago when I got that card. Why that's happening when the only number anyone can find there is my current number is the thing they don't know. posted by justcorbly at 12:45 PM on November 19 I live in the US, and have never even SEEN the "just tap the card to pay" situation. Here, it's all: 1. Swipe the card, using the mag stripe (legacy only) 2. Use the new time-eating chipreader, which leaks all your info to the merchant in addition to taking longer; or 3. ApplePay, which is both crazy fast AND secure, and leaks very little info to the merchant. Of these options, I take ApplePay every damn time. Since I got an Apple Watch, it's even MORE cool -- especially when I'm off cycling somewhere and want to buy a water or an energy bar. I know which convenience stores take it now. :) posted by uberchet at 12:50 PM on November 19 [1 favorite] I assume you also have an Apple ID? Might that old phone number be attached to that account? posted by Thorzdad at 12:54 PM on November 19 I assume you also have an Apple ID? Might that old phone number be attached to that account? The number comes from the card issuer and not Apple, so that wouldn't be it, unfortunately. posted by sixfootaxolotl at 1:08 PM on November 19 Here in NZ, there's only one bank that uses Apple Pay as the rest are an Australian consortium who are holding out. Needless to say, I opened an account with that bank even though they're hopeless at customer service. Took days to open the account, but now I have I do well over half my transactions through Apple Watch. If they don't have contactless payment then I have to use a card, but I try to avoid those shops that don't accept it. Apple Pay is the way to go for sure. posted by tillsbury at 7:16 PM on November 19 I love Apple Pay as a consumer, and I love customers who use Apple Pay when I am at work. It has made such a difference for me time/convenience wise. Hope you're able to get yours to work! posted by Hermione Granger at 7:51 PM on November 19 I only ever use Apple Pay as a novelty at Whole Foods. It's kind of convenient. The difference between "get phone out and press button" and "get wallet out, remove card, insert into terminal, wait, sign terminal, take card back, and place in wallet" is not that big a deal. Not what I would call "life transforming", but nice. posted by theorique at 9:21 AM on November 20 « Older How strict are antibiotics frequency times?   |   Dyeing hair for the first time ever with ombré -...

Which is progress. However, it’s not accepting the blame for this fault that’s out there right now killing iPhones. What’s more, it’s charging customers to repair the problem. Which is the opposite of progress. In August of this year, a rather serious flaw with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus reared its ugly head.

[Tech News Digest] Apple has a serious iPhone problem, Google hates interstitials like the rest of us, Woz likes his headphone jack, Adult Swim brings ToeJam & Earl back, and what happens when the Pokemon fight back? Read More , this flaw turns your iPhone into a rather expensive brick. What starts out as a flickering gray bar at the top of your touchscreen eventually renders your phone unusable. The clever bods over at iFixit quickly identified the problem, and others have since confirmed the ultimate cause of Touch Disease. It’s claimed it all leads back to the integrated circuit chips which power and control the touchscreen, and the way they’re soldered to the logic board. If this is true, then Touch Disease is caused by a design flaw. Apple changed something, and it may have directly led to iPhones stopping working.

Apple Will Fix Touch Disease… For a Price Apple has stayed silent on this issue for months. If a customer complained that their iPhone had stopped working they were advised to simply buy a new iPhone. So people turned to third-party iPhone repairers instead, who were able to fix Touch Disease without too much hassle. Now, however, Apple has launched its “Multi-Touch Repair Program for iPhone 6 Plus”. Which sees Apple offering to fix your iPhone for just $149. Unfortunately this only applies to iPhone 6 Plus owners, with Apple still refusing to even admit the iPhone 6 is adversely affected. So why is Apple charging you to fix a problem it caused in the first place? Because Apple is refusing to take the blame, claiming that iPhones are suffering catastrophic failure “after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device”. In other words it’s all your fault. So pay up or else.

In 2007, Nokia recalled 46 million phone batteries, and there have been more than forty other such recalls since 2002. In this article, we’ll explore just what the heck is going on and whether or not you need to worry about this with your own smartphone. Why Do We Use Batteries That Explode? All of our portable electronic devices (i.e. phones, tablets, laptops) use Lithium-ion batteries. Pound for pound, Lithium-ion batteries provide far more energy than other types of batteries — around twice as much as Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries and around six-times as much as the lead-acid batteries used in cars. This is important in an industry where weight (or lack thereof) is a huge selling point. We all want our phones to be as light as possible yet still last at least a full day without recharging — and at the moment, Lithium-ion is the best technology we have that lets us do that. Image Credit: Coprid via Shutterstock But Lithium-ion batteries have a few disadvantages, too. They have a short shelf life, only lasting about 2–3 years from the date of manufacture, and that’s regardless of whether they’re actively used or not. If they fully discharge, they’ll never work again. And occasionally they explode. To understand why this happens, it’s necessary to know a little about how Lithium-ion batteries work internally. Like all modern batteries How a Battery Works and 3 Ways You Can Ruin It How a Battery Works and 3 Ways You Can Ruin It The modern battery is featured in so many of our favourite technologies that you could almost be forgiven for not spending time learning about their workings. Read More , they store and release energy through controlled chemical reactions. A current flows between two electrodes (an anode and a cathode) through chemicals called electrolytes. Lithium is highly reactive, which is what gives these batteries such a high energy density — but it also means that if something goes wrong, the results can be catastrophic. So, What Can Go Wrong? There are a few things that can go wrong with a Lithium-ion battery and they all involve overheating. If one part of the battery gets too hot, then it can lead to a chain reaction known as “thermal runaway” — the whole battery gets hotter and hotter until it ignites or explodes. Because of this, Lithium-ion batteries have an on-board computer to ensure they don’t overheat. If this fails then overheating can occur, especially on a hot day or when the device is being heavily used. Overcharging can also lead to overheating, but again, the battery’s internal computer should prevent this. Unfortunately it may fail to do so, whether due to a manufacturing error or because the computer itself has sustained damage. Image Credit: wk1003mike via Shutterstock The anode and cathode also need to be kept separate or the battery will short circuit, redirecting energy to the electrolytes. In a Lithium-ion battery the electrolytes are highly flammable, and fire or explosion is all but inevitable if this occurs. Why would the electrodes ever touch? Again, maybe because the battery sustained physical damage or because of a manufacturing error (e.g. a defect in the material that separates the electrodes, the introduction of a foreign conducting material, etc). Misusing or abusing the battery can also cause an explosion. Piercing the battery with a sharp object can cause a short circuit, while connecting it to an incorrect charger can cause it to overcharge or charge too quickly, which can lead to a build up of lithium on the electrodes, a short circuit, and ultimately an explosion. What Went Wrong for Samsung? It’s not yet clear exactly what the issue was with the Galaxy Note 7. The company has blamed “a very rare manufacturing process error” which caused the anode and cathode to come into contact. Further investigations are underway. Samsung has stated that none of its other products are affected by this issue, and there have not been a significant number of incidents involving their other products. Remarkably, some people have decided that the Galaxy Note 7 is such a good phone, they’re going to hold onto theirs Some Idiots Are Keeping Their Exploding Samsung Phones Some Idiots Are Keeping Their Exploding Samsung Phones In case you missed the news, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is dead.

Although the consequences of an exploding battery can be catastrophic, it’s an extremely rare event.  You’re more likely to be struck by lightning  — which would probably also cause your phone to explode! But there are some steps you can take to reduce the odds even further: Only use the original battery, or one from the manufacturer, or a reputable brand. Don’t leave your device in hot areas, particularly while charging. Keep it out of direct sunlight, and make sure it can dissipate heat effectively. Have a protective case for your phone to avoid puncture damage if you drop it. But take the case off if the phone gets too hot. The phone will almost certainly shut down before the battery gets hot enough to ignite, but the heat can still shorten the life of the battery. Do not use a cracked or swollen battery. Remove it from any device and do not attempt to charge it. Dispose of old or damaged batteries responsibly. Take them to a recycling center, or to a electronics retailer who will be able to dispose of them properly.

And yes, I'll buy the Note 8, but a couple of months after release to avoid any other recall. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

NEW YORK  Your streaming TV options have gotten better and cheaper. Features that once required a $100 device can now be had for as little as $30. A cheap device is fine for getting TV shows and movies from most popular services onto a big-screen TV  as long as its a regular, high-definition set. Of course, its possible to simply watch video on a phone or tablet, but its not as satisfying from a living-room couch. Heres a holiday buying guide for the TV-streamers in your life. Streaming built-in Smart TVs, game consoles and the TiVo digital video recorder all have streaming apps, and if all you watch is Netflix and Hulu, youll be fine with those. But apps for individual channels such as The CW and FX wont work with every device. The exceptions are TVs running Roku software or that have Googles Chromecast technology built in; they tend to have wider app selections. Getting around Devices vary in how easy it is to access apps and video. While many devices are getting voice features that let you search multiple services at once, youll still need to navigate on-screen menus with a remote. The exception is Chromecast, which has no menu or remote at all. Instead, you start video on an iPhone or Android phone and send it to the big screen with a tap of a cast button. With some video services, the phone is freed up for other things, though youll need to use the phone as a remote for pausing and rewinding. Devices running Googles Android TV come with Chromecast features and pack their menus with video from Googles YouTube service. Amazons Fire TV device has traditionally favored Amazon video over others, though thats changing as Netflix, HBO and other leading services get prominence on the home screen. Roku is the most service-agnostic of the bunch. Apple TV ships with Apple services, but its easy to replace those with your favorites. App selection Roku has one of the most complete app libraries, though Apples iTunes service is notably missing. Youll need an Apple TV to access iTunes. Apple TV also has a good app selection, though out of 25 leading services The Associated Press checked, its missing direct access to Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and PlayStation Vue. You can get the first three indirectly with a Chromecast-like feature called AirPlay if you have a companion iPhone or other Apple device. Amazons Fire TV device is missing iTunes, Google Play, Vudu, ABC, Freeform and the NFL (though some games are shown through Twitters app). The selection on Android TV is also limited, but you can supplement that with apps for Chromecast. With an Android phone, you can get all but iTunes, though getting Amazon video is tough, as it requires getting Amazons Underground app store first. With an iPhone, youre missing iTunes, Amazon and USA Network, even with AirPlay. If you just have a Chromecast device with an iPhone, youre also missing Freeform (formerly ABC Family) and CNN. Youll still need individual subscriptions to these services. The streaming device merely enables playback on the big screen. Entry-level devices Amazons Fire TV Stick stands out as a speedy, capable device for $40. It now comes with a voice remote for searches and Alexa assistant queries on weather, sports scores and other information. The Roku Express is cheaper at $30, though theres no voice remote, and the interface is slower (which doesnt matter as much once you sit back and watch the video). Its a great choice considering its wider app selection, notwithstanding the lack of iTunes. Googles entry-level Chromecast costs $35  affordable, though the gadget is clunky without its own remote. Its slightly better with Android than iPhones. Mid-range devices Xiaomis Mi Box is a speedy Android TV device with a nice price tag, $69. It supports higher-resolution video known as 4K, an option that once required more expensive devices. But you need a 4K TV and services that offer 4K video  so far, Netflix and YouTube do so for just some of their offerings. Mi Box also supports HDR picture quality. HDR, or high dynamic range, promises brighter whites, darker blacks and a richer range of colors  but you need an HDR TV and HDR video. Googles new Chromecast Ultra also has 4K and HDR support for $69. Because Mi Box also does Chromecast, you get more overall for the same price. Mi Box also has a voice remote. The Roku Premiere also offers 4K for $80, but its remote lacks voice support. Amazons regular Fire TV has 4K and a voice remote for $90. Neither has HDR. For now, HDR sets are rarer than 4K, and even 4K sets arent that common. Why pay more? The $100 Roku Premiere Plus and the $130 Roku Ultra offer both 4K and HDR. The remote for both also has a headphone jack for listening when everyone else is asleep. The Ultra also has a voice remote, something many cheaper devices offer. That remote also has gaming buttons and emits a sound when you lose it in a couch. For hard-core gamers, consider the $200 Nvidia Shield TV, an Android TV with both 4K and HDR support, plus faster processors for games with intensive graphics. Another premium choice is Apple TV, which starts at $149. You dont get 4K or HDR, which wont matter for regular sets. Instead, you get plenty of apps that do more than play video. You can browse Ikeas catalog, order food from Grubhub and get the AccuWeather forecasts. For video, an upcoming app simply called TV promises to bring together all your viewing from various channels and services. An iPhone isnt required, but helps. Sorry, no Android. And for iTunes, Apple TV is the only choice.

Seth McNew (TMFMcNew) Nov 19, 2016 at 6:41AM Image source: Fitbit. Wearables companies like Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) with its Apple Watch have long talked about the ability for their devices to play a key role in the healthcare system. Fitness wearable users should be happy to hear that more and more companies and insurers are including wearables as part of an overall health and wellness initiative to keep employees healthy -- often giving perks such as reduced health insurance costs to those that participate.  Wearables could mean lower insurance costs Health insurance can be expensive for companies. Total health benefit costs were nearly $12,000 per employee so far in 2016, according to Mercer. Anything that shows signs of significantly reducing that cost is likely to be welcomed, such as a relatively inexpensive fitness tracker that may reduce health benefit claims.  Image source: Fitbit. That's the goal behind programs like Fitbit's group health initiative that partners with companies to try to get their workforce more active. The company released a report in October in which researchers studied employees for two years and found that those who took part in Fitbit's corporate wellness program had on average $1,300, nearly 25%, less in annual healthcare costs.  Insurers seem to like the sound of that, too, and many are willing to pass some of those savings on to the insured. UnitedHealthcare Group (NYSE:UNH) announced "UnitedHealthcare Motion" in March, a program that provides employees with wearable devices at no charge and makes it possible -- if they meet certain activity and fitness goals such as average daily steps -- to earn up to $1,460 in health reimbursement account (HRA) credits. Aetna (NYSE:AET) is another health insurance provider that is not only working with the companies it services to try to get their employees a subsidized or free tracker, but has also offered to give an Apple Watch at no cost to all of its thousands of employees. Aetna's wellness reimbursement plan will offer employees credits based on activity levels, and it has also announced various new iOS apps to help streamline users' tracking and healthcare management.  Accessorized Fitbit tracker. Image source: Fitbit. Investors should be happy, too For wearables users, the benefits are obvious in that you might save on your health insurance or get reimbursement credits for completing activity goals. Better health and cost savings are a win-win. Investors interested in this space should be happy about this trend, too. As more companies see these benefits in action, they're likely to join, which should contribute to rising wearable sales in the months and years to come. Fitbit, Apple, and others have even accessorized their devices to be more appropriate for professional work environments to make this transition easier.  There are some roadblocks to this being a slam-dunk for wearables companies. A big one is privacy: Not everyone will feel comfortable having their employer seeing so much personal information, and there's also the potential for some employees to feel left out -- particularly those with disabilities or elderly employees, both of which are protected classes under the law. The AARP recently sued the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over similar discount programs in October for what they claimed was a bias against elderly employees. To combat that concern, Fitbit claims that results are based on individuals increasing their own fitness level from wherever they start, not compared to an average or base model. Also, a recent case study highlights one employee with spina bifida who was able to use an upper body fitness machine to get similar activity and tracking results.   There is another large caveat to all of this. Over the last few years, healthcare has been transformed by the Affordable Care Act and other regulations, some of which encouraged more action in getting employees more involved in their own healthcare management. President-elect Trump has signaled throughout his campaign that there will be massive changes to the current healthcare system. Still, healthcare will almost certainly continue to be a large expense for companies under the next administration, so wearables' attractiveness in this market shouldn't change. But, just like with every segment of the market in the coming government transition, investors will be wise to follow what's happening and update their investment plans accordingly.  Seth McNew owns shares of Apple.

In English На русском Հայերեն Full version November 19, 2016 - 15:47 AMT SHARE Apple could move iPhone production to U.S. - sources iPhones might one day soon carry "Made in America" labels. Key Apple assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn Technology Group, has been studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to the U.S., the Nikkei Asian Review cited sources as saying on Friday, November 18. "Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the U.S.," a source said. "Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns." Foxconn, based in the gritty, industrial Tucheng district in suburban Taipei, and its smaller Taiwanese rival churn out more than 200 million iPhones annually from their massive Chinese campuses. Another source said that while Foxconn had been working on the request from Apple Inc., its biggest customer that accounts for more than 50% of its sales, Chairman Terry Gou had been less enthusiastic due to an inevitable rise in production costs. "Making iPhones in the U.S. means the cost will more than double," the source said. The person added that one view among the Apple supply chain in Taiwan is that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump may push the Cupertino, California-based tech titan to make a certain number of iPhone components at home, Nikkei said. According to research company IHS Markit, it costs about $225 for Apple to make an iPhone 7 with a 32GB memory, while the unsubsidized price for such a handset is $649. Apple, Foxconn and Pegatron all declined to comment. SHARE PanARMENIAN.Net © 2000—2016

Now a report claims that Apple may have intentionally throttled the former variant so that it was on-par with the latter. According to Bloomberg, researchers at Twin Prime and Cellular Insights evaluated the Qualcomm-powered Verizon and Intel-carrying AT&T versions of the iPhone 7. The firms found that the two were mostly equal in terms of speed even though the former is technically able to download data faster. This leads us to the theory of the hour, which is that Apple isn’t taking full advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities. The X12 Qualcomm modem found inside the carrier’s iPhone 7 model is capable of pushing up to 600Mbps, while the AT&T Intel one boasts of a lower 450Mbps. Also See: iPhone 7 severely burns pregnant woman’s arm If the throttling allegations prove true, it would be a highly unusual step for Apple to take since companies usually aim to have the fastest phones. Analysts think the brand may have done this so that everyone has a uniform iPhone 7 experience. This conclusion is backed by insider sources who told Recode that Apple wanted the cost savings and flexibility of having multiple suppliers for its chips, while also wanting the two models to be as similar as possible. The latter may have been done to avoid making AT&T and T-Mobile angry. This makes sense, since it would be unfair for Verizon customers to have better speeds. However, the apparent throttling may still make many consumers angry given that their iPhone 7 is possibly not living up to its full potential. To make matters worse, Twin Prime pitted the iPhone 7 against the Samsung Galaxy S7 and found that the second was two times faster than the first. Both were utilizing Qualcomm’s X12 modem and run on Verizon’s network.

Apple wants to put Siri in your messages Written by Ananya Bhattacharya November 19, 2016 Better late than never. (Reuters/Robert Galbraith) Share Written by Ananya Bhattacharya November 19, 2016 You may someday have another participant in your group messaging chats: Siri. An Apple patent application published Nov. 17 describes how Siri could be pulled into iMessage chats to help with scheduling and making payments. Any of the participants in a conversation can choose to bring in Siri to assist people with tasks, the filing with the US Patent and Trademark Office says. When summoned to a message thread, the AI assistant uses semantic analysis to decipher which messages are meant for it. Once users direct a message toward Siri, it will be able to carry out tasks like checking people’s availability on their respective calendars or estimate how far people are from each other by using their locations. In one instance, a user asks, “Siri, when are we all free to grab lunch?” and Siri responds by scouring their calendars for matching availabilities and presenting a poll of possible times. Siri iMessage integration patent. (USPTO) With iOS 10, Apple announced Siri would support a myriad of third-party apps, including payment apps like Venmo, Paypal and Square Cash. In renderings included with the application, the outlined technology appears to allow for peer-to-peer payments from within the conversation. In an example, a participant says, “Siri, can you send Brett 10 bucks?” The assistant then pulls up a range of payment apps to choose from, and asks for fingerprint authorization before making the transfer. At any given time, participants can choose to deny Siri access to their personal information. Apple’s latest patent filing echoes functions already available in Google Assistant, which makes similar in-conversation contributions within Google’s text chat-only app Allo. Google Assistant’s functionality is more extensive than what’s described in the Apple patent, which only gives examples of scheduling and payments. Google Assistant can scour for addresses, movie showtimes, restaurants, flights, and hotels from within the app, as well as report on news, weather, traffic, sports, and more. That said, it’s worth noting that Apple filed for this patent in April 2015, well before Google’s Assistant made its debut last month. And the trend toward using machine learning to help virtual assistants better serve users is on the upswing across the board: consider Amazon’s Alexa, Facebook Messenger bots, and Samsung’s acquisition of a Siri-like assistant called Viv. Apple’s concept is still just a patent application, which is not an indication that the technology will be deployed—now or ever. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Touchscreens on smartphones that have this problem gradually become unresponsive. The fault was highlighted by gadget sites which said it was caused by a manufacturing issue that meant some screen controller chips became loose. Apple was criticised by one expert who said it was the phonemaker’s responsibility to fix it. Apple is charging $149 in the USA for the service that will only be available on phones that are “in working order”. Loose chips In a statement on its website, Apple said it had “determined” that displays on some iPhone 6 Plus handsets flickered or became unresponsive if the device was dropped several times on a hard surface and was then subjected to “further stress”. An iPhone 6 Plus suffering this problem, which worked and did not have a cracked or broken screen, was eligible for the repair programme, it said. The service is available worldwide and costs £146.44 in the UK. Apple said that customers who had already paid to get their phone cured of “touch disease” should get in touch to be repaid for the amount they spent beyond the programme fee. The repair programme will run for five years beyond the initial date on which the iPhone 6 Plus went on sale, said Apple. Stuart Miles, founder of gadget news site Pocket-lint, said: “I think if it’s a known defect that isn’t caused by the user then it should be the responsibility of Apple to fix the phone free of charge regardless of the age.” The manufacturing problem with the iPhone 6 Plus was first highlighted by gadget site iFixit which said it had seen an “influx of faulty iPhones”. In a blogpost about the problem posted in August, iFixit said there were “pages and pages” of messages from aggrieved iPhone 6 Plus owners on the Apple support site complaining about the fault. An investigation by iFixit and specialist repair shops found the cause of the fault was the placement of the touchscreen controller chip. Several rough knocks could dislodge this chip making phones unresponsive, it said. – Source: BBC Delali Adogla-Bessa More on citifmonline.com Facebook considering ways to combat fake news – Mark Zuckerberg November 19, 2016 Volkswagen to cut 30,000 jobs in huge post-dieselgate revamp November 18, 2016 SpaceX aims to launch internet from space November 18, 2016 Twitter suspends alt-right figureheads November 17, 2016 Snapchat ‘files for stock market float’ November 16, 2016 WhatsApp finally launches video calling November 15, 2016 General News GSE lobbies for patronage of the Ghana Fixed Income Market November 20, 2016 NDC deserves another term – Amissah-Arthur November 20, 2016 Create jobs; any gov’t can construct flyover – Alan November 20, 2016 Ketu South: Ghanaians in Togo welcome Nana Addo with protests November 20, 2016 53% of students unable to complete secondary education – Report November 20, 2016 Advertisement Recent Posts GSE lobbies for patronage of the Ghana Fixed Income Market NDC deserves another term – Amissah-Arthur Create jobs; any gov’t can construct flyover – Alan ECG recovers GHc 450,000 from illegal connections in Eastern Region Nana Addo not hospitalized; he’s campaigning vigorously- Hamid Ketu South: Ghanaians in Togo welcome Nana Addo with protests Murray v Djokovic: Top two fight to be number one at ATP Finals finale India train crash: Scores killed in derailment near Kanpur 53% of students unable to complete secondary education – Report Takoradi Technical university launches 5-year strategic plan Find us on Facebook © Copyright 2016 | citifmonline.com | All Rights Reserved.

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software Apple Working on Digital Glasses with AR Prowess November 19, 2016, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts iOS 10.2: Top Anticipated Features Facebook Revving up Public Chatrooms via Messenger App Augmented Reality is still a blooming field relatively. But many companies have already set its eyes on this lucrative domain. And now, Apple has got its name registered as one among them. The word now is that the Cupertino Company has set its eye for an expansion on to augmented reality, and its initial venture will be something similar to what Google have previously experimented with. The company is reportedly working on a digital glass that will be incorporated with augmented reality capabilities. By picture, Apple’s glasses stays close to Google Glasses, working on a modus operandi that will have data collected through the glass and synced with the iPhone devices. The augmented reality data processed will be then overlaid onto the glass screen, either through a projector or by some other means. That means it’s never as complicated like the other ambitious AR headsets the rivals are working upon at present. Apple’s new AR glasses won’t be coming out before 2018 to the least, and this should give some breathing space for the company to experiment more; something which Google failed to materialize with Google Glasses. The longer dateline also raises the possibility of the project being scrapped, given that Apple is already nourishing its interest in the automobile field. But previous words from Apple CEO Tim Cook had already exposed the interests of the company in working with AR. Tim Cook is also someone who believes more in the potential of AR than that of virtual reality. However, recent reports have suggested that Apple is still continuing the hiring process of AR as well as VR experts, which could suggest that Apple might just blend some VR technologies in its due course.

For the past few months, reports have covered the ‘touch disease‘ that renders Apple’s iPhone 6 and 6 Plus nonfunctional. Investigation into the problem revealed that Apple removed the underfill from the controller chips that govern touchscreen functionality. The underfill typically fills the gaps between solder balls that attach a chip to its motherboard and prevents the solder from cracking under normal wear and tear. Removing the underfill means that the solder itself is responsible for holding up under flexion — and when the chips start failing as a result, touch screens stop working. Up until this point, Apple has steadfastly refused to acknowledge the problem, even as independent analysis showed it was easily the largest issue causing device failures. Now, Apple has announced that it will offer a $149 repair option, but only for the iPhone 6 Plus. The company has published a webpage to alert customers to the issue, but continues to pretend the flaw is entirely its own users’ fault. Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device. If your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple will repair your device for a service price of $149. Apple will contact customers who may have paid for a service repair related to this issue either through Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider to arrange reimbursement. If you have not been contacted but paid for a repair that you believe was related to this issue, please contact Apple. The reimbursement amount will equal the difference between the price you paid for the original service to your iPhone 6 Plus and the $149 service price. While we’re glad to see Apple formally offering repair and refunding the difference consumers may have already spent on the issue, it affects both the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and not just the 6 Plus. It’s been known to occur even to devices that are kept in hard cases, and it isn’t the result of consumers mistreating their hardware. If Apple had used underfill or a metal plate to strengthen the phone, this issue wouldn’t happen — and given that Apple added such a plate in the iPhone 6s Plus, moved the touch ICs off the logic board, and went back to using underfill, it’s clear the company was fully aware that the original device had issues and simply chose not to address them. Ultimately, we’d prefer this program be free — similar repair programs in previous years have been. Apple really screwed this up.         LATEST STORIES (45) Holy Karbala: World Shiite Muslims Commemorate Arbaeen Iran Extends Condolences to New Delhi on Death of Nearly 100 Indians Iran, Morocco Keen to Bolster Mutual Cooperation Civilians Risk Their Lives to Flee Terrorist-Controlled Areas in Eastern Aleppo Iran, Japan Ink MoU on Inspectorate Cooperation German Company Mulls Investment in Iran's Projects Terrorists Agree to Hand over West Ghouta Stronghold to Syrian Army 7 Schoolchildren Killed in Militant Shelling of Government-Held West Aleppo Syrian Soldiers Engage in Tough Clashes with ISIL Invaders in Deir Ezzur Slovenian President Due in Tehran on Tuesday ISIL Fails to Prevail Over Gov't Forces' Positions East of Syria's Homs Iran, Armenia Opt for Boosting Economic Ties Syria: Hundreds of Army Soldiers Arrive in Eastern Part of Aleppo City Syrian Army, Air Force Hold Massive Military Operations in Lattakia, Hama Provinces Nusra Centers across Dara'a Province Receive Sever Blow in Syrian Army Attacks Holy Karbala: World Shiite Muslims Commemorate Arbaeen TEHRAN (FNA)- Millions of Shiite Muslim Pilgrims from across the world, including Iran, congregated in Iraq's Western city of Karbala to mourn the 40th day after the martyrdom of Shiite Islam's third Imam and his 72 companions over 13 centuries ago.

Photo / File A setting on Apple smartphones has users alarmed their personal mobile data is being used when they're supposed to be connected to a Wi-Fi network. The feature added in iOS 9 and later updates of the Apple operating system includes a feature called 'Wi-fi Assist'. The setting, which has been available since September 2015, is intended to make users stay connected to the Internet even through a poor Wi-Fi connection by using their cellular data. The setting is automatically enabled when updating software to iOS 9 and later versions, and if left activated an iPhone will use mobile data whenever a Wi-Fi signal is weak - catching unaware consumers out world-wide. West Auckland woman Kelly Burns told the Herald "I realised my data usage was higher than normal after I bought a new iPhone 7 which had the latest iOS and I kept having to top up with extra data packs. "I wasn't aware of the iPhone 'Wi-fi Assist' setting until I called my provider 2degrees to ask why I was suddenly using so much data." After turning the function off, Burns' data usage returned to her normal rate. The Avondale resident said "I don't think the Wi-Fi Assist setting should be on by default, I understand the premise behind it is to ensure optimal service however since having the setting off there has been no noticeable degradation to the speed of my connection." She says the first month before she realised the setting was on she probably spent an extra $80 on four data packs. Continued below.

Craig Young from TUANZ (Telecommunications Users Association of New Zealand) told the Herald "It's an example where the maker of the phone has made a decision that isn't overly user friendly. "It's okay in countries where you might be able to get unlimited data to your mobile device and it doesn't matter how much data you're chewing through but particularly users in New Zealand who might be on prepay or on smaller plans and are carefully managing data may find it's actually being sucked up." He said his advice is that users should be looking at that and turning the setting off. The Herald spoke with representatives of ISP's (Internet Service Providers) to find out how the software update has impacted customers. A representative from Vodafone said the telecommunications provider was first made aware of the 'Wi-fi Assist' feature in September last year. She said "At the time we alerted customers through our online forums and social media and we responded to several media enquiries. This affected iPhone users globally. As part of our response, we pointed customers to a page on our website which offers a step by step guide to switching the feature off. Our customer care teams are aware of the feature and proactively support our customers to switch it off." A Spark representative told the Herald they don't have any control over third party apps or operating systems, many of which use data. He said "We want to encourage people to use the tools that can protect them from accidental over data use or a feature or an app consuming more data than they were expecting." He urged any Spark users suffering from data usage issues to get in touch. 2degrees spokeswoman Lenska Papich said "If contacted by customers about data use we work through a range of possibilities with them, one of which for iOS 9 users is to turn off the Wi-Fi assist option." Apple responded to the Herald's enquiries to find more information through their support page, which can be found here.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 18, 2016 at 7:07PM For about a decade, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has used processors designed and manufactured by microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in its iMac desktop and MacBook laptop computer families.  Apple iMac and MacBook computers. Image source: author.  However, as Apple's chip design prowess has grown, primarily to support its non-Mac products such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, speculation has run rampant that Apple would eventually build processors to replace Intel's in the Mac.  Were that to happen, Intel's personal computer processor business would be negatively impacted, but Intel's business would be able to weather it (sales to Apple comprised less than 10% of Intel's total revenue in 2015).  It still hasn't happened, though.   Nevertheless, a new report from investment company Exane BNP Paribas (via The Street) suggests that Apple might be hiring engineers to build chips that will finally allow Apple to boot Intel out of the Mac. Let's take a closer look at what the analysts had to say.  Apple is hiring graphics engineers? You don't say! The analysts reportedly point out that Apple's looking to fill 87 hardware engineering positions related to graphics processing technology. Based on this, the analysts said that "the graphics job vacancies suggest that Apple is building a completely new chip design team, which in our experience points to a new application." The analysts further went on to say that "the need for computing, CPU and/or GPU skills could point to a custom Apple chip for the Apple MacBook." "It is entirely plausible that Apple could produce a beefed up 7 [nanometer] apps processor... capable of powering a MacBook in 2018," the analysts concluded. I'm not buying it. What else requires CPU and/or GPU technology? Inside of every Apple iPhone and iPad is an Apple-designed applications processor. These chips integrate a whole host of technologies, including CPUs, graphics processors, image processing units, memory controllers, and more. Microprocessor expert David Kanter recently revealed in an article published on website Real World Technologies that Apple has been using custom-designed graphics processors in its iPhone and iPad chips since the A8/A8X chips. Previous Apple chips incorporated graphics processor designs licensed from graphics specialist Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF). It is far more likely that the job listings indicate that Apple is trying to bolster the graphics processor teams that build technologies for Apple's iPhone and iPad devices rather than for its Mac products.  So, about the Intel thing... Only Apple knows if its long-term plan is to replace Intel's processors with its own chips.  That said, a transition away from Intel processors and toward Apple-designed ARM processors across Apple's Mac lineup is unlikely to happen in the near-future, if it's going to happen at all.  Indeed, all of the software that runs on the Mac -- both first-party and third-party -- would need to be reworked in order to properly function on ARM processors, as it is all designed around Intel's technology. Yes, Apple has done such architecture transitions on the Mac before, but the last time that the company did one (moving from PowerPC to Intel), Apple gave developers ample notice so that they could get their software ready (the PowerPC to Intel transition was announced at World Wide Developers Conference 2005; the first Intel-based Macs didn't ship until WWDC 2006).   To my knowledge, Apple hasn't given developers such a heads-up about a transition of the Mac from Intel to ARM.  Nevertheless, the point here isn't whether or not Apple is ultimately planning to kick Intel out of the Mac; the point is that the fact that Apple is hiring experts to work on graphics processor technology is hardly evidence that Apple is planning to replace Intel in the Mac.

Trump jumped at the chance, claiming in a tweet that he had “worked hard” with Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. to keep the plant in Kentucky, even though Ford had never considered moving the whole factory south of the border. In letting Trump claim a victory, Ford made what appeared to be a calculated, public appeal to the next president in an attempt to soothe concerns about outsourcing jobs and to gain some leverage with the new administration as the automaker pushes for favorable policy changes in Congress. “Ford is not going to make a decision on a purely political basis,” said Kristin Dziczek, director of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan. “They are going to make a decision that makes business sense, economic sense and if it happens to align with political goals, that’s great,” she said. The No. 2 automaker in the United States is not the only company in Trump’s crosshairs working out how to deal with the new political reality in Washington. Apple Inc, criticised by Trump for not building products in the United States, is studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to the United States, Japanese news service Nikkei reported on Thursday. Apple did not reply to a request for comment yesterday. Trump campaigned heavily on bringing jobs to the United States and attacking companies such as Ford that plan to take some production overseas, a message that resonated in the economically ravaged center of the country. Ford gave Trump plenty of ammunition, confirming in September that all of its remaining small-car production in the United States, at its facility in Wayne, Michigan, would go to lower-cost Mexico by 2019. Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said no plants would be closed as a result, and no US jobs would be lost as capacity at the Wayne plant would be taken up by two new models. The Mexico plans remain in place, despite the fact that Trump vowed on the campaign trail to stop Ford opening a new plant in that country and promised to slap 35 per cent tariffs on any Ford vehicles made there. Ford went further this month, announcing on Election Day a new US$195 million (RM861 million) investment in India to add 3,000 jobs over the next five years in a technology and business center in Chennai. Ford said this week it would import its Ford EcoSport built in India to the United States. Trump has not made any public comment on that plan. On Thursday, Ford said it had been reviewing where to build the Lincoln MKC, just one vehicle built at the Louisville assembly plant, but had decided to keep it in Kentucky. As such, nothing changed, but letting Trump announce the decision gave him the opportunity to claim he saved US jobs and cast Ford as a patriotic manufacturer. “Both sides will claim a certain level of victory because nobody wants a significant negative impact on the industry,” said Dave Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research. It was unclear how many, if any, jobs were actually saved by the decision. Ford decided last year to move MKC production by 2019, on the assumption that production of the Ford Escape, a similar vehicle made in the same plant, would grow. But recently Escape demand has slumped, which may have prompted Ford to reconsider. According to Cole, Ford’s olive branch to Trump was a clear indication that it needs help from the next administration as it faces a host of issues from fuel economy standards and the rise of autonomous vehicles to trade and currency. Cole said Trump, who boasts about his dealmaking skills, may choose to focus on bargaining with companies he has targeted - even if only for small concessions - rather than pursue more punitive measures such as tariffs, which would take time to implement and potentially damage the economy. Ford nodded to those wider issues in a statement yesterday, saying it was encouraged that Trump’s economic policies “will help improve US competitiveness.” Ford, like other global US corporations, agrees with key aspects of Trump’s economic plans. It has called for US tax reform and raised concerns about the costs of federal regulations. Ford also shares Trump’s concerns about currency manipulation. — Reuters                 MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Five ways Indians are dodging ‘black money’ crackdown Asia to narrow trade focus as protectionism rises, say analysts Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Palm oil celebrates centennial, output doubles every 10 years TPP, RCEP, FTAAP: A user’s guide to alphabet soup of trade deals Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Tensions’ likely under President-elect Trump, Obama says Reuters Video: Trump says ‘you will hear some things tomorrow’ MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Related Articles Trump set to announce new cabinet picks (VIDEO) Ibrahim Ali: If Trump can be president, I can be PM Turning other cheek, Mexican president vows Trump talks Turns out, everything is negotiable ― Paula Dwyer Dancing in a hurricane ― Thomas L.

Stick It In (or On) Your Ear View All Editorials → Apple Launches Multi-Touch Repair Program for iPhone 6 Plus Bryan Chaffin @TMOBryan · +Bryan Chaffin Nov 18th, 2016 11:00 AM EST | Product News Apple has launched a repair program for iPhone 6 Plus devices that suffer a flickering display or Multi-Touch issues. The program’s description specifies devices that experience these troubles “after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.” “If your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple will repair your device for a service price of $149,” Apple said. In other words, Apple is still charging, but it’s likely to be less than it would have otherwise have been. Furthermore, the company said it would reach out to customers who may have already paid more through Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider “to arrange reimbursement.” That refers to the difference between what they paid and the new program’s price tag. Where to Start There are three ways to take advantage of the program: Apple Authorized Service Provider Apple Retail Store Apple Technical Support Note that the last two links are the same starting point. Long Standing Issue There have long been complaints about this issue, but this is the first time Apple has publicly acknowledged it. The specific wording for the program should be noted, as the company is clearly trying to maintain a tight grip over what is covered. Nonetheless, it’s always good for device owners when Apple opens up a repair program.

Stick It In (or On) Your Ear View All Editorials → Apple Has the Experience to Make an AR Bombshell Come True John Martellaro @jmartellaro Nov 18th, 2016 5:20 PM EST | Particle Debris Augmented reality (AR) is coming. Combine it with AI … and … wow! Mark Gurman and his colleagues at Bloomberg have written that Apple is exploring another wearables project: digital glasses. “Apple Considers Wearables Expansion With Digital Glasses.” According to people familiar with the matter: While still in an exploration phase, the device would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer’s field of vision, and may use augmented reality (AR)…. But wait. Don’t laugh yet. I’ve long believed that this is our technical future. That is, a sophisticated optical device that displays all the information we need on our visual field. (Think about combining that with a really smart AI agent!) Just how that’s implemented is the key, and it will surely evolve. Google Glass was version 0.10. Right now, according to Gurman, Apple is in the testing phase. Apple has talked about its glasses project with potential suppliers, according to people familiar with those discussions. The company has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing, the people said. Apple hasn’t ordered enough components so far to indicate imminent mass-production, one of the people added. Of course, as Google found out, there are lots of technical and social issues to work out. Perhaps, Apple with hindsight, tremendous R&D funding and vast UX/UI experience can get us all the way there, as it did with the Apple Watch. The days of walking around, dodging busses, staring at a little black brick will be over in a few years. Next page: The news debris for the week of Nov 14th.

Your choice Apple That is true of so much in the Apple universe right now. They keep saying there’s great stuff on the way. Rumours are out there of really cool stuff that will revolutionize things. But they never seem to arrive. Macs are stagnant, the SmartWatch fad has peaked, Tablets are essentially unchanged, and Phones are commodity items. Yes they are making money but they’re stagnant. You know what Apple reminds me of? GM in the early 1970s. Making lots of money making more or less the same thing they did ten years before. Then they were blindsided by small cars from Japan that were less expensive, more reliable, and more efficient. Apple is cranking out the same devices they have for a long time albeit with Incremental improvements. Somebody is going to come in with a revolutionary thing and Apple will be caught flat footed. The Surface Pro from Microsoft is close. I just hope it was enough of a slap across the face to wake Apple up. To get them innovating again. Because someone will ‘think different’ and roll out a product that will make the new MacBook Pro look like a ’73 Chevette. Something as revolutionary as the first Macintosh was to the DOS world. November 18, 2016 at 6:53 EST PM CudaBoy November 18, 2016 What geo said. I would add that the ol’ paradigm of Apple taking other’s pre-existing technology (swipe to unlock; NFC; stylus’, smartwatch etc) and sprinkling fairy dust on it just won’t fly any more. The AI assistance field (echo etc) seemed like Apple worthy; VR seemed Apple worthy, I just wonder. So, this glass will be the latest thing Apple poo-poo’d like NFC and stylus’ a few years ago only to backpedal and copy. Great. Steve’s rolling in his ‘pod’. Please, Apple – BUY Tesla and install Elon as CEO ASAP!!! I want a 35 lb carbon EV Apple Bike powered by Tesla !! And, Apple NEEDS Elon’s vision. GM, I mean Apple is getting a bit stale.

Sometimes when I pick up my iPad (Air 2) a finger or thump barely grazes the edge of the screen and unwanted things happen, like interrupting the stream I am listening to. When iPads magically follow us around, then maybe edge to edge screens will be useful. Till then, not so much. November 19, 2016 at 12:12 EST AM Lee Dronick November 19, 2016 I agree Buck. We would end up putting a wider case on the iPad. November 19, 2016 at 8:22 EST AM Jamie November 19, 2016 Hmm . . . I have no doubt Apple could makes something neat with AR, but the question remains whether or not people actually want it. I think a big part of the issue with tech in general is this insistence on developing things for a future that has yet to arrive. Until something like this is as easy and functional as a ‘J.A.R.V.I.S.’, it’s just too much hassle. Is Silicon Valley insularity to blame? I can’t say for certain, but it sure seems to be. Wearing glasses isn’t much different than wearing a watch – if one isn’t inclined to do so, they most likely aren’t going to start. I can’t help but notice that in the current Samsung commercials that feature VR, it is mainly children using their goggles for play being depicted, and I think play and perhaps specialized scenarios where simulation would actually be useful is probably where that technology (which I think is cool, BTW) will likely end up when all is said and done. It’s just too cumbersome/annoying/inefficient – I don’t need to interact with a simulation of my mundane life-tasks, it’s so much easier just to do them, and I don’t want to have to unnecessarily accessorize to accomplish them. Some aspects of human existence just ain’t broke. November 19, 2016 at 2:00 EST PM Lee Dronick November 19, 2016 This afternoon at the Apple Store, well Apple, I had a chance to mess around with a MacBook Pro and Touch Bar. I think that I will opt for the model with the Touch Bar, it is very nice and will come in handy. Only 30 lbs more to go on my weight loss program, the new MacBook Pro is my incentive.

The new coffee table book definitely deserved this kind of parody. I think the problem with the Apple book is not necessary the book itself, but the timing of the book’s release. Overall, it does seem like a nice art book. However, considering how many products Apple is currently neglecting, both hardware and software, it makes this book seem like a giant ego trip. Had Apple released this book back when the new Mac Pro was actually still new, and the 5K iMacs just came out, the book would have probably been well received. Releasing this kind of book now is kind of like Marie Antoinette saying to starving people (allegedly) “let them eat cake”, when all they wanted was bread. For us Mac enthusiasts, bread is updated Mac hardware and software. It doesn’t have to be a complete redesign every time or even every other time, just updated specs.

Steve Symington (TMFSymington) Nov 18, 2016 at 11:24PM I've long anticipated that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would completely transition its products from LCD to OLED displays. The process has already started with the Apple Watch and should continue with Apple's wildly popular iPhone line. And according to astute supply chain watchers, it's increasingly likely that the process will happen on iPhones sooner than expected. Apple's latest iPhone 7 lineup, IMAGE SOURCE: APPLE, INC. Perspective is in order Around this time last year, multiple industry sources had already suggested that Apple was set to migrate its entire iPhone lineup from LCD to OLED. But given its massive unit shipment requirements, it was clear that sufficient manufacturing volume for the high-tech OLED displays wouldn't be available for all models until at least 2018. In a recent note to clients, however, Barclays analysts Blayne Curtis and Chris Hemmelgarn cited supply-chain sources as stating that -- with the caveat that its designs aren't finalized -- Apple is set to reveal three new iPhones in 2017 for the iconic smartphone's 10-year anniversary. While the two smaller iPhones will probably stick to LCDs because of the aforementioned supply constraints, the largest Plus model will boast a 5.8-inch OLED display, allowing Apple to bend the display at its edges to create a curved, bezel-free design. Of course, a curved-edge iPhone isn't entirely surprising, considering Samsung has already revealed a similar feature with the OLED displays on its Galaxy Edge-series smartphones. Incidentally, Barclays also stated that the majority of these early iPhone OLED display panels will be provided by Samsung Display and LG Display, which together represent the two largest clients of another one of my personal favorite investments, OLED technologist Universal Display Corporation (NASDAQ:OLED). This also corroborates reports detailing that such a supply agreement was struck between Samsung Display and Apple earlier this year. For what it's worth, however, this isn't the first report suggesting that Apple will start with a single OLED iPhone next year. A few months ago, Universal Display shares hit an all-time high, after electronics equipment maker Applied Materials revealed a surprisingly strong quarter in which it received an incredible $700 million in display orders. Applied Materials later confirmed that the "vast majority" of those orders consisted of mobile OLED display equipment, while Bloomberg subsequently reported that the new OLED displays were set to make their way into Apple's lineup in 2017. In any case, to have that assertion echoed by Barclays' comments this month serves as badly needed affirmation for skeptical investors. Here's how to invest All things considered, I'll reiterate my assertion that buying shares of Universal Display is the single best way to take advantage of Apple's transition to OLED. For one thing, the reported Apple/Samsung supply agreement was rumored to last at least three years, indicating that Apple is invested in Universal Display's flagship OLED technology for the long haul. What's more, during Universal Display's most recent quarterly conference call earlier this month, CFO Sidney Rosenblatt made it clear that the company is preparing for accelerated growth next year by "building our infrastructure to meet the growing needs of our expanding customer base." Sure enough, Universal Display shares shot higher just last week on reports that iPhone display supplier Japan Display is in talks to receive financing to shift its own manufacturing lines from LCD to OLED. That's not to mention the prospect for Universal Display's OLED technology to continue to proliferate not only in smartphones, but also in tablets, televisions, and (over the longer term) differentiated lighting applications. For investors who buy now before the immense scale of Universal Display's growth story becomes evident, I think the stock's recent gains will prove a drop in the bucket compared with its long-term potential.

Apple on November 17 acknowledged the iPhone 6 Plus flaw, known as ‘touch diseases’. In return, the company has started offering a repair program to the customers to fix the flaw. “Apple has determined that some iPhones 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Mutli-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on device,” Apple wrote on its website. The flaw was acknowledged by engineers back in August 2016. A repair and teardown website iFixit, reported many iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus owners are continuously facing the touchscreen issue, claiming the handsets had stopped registering touch. The engineers termed the iPhone models touchscreen flaw as ‘touch disease.’ They highlighted the flaw was caused because of tow chipset touchscreen controller chips, or Touch IC, integrated in iPhone 6 models. However, in a statement Apple said the flaw will occur in case the handset will be ‘dropped multiple times on a hard surface.’ The repair program is available worldwide and will cover affected iPhone 6 Plus devices for five years after first retail of the unit, Apple wrote. The company is charging $149 for the service. However, pricing offered by Apple Authorised Service providers may vary. To seek more information on the program click here.

Reuters/Jason Reed If latest reports are to be believed, Apple will be releasing the iOS 10.2 in December 2016. This means, Chinese jailbreaking group Pangu could also be releasing the iOS 10 jailbreak in December. Tech experts stated that the iOS 10.2 is already in the beta testing phase and once released, it will come with a whole set of bug fixes and new features. Once Apple users have installed the update, Pangu could be releasing the iOS 10 jailbreak. Pangu has earlier claimed that it has already jailbroken Apple’s latest operating system but is simply waiting for the Cupertino-based company to release their update first, writes NEUROGADGET. There is another set of fans who believe that this time, even Pangu hasn’t succeeded in jailbreaking the Apple iOS 10, as the tech giant has claimed that the iOS 10 is the most secure system ever built by Apple. Whatever may be the reason, Pangu has been absolutely silent on the matter and is simply waiting for the latest update to be released. It does not want any information to get leaked as Apple will then quickly patch the glitches. Pangu reportedly does not want Apple to have the slightest clue as to how it has jailbroken the iOS 10 operating system, writes Mobile & Apps. However, it is known that most jailbreaking groups have failed in cracking open the system and even Pangu had a tough time. Moreover, there are no reports confirming whether Pangu has actually jailbroken Apple iOS 10. If at all, Pangu succeeds in releasing a jailbreak, Apple won’t be happy about it as it seems confident that its operating system cannot be jailbroken. Many believe that Apple’s regular updates on its operating system are the primary reason for the delay. Fans are still waiting for the iOS 10.0.1 jailbreak tool. Meanwhile, known hacker Luca Todesco has claimed that he has a jailbreak ready but hasn’t released anything as of now. Submit Correction 0 0 0 Related Apple iOS 10 jailbreak impossible?

Globally, smartphone sales increased by 5.4% year-on-year, with 373.2-million devices sold. Leading this charge was Huawei, Oppo and BBK (the company that owns the likes of Oppo, OnePlus and Vivo). The three manufacturers claimed 21% of the global smartphone sales market in Q3 2016, compared to Samsung‘s 23.6% and Apple‘s 13%. Samsung had its worst smartphone sales quarters ever, thanks in part to the Note 7 Notably though, most of these smartphone sales from Oppo and BBK were in China. The fall of the old guard? Samsung and Apple had less successful quarters. Notable was Samsung’s terrible performance, thanks in part to the Galaxy Note 7 debacle. “Samsung’s smartphone sales in the third quarter of 2016 as a whole declined 14.2 per cent year over year — their worst performance ever,” Gartner notes. Apple also had a torrid quarter. The company’s global smartphones sales accounted for just 11.5% — it’s lowest total since 2009. “Apple’s sales fell by 8.5 per cent in the US and by 31 per cent in China, two of its biggest markets. The iPhone 7 struggled to stimulate replacement sales,” Gartner concludes. Author Bio Camper by day, run-and-gunner by night, Andy prefers his toast like his coffee -- dark and crunchy.

The team has introduced yet another full teardown of Apple’s current Cadillac model of MacBooks, It’s a pleasure to take a look at this new tech reduced to its most base of components, and even a little cathartic to think they dove right into a brand new expensive little bugger like this so see what makes it tick. Credit: iFixit For starters, the MacBook Pro 15″ has over a million pixels more than the previous 13″ models the site has torn down, along with a 15.4″ LED-backlit Retina display with 2880 × 1800 resolution and 2.6 GHz Skylake quad-core Intel Core i7. In short, this is a powerhouse of a MacBook with plenty of reasons for you to pick it up if you’re interested in jumping on the bandwagon. The size, in comparison to the 13″ MacBook Pro, at least as far as thickness goes, is nearly identical. Inside it seems as though it’s like a “scaled up’ version of the smaller version with tiny differences in the way the batteries are laid out inside. The enormous touchpad requires an additional touch controller, but nothing too special there. Once again, the Touch Bar is difficult to replace, you could damage the screen if you delve into the MacBook without knowing much about what you’re doing. Since the Touch ID sensor also doubles as the power switch and is paired with the T1 chip on the logic board, you basically need Apple’s assistance to repair. This isn’t something you’ll want to jump into to fix yourself. Take it from us. In short, the upgraded MacBook Pro packs the extra battery power, screen size and more but it also contains several components that are equally difficult for layman tech enthusiasts to replace. If you opt for picking one up and you run into problems, you’re going to be better served taking it in for repairs and letting Apple handle it.

But it turns out that’s a feature built into iOS and macOS for the user’s “convenience.” So there’s no point freaking out about it. That said, Apple could certainly have done a better job informing the user what happens with call data. DON’T MISS: All the best pre-Black Friday deals you can buy right now at Walmart, Best Buy and Amazon If you’ve got iCloud enabled on your Apple devices, and most people do, then Apple will record data from all your calls, whether it’s a regular phone call or VoIP-based calls including FaceTime, Skype, WhatsApp, Viber and others. Everything gets synced to the cloud, complete with phone numbers, call dates and times, and call duration. The reasoning here is pretty simple. Apple wants you to be able to access those calls and return missed calls from any of your devices. This is possible through Apple’s Continuity feature. The actual contents of a call aren’t saved in iCloud. After all, Apple doesn’t listen in on your conversations. However, the worry with some people is that the data stored in iCloud can be decrypted by Apple, and can be shared with law enforcement if a warrant requires Apple to do so. Hackers might also access call history, and Elcomsoft updated its Phone Breaker software to extract call records from iCloud using only an authentication token for an account from a computer belonging to the account holder. To make those call records disappear, you have to delete them from a device. Otherwise, they’ll remain in iCloud for up to four months. FaceTime call invitations can be stored for up to 30 days. “We offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices,” an Apple spokesperson said about the matter. “Device data is encrypted with a user’s passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user’s Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication.” MacRumors notes that while Apple may not explain exactly what happens in the background, it does state that it collects call history for iCloud backups in a 63-page white paper about iOS security.

Whether you like it or hate it, it is clear Apple takes its design very, very seriously or just thinks people are idiots and will buy anything with an Apple logo. Going back to the Apple II and 1984 Mac launches, Apple has boasted about design which it meticulously tries to keep as humane as possible. No wonder, the company’s latest product is a $300 book, containing 450 photos of iconic Apple products from the 1998 iMac to the 2015 Apple Pencil, covering the peak years of Jobs and Ive’s partnership. Bet you won’t be see that from Samsung often. Aptly titled “Designed by Apple in California”, the book features the best of Apple’s industrial designs, which doesn’t only include Cupertino’s successful products, but others as well. Photography is done by Andrew Zuckerman, with images laid out in a “deliberately spare style”. In typical Apple fashion, the book will be arriving in two variants: a 10.2 x 12.75” version costing $199, and a 13 x 16.25” version costing $300. It will be printed in “specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink”. “Designed by Apple in California” is dedicated to the memory of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who was the mastermind behind so many of Apple’s greatest releases. It will be published by Apple itself and goes on sale starting today. Like much of Apple’s offerings, the book expects value in return but for the huge Apple fan (read obsessed Apple fan), this could be the best coffee-table book there will ever be. 88Shares FacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsappLinkedinPrint Primary Sidebar ProPakistani Viral Stories Pakistan’s Telecom Industry is in Deep Trouble [Part 2] This CCTV Documentary on CPEC is a Must Watch!

We now know that Super Mario Run will arrive on December 15th and that it will be, as promised, a "free-to-start" game (you'll be able to download it and start playing for free) but will not proceed along a free-to-play model. Instead, at some point in the game it'll ask you for a single $9.99 in-app purchase to unlock its full functionality. The devil is in the details, of course, and it remains to be seen how much Nintendo has been paying attention to the reasons why F2P dominates mobile in the first place. How exactly that IAP will be implemented and how the content it unlocks will be gated will be very interesting to see. Will Super Mario Run let you play the game as long as you like, but only in a very basic mode, without unlocking? Or will it let you play a certain number of times before slamming down a hard barrier that can only be removed by purchasing, an approach that would make any F2P designer recoil in hissing horror? Will the game employ standard retention strategies like daily rewards, which Pokemon Go rather astonishingly only got around to adding recently, or will it eschew these trappings of mobile gaming entirely? Most of all, perhaps, how much of the established structure of mobile gaming can Nintendo just barge through on the strength of its brand and its IP? $9.99 is an interesting price point, psychologically - it's a very expensive entry point by mobile standards, but probably more realistic than the premium prices companies like Square Enix have tried to charge for some games. Everything Nintendo does in mobile for now is an experiment, of course, but with this price point it's hard not to see them drawing a line in the sand. I imagine that $10 feels like the "right" amount players should be paying for a game, to Nintendo, and by going all-in with their biggest IP from the very outset, the company is essentially trying to push mobile gaming as a whole towards accepting that price point. "It's a coup for Nintendo...not least since it secured them an unprecedented preorder slot on the iOS App Store for several months, undoubtedly ensuring an enormous launch that may even eclipse that of Pokemon Go" It's not that Nintendo expects F2P to go away, and I doubt it's even especially opposed to the idea of F2P on some moral ground. It just wants to give itself options and flexibility, to have a chance to fit the right business model to the right game rather than being painted into an F2P corner by the simple fact of creating a mobile game. With Super Mario Run, it's testing to see if it can create a new norm within the market; a $10 price tag on premium, in-demand games. What's intriguing is the extent to which Nintendo is being aided in this endeavour by Apple. Certainly, it was a coup for Apple to have Super Mario Run on its event stage, and an even bigger one to secure exclusivity (of an as-yet unrevealed nature) for the game on iOS devices. However, these things run both ways; it's a coup for Nintendo too, not least since it secured them an unprecedented preorder slot on the iOS App Store for several months, undoubtedly ensuring an enormous launch that may even eclipse that of Pokemon Go. Both companies are stepping into unknown territory here; Nintendo with the game itself and by working with another platform holder, and Apple with the pre-order and with the very notion of a third-party iOS exclusive game. It's a collaboration, in short, and it's clear that the two companies have had extensive discussions behind the scenes. The question of business model must have come up in those discussions, and Nintendo's free-to-start, premium IAP model - essentially a shareware style demo and upgrade - most likely has Apple's blessing. That's something of a U-turn for Apple. Although the company has remained publicly agnostic about business models on the App Store for years, its deeds have clearly been aimed at promoting F2P to a large extent. That's understandable; Apple's business is selling hardware, and having an enormous library of software people can download for free is a great way to sell hardware. The reason F2P came to dominate mobile gaming so quickly was that unlike other platform holders (who sell hardware at a loss or at break-even and make their money from software licensing), Apple had no interest in holding up software prices. Freed from the control of a platform holder, prices trended towards the inevitable baseline - zero - and developers found different ways to monetise their work. Now it seems that Apple is willing, perhaps even actively interested, in exploring alternatives. Maybe the company has come to view the F2P model, which is great in principle but so often abused, as a net negative for its customer base and potentially harmful to sales. Perhaps it's concerned by the ongoing market dominance of such a small number of rapidly ageing game titles, which may be squeezing out other developers and quashing creativity. Perhaps it's simply interested in finding ways to expand the reach of the App Store and believes that encouraging a diversity of business models is a good way of doing so. Most likely, there's a little of all of these motivations in the mix, but the ultimate outcome is the same in any case; in striking its partnership with Nintendo, the closest collaboration it's ever done with a game company, it's given its badge of approval to a radically different approach to selling games on the App Store. For Nintendo's part, it's obviously taking a big risk; I confess to being moderately surprised, at the time, that it would commit Mario, its most valuable IP, to its very first full-fledged experiment in mobile gaming. My own guess had been that something like Animal Crossing or perhaps even a tie-in with current golden-child Splatoon would have been first to launch; you can't win 'em all, and in this case I clearly overestimated Nintendo's caution with its most precious asset. Perhaps that simply speaks to great confidence in the game they're launching; perhaps it's more a reflection of belief in the robustness of the Mario IP, which has after all survived the character's likeness being plastered all over all sorts of unusual games ever since the era of the NES. "It's not just Mario who'll get bruised if Super Mario Run doesn't live up to the company's standards. It'll be a blow to the firm's entire medium to long term strategy, and a major challenge to the leadership of its still relatively new CEO, Tatsumi Kimishima" Perhaps, though, there's a slightly different explanation - one suggested strongly by the enormous hype surrounding Pokemon Sun and Moon on the 3DS, the latest iterations in the venerable Pokemon franchise and unquestionably the most eagerly awaited and loudly hyped iterations in many years. Pokemon Sun and Moon are, of course, the first Pokemon games to launch since Pokemon Go became an overnight phenomenon on mobile devices over the summer. While much of the excitement around Pokemon Go has died down, the sheer degree of brand awareness and interest generated by the game is incalculable; it's quite literally the kind of marketing and publicity that money cannot buy. The boost it will provide to sales of Pokemon Sun and Moon is likely to be significant, as the 3DS titles have already sold-in 10 million copies. Thinking about timescales, a Super Mario Run launch in mid-December places it a similar distance ahead of the launch of Nintendo's new Switch console as the Pokemon Go launch was ahead of the launch of Pokemon Sun and Moon. It's a somewhat different proposition, of course, but the thinking may well be similar; stirring up enormous interest in a key, classic Nintendo IP - perhaps even one which will be a launch title for Switch - should give a major boost in the arm to the console when it launches. Much of Nintendo's challenge at the moment lies in reactivating its consumers; reminding people who used to be Nintendo players, but have either strayed to PlayStation and Xbox or stopped playing entirely, what they valued about the brand and its games. Mobile gaming isn't just a profitable business for the company, though it certainly hopes it will become that; it's also an outreach program, a way to bring people back into the fold and help the company to sustain its position in the market. All of this depends, of course, on Super Mario Run being a great experience. In that sense, next month brings a truly enormous risk - far greater than the risk of simply associating the Mario brand with a dud. It's not just Mario who'll get bruised if Super Mario Run doesn't live up to the company's standards. It'll be a blow to the firm's entire medium to long term strategy, and a major challenge to the leadership of its still relatively new CEO, Tatsumi Kimishima. Whatever else Nintendo is thinking about Super Mario Run, you can be absolutely assured that one thought is predominant; the game absolutely has to be good. Luckily, that's not exactly an alien thought for the company - no matter what platform you're working on or what business model you're designing around, some philosophies of game creation are universal.

It would be awesome if one 'brave leader' were to still recognize the potential for a monetization model that does not involve the current vampiric like activities the current freemium models resemble. Taking a casual survey of comments on the gaming forums I frequent, many F2P who don't normally pay into a game would probably appreciate a one time fee to unlock vs the current 'pay to win' models that are dominated by 'whales'. The current freemium is too lucrative to outright die, that is for certain. However, it would be nice if some tried a 'AAA' production game that either utilized a free for the beginning (i.e for RPGs this could entail the first 10 - 15 levels or beginning 3 zones etc), and subscription based service or one time fee unlock for the whole game. The subscription could be 1 or 2$ a month.

Often you'll get increased benefits as your VIP status goes up with every purchase. It does not alleviate the need to potentially keep paying for other elements of the game, but it gives you an edge to progress faster, earn more coins or XP, etc. 0Sign inorRegisterto rate and reply Robin Clarke Producer, AppyNation Ltd2 days ago Good stuff. However I'm still not convinced by this narrative that Nintendo or Apple are trying to divert the established model. There aren't a lot of brands in gaming that can justify a premium price tag that aren't exploiting this already. SMR's model lets them take two bites of the cherry - a one-off payment for a finite arcade style game, and IAP for virtual currency and items in the other two game modes. Apple have always heavily favoured premium games to F2P in terms of giving them marketing support, taking the view that successful F2P games are able to buy enough visibility on their own. SMR isn't doing anything new with its monetisation that would need Apple's approval. 1Sign inorRegisterto rate and replyShow all comments (6) James Berg Games User Researcher, EA Canada2 days ago The $10 price point is definitely interesting. I hope they're successful, as a consumer I'd be happier seeing more premium titles from quality developers. I too think Run is likely viewed largely as adjunctive marketing for the Switch. 0Sign inorRegisterto rate and reply Emmanuel Dorée Studying Software Engineering, Open University22 hours ago It's going to be interesting to see who is ready to pay $10 for a runner game on a phone. I wish they went instead with a different genre like a puzzle game or a throwback to game and watch games or Wario ware style games etc... Then I wouldn't mind the price tag. I find this game so uninspired so unNintendo. I will be more interested to see their approach with Animal Crossing and Fire Emblem. I hope though that this is successful and that it drives people back to Nintendo consoles. 0Sign inorRegisterto rate and reply Daniel Hughes PhD Researcher, Bangor University3 hours ago As a consumer I'd definitely welcome more high quality mobile titles in the £5-£10 price range. Presumably Nintendo will want their core fans to buy-in first, and will then hope that gamers new to Nintendo either spend through IAP, or enjoy the free trial enough to feel confident that the final product is worth the £8/$10. I also fully expect we'll see Super Mario Switch launching alongside the new machine in March. The downside is I'm on Android, so I won't be trying Run out until sometime next year! 0Sign inorRegisterto rate and reply Sign in to contribute Email addressPasswordSign in Need an account?

Nicknamed the “Touch Disease”, this particular problem was attributed to rather poor quality in the soldering of the smartphone’s touch controller component. Now three months later, Apple has finally spoken up about the matter and is offering repairs for any iPhone 6 Plus experiencing the issue. And, of course, Apple is placing the blame solely on the user. Initial third-party and consumer investigations speculated that the touch disease was a by-product of the iPhone 6 Plus’ “bendability”. With just the right (read: excessive) amount of pressure, the frame of the smartphone curves and some components, like the touch controller, get dislodged. Teardown experts and users alike criticized Apple’s craftsmanship, saying that even with bendgate, the components should not so easily detach from the logic boards. Apple doesn’t go into detail with the exact cause of the issue other than acknowledging that there is, indeed, a widespread issue. It does say, however, that the flickering and multi-touch problems are the result of the iPhone being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress. So, yeah, you’re holding/dropping it wrong. Nevertheless, Apple is accepting repairs for the iPhone 6 Plus experiencing this problem, as long as they are still in working order and don’t have broken screens. Oh, and you get to pay a $149 service fee as well. If you’re lucky enough for that service to be available in your country. Those who already did so before this Multi-Touch Repair Program will be contacted by Apple for reimbursements. If you’re one of those and haven’t received that e-mail yet, you can contact Apple directly as well. No word if the iPhone 6, some of which have also been bitten by the Touch Disease, are eligible.

President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants Apple to start making its "damn computers and things" in the US, and he may get his wish. Citing unnamed sources, Japanese newspaper Nikkei claims that Apple's key manufacturing partner Foxconn "has been studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to the US." One source reportedly told the paper that Apple in June asked Foxconn and another Taiwanese iPhone assembler Pegatron to look into making the handsets in the states. "Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns," the source said, according to Nikkei. Moving iPhone production to the US would undoubtedly be more costly for Cupertino. One source told the newspaper that production costs would more than double. Apple and Foxconn did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In 2011, Steve Jobs reportedly scoffed at the idea of bringing iPhone production to the US when asked by President Obama what it would take to make that happen. "Those jobs aren't coming back," Jobs said at the time. //Related Articles Report: Fire Breaks Out at Foxconn's iPhone Manufacturing Facility The following year, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced plans to bring some parts of Mac production to the US; Apple reportedly invested more than $100 million as part of that effort. This isn't the first time Foxconn has considered setting up shop in the US. The manufacturing giant in 2012 confirmed that it was looking to expand operations in North America, but that has not yet happened. "We are looking at doing more manufacturing in the US because, in general, customers want more to be done there," Louis Woo, a Foxconn spokesman, told Bloomberg Businessweek at the time.

Now Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance is leading the charge. Vance is renewing calls for federal legislation to force Apple to unlock their phones in criminal investigations. Apple has so far remained steadfast in saying no to law enforcement entities. These days, everyone has a smartphone -- even criminals. Inside the Manhattan District Attorney's new Cyber Lab, which just opened Thursday, there are 409 locked iPhones. All seized from criminal investigations. The office believes accessing the stored data in these phones will further the investigations. According to Vance's office, 10 percent of the locked phones are involved in attempted murder or homicide cases. Nine percent of the phones in sex crimes cases. The impressive 2200 sq. foot facility will comb through digital evidence and try to crack passwords to get into those phones. DA Vance says of the new Lab: "A state-of-the-art cyber lab is an investment in 21st-century crimefighting and a demonstration of my Office's capacity to handle complex local, national, and international cybercrime investigations. Nearly every crime against Manhattan residents and institutions involving digital evidence will engage the resources and expertise of this lab. With a dedicated space for our prosecutors, investigators, and analysts to work together on fast-moving investigations, New York City is better equipped than ever to combat the rising tide of cybercrime and identity theft." Apple first went up against law enforcement when they butted heads in February after the FBI fought to have Apple unlock the iPhone of the San Bernardino shooter. Apple went against the court order. The FBI eventually unlocked the device without Apple's help. PIX11 spoke with people who have mixed feelings. Many say they want to be protected and help solve crimes but if it comes at the expense of their privacy, that becomes a more difficult question. Some are worried it opens the door to hackers. "There's always a possibility to be hacked. I don't know if it makes it bigger the possibility because hackers know their way into the phones but if they want to get into your phone, they'll find a way," said iPhone user Antonella Mangold. "I know it's like the FBI reading it but it still could be any person so I personally prefer my privacy over safety," said Nina Bechtold. DA Vance is calling for federal legislation to force Apple to write a "warrant-friendly operating system." A woman visiting New York City from Silicone Valley weighed in, saying "It's a conundrum there's both sides and I can see both sides. I'm from San Francisco we get it we understand the rights to privacy but we also understand there are times the government probably needs to get into phones for safety and security." DA Vance's call for federal legislation may get a boost when President-elect Trump takes office. Trump called for a boycott of Apple when the company refused to help the FBI in the San Bernardino shooter case.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 18, 2016 at 7:07PM For about a decade, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has used processors designed and manufactured by microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in its iMac desktop and MacBook laptop computer families.  Apple iMac and MacBook computers. Image source: author.  However, as Apple's chip design prowess has grown, primarily to support its non-Mac products such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, speculation has run rampant that Apple would eventually build processors to replace Intel's in the Mac.  Were that to happen, Intel's personal computer processor business would be negatively impacted, but Intel's business would be able to weather it (sales to Apple comprised less than 10% of Intel's total revenue in 2015).  It still hasn't happened, though.   Nevertheless, a new report from investment company Exane BNP Paribas (via The Street) suggests that Apple might be hiring engineers to build chips that will finally allow Apple to boot Intel out of the Mac. Let's take a closer look at what the analysts had to say.  Apple is hiring graphics engineers? You don't say! The analysts reportedly point out that Apple's looking to fill 87 hardware engineering positions related to graphics processing technology. Based on this, the analysts said that "the graphics job vacancies suggest that Apple is building a completely new chip design team, which in our experience points to a new application." The analysts further went on to say that "the need for computing, CPU and/or GPU skills could point to a custom Apple chip for the Apple MacBook." "It is entirely plausible that Apple could produce a beefed up 7 [nanometer] apps processor... capable of powering a MacBook in 2018," the analysts concluded. I'm not buying it. What else requires CPU and/or GPU technology? Inside of every Apple iPhone and iPad is an Apple-designed applications processor. These chips integrate a whole host of technologies, including CPUs, graphics processors, image processing units, memory controllers, and more. Microprocessor expert David Kanter recently revealed in an article published on website Real World Technologies that Apple has been using custom-designed graphics processors in its iPhone and iPad chips since the A8/A8X chips. Previous Apple chips incorporated graphics processor designs licensed from graphics specialist Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF). It is far more likely that the job listings indicate that Apple is trying to bolster the graphics processor teams that build technologies for Apple's iPhone and iPad devices rather than for its Mac products.  So, about the Intel thing... Only Apple knows if its long-term plan is to replace Intel's processors with its own chips.  That said, a transition away from Intel processors and toward Apple-designed ARM processors across Apple's Mac lineup is unlikely to happen in the near-future, if it's going to happen at all.  Indeed, all of the software that runs on the Mac -- both first-party and third-party -- would need to be reworked in order to properly function on ARM processors, as it is all designed around Intel's technology. Yes, Apple has done such architecture transitions on the Mac before, but the last time that the company did one (moving from PowerPC to Intel), Apple gave developers ample notice so that they could get their software ready (the PowerPC to Intel transition was announced at World Wide Developers Conference 2005; the first Intel-based Macs didn't ship until WWDC 2006).   To my knowledge, Apple hasn't given developers such a heads-up about a transition of the Mac from Intel to ARM.  Nevertheless, the point here isn't whether or not Apple is ultimately planning to kick Intel out of the Mac; the point is that the fact that Apple is hiring experts to work on graphics processor technology is hardly evidence that Apple is planning to replace Intel in the Mac.

"Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the U.S.," the Nikkei Asian Review reported, citing a source. "Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns." Apple declined to comment when contacted by CNBC. However, Apple has long said the barrier to moving iPhone production to the U.S. is expertise, in addition to cost. "Foxconn follows a strict company policy of not commenting on any matters related to current or potential customers, or any of their products," a company spokesperson told CNBC via email. Taiwan-based Foxconn and Pegatron assemble iPhones in China. The news comes following Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election. The Republican president-elect has been vocal about how U.S. companies should be building their products in America. "We're going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries," Trump said in a speech in January.

But Beijing has hit back: In an opinion piece published in a state-backed newspaper, the Chinese government warned that iPhone sales and other American goods could suffer if such a plan were to go through. "A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.," the Global Times article read. Manufacturing the iPhones abroad allows Apple to maintain a strong margin on its product. Apple is Foxconn's biggest customer but Chairman Terry Gou is worried about the rising production costs of such a move, the Nikkei reported, citing a source saying that costs will double. It's important to note that the discussions began in June, five months before Trump won the election. Analysts said it is still hard to quantify what such a move would mean for Apple's finances, but warned that there will be an impact. "If the world moves to a more nationalistic approach 'made in America, by Americans, for Americans' or 'made in China, by Chinese, for Chinese'... these variable conditions will likely impact margins, growth and suppliers exposed to the globalization trend of the last decade," wrote Neil Campling, head of global technology, media, and telecoms research at Northern Trust Capital Markets, in a note on Friday. "The same will likely make global tech a tougher place to invest in 2017," he said.

Trump jumped at the chance, claiming in a tweet that he had "worked hard" with Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. to keep the plant in Kentucky, even though Ford had never considered moving the whole factory south of the border. In letting Trump claim a victory, Ford made what appeared to be a calculated, public appeal to the next president in an attempt to soothe concerns about outsourcing jobs and to gain some leverage with the new administration as the automaker pushes for favorable policy changes in Congress. "Ford is not going to make a decision on a purely political basis," said Kristin Dziczek, director of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan. "They are going to make a decision that makes business sense, economic sense and if it happens to align with political goals, that's great," she said. The No. 2 automaker in the United States is not the only company in Trump's crosshairs working out how to deal with the new political reality in Washington. Apple Inc, criticized by Trump for not building products in the United States, is studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to the United States, Japanese news service Nikkei reported on Thursday. Apple did not reply to a request for comment on Friday. JOBS = VOTES Trump campaigned heavily on bringing jobs to the United States and attacking companies such as Ford that plan to take some production overseas, a message that resonated in the economically ravaged center of the country. Ford gave Trump plenty of ammunition, confirming in September that all of its remaining small-car production in the United States, at its facility in Wayne, Michigan, would go to lower-cost Mexico by 2019. Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said no plants would be closed as a result, and no U.S. jobs would be lost as capacity at the Wayne plant would be taken up by two new models. The Mexico plans remain in place, despite the fact that Trump vowed on the campaign trail to stop Ford opening a new plant in that country and promised to slap 35 percent tariffs on any Ford vehicles made there. Ford went further this month, announcing on Election Day a new $195 million investment in India to add 3,000 jobs over the next five years in a technology and business center in Chennai. Ford said this week it would import its Ford EcoSport built in India to the United States. Trump has not made any public comment on that plan. BOTH CLAIM VICTORY On Thursday, Ford said it had been reviewing where to build the Lincoln MKC, just one vehicle built at the Louisville assembly plant, but had decided to keep it in Kentucky. As such, nothing changed, but letting Trump announce the decision gave him the opportunity to claim he saved U.S. jobs and cast Ford as a patriotic manufacturer. "Both sides will claim a certain level of victory because nobody wants a significant negative impact on the industry," said Dave Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research. It was unclear how many, if any, jobs were actually saved by the decision. Ford decided last year to move MKC production by 2019, on the assumption that production of the Ford Escape, a similar vehicle made in the same plant, would grow. But recently Escape demand has slumped, which may have prompted Ford to reconsider. According to Cole, Ford's olive branch to Trump was a clear indication that it needs help from the next administration as it faces a host of issues from fuel economy standards and the rise of autonomous vehicles to trade and currency. Cole said Trump, who boasts about his dealmaking skills, may choose to focus on bargaining with companies he has targeted - even if only for small concessions - rather than pursue more punitive measures such as tariffs, which would take time to implement and potentially damage the economy. Ford nodded to those wider issues in a statement on Friday, saying it was encouraged that Trump's economic policies "will help improve U.S. competitiveness." Ford, like other global U.S. corporations, agrees with key aspects of Trump's economic plans. It has called for U.S. tax reform and raised concerns about the costs of federal regulations. Ford also shares Trump's concerns about currency manipulation. (Editing by Bill Rigby) Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

November 19, 2016 9:36 PM   Subscribe Since Apple decided to stop tethering their products, I've been seeing stories in the news about people just walking into stores in large groups and walking off with thousands of dollars worth of items. Explain Apple's business plan to me. In theory, I realize that Apple can just brick any devices after they connect to the internet. But I haven't actually seen any follow up stories to the theft stories where the thieves have been caught because they turned on a stolen computer or people buying phones on eBay only to find them bricked due to them being stolen. My local store has had over $100k of merchandise stolen over the past 3 months - I have no idea how they are still insured. Are they still insured? I guess I'm looking for four things here: 1. How is this a good business plan for Apple? 2. Where is the second part of these theft stories where the phones turn up or the thieves are caught? 3. Where are these stolen items being taken to? Oversees? Broken down and reconstituted? 4. Who would insure a store that has 100k worth of merchandise stolen in 3 months? Opinions or news stories welcome. posted by Toddles to Computers & Internet (3 answers total)   1. Apple stores have always been getting robbed. Thieves cut tethers easily. It's just their same old retail strategy that's been working out. It's a bit scary how coordinated some of these recent thefts are, though. 2. They do get caught. I just googled some stories. 3. They're supposedly sold for parts. 4. $400k in thefts a year is only about 1% of an Apple store's revenue. Since they have so much cash and a huge finance operation I am guessing Apple self-insures these losses anyway. posted by michaelh at 10:18 PM on November 19 Apple stocks almost no merchandise on the sales floor. Peripherals, phone cases, cables, laptop bags etc? Sure. But I can't think of a single high-dollar item they sell that is kept out on the floor in large numbers. When you want to buy something, you find a sales associate, who gets the item from the stockroom and drops it at the cash register for you. The monetary value of the floor models is probably a tiny drop in the bucket of any given Apple store's general L&D budget. They are probably more worried about employees stealing than they are that someone will come in and swipe a floor model iPad. posted by Sara C. at 10:28 PM on November 19 Apple stocks almost no merchandise on the sales floor The Apple Store near me usually have 30-40 iPads, 20 iPhones, and 5-15 laptops on the tables right by the wide open doors. I agree that may not be a huge amount, but grabbing ten or twenty of those items would be over $10,000, would it not? posted by saucysault at 5:45 AM on November 20 [2 favorites] « Older How to move links from the home screen of Android...   |   Is my new housemate smoking indoors?

Posted: Yesterday 5:37 p.m. 0 Comments SHARE Richard Lui/The Desert Sun Tablet computers provide information on the edibles at the MedMen marijuana dispensary on Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood. Richard Lui/The Desert Sun A worker tends to marijuana plants at the MedMen cultivation facility in Sun Valley near Los Angeles, on Nov. 15. These plants are ready to be harvested. MedMen currently grows 20 strains of marijuana plants. By Rosalie Murphy, USA TODAY NETWORK Posted: Yesterday 5:37 p.m. 0 MedMen likens itself, as many cannabis companies do, to an early tech startup. Its West Hollywood dispensary looks a bit like an Apple store, with samples of product in polished glass cases and information about each on iPads. In a grow facility in Sun Valley, north of Los Angeles, marijuana plants grow in coconut fiber, sustained by drip irrigation and marked by thin plastic labels stuck in soil. Beyond the dispensary and cultivation center, the company offers "turnkey management services" to others in the cannabis space and boasts a $100 million venture capital fund. This is the future of legal marijuana in California: Diversification, slick branding and professional investment. Marijuana is already as big a business as coffee and Indian gaming, with analysts estimating $30 billion in annual consumer spending. The trouble is, only one in every five of those dollars are currently spent on legal products. The rest, some $24 billion annually, ends up in black-market pockets, according to a 2016 cannabis report from the Cowen Group, a New York-based market research firm. But more and more of that money will come out of the shadows in the next two years. This month, voters legalized recreational marijuana use in four states and medical marijuana in four more. California, home to 12 percent of Americans, is expected to triple the size of the legal market when the state begins issuing licenses in 2018. Vivien Azer, a cannabis analyst with Cowen, believes the nation's legal market will grow ninefold over the next decade, with consumer spending on recreational and medical marijuana hitting $50 billion by 2026. "Formalizing the informal market alone is a $25 billion opportunity," Azer wrote in a September report. Part of that growth will come from black-market customers moving into the legal market. And some will come from new customers, who were uncomfortable seeking prescriptions for the drug or have never used it at all. There's a similar industry evolution already underway. While some mom-and-pop growers, operating for years in a "gray zone" without regulation, struggle to come out of the shadows, companies are circling the enormous California recreational market — some with millions in the bank already. Mainstreaming an Industry Even before California voters passed Proposition 64, the state's medical marijuana market was two decades old and fairly sophisticated. California marijuana has apps, wealthy investors and companies that specialize in packaging and branding. But even now it lacks some key resources: For example, many banks won't serve cannabis businesses while the drug remains illegal at the federal level. "Something people forget is that medical marijuana has been around in Cailfornia for two decades now," MedMen communications director Daniel Yi said. "I think we are at an inflection point in our industry now where it's going from legacy growers — people who were in the trenches at the beginning of the medical marijuana fight — and it's becoming more and more business-like. Some people see negative connotations in that, but this has become more of a mainstream industry." The current patchwork of laws have kept the largest investors — entrepreneurs mentioned Goldman Sachs and tobacco giant Phillip Morris — out of the market for now. Azer, the Cowen analyst, believes those companies will start acquiring or investing in cannabis companies only after the drug is legalized at the federal level. But private investors are already eagerly seeking opportunities in cannabis, eyeing high returns. MedMen launched a $100 million private equity fund this summer, and Chris Leavy, a former BlackRock executive, invested soon after. He's interested in cannabis because he knows the customer base already exists — nearly one in 10 Americans admits to using cannabis, according to Cowen estimates, and many of them are shifting from illegal to legal use now — and because, in the absence of large institutional investors, cannabis investments are relatively accessible. "As investors became aware of the likely legalization of recreational use for California and a few other states, I think two things happened in investors' minds," Leavy said. "One is the obvious growth in the industry that comes with legalization. But I also think there's a strength in that current ... that reduces the risk that the trend toward legalization gets reversed." The industry, Leavy predicted, will increasingly have winners and losers — companies that make it and those that don't. He thinks the winners will be those with innovative manufacturing processes, brand awareness and the ability to scale. Scaling will be necessary. According to a 2016 report from ArcView Market Research, recreational marijuana sales more than tripled from 2014 to 2015 as Colorado and Washington's markets matured, reaching $1.2 billion in 2015. California's population is more than three times larger than Colorado and Washington combined. In 2020, when ArcView predicts recreational sales will hit $12 billion nationwide and medical sales will top $10 billion, MedMen plans to be there. "We are years ahead now," Yi said. "Say somebody with $100 million wakes up tomorrow and decides they're going to get into the marijuana business. They'll have a learning curve. It takes a lot of time to prepare all that, and we've been doing this for years." 'Big Canna' There are thousands of people who have been operating marijuana businesses for years — and unlike MedMen, most have been operating illegally. They risk arrest, but they also avoid taxes and the cost of complying with regulations. They might not survive. "If you're a small pot grower and you don't have the money and resources to turn into a bigger player ... then unfortunately you're not going to be around," Yi said. "Nobody wants to see people lose their businesses and lose their jobs, but there's the flip side — you either have this gray market forever and ever, or you institutionalize that and become mainstream. A lot of these folks might be able to find jobs in the evolving industry, but the business model is not going to survive unless they adapt." Ata Gonzalez, founder of G FarmaLabs and a longtime player in the industry, said some of the so-called "gray market" growers — who supply dispensaries selling to legal customers but aren't licensed themselves — have started to see his company as "big canna." Gonzalez said he and his colleagues started like everybody else in the industry, growing small amounts of cannabis for dispensaries. But then they kept growing. After Washington legalized recreational marijuana in 2012, the Anaheim-based company began contracting with manufacturers there to serve recreational customers. Gonzalez is now planning a cultivation facility on 7 acres in Desert Hot Springs, set to open in 2018. "(Small growers) fear it, and I don't think they should fear it, I think they should embrace it, I think it's going to create a lot of opportunity for a lot of people," Gonzalez said. "But I think that's their biggest fear, the big guys coming in and wiping us out. I fear it as much as them. I don't have the firepower to keep Phillip Morris from actually coming in here and spending a billion dollars, how do you fight that? But I have strategy and experience in this industry. I see them come in, I see them blow the money, and I see them walk away." Marijuana products need packaging, which is often governed by strict regulations. Dispensaries need scales and specialty gloves. Users need pipes and rolling paper. Kush Bottles, with offices in Denver and Santa Ana, is trying to provide all these products. With 50 employees, the 6-year-old company says it raked in $8.2 million in revenue in fiscal year 2016. In January, the company started trading stocks "over the counter" — using a network of stock traders less formal than the NASDAQ, but still allowing out-of-state investors to buy shares. "There aren't a lot of large companies in the cannabis space, but there's a huge appetite in the investor community wanting to participate in the cannabis space," CEO Nick Kovacevich said. "We're doing well in our niche markets, but we're only in three or four markets heavily, and we see this thing being 50 markets, and hopefully pool-able expansion. In order to prepare for that, we knew we would need access to capital. ... While we're waiting for these (newly legalized) states to implement, we use our public vehicle to make sure we're ready to take advantage of it and capitalize on these new markets." Cowen analyst Vivien Azer often compares the cannabis industry to tobacco — and if the federal government legalizes marijuana, she expects to see a great deal of overlap between the two. In the meantime, she thinks tobacco companies can focus on developing products like e-cigarettes for cannabis users. She identified Kush Bottles as one of the industry's most interesting companies. "I really like their business model because they're arms-length," Azer said. "I think they've really carved out a niche and are keenly aware of the headwind going forward." Proposition 64 allows California to start licensing sellers of recreational marijuana on Jan. 1, 2018. But because marijuana remains illegal at the federal level, it can't be transported across state lines — meaning it will have to be California grown. One cultivation facility is already online in Desert Hot Springs; MedMen and G FarmaLabs are both building facilities in the desert town two hours from Los Angeles. Industrial land prices in the city have spiked as would-be growers try to secure space and start selling medical products, though recreational sales are still 14 months away. In Colorado, demand spiked when licensing began in 2014, driving prices way up. But as more growers and sellers joined the industry, prices plummeted. Joshua Haupt, co-owner of Colorado's Superfarm, a 2-facility cultivation company, said marijuana there sells for $900 to $1,200 per pound — down from about $4,000 a pound right after legalization. He thinks California's large population will keep prices higher for longer, but eventually, margins will shrink. Haupt said Superfarm takes in about $1.1 million in revenue on about 1,000 pounds of marijuana per month. They pay more than $250,000 in taxes and spend about $350,000 on production. The rest is overhead, salaries for 80 employees and, of course, profit. "If you're getting in now and only have a few hundred thousand dollars and a genius grower who's been growing under four lights in his basement ... they're so stuck in the world of the black market, they've done incredibly well in the black market, and they think it's going to transfer into the legit industry, and that is an incredibly large mistake on their part," Haupt said. Taxes and regulatory costs are high; profits can shrink in the legal market even as the customer base grows. "It's one thing to run four lights in your basement. It's another thing to run 400 lights in a 25,000-square-foot grow. Is it too late? Absolutely not, but the barrier for entry has gotten much higher." Investor Chris Leavy, considering the state of the industry, summarized, "I think we're at the end of the beginning." 0 Share Tweet Email Print More News Shasta's Most Wanted: Nov. 20, 2016 Sikh procession honors founder, feeds community Negotiator posts video in urgent mission to find Sherri Papini Two key Burney companies get 5-year reprieves Most Wanted: Paul Joseph Shell Now Trending Negotiator posts video in urgent mission to find Sherri Papini Burney biomass plant, sawmill get five-year reprieve Shasta County narrowly votes no on legal pot; Trinity County virtually tied UPDATED: Storms bring rain, snow to North State; road conditions affected Measure D failed because of distrust in local leaders News Sports Business Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Obituaries Connect With Us Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube Google Plus Pinterest Newsletters RSS News Tip Useful Links e-Edition Events Calendar Blogs Contests Advertise Subscribe Member Benefits Get Out!

Photo: Annie Wermiel The Busby girls take Manhattan! America’s only set of female quintuplets — the stars of the TLC reality show “OutDaughtered” — hit the Big Apple this week to film an episode for Season 2 of the show, which returned to the small screen last Tuesday. “Whenever we’re just strolling through the streets, [the babies are] so good, because they just like to look around,” said dad Adam, 34, who works in petrochemical industrial sales. “Especially when we went to Times Square with them and saw the lights; they loved it.” The Busby’s: Adam and Danielle with daughter Blayke and quintuplets: Hazel, Ava, Riley, Olivia, Parker.Photo: Annie Wermiel The girls — 19-month-old Ava, Hazel, Olivia, Parker and Riley — draw plenty of attention themselves, too. Mom Danielle, 32, said that when the whole family is out together, people “want to ask questions.” The Busbys, who live in League City, Texas, have gotten used to the curiosity factor since the babies were born in April 2015. One of the big questions is whether the babies were conceived naturally. The couple, who also have a 5-year-old daughter, Blayke, struggled with infertility prior to both their pregnancies, and the quints were conceived with the aid of fertility drugs and a procedure called IUI, or intrauterine insemination. It caused Danielle to ovulate three to four eggs each cycle as opposed to one, and multiples also run in her family. Babies Ava and Olivia are identical twins; their three sisters are sororal (the female equivalent of fraternal). On the first season of the show, which airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m., Adam worried about the expense of raising six kids. (Danielle is a stay-at-home mom.) “It’s tough knowing that it’s all on my shoulders,” he said at the time. While the quintuplets are still young enough to fly for free, they need someone to hold them. So for their five-night trip to New York, the family invited Adam’s parents and Danielle’s mother so each baby could sit on an adult’s lap on the flight. And no subway rides for this crew, as TLC rented the Busbys a 32-passenger bus for cruising the town. Navigating the two strollers they brought — a double and a triple — through the crowded streets of Manhattan proved a struggle for the first-time visitors, but they’re one of the few sites that get New Yorkers to stop in their tracks. “I would have figured that a lot of people would just walk past and not even look, but there have been quite a few people that have stopped us and said something to us,” Danielle said. “They see the three in stroller and then two – triplets, wait what?!” The Busby household is more chaotic than ever!

New figures released show that foot traffic to branches is also down, with "branch banker interactions" down 22 percent from 2015. The figures come in the wake of a sales practice scandal that triggered multiple lawsuits, an enormous $185 million fine and the resignation of the company's longtime CEO John Stumpf.

Its West Hollywood dispensary looks a bit like an Apple store, with samples of product in polished glass cases and information about each on iPads. In a grow facility in Sun Valley, north of Los Angeles, marijuana plants grow in coconut fiber, sustained by drip irrigation and marked by thin plastic labels stuck in soil. Beyond the dispensary and cultivation center, the company offers "turnkey management services" to others in the cannabis space and boasts a $100 million venture capital fund.

Marijuana is already as big a business as coffee and Indian gaming, with analysts estimating $30 billion in annual consumer spending. The trouble is, only one in every five of those dollars are currently spent on legal products. The rest, some $24 billion annually, ends up in black-market pockets, according to a 2016 cannabis report from the Cowen Group, a New York-based market research firm. But more and more of that money will come out of the shadows in the next two years. This month, voters legalized recreational marijuana use in four states and medical marijuana in four more. California, home to 12 percent of Americans, is expected to triple the size of the legal market when the state begins issuing licenses in 2018. Vivien Azer, a cannabis analyst with Cowen, believes the nation's legal market will grow ninefold over the next decade, with consumer spending on recreational and medical marijuana hitting $50 billion by 2026. "Formalizing the informal market alone is a $25 billion opportunity," Azer wrote in a September report. Part of that growth will come from black-market customers moving into the legal market. And some will come from new customers, who were uncomfortable seeking prescriptions for the drug or have never used it at all. There's a similar industry evolution already underway. While some mom-and-pop growers, operating for years in a "gray zone" without regulation, struggle to come out of the shadows, companies are circling the enormous California recreational market — some with millions in the bank already. Mainstreaming an industry Even before California voters passed Proposition 64, the state's medical marijuana market was two decades old and fairly sophisticated. California marijuana has apps, wealthy investors and companies that specialize in packaging and branding. But even now it lacks some key resources: For example, many banks won't serve cannabis businesses while the drug remains illegal at the federal level. "Something people forget is that medical marijuana has been around in Cailfornia for two decades now," MedMen communications director Daniel Yi said. "I think we are at an inflection point in our industry now where it's going from legacy growers — people who were in the trenches at the beginning of the medical marijuana fight — and it's becoming more and more business-like. Some people see negative connotations in that, but this has become more of a mainstream industry." The current patchwork of laws have kept the largest investors — entrepreneurs mentioned Goldman Sachs and tobacco giant Phillip Morris — out of the market for now. Azer, the Cowen analyst, believes those companies will start acquiring or investing in cannabis companies only after the drug is legalized at the federal level. But private investors are already eagerly seeking opportunities in cannabis, eyeing high returns. MedMen launched a $100 million private equity fund this summer, and Chris Leavy, a former BlackRock executive, invested soon after. He's interested in cannabis because he knows the customer base already exists — nearly one in ten Americans admits to using cannabis, according to Cowen estimates, and many of them are shifting from illegal to legal use now — and because, in the absence of large institutional investors, cannabis investments are relatively accessible. "As investors became aware of the likely legalization of recreational use for California and a few other states, I think two things happened in investors' minds," Leavy said. "One is the obvious growth in the industry that comes with legalization. But I also think there's a strength in that current... that reduces the risk that the trend toward legalization gets reversed." The industry, Leavy predicted, will increasingly have winners and losers — companies that make it and those that don't. He thinks the winners will be those with innovative manufacturing processes, brand awareness and the ability to scale. Scaling will be necessary. According to a 2016 report from ArcView Market Research, recreational marijuana sales more than tripled from 2014 to 2015 as Colorado and Washington's markets matured, reaching $1.2 billion in 2015. California's population is more than three times larger than Colorado and Washington combined. In 2020, when ArcView predicts recreational sales will hit $12 billion nationwide and medical sales will top $10 billion, MedMen plans to be there. "We are years ahead now," Yi said. "Say somebody with $100 million wakes up tomorrow and decides they're going to get into the marijuana business. They'll have a learning curve. It takes a lot of time to prepare all that, and we've been doing this for years."'© REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni A variety of medicinal marijuana buds in jars are pictured at Los Angeles Patients & Caregivers Group dispensary in West Hollywood, California, on Oct. 18, 2016. 'Big Canna' There are thousands of people who have been operating marijuana businesses for years — and unlike MedMen, most have been operating illegally. They risk arrest, but they also avoid taxes and the cost of complying with regulations. They might not survive. "If you're a small pot grower and you don't have the money and resources to turn into a bigger player... then unfortunately you're not going to be around," Yi said. "Nobody wants to see people lose their businesses and lose their jobs, but there's the flip side — you either have this gray market forever and ever, or you institutionalize that and become mainstream. A lot of these folks might be able to find jobs in the evolving industry, but the business model is not going to survive unless they adapt." Ata Gonzalez, founder of G FarmaLabs and a longtime player in the industry, said he's been getting some heat lately from so-called "gray market" growers — who supply dispensaries selling to legal customers but aren't licensed themselves — who perceive him as "big canna." Gonzalez said he and his colleagues started like everybody else in the industry, growing small amounts of cannabis for dispensaries. But then they kept growing. After Washington legalized recreational marijuana in 2012, the Anaheim-based company began contracting with manufacturers there to serve recreational customers. Gonzalez is now planning a cultivation facility on 7 acres in Desert Hot Springs, set to open in 2018. "(Small growers) fear it, and I don't think they should fear it, I think they should embrace it, I think it's going to create a lot of opportunity for a lot of people," Gonzalez said. "But I think that's their biggest fear, the big guys coming in and wiping us out. I fear it as much as them. I don't have the firepower to keep Phillip Morris from actually coming in here and spending a billion dollars, how do you fight that? But I have strategy and experience in this industry. I see them come in, I see them blow the money, and I see them walk away." Ancillary businesses Marijuana products need packaging, which is often governed by strict regulations. Dispensaries need scales and specialty gloves. Users need pipes and rolling paper. Kush Bottles, with offices in Denver and Santa Ana, is trying to provide all these products. With 50 employees, the six-year-old company says it raked in $8.2 million in revenue in fiscal year 2016. In January, the company started trading stocks "over the counter" — using a network of stock traders less formal than the NASDAQ, but still allowing out-of-state investors to buy shares. "There aren't a lot of large companies in the cannabis space, but there's a huge appetite in the investor community wanting to participate in the cannabis space," CEO Nick Kovacevich said. "We're doing well in our niche markets, but we're only in three or four markets heavily, and we see this thing being 50 markets, and hopefully pool-able expansion. In order to prepare for that, we knew we would need access to capital... While we're waiting for these (newly legalized) states to implement, we use our public vehicle to make sure we're ready to take advantage of it and capitalize on these new markets." Cowen analyst Vivien Azer often compares the cannabis industry to tobacco — and if the federal government legalizes marijuana, she expects to see a great deal of overlap between the two. In the meantime, she thinks tobacco companies can focus on developing products like e-cigarettes for cannabis users. She identified Kush Bottles as one of the industry's most interesting companies. "I really like their business model because they're arms-length," Azer said. "I think they've really carved out a niche and are keenly aware of the headwind going forward." 'Barriers to entry' Proposition 64 allows California to start licensing sellers of recreational marijuana on Jan. 1, 2018. But because marijuana remains illegal at the federal level, it can't be transported across state lines — meaning it will have to be California grown. One cultivation facility is already online in Desert Hot Springs; MedMen and G FarmaLabs are both building facilities in the desert town two hours from Los Angeles. Industrial land prices in the city have spiked as would-be growers try to secure space and start selling medical products, though recreational sales are still 14 months away. In Colorado, demand spiked when licensing began in 2014, driving prices way up. But as more growers and sellers joined the industry, prices plummeted. Joshua Haupt, co-owner of Colorado's Superfarm, a 2-facility cultivation company, said marijuana there sells for $900 to $1,200 per pound — down from about $4,000 a pound right after legalization. He thinks California's large population will keep prices higher for longer, but eventually, margins will shrink. Haupt said Superfarm takes in about $1.1 million in revenue on about 1,000 pounds of marijuana per month. They pay more than $250,000 in taxes and spend about $350,000 on production. The rest is overhead, salaries for 80 employees and, of course, profit. "If you're getting in now and only have a few hundred thousand dollars and a genius grower who's been growing under four lights in his basement... they're so stuck in the world of the black market, they've done incredibly well in the black market, and they think it's going to transfer into the legit industry, and that is an incredibly large mistake on their part," Haupt said. Taxes and regulatory costs are high; profits can shrink in the legal market even as the customer base grows. "It's one thing to run four lights in your basement. It's another thing to run 400 lights in a 25,000 square foot grow. Is it too late? Absolutely not, but the barrier for entry has gotten much higher." Investor Chris Leavy, considering the state of the industry, summarized, "I think we're at the end of the beginning."

Concrete for the building’s foundation is expected to begin later this month. The first section of the L-shaped building was moved in late September and early October using a roller system, a laborious and slow process. Relocating the second section of the barn, which is smaller than the first, has been faster because crews were able to use a dolly system for the move. The 181-foot-long barn was been divided into two sections for the move. The division was made at the location where the first addition to the barn was made about 100 years ago. The pad where the barn will be placed was trenched for the foundation before the move began. Crews have been framing in molds for the future foundation. Relocating and rehabilitating the barn is a key element of the Aptos Village Project. Although the exact date the Hihn Apple Barn was constructed is not known, the barn is historically significant. Part of the building appears to have been constructed c.1891-1899, with substantial additions in 1915 and c.1920, with the last bay (88 feet long by 36 feet wide) added in c.1929-1930. The barn will become a New Leaf Community Market with doors that open into the Village Green common area, a new civic heart for Aptos. Additionally, Soquel Creek Water District has started work on an unrelated project on the property of the future Aptos Village. The District is developing a new well near Granite Way and Trout Gulch Road. This is part of the District’s Well Master Plan. The Aptos Village Project was approved in 2012 after a decade of planning and community input. The redevelopment project features broad sidewalks, vibrant shops, affordable homes and generous civic space to promote a healthy community. Located at the entrance to the Forest of Nisene Marks State Park, this is an innovative and resource-efficient project that re-establishes Aptos Village as the civic heart of Aptos. The project is registered and in process for LEED ND certification, a distinction provided by the U.S. Green Building Council to projects that “successfully protect and enhance the overall health, natural environment and quality of life in our communities.” ••• For more information about the project visit www.theaptosvillage.com and sign up for email newsletter updates, or follow the project on Facebook: www.facebook.com/friendsofaptosvillage. ••• For over 35 years, Barry Swenson Builder has been a dynamic partner in building the Monterey Bay Area.

Apple notoriously provides one of its mini-shops within various Best Buy locations, and Google has tinkered with this concept before. Now, it seems that the big “G” is going all-in on this approach. Image courtesy of TechCrunch Starting in Canada, Google is creating a unique way to experience all of its new products.These shops are aptly named “Google Shops” and allow customers to test out the latest and greatest products including the new Daydream View VR headset, the Pixel and Pixel XL, Google Home, and more. Speaking to TechCrunch, Janell Fisher, Google’s Director of Retail Marketing has explained the reasoning behind this new approach: We love it when people can come in, discover, play and have fun and it just happens to be with technology, so we’ve really tried to layer on lots of different immersive sorts of experiences, some that are direct demonstrations of the product and product features, but some that are more exploratory and fun. In addition to providing a new way to experience Google’s products, the company will also be hosting various workshops and sessions. These workshops will be held within the appropriate Best Buy location and may be run by Google employees or others such as YouTubers. Image courtesy of TechCrunch In addition to launching the Google Shops within Canada, Google has already launched three of these shops in the UK. The experiences will remain mostly the same, save for some subtle changes depending on the location and size of the shop. The bad news is that Fischer confirmed that Google does not have anything in the works to bring this experience to those of us in the United States. This is fairly upsetting considering Google’s failed attempt to provide a different experience within Best Buy locations here in the States.

Trump took his own shots at the industry, floating a boycott of Apple for refusing to crack its encryption for the FBI and accusing Amazon CEO and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos of using his paper as a political weapon against him. ADVERTISEMENT Now with Trump's victory, many tech leaders in Silicon Valley are extending an olive branch. "I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country," Bezos tweeted, two days after the election. Since then, Sacca has criticized and expressed disappointment in Trump's appointments and actions both on Twitter and to The Hill. In August, prominent venture capitalist Chris Sacca knocked “Trump's erratic behavior, repeatedly demonstrated ignorance of economics, and reckless statements." Sacca now says he's willing to give Trump a chance. “We in the tech community are open to helping President Elect Trump in any way he needs to help those Americans who need it most,” Sacca wrote in an email to The Hill after the election. “We are hopeful he will immediately reach out to the tech and startup sectors and start building relationships so we can all work together.” Safra Catz, the co-CEO of Oracle, also met with Trump on Thursday and there is speculation she could be tapped for a cabinet post. Tech leaders have been quick to highlight areas where they hope to work with the president-elect. On Monday, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty wrote an open letter congratulating Trump and offering policy ideas. In her letter, Rometty highlighted creating a "national corps of skilled workers," and using technology to improve infrastructure and make government more efficient. She also raised two big issues: healthcare and taxes. Rometty noted that IBM operates one of the nation's largest employer-sponsored health plans and vowed to work with Congress and the new administration on lowering health costs. And she offered support for Trump's calls to reform the tax system. Efforts to mend fences between the new administration and Silicon Valley could also get a boost from Peter Thiel, Trump's highest profile-supporter from Silicon Valley, and a member of the transition team. Thiel donated millions to Trump's campaign and spoke at the Republican National Convention, and crucially has a foot in both camps. The billionaire venture capitalist sits on Facebook's board of directors and the company defended his role there when critics called for his ouster. But despite Silicon Valley's outreach, there are still many questions and potential roadblocks ahead. Trump has not yet filled many of the key tech policy posts in his administration. And some of the names that will be in the Trump cabinet are worrying Silicon Valley. Stephen Bannon, who will be Trump's senior adviser in the White House, suggested in an interview with Trump in November that Silicon Valley had too many Asian CEOs. For attorney general, Trump on Friday tapped Sen. Jeff SessionsJeff SessionsSearch for secretary of State appears to narrow Priebus: Sessions an 'honorable, decent, good human being' Schumer vows 'tough vetting' for Sessions MORE (R-Ala.), who has a record that's often clashed with tech's interests. The Alabama senator sided with the FBI when they asked Apple to unlock an encrypted phone used by the San Bernardino shooters. He also opposed the USA Freedom Act that curbed many of the NSA surveillance practices. Sessions has also slammed Facebook CEO's Mark Zuckerberg's push for immigration reform. Many in Silicon Valley say they are still unsure what to expect from a Trump administration. During the campaign, Trump made his views on immigration and encryption clear. But since the election, Trump has had few meetings with Silicon Valley execs and offered little insight into what policies he will actually push. “Trump hasn't said what his position is on tech issues, but if I had to guess he will be for more innovation, less regulation and more spying on citizens,” said major tech entrepreneur Jason Calacanis. “Of course, maybe Trump will change his mind... two or three times in four years. No one knows... he can't even remember his past positions,” he added. Many in Silicon Valley are also not yet ready to turn the page. Venture capitalist Shervin Pishevar has kept up his criticisms of Trump, calling for California to secede after the election. One major Trump donor in Silicon Valley who has known the president-elect for years, though, is optimistic. The donor said there is a different Trump, away from the campaign trail, who could work with tech. That donor believes Trump will likely change his views on H-1B visas, which are for skilled workers, and highly favored in Silicon Valley. “He wants an immigration policy that makes sense for America,” the donor said. “He gets the H-1B thing. He will not compromise safety but he wants to make America more innovative.” During the campaign Trump flipped his position on H-1B visas at times, pledging to reduce their use at times, while in other moments noting its benefits. “We need highly-skilled people in this country,” Mr. Trump said during a Republican debate in October 2015. “If we can’t do it, we will get them in.” For now, Silicon Valley is taking a hopeful approach that Trump will respond to their overtures and find common ground, even as they acknowledge the tensions and uncertainty. “I’ve noticed there’s a lot of pot being smoked at Silicon Valley at night since the election,” the Trump donor joked. --This report was updated on Nov. 20 at 10:09 a.m. Tags Hillary Clinton, Jeff Sessions, Donald Trump   Please enable JavaScript to view the featured perspectives by Versa.

Reuters/Lucy Nicholson Apple takes pride in being one of the leaders in tech innovation. It’s a reality that the Cupertino-based company is never one that remains left out of the latest advancements for too long. Apple is now set to back that up by incorporating augmented reality technology into iPhone cameras. Apple is reportedly integrating AR features into its flagship smartphone’s camera and is reaching out for start-up support in order to get the job done immediately. The tech giant is also in the midst of developing state-of-the-art glasses that could alter how users see their environment. Apple has recently employed the services of a specialist in head-mounted displays to further solidify its future AR enterprise, according to a Business Insider source. One of the booming interests in modern technology, augmented reality involves superimposing automated objects onto the real world. Apple’s main target is the development of the AR smart glasses, which is a product that competitors like Google and Microsoft are also into. Until more convenient devices come along, smartphones will be the ones to carry the top augmented reality apps. READ: Apple refuses to launch Australian Indigenous app, faces backlash The integration of AR technology into the iPhone’s camera will allow users to direct the device at actual objects and have them recognised. Apple will have to create or certify a database of 3D objects in order to make this possible. Facial manipulation will also be another AR feature with the help of Apple’s acquisition of FaceShift and several other augmented reality and virtual reality companies. According to the source, once Apple is done incorporating the AR features into the iPhone camera software, it shall launch the new enhancement via an SDK for app creators. That way, augmented reality technology could further reach more users. The company also did the same thing with its Touch ID fingerprint scanner. Apple has yet to make an official announcement or comment about the topic.

Partners in Crime: Apple Inc. and Ireland! ENSURING NATIONAL PROSPERITY VIA TAX LOOPHOLES . . . November 19, 2016, 8:47 pm by Selvam Canagaratna   "Crime is a logical extension of the sort of behaviour that is often considered perfectly respectable in legitimate business."– Robert Rice, The Business of Crime, 1956 "Underneath the sleek design there’s nothing but sleaze," wrote Aidan O’Brien, a regular contributor to CounterPunch magazine, on the revelations by the European Union HQ in Brussels in early September relating to America’s Apple Inc., the world’s largest company. "And behind the blarney there’s sinister bullshit." The giant US corporation has been working harmoniously with the Republic of Ireland since 1991 on its vast tax-dodging exercise. " No wonder they understand each other," wrote O’Brien. "Despite the ultramodern technology and the trendy little economy – Apple and Ireland are nothing but pirates attempting to pillage as much as they can from the global community." The EU Competition Commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, nailed the corporation and the country to the wall of shame, wrote O’Brien. After investigating Apple’s tax arrangements in Ireland Vestager concluded that Dublin was breaking EU rules by giving state aid to Apple – one of the richest corporations in the world (it’s value is not far off a trillion dollars). The ‘state aid’ that Ms. Vestager referred to is a tax arrangement that allows Apple to avoid paying international tax. The trick is the use of a shell company that is based in Ireland but which is officially ‘stateless’. By directing all the money it makes outside the US into it’s Irish shell company, Apple – thanks to the Irish government – walks away with a tax rate of 0.005%, apart from the token amount it pays to the Irish government at the usual 12.5% rate. So Apple walks away with everything it can get it’s hands on. But since this special tax package is offered ‘only’ to Apple the EU judged it to be a breach of the Union"s competition rules. Ireland has, since 1991, been ‘subsidising’ Apple’s international profits (in October 2015 it recorded an annual profit of $53.4 billion). By offering a phantom address and turning the other way, Ireland is facilitating a world wide tax dodge. And what does Ireland get in return for this? Six thousand Apple jobs. And what can the EU do about it? It is attacking the shell company and demanding that it pay the ‘Irish’ taxes it has been avoiding all these years. The EU calculates an unpaid Apple tax bill of $14.6 billion plus interest (a world record penalty). And Ireland’s response? It claims innocence and doesn’t want any money from Apple! Commented O’Brien: "The irony is that Ireland – a victim of the EU’s extreme financial capitalism – is making the EU look good. Neoliberal Ireland is being called to order by Neoliberal Europe. And Ireland dares to protest even though it has been caught red handed cheating Europe and the world. In the name of competition Europe wants justice. And in the name of globalisation Ireland rejects justice. It’s a right wing joke. It’s a neoliberal farce. But it’s deadly serious too. The issue is taxation. And in the age of austerity this is an explosive subject." The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has been openly targeting tax havens since 2014. When Western governments are bailing out every bank in the Western world – tax avoidance becomes a real issue. The significance of the ruling against Ireland and Apple is that it has set a strong precedent. The EU intends to hit Europe’s tax havens hard. Luxembourg and Holland beware! And the USA? The USA, writes O’Brien, is angry. Because it’s corporations have been caught red-handed. And because its government is controlled by its corporations. The likes of Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Starbucks and McDonalds have lodged themselves into the dark corners of Ireland, Luxembourg and Holland. And are walking away with staggering amounts of untaxed profits! O’Brien suggests Apple may have to add it’s smug wording on the back of it’s products: Designed in California and Assembled in China, but also add: Dodging tax in Ireland. Sociologist Nicki Lisa Cole, who writes about global supply chains and consumer culture, on reading of Apple’s woes in the EU, zeroed in on the website Cult of Mac [dedicated to all things Apple from the fan’s perspective] which had published a piece titled The Biggest Apple Stories of 2013. "The piece is a toast to capitalist greed and the smarmy, self-righteousness of the kings of Silicon Valley. Notably, other important Apple stories, listed below, were not on this list." Sample list: * In July protests at several Apple Stores were organized by Friends of the Earth to spotlight the implications of mining tin in Indonesia. Tin is used for soldering Apple products. Miners have been injured and killed, the silt run-off from mines poses a threat to coral and sea life, and the deforestation that follows increased mining causes acidification of soil, damaging the region’s small farms and rural communities. * Apple continues to come under fire in the US and the UK for its tax dodging scheme, cleverly nicknamed ‘iDodge Tax’ by Irish comedian Mark Thomas. Protesters pointed out that one of Apple’s holding companies, Apple Sales International, paid only 0.0135 percent in tax on its $74 billion in earnings in 2012. * Fueling the ‘Apple Picking’ Phenomenon. Last year Apple spent $1 billion on advertising – a small investment given its brand is valued at over $98 billion – making it the most valuable brand in the world. The iPhone, with its high price point and value as a status symbol, is a lucrative theft target. A stolen iPhone can fetch as much as $200 domestically and far more overseas. Mobile security firm Lookout estimates that the annual value of lost and stolen smartphones is $30 billion. The Federal Communications Committee reported that 1.6 million Americans were robbed of a digital handheld device (smartphone or tablet) in 2012. Statistics from around the country reveal that most of those were Apple iPhones, and that the iPhone fuels the trend. * Reports from Hong Kong-based SACOM (Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour), China Labor Watch, and the newly formed New Generation of Migrant Workers Concern Programme detail systemic labour violations at eleven Chinese Apple suppliers. These reports detail similar problems across suppliers, including very low pay, excessive and forced overtime, up to 14 hour shifts and 100-hour work weeks, standing for 11 hours at a time, increased use of insecure dispatch labourers, employment of underage and forced student workers, a military-style of management with prohibitions on bathroom breaks and inadequate lunch breaks, and unsafe work environments. * In late November SACOM released a report detailing unsafe and sickening work conditions at Biel Crystal’s Huizhou factory, which supplies 60 percent of the glass used in Apple products. Some workers were poisoned due to high levels of acetone vapour in the factory, and some suffered eye injuries due to lack of safety goggles. According to the US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, when not handled properly in unventilated environments acetone can be highly dangerous, causing irritation of the nose, throat, lungs, and eyes, as well as headaches, light-headedness, confusion, increased heart rate, nausea and vomiting, and even fainting and coma. * In December, China Labour Watch announced that three Pegatron Shanghai workers died after working through peak production periods. Shi Zhaokun, 15 years old, succumbed to pneumonia. He was in good health when he passed the company’s physical examination upon his hiring in September. Between then and his death on October 9 he worked 12 hours each day on Apple product lines.      Hits: 439     Send to Friend               Breaking News Await Breaking News Last Updated Nov 19 2016 | 08:09 pm ...   Featured News Comments on Trump –... 2016-11-19 Read More   Harnessing connectivity 2016-11-19 Read More   Indo-Sri Lanka Fishery... 2016-11-19 Read More   Testing the limits of American... 2016-11-19 Read More   Partners in Crime: Apple Inc. and... 2016-11-19 Read More   Life lessons from Medical knight... 2016-11-19 Read More         ARCHIVES RELATED LINKS Sunday, 20th November 2016 [Current Issue] Saturday, 19th November 2016 Friday, 18th November 2016 Thursday, 17th November 2016 Wednesday, 16th November 2016 Tuesday, 15th November 2016 More Archives World Clock Currency Rates Weather     UPALI NEWSPAPERS (PVT) LTD Copyright © Upali Newspapers (Pvt) Ltd.

Saturday, Claridges showed off results of Ive and Newson’s work, reports Wallpaper.com. The two designers collaborated with British set designer Michael Howells to reinterpret the Christmas tree by transforming Claridge’s vast grand lobby into a full-on festive installation comprising of a series of four metre-high digital light boxes on the walls that project black-and-white images of snow-capped silver birch trees. Against this immersive backdrop, towering cast models of Scots pine rise to a canopy of natural green pine. The installation plays forest sounds, starting with a dawn chorus and including owls, nightingales, sparrows and foxes. Specially choreographed lighting is synced to the soundscape to create “a dappled effect in the space, continuously cycling through sunrise to a celestial night scene.” Ive and Newson explain how their festive installation for Claridges explores the relationship between nature and technology: Our aim was to create an all-enveloping magical experience that celebrates our enormous respect for tradition while recognizing our excitement about the future and things to come. There are few things more pure and beautiful than nature, so that was our starting point, layering various iterations of organic forms with technology. The unveiling of the Claridge’s Christmas tree has traditionally heralded the start of London’s festive season. Be sure to check out Claridge’s past Christmas tree collaborations here.

Despite its name, LameXP is not only a front-end for the LAME MP3 encoder, but supports a wide range of output formats, including MP3, Ogg Vorbis, Opus, AAC/MP4, FLAC, AC-3 and Wave Audio. The number of supported input formats is even bigger! Furthermore LameXP not only runs on Windows XP, but also on Windows 7, 8 and 10 as well as many other operating systems.

Iron Man Gets The Logan Trailer Treatment Matthew Mueller - 11/19/2016 2 comments share Newsletter Share on Facebook Tweet This Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Pin to Pinterest Start Photo Gallery Back to Article Image of Johnny Cash's classic song Hurt thankfully replaced "Pen Pineapple Apple Pen" as the defacto song of 2016, mostly due to its effective use during the premiere trailer of James Mangold's Logan. Now the song is being paired with a variety of other superhero films, with the latest beneficiary being Tony Stark. YouTube user DrFlashPoint has blended the three core Iron Man films along with a few snippets from Captain America: Civil War with the Logan backing track. As with the Superman (Kent) trailer before it, it delivers best when the footage matches the sorrowful tones of Cash's voice, something that the Logan trailer embodies all throughout. The best moments come from the beginnings of the original Iron Man, where Tony is being held captive and is trying to survive by building his first piece of armor. There are some great quotes from Stark (played by Robert Downey Jr.) throughout the trailer, but Stark's delivery is less guttural than Logan and Xavier's, so it doesn't hit as hard. The other highlights are actually from Captain America: Civil War, which is used to bring the trailer to a close, and done so quite effectively. The biggest disconnect is the polish and sheen of Tony's world, which doesn't work quite as well as Logan's barren wasteland, harsh circumstances, and brooding characters. Still, it's an impressive job by DrFlashPoint, who managed to assemble some great footage from what was there. You can find more of DrFlashPoint's work on YouTube, and if you're interested in more Logan-inspired trailers, make sure to check out some of the other examples listed below. Logan takes place in the year 2024, where mutant births have become extremely rare. The defenders of mutantkind, the X-Men, are long gone, and the only remains of them are an old and struggling Charles Xavier and a weary Logan. Logan's vaunted healing factor has slowed, and at times doesn't seem to work at all. When a young mutant needs his help, Logan has to unsheathe his claws once more. His job isn't over yet.

Search Main menu Skip to primary content Post navigation ← Previous Programmed my first Alexa skill: I was shocked by what I found! Posted on November 19, 2016 by larry Although I am pretty deeply entrenched in the Apple ecosystem, the recently-announced $50 Dot was so inexpensive I could not resist checking it out. (Before I go further: I work for Microsoft, so take that into account as you see fit.) Out of the box, the Echo is very easy to setup for basic queries “Alexa, what’s my latitude and longitude?” and so forth. The Echo has a relatively lo-fi speaker and the integration with Sonos (what Amazon calls an “Alexa Skill”) is not yet available, so I haven’t used it all that much. But there’s an API so you know I had to program something. My preferred solution for “computations in the cloud” is definitely Azure Functions written in F#, but for my first Alexa Skill I used Amazon Lambda running Python. The first thing to focus on is that Alexa Skills are a separate service that can be programmed many ways, so there’s always going to be a certain amount of integration overhead in the form of multiple tabs open, jumping back and forth between the Alexa Skills and the Web server/service where you are handling the computation. The Alexa Skills documentation is good, but there’s a good number of parts and I think it’s wise to write your first skill using Amazon Lambda, as I did. Amazon Lambda is often the default service in the documentation and there are often hyperlinks to the Lambda-specific page to do “X.” A Skill for Gravity A friend was talking to me about riflery and astonishing me with the flight times he was talking about. Alexa failed to answer some basic questions about ballistics (Alexa seems to me less capable than Google Assistant, Cortana, or Siri at answering freeform questions), offering me the perfect simple use-case for my first skill. Minimum viable query: "What is the speed of an object that has fallen for 1.5 seconds?" SWAG achievable: "How long would it take for an object dropped from the height of the Empire State Building to fall to the ground on Mars?" The nice thing about my minimal query is that it’s both stateless and easy to answer with some math: all you need to answer is the duration of the drop and use a gravitational constant of -9.81. (Conversions from meters/second can come later.) I followed the documentation on building an Alexa skill with a Lambda function to create an Alexa Skill named called “Gravity.” After naming, the next page of the Skill development site is “Interaction Model.” This is where I was shocked to discover: Alexa doesn’t do natural language processing! I ASS-U-ME’d that I would be receiving some programmatic structure that told me the “nominal subject” of the sentence was the noun speed and would allow me to search for a “prepositional modifier” whose “object” was the noun seconds and extract its modifier. That would allow me to recognize either of these sentences: What is the speed of an object that has fallen for 1.5 seconds?; or What's the velocity of an apple after after 1.5 seconds? Or any of a large number of other sentences. Foxtype will show you such parsing in action at this (fascinating) page. But no! As you can see in the screenshot below, the mapping of a recognized sentence to a programmatic “intent” is nothing but a string template! You either have to anticipate every single supported structure or you have to use wildcards and roll your own. (Honestly, I imagine that it’s not a long road before the wisest interaction model is Parse {utterance}.) To be clear: ‘just’ voice recognition is extraordinarily hard and doing it in ambient environmental noise is insane. It’s only because Alexa already does this very, very hard task that it’s surprising to me that they don’t provide for some amount of the (also hard) task of parsing. The upside, of course, is that sound-&gt;utterance is decoupled from utterance-&gt;sentence. As far as I know, no one today provides “NLP as a Service” but it’s easy to imagine. (Although latency… Nope, nope, staying on topic…) Returning to the screenshot above, you can see that it contains the bracketed template {duration}. The matching value will be associated with the key duration in calls to the Lambda function. And, to be honest, it’s a place where Alexa Kit does do some NLP. You can help Alexa by specifying the type of the variables in your template text. For instance, I specified the duration variable as a NUMBER. Alexa does use NLP to transform the utterances meaningfully — so “one and a half” becomes “1.5” and so forth. I haven’t really explored the extent of this — does it turn “the Tuesday after New Year’s Day” into a well-formed date and so forth? Alexa packages session data relating to an ongoing conversation and intent data and performs an RPC-like call (I actually don’t know the details) to the endpoint of your choice. In the case of Amazon Lambda, that’s the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your function. The data structures it passes look like this: 
{
  "session": {
    "sessionId": "SessionId.07dc1151-eb4e-4e12-98fa-64af3f59d82a",
    "application": {
      "applicationId": "amzn1.ask.skill.443f7cb5-ETC-dbecb288ff2d"
    },
    "attributes": {},
    "user": {
      "userId": "amzn1.ask.account.ETC"
    },
    "new": true
  },
  "request": {
    "type": "IntentRequest",
    "requestId": "EdwRequestId.13cf7a2b-0789-4244-879f-f4fae08f315f",
    "locale": "en-US",
    "timestamp": "2016-11-18T17:24:09Z",
    "intent": {
      "name": "FallingSpeedIntent",
      "slots": {
        "duration": {
          "name": "duration",
          "value": "1.5"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "version": "1.0"
}
 The values in the session object relate to a conversation and the values in the request object belong to a specific intent — in this case the FallingSpeedIntent with the duration argument set to “1.5”. On the Lambda side of things Amazon Lambda has a template function called ColorIs that provides an easy starting point. It supports session data, which my Gravity skill doesn’t require, so I actually ended up mostly deleting code (always my favorite thing). Given the JSON above, here’s how I route the request to a specific function: 
def on_intent(intent_request, session):
""" Called when the user specifies an intent for this skill """

print("on_intent requestId=" + intent_request['requestId'] +
", sessionId=" + session['sessionId'])

intent = intent_request['intent']
intent_name = intent_request['intent']['name']

# Dispatch to your skill's intent handlers
if intent_name == "FallingSpeedIntent" :
return get_falling_speed(intent, session)

def get_falling_speed(intent, session):
session_attributes = {}
reprompt_text = None
should_end_session = True

g = -9.82 #meters per second squared

if "duration" in intent['slots']:
duration = float(intent['slots']['duration']['value'])
velocity = g * duration**2

speech_output = "At the end of " + str(duration) + " seconds, an object will be falling at " + ('%.1f' % velocity) + " meters per second. " + \
"Goodbye."
else:
speech_output = "Pretty fast I guess."

return build_response(session_attributes, build_speechlet_response(
intent['name'], speech_output, reprompt_text, should_end_session))

Tech Insider BI Intelligence Events Trending Tech Insider Finance Politics Strategy Life Sports Video All × From To You have successfully emailed the post. 25 essential tips and tricks for Mac owners Jeff Dunn Nov. 19, 2016, 12:04 PM 160,565 facebook linkedin twitter email print A guest points to a new MacBook Pro during an Apple media event in Cupertino.Reuters/Beck Diefenbach Apple has some new MacBook Pros. They're certainly expensive, and lots of professionals aren't thrilled with them, but when it comes down to it, they're great laptops for most people.  Regardless of what critics say, though, this is Apple. That means people are going to buy these things. And since these are the most significant refreshes to come to the Mac lineup in years, they're likely to reel in more than a few newcomers to macOS. If you're one of these Mac newbies — or if you're just coming back from a long Windows vacation— we've rounded up 25 handy, not-totally-obvious tricks to help you get the most out of your new Mac platform.  View As: One Page Slides 1. The simplest, and most common, way to speed up your Mac usage is utilize Spotlight. Get there by hitting Command + Space, and you can quickly find files, open apps, search the web, and make system-wide searches. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn 2. You can also use Spotlight as a calculator, or have it make currency conversions. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn 3. If you ever lose your mouse in a sea of windows onscreen, just shake it, and the cursor will automatically enlarge. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn 4. Inevitably your Mac will freeze up and force you to quit some apps. There's no "Ctrl Alt Delete" here — instead, you hit Command + Option + Escape to shut tasks down the hard way. This is a bit faster than right-clicking on each troublesome app yourself. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn 5. You delete files on Mac by sending them to the Trash. Many people do this by manually dragging each file to the little Trash icon. If you want to go a little faster, though, just select a file, and hit Command + Delete. 6. Taking a screenshot on Mac is just cleaner than it is on Windows. At any point, hit Command + Shift + 3 to capture the whole screen, or Command + Shift + 4 to capture a custom portion of the display. 7. You can move windows without bringing them to the foreground by holding Command as you drag it around. This may not be crucial, but a click saved can always be appreciated. 8. If you ever feel like changing which apps load whenever you boot up your Mac, you can go to System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items, then add, check, and uncheck whatever you want to prioritize. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn 9. Whenever you need an accent mark (or related foreign character), just hold down the appropriate letter, and a list of relevant options will pop up. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn 10. We've all had those moments where there's a certain word you want to write, but can't quite remember what it is. If you know you're close, though, just hit Fn + F5 as you're typing something, and you'll get a list of similar words right then and there. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn 11. See a word you're not familiar with? If you highlight it and hit Command + Control + D, you can get dictionary definitions and Wikipedia info without having to leave your page. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn 12. If you frequently pair Bluetooth headphones with your Mac, at some point you'll have a moment where your music blares from the Mac's speakers instead of your cans. This'll force you to dig into your settings and change your audio output source. To make that process less annoying, go to System Preferences > Sound and check off "show sound in menu bar." You can then change the volume from said menu bar, and hold Option while clicking on the icon to quickly change the source. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn 13. Speaking of the menu bar: It's a powerful tool, but it does eat up screen space. If you want that space back, you can make it so the menu bar only shows up when you scroll toward it. To do so, go to System Preferences > General, then click "Automatically hide and show the menu bar." Business Insider/Jeff Dunn 14. If you do keep the menu bar around, though, you can rearrange the icons within it by holding Command and dragging them around. You can also use this to remove certain icons off the menu bar completely. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn 15. If you're only working on a couple of things, you can take them into a cleaner, Split View layout by holding down the rightmost (or green) button at the top of a given window. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn 16. It won't be for everyone, but the built-in "Hot Corners" setting lets you clear the windows off your desktop, open the Mission Control page, or set your display to sleep, among other tricks, just by moving your mouse to a certain corner of the page. You can experiment and see if it'd speed up your workflow by going to System Preferences > Mission Control, and selecting "Hot Corners..." at the bottom. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn 17. This isn't necessarily a pro tip, but generally speaking, don't sleep on Preview. Apple's built-in image editor is one of the most underappreciated aspects of macOS. If you need to resize, annotate, or change file type for your images, just know that you may not have to buy Photoshop. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn 18. Along those same lines, make use of Apple's QuickTime Player. If you need to record whatever audio or video is playing on your screen, for instance, you don't need to download any third-party software. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn 19. If you want to adjust your Mac's volume, but only by a little bit, hold Shift + Option as you hit the Volume Up or Down buttons. This will change it in smaller increments. You can get similarly granular control with your screen's brightness, too. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn 20. You can also take more control of how you resize windows. Instead of taking two swipes to stretch something horizontally and vertically, you can hold Option + Shift while you resize, which lets the whole thing grow and shrink proportionally at once. It's a minor thing, admittedly, but it's another way to save time. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn 21. Another minor, but useful thing: In Finder, you can rename files and photos in bulk, rather than changing each one manually. Just highlight what you need, right click, select "Rename [X] items...", and enter your new info into the naming tool that pops up. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn 22. You can also create custom keyboard shortcuts for certain apps. Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts, click the "+" icon to add an app, then add your shortcut function and corresponding keypress from there. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn 23. The latest macOS Sierra update put Apple's Siri voice assistant on the desktop. It's weirdly similar to Spotlight today, and it's still incredibly awkward to converse with in public, but it works for voice searching the web, finding photos, or looking through files and messages. You can see it in the dock or menu bar. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn 24. The other semi-useful addition built into Sierra is a picture-in-picture mode. It only works with Safari, and not every video site supports it, but when it works, it can help maximize your space. Just know that it's not immediately visible on YouTube — there, you have to right click on a video twice to bring up the option. Screenshot/Tech Insider The third splashy feature of macOS Sierra is "optimized storage," which lets you save space on your Mac by letting Apple automatically send unused files to iCloud. This is very useful in theory, but having to pay for iCloud isn't, and the feature itself will sometimes delete things you don't necessarily want to lose. For now, I'd pass. 25. Let's close with every Mac nerd's best friend: Terminal. Though macOS is pretty fast on its own, a few changes to your system's animations can make the whole thing feel just a little bit quicker. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn As IBM developer Patrick Mullins notes, you can disable window opening and closing animations by entering "defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSAutomaticWindowAnimationsEnabled -bool false", or cut off animations when opening an app from the dock with "defaults write com.apple.dock launchanim -bool false." There are others, but just be sure you know what you're entering before going too wild with your system.  SEE ALSO: Don't buy the MacBook Air More: Tech Gadgets macOS Apple MacBook Pro Mac Software Tips and tricks Laptops OS facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru 25 essential tips and tricks for Mac owners 25 essential tips and tricks for Mac owners Apple has some new MacBook Pros.

The iPhone 8, Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6 are just some of them.  ( Chris McGrath | Getty Images ) Advertisement Even as holiday shoppers gear up for some fantastic discounts on smartphones this Thanksgiving, they may wonder if they should buy the current-gen models now at a discount or wait for the next-gen impending handsets. We take a look at some of the best upcoming smartphones in 2017 — the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, One Plus 4, LG G6, Galaxy Note 8 and Galaxy S8. iPhone 8 And iPhone 8 Plus The 4.7-inch iPhone 8 and 5.5-inch iPhone 8 Plus are expected to debut in the second half of 2017 and will house several firsts per rumors. The next-gen iPhone — the tenth anniversary special — is speculated to have an OLED screen instead of the LCD one. The display is rumored to be a curved one. It is also anticipated to offer support for wireless charging and may have an iris scanner, as well as lose a Home button. The iPhone 8 is also tipped to house a faster A11 processor, but the chip will not be produced by Samsung but TSMC. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are also rumored to boast a new form factor — no bezels and curved edges. The devices are also said to tout an all-glass back. A new patent also hinted at the possibility of the next-gen iPhones offering support for gesture control. Samsung Galaxy S8 Rumors pertaining to Samsung's next flagship have been surfacing online for a while now. The Galaxy S8 — the successor of the Galaxy S7 — has apparently been given the codename Dream. However, unlike its predecessor, the Galaxy S8 will be available in a curved screen option alone. The handset is anticipated to tout a 4K screen, a pixel density of 806 ppi and may pack in a 10nm Exynos 8895 SoC. The Galaxy S8 could possibly include the Mali-G71 GPU from ARM. The smartphone may also offer support for Force Touch display and its very own AI assistant called Bixby. The Galaxy S8 is also expected to have no Home button. The smartphone is said to have a "slick design" and a new camera as affirmed by the company's vice president. The Galaxy S8 may also have an optical fingerprint scanner embedded into the device's home screen. The Galaxy S8 is expected to make its appearance in February 2017 at the MWC. The latest buzz is that the smartphone will come in two sizes — a 5.7-inch and a 6.2-inch version to win back Galaxy Note 7 customers. OnePlus 4 Another much-awaited handset in 2017 is the OnePlus 4 which is rumored to sport a 5.5-inch OLED screen which may be a flexible one. The resolution of the display will be an improvement from the OnePlus 3 and is rumored to be 2,560 x 1,440 pixels. The OnePlus 4 will offer support for NFC and house a Snapdragon 830 CPU, as well as 8 GB of RAM. Rumors hint at either a 21 MP or 23 MP primary snapper and either a 16 MP or 12 MP selfie camera. It may have a dual-camera setup with AR/MR support. The OnePlus 4 will apparently offer 128 GB of on-board storage, as well as microSD support (256 GB). The handset will apparently come with Oxygen OS with Android Nougat out of the box. The OnePlus 4 is rumored to debut in April or May 2017. Samsung Galaxy Note 8 The debacle of its Galaxy Note 7 notwithstanding, Samsung is forging ahead to redeem itself with the next-gen Galaxy Note 8. The company has already supposedly got LG on board to make the batteries for its Galaxy S8 and could take the same route for the Galaxy Note 8. Like the Galaxy Note 7, the successor will apparently tout a 5.7-inch screen but with a 4K display. Under the hood, the Galaxy Note 8 may house either the impending Snapdragon 830 CPU or the Exynos 8895 processor. While the Note 7 housed 4 GB of RAM, consumers would be hoping for a bump up to 6 GB or 8 GB of RAM. The handset will likely offer support for fingerprint and iris scanners as well. The Galaxy Note 8 may also house its speaker in the S Pen stylus per a new patent. The Galaxy Note 8 is expected to debut in the second half of 2017. LG G6 The LG G6 — the successor of the LG G5 — is rumored to come with a 4K display, but may stick to the 5.3-inch screen size. It too was said to be packing in a curved OLED screen instead of LCD, which seems to be the new trend for 2017 smartphones, but reports suggested that it had canceled the plans. The LG G6 is also rumored to be discarding the modular design it used for the LG G5. A new and exciting feature for the LG G6 is the iris scanner, which will be welcomed by users. Under the hood, it could house the Snapdragon 830 CPU and 6 GB of RAM. It will likely come with a bigger battery, a dual-camera setup like the LG G5 and Android Nougat. The LG G6 is expected to be unveiled at the MWC 2017 in February and may hit the shelves a month later.

Digitize Physical Prints With Google's New PhotoScan App With Google's new PhotoScan app, one can digitize their physical photos at home using only the standard smartphone camera. It's not quite up to par with a scanner, but it's a substantial improvement upon snapping a photo of a photo and cropping. Using four points on the hard image, the app initiates a more accurate, thorough capture. Additionally, the Google Photos app also received an upgrade with an array of "pro editor" options including exposure, highlights and shadows features. 2. Surreal and Gorgeous Car Images in Palm Springs Arguably the most beautiful Porsche 911 Carrera model, the 1973 iteration has been manipulated for artist Chris Labrooy's surreal, candy-colored "911" series. Each modified piece sees a 911 (or several) placed in unlikely scenes in sunny Palm Springs—with plenty of the city's stunning mid-century architecture included. Labrooy successfully takes a few of our favorite things, morphs them, and makes a combination that's a veritable feast for the eyes. See more at designboom. 3. Designing for Social Reform After the recent election results, many people in the creative community have voiced their determination to work with and for organizations that will need the most help. As FastCo's Meg Miller says, "With a Trump presidency, using design in support of social progress will be more important than ever." From Jennifer Kinon (design director for the Hillary for America campaign) to Jessica Hische (type designer and illustrator), Miller reached out to several design leaders to find out about next steps. Read more at Fast Co. 4. Anger vs Hate While it's perfectly healthy and natural to be angry, NYC-based holistic psychiatrist Meredith Bergman says it's time to slow down and reflect when that anger starts morphing into hatred. This isn't just for your mental health, but your physical wellbeing too: "Doctors say a burst of cortisol (the stress hormone) from negative emotions can trigger inflammation in the body, which is linked to health problems like cancer, heart disease and autoimmune disorders." So in order to keep angry and aware, but not slip into a negative and unhealthy state, head to Well and Good for some tips. 5. New Photo Book Showcases 20 Years of Apple Design From 1998's iMac (remember that one?) to 2015's Apple Pencil, the new hardcover book "Designed by Apple in California" celebrates and explores 20 years of Apple-designed products. Shot by photographer Andrew Zuckerman, each of the 450 images delves into not only the finished product, but also the intense design process. Like its current devices, the photographs are minimal and sleek—the ideal way to demonstrate all the ins and outs of the designs. Available today, the book comes in two sizes—small and large—and costs $199 or $299 respectively. 6. Vale, David Mancuso, DJ and Dance Culture Legend Dance culture pioneer, DJ and The Loft founder, David Mancuso has passed away at age 72. Not only was The Loft considered NYC's first underground dance party, Mancuso was determined to make it a safe and welcoming place for everybody. He told Red Bull Music Academy back in 2013, "The core [idea behind The Loft] is social progress. How much social progress can there be when you're in a situation that is repressive? You won't get much social progress in a nightclub. In New York City they changed the law [for entry into clubs, from] 18 to 21 years old; where can this age group go to dance? In my zone, you can be any age, a drinker or non-drinker, a smoker or a non-smoker. And that's where I like to be." There are several uplifting live mixes by Mancuso online, which we recommend listening to. And you can read more about him at The Guardian. 7. Tinder Allowing More Gender Options In a blog post from Tinder yesterday, the dating app announced it's introducing more gender options for users—meaning everybody can identify authentically. In the post, the company outlines just how easy it is: "When you tap 'I Am' and select 'More' you can type a word that describes your gender identity. You can also select to be shown in searches which best reflect your identity." Acknowledging that the app hasn't had enough tools to be inclusive before, the team at Tinder says that while they haven't been perfect, they are continuing to learn and grow—and want to make everybody welcome. 8. 2016 Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards Winners Whether it's a bear completely missing his prey, a grinning zebra or a fox diving head-first into snow, the 2016 Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards winners are guaranteed to deliver good cheer. This year's awards saw around 2,200 submissions from all over the world, and the winners (and finalists) are worth a look. There are many notable images but the pelican's look of shock as it drops a fish from its beak is particularly amusing—and poignant. See more at The Washington Post.

As has been reported, and even mocked by the president and Grand Theft Auto, Samsung has been the champion of flamable phones for the past few months. Samsung has been an innovator in how to leave their users with burns thanks to the explosive Galaxy Note 7 smartphone. via GIPHY That was until the Silicon Valley stalwart Apple has had their say. After falling asleep watching a movie on her iPhone 7, a pregnant Australian woman awoke to several “superficial” burns on her arm, leaving “an imprint of the phone and charger etched into her skin,” according to Metro. While she’s probably relieved that the phone didn’t blowup, Melanie Tan Pelaez did claim to also “experience sudden pain, pins and needles, numbness and shortness of breath.” Genius Bar can’t fix that. The burns, Pelaez was told, wouldn’t be covered under the warranty, as Apple “allegedly denied that the phone was to blame ‘as it didn’t have a distinct smell’ and told her the phone usually shuts down if overheating occurs.” The phone has since been sent to California for testing. Hey, if it doesn’t smell like an Apple burn, it’s not an Apple burn. Now, let’s see Samsung build an explosion with a signature smell.

Monday, November 21, 2016 Facebook Twitter RSS Navigate Home News Opinion Regions World Sports Business Special Features SPECIAL REPORTS The Sunday Times You are at:Home»Weekly»The Sunday Times Magazine»Janine Tugonon spreads her wings Janine Tugonon spreads her wings 1 By CARLA BIANCA RAVANES-HIGHAM on November 19, 2016 The Sunday Times Magazine Tweet It was the year 2012, and just like clockwork, the nation tuned into their televisions in the middle of the day to cheer on the Philippines’ candidate to the Miss Universe pageant. She may not have won the crown that year—albeit landing an impressive first-runner up finish—but four years later, she would bring pride to her country all the same, gaining wings and flying high all on her own in the Big Apple. From the Universe to NYC New York City is filled with beautiful people, and right smack in the middle of this pulsating vibe is the Filipina runner-up of Miss Universe 2012, Janine Tugnon. Now 27 years old, the former beauty queen exudes a different kind of confidence. It is the kind of confidence that belongs to someone who has seen the world, and because of it, developed a depth that wasn’t quite there before. This, despite the fact that she has had her share of notable achievements even before she decided to move to the United States in 2013. It was the year 2012 when the nation tuned into their televisions to cheer for Janine Tugonon, the Philippines’ candidate to the Miss Universe pageant AFP FILE PHOTO To be sure, Tugonon knows what it feels to succeed. A consistent honor student since her elementary days, she was crowned Bb. Pilipinas-Universe shortly after graduating Cum Laude as a Pharmacy major at the University of Sto. Tomas. Diverted by the beauty queen path from her college degree, she found herself uncertain what to do next with only a first runner-up sash from Miss Universe to her name. “I consider that phase of my life as a transition period. I steered away from the plan I created for myself and ventured into [what I felt]was God’s plan and purpose for me,” recalled Tugonon in this one-on-one interview with The Sunday Times Magazine. “I remember being so raw and new in the [modeling]industry. I have always been known to speak my mind, and I learned the hard way there’s a downside to that, especially in this industry. I was overwhelmed at that time yet I knew in my heart that I had to keep going.” Criticized and bashed for her bold move, Tugonon also learned through this time to keep her head up no matter what. “I’m the type of person who forgets criticism, which is good. I don’t focus on the negative and instead choose to focus on people who encourage, help, and support me. I just work hard and try to offer words of love, life, and encouragement.” Crossing oceans Tugonon says she has always wanted to live somewhere in the West, growing up watching American shows, curious what it would be like to live there “I have always wanted to live somewhere in the West,” shared Tugonon of her decision to try her luck abroad. “I grew up watching American shows and I was always curious what it was like to live there. It was my mom who saw the scholarship offered by Miss Universe for the New York Film Academy, and with her encouragement, I decided to fly across the world to pursue my interest in acting.” With a dream in her heart and an unwavering faith that she will be guided by the heavens, Janine took on her life’s biggest adventure. Besides studying, she also pursued modeling, which initially she thought would be easy. She humbly confessed, however, “When I started modeling, I thought I was going to book a lot of jobs constantly. Because to be honest, Filipina beauty is appreciated everywhere, most especially in the States. Even people in the streets would be quick to approach you to say so but in the first weeks after signing with my agency, I wasn’t getting the jobs. I was worried my agent would drop me.” Luckily, her agent, Francis Arden believed in her spirit and kept her on, but all the same, the usually optimistic young lady still felt dejected. “I was thinking that there was something wrong with me because I wasn’t booking jobs. I focused instead on losing weight while figuring out the modeling industry. It was extremely frustrating, but eventually patience paid off, and the projects became more consistent. They weren’t huge jobs, mind you, but enough to tide me over—to pay the bills, and the rent.” Frugal with money, she sustained herself through her time in New York and stints in Los Angeles. Soon enough, Tugonon became the face for many US brands including Wells Fargo, Walmart, and Kohl’s. It was in August this year that Janine Tugonon became the very first Filipina model to join the exclusive clique of Victoria Secret Angels through a 50-seconder online ad known as ‘VS Pink’ Asked how she overcame rejections before her modelling career finally picked up, she replied, “The idea of doing something else kills me. I knew this was what I wanted to pursue, and while there were days questioned it—when I didn’t have jobs lined up—something came up soon enough. The Provider provides if you’re on the right track, you just have to trust Him.” The determined lady also credits a strong support system for seeing her through her toughest times, like her friend Rasec Marc Ortega who pushed her to keep going. “He just told me, ‘Keep at it, keep at it.’ There are people placed in your life for a reason. Keep them, love them, and support them too.” Most of all, Tugonon believes her faith was her strongest and most effective shield from giving up. “Faith is everything. Without it, I would have given up a long time ago. I never liked rejections. I grew up an achiever and was a consistent honor student, so imagine how I feel about rejection. It’s discouraging, but the thing is, when God puts something in your heart, like I said the Provider provides, even in the most challenging moments. And while He won’t give it quickly, because He is building your character to prepare you for what He has in store, He is always there for you.” She is grateful for the challenges that taught her the virtue of humility. “I realized it’s because of Him that I am where I am.” Winged woman Besides studying acting at the New York Film Academy— under a scholarship— Tugonon pursued modeling It was in August this year that Janine Tugonon became the very first Filipina model to join the exclusive clique of Victoria Secret Angels. She appeared in a 50-seconder online ad known as “VS Pink.” She said of her big break, “It felt really great and I will be forever grateful to the team [behind the project]. It is one of those ads that you think is a stepping stone to something more, and true enough they called me for the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show casting.” Despite missing the cut, Tugonon served as an inspiration to Filipinas who hope to break through the international modeling scene. And like she said, when something you hope for does not happen at first, it only means “the Provider” has a different plan for you. Sure enough, she was chosen as one of the 12 winners of the annual search for the Nu Muses Calendar, which gave her the opportunity to work with renowned French fashion photographer David Bellemere whose works fill the pages of Vogue Paris, Marie Claire Italy, Nippon Vogue, and Elle USA to name a few. Her shoot for the calendar in the Dominican Republic was only the beginning of this exciting project, which has taken Tugonon back home to Manila. Apparently, each of the 12 featured models will be filmed in their home country as part of an exclusive documentary, and the beautiful balikbayan is now here for her part of it. According to Tugonon, both the docu and the calendar will be launched at Art Basil in Miami, after which she and the other featured models will be given the chance to grace the covers of international glossy magazines. It was the smart lady’s definition of timeless beauty, which landed her a place among the 12 winners. Tugonon said, “The question to define timeless beauty was actually tough. But as cliché as it may sound, I said beauty comes from within and it’s true. If we fill our minds with comparison, insecurities, hatred, it will reflect in our overall aura and how we deal with people. Inner peace and security goes a long way.” She also said that Filipinas stand out among women around the world “because our beauty is unique, and because of our good work ethic.” Janine today Tugonon is happily busy these days—thriving in a career she continues to work hard for. Not one to forget her beauty queen roots, Tugonon was spotted twice bonding with her Miss Universe Philippines successors, Miss Universe 2015 Pia Wurtzbach (topmost) and Miss Universe Philippines 2016 Maxine Medina (above) “I’ve taken a part time job in a clothing store at night, while I continue to pursue modeling,” she humbly said. “I don’t consider myself ‘there’ yet but I thank God for the projects that are coming. I won’t have to worry about rent for the next few months!” she added laughing. “But there’s more work to be done—I’m just hopeful, expectant, and positive.” When asked what her advice is to women who are passionate about their dreams, she replied, “First, never compare. Each and everyone has a purpose. There are different routes for different people. Never compare your journey to another person’s journey. Just stay on your path because comparing makes you lose sight of where you’re going. “Comparing ourselves leads to doubt, anger, and jealousy and we become discouraged and insecure,” she continued. “This is where crab mentality stems from. We all have a different and unique purpose so once you find that purpose, never give up, just keep at it. “It’s not going to be easy, there will be pain and heartaches but you have to keep running your race. Work hard and strive for excellence. Don’t settle, and be the best you can be. Be right with people, have fun through the journey, and have faith you’ll be fine.” Finally asked to describe Janine Tugonon today, she declared, “I am more confident and convinced that this is the path I was made to take. When I was younger, I was hesitant and terrified to pursue it. Now, I am more focused on what the Lord has planned for me.” Share.

He is shown here in his studio with one of the works heading to the Big Apple. Pictures by Rob Lock 13:00 Friday 18 November 2016 3 Have your say It’s a race against time for a Blackpool artist looking to take his work on tour with a big trip to the Big Apple. Screen painter Robin Ross has the opportunity of a lifetime to put his prints on display in an art cafe in Brooklyn, New York next year. Robin pictured outside The Old Rock Factory But there’s a catch. The artist, whose studio is based at The Old Rock Factory, Deansgate, has just 30 days to raise £1,500 and is relying on crowd-funding to make his dream happen. The pressure isn’t putting him off though. In fact, he’s looking forward to the challenge. “It has taken me nine years to get where I am now and there are a lot of exciting times ahead,” he said. “I’m having a ball.” It has taken me nine years to get where I am now and there are a lot of exciting times ahead Mr Ross has set up a crowd-funding page online, where investors can contribute in return for a limited edition print. And he’s delighted with the response to his entrepreneurial endeavours so far. He said: “Within four days of asking for help, I have already made half of what I need to make it to Brooklyn. “People have to pay £25 to sponsor me and with that they get a special limited edition print of my work. “If I only get 50 sponsors then there will only ever be 50 prints of that piece. Robin pictured in his studio working on a screen print “So in a way they are getting a lot more than what they’re giving.” Mr Ross has previously visited some of his New York heroes and that was what inspired him to take his work overseas. He said: “Going to New York made me want to get my art displayed there and I thought that it would be a great opportunity for me to start to show people that Blackpool has an exploding arts scene.” The exhibition will be featuring original prints of Blackpool, Cuba, New York and several other places he has visited. Mr Ross added: “I’ve travelled a lot but everywhere I go I always talk about Blackpool. It’s refreshing to see its art scene growing so much independently without massive amounts of money going into it.” Even though he is relying on funding, with more than £600 still needed before he hits his target, Mr Ross has already planned out the launch night for the event. “I want to provide tea and biscuits and even take some Blackpool rock there,” he said. Before focussing on his art, Mr Ross enjoyed a colourful career that included making contact lenses in St Annes and becoming a presenter on offshore radio station Radio Caroline. He has also put on the Sand Sea and Spray festival, an event for street artists to congregate in Blackpool and turn blank walls into pieces of art. ◘ For more information and to contribute to the crowdfunding venture, visit www.kickstarter.com/projects.

Customers who are looking to buy both can now save up to Rs 23000 as cashback, meaning the price of the base model of the handset comes down to Rs 37000. The combo offer goes both ways. A person could buy an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus and get a discount on purchase of an iPad of their choice, or buy an iPad and get cashback on the smartphones. The main guiding principle here is that they have to buy both on the same day, from the same store, using the same card and mobile number. As for limitations, the deal is only available via select offline Apple resellers and accessible by Citibank credit card customers. It’s not open to Citibank Corporate credit card holders. The offer has already begun and will go on till 31 December. People can perform a maximum of 4 transactions, with a limit of 2 each month.

They’ll get Rs 18000 if they purchase an iPad Air 2 and Rs 17000 if they snap up an iPad mini 2 or iPad mini 4. There are also in-store discounts on hand namely Rs 2800 for the iPad mini 2, Rs 2900 for the iPad Air 2, and Rs 5900 for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Citibank is supposed to give the cashback amount in two entries within 90 days of utilizing the iPhone-iPad combo deal. You can check out the list of participating stores here.

At the recent investor's conference, post announcement of its quaterly results, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the company is excited about its India investments. Cook said that the past year has seen iPhone sales growing at a fast clip in India. "Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface of this large and growing market opportunity," he said. The Apple CEO further added that he is confident that he can turn India into as big an opportunity as China is for Apple. He emphasized that India's "very, very young population" holds tremendous advantages for the company. "The truth is there's going to be a lot of people there and a lot of people in the middle class that will really want a smartphone, and I think we can compete well for some percentage of those. And Given our starting point, even though we've been growing a lot, there's a lot of headroom there in our mind. So, we're working very hard to realize that opportunity," Cook told mediamen and investors.

Half of the nation reveal they always manage to find a bargain over the Black Friday and Cyber Monday period with 8% having saved up just for the occasion - and the average shopper set to spend £227 in 2016. But, this year experts are calling for consumers to be extra cautious over their spending, after hundreds of Black Friday 2015 deals were exposed as misleading - with questionable promotions being advertised at a number of known high street stores. Here's how to make sure you stay safe - don't get ripped off - and stay within budget this Black Friday. If you are going all out next week, it could be time to get your shopping list in check, to avoid any over-spending. In fact, retailers like Amazon, Tesco Direct and Argos have already released their deals early. And as you'd expect, such spending will give the economy a good end-of-year boost, with the high street expected to cash in an astonishing £5 billion this year according to GoCompare - that's five times last year's splurge - with shoppers on average set to spend between £175 and £227 each on Black Friday. National retail chain The Original Factory Shop (TOFS) polled over 2,000 people to reveal 5% will stay up into the night waiting online for the deals to go live - that's around 3 million shoppers in Britain. Hannah Legg, Marketing and Multichannel Director at TOFS, says: "Last year we recognised the importance of Black Friday for our customers and decided to offer five days of exclusive deals instead of just one. "Customers responded well so this year we’re launching our ‘Black Fivedays’ event for a second year running." poll loading Will you be shopping on Black Friday? 500+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO Managing Director of Nectar, James Moir says: “In the past few years we’ve seen a monumental shift in the way people go about their Christmas shopping. Consumers are becoming increasingly determined to hold off on any planned purchases in the hope of getting a better deal on Black Friday." "On 25 November, Nectar cardholders will find Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers online with eBay, Debenhams, ASOS and Apple to name just a few. All you need is a card to take advantage of the deals." Read More Apple Black Friday 2016 deals: Best discounts and how to save on iPhones, MacBooks, iPads and more in the sales With the shopping frenzy set to stir the entire country come Black Friday, Londoners have been revealed as the biggest bargain hunters, hoping to save £489, followed closely by northerners, who want to save £463 on average. Katie Thompson, a copy writer from York is a deal hunter planning to make huge savings by doing all her Christmas shopping this Black Friday. She says: “I have a huge family, so whilst Christmas is always a really fun time, it also means I have a long list of presents to buy. I love Black Friday for helping me to bring those Christmas costs down. “In the past I’ve spent around £1,000 on presents, but now I save at least half of that which is massive. It also means I get myself organised before December even begins so I can enjoy the festive season without the stress of last minute grabs for expensive gifts!" Top 10 Black Friday 2016 retailers to watch A survey by YouGov reveals that almost three in ten Brits shopping on Black Friday plan on getting a bigger ticket item on Black Friday such as a new TV, perhaps in preparation for home entertaining over the festive season. Categories expected to do well this year also include DVDs, computer games and books, followed by clothing, footwear and accessories ahead of the festive party season. Here's Mirror Money's list of the retailers to watch come November 25. 1. Argos has already started its 13-days of deals What tricks will Argos have up their sleeves for this year's Black Friday? Argos’ eagerly anticipated Black Friday bonanza has already started and will run for 13 consecutive days through to Cyber Monday, the retailer has announced. Following in the footsteps of rival Amazon, which has also extended its Black Friday sale to two weeks, the high street chain has promised deals galore across "thousands of products" ahead of the Christmas extravaganza. Argos also insists that there will be "sizable discounts" available on a range of technology, toys, consumer electronics and domestic appliances this year. John Rogers, Chief Executive Officer of Sainsbury’s Argos, said: “Last year’s Black Friday was the biggest and most successful shopping day ever for Argos. “We have been busy preparing for the Black Friday period for many months now, making sure our website, stores and distribution operations are all geared up in anticipation of high levels of demand for our great range of products." To find the best deals, visit Argos.co.uk in stores and online, or stay tuned on our Argos Black Friday deals guide. 2. Amazon's sale will last 2 weeks Amazon sold more than 7.4m items online last Black Friday (Photo: PA) In 2015, Amazon sold more than 7.4million items in the UK, a record sales day with 86 items sold a second. This time they're hoping to break records again, with an extended sale, running for just under two weeks. This year Amazon intends offer double the number of deals compared to last year. The online retailer said it was extending its promotions, which ran for about a week last year, in response to customer feedback. Customers can get an early start on Christmas shopping with deals already available at Amazon.co.uk on gifts from HD TVs, phones, and audio products, to beauty, home accessories, fashion, and some of the most popular toys of the year. Doug Gurr, UK country manager for Amazon, said: “In response to positive customer feedback for Black Friday deals, we are introducing the Black Friday Sale – 12 days of fantastic deals on must-have gifts and products, saving our customers millions of pounds. “We’re also thrilled to have over 1,000 small businesses featuring in our Black Friday sale, broadening the selection for our customers and enabling those businesses to boost their sales in the run-up to Christmas.” For all the goss, head to Amazon.co.uk, or our Amazon Black Friday deals page. If you're an Amazon Prime member, don't forget, you can get early access to all the deals before they go live - find out how Amazon Prime works here. 3. Currys' 'incredible deals' Currys PC World is likely to go big online this year Currys PC World are promising 'incredible deals' online for those who don't want to wrestle their way through manic crowds. Last year the high street chain reported EIGHT sales made every second, and around 30 TVs a minute sold on Black Friday alone. In a bid to avoid shopping chaos, the retailer has increased its stock numbers and launched a click and collect service on discounted items this year. This year's deals are expected to include Apple's iPhone 7, 4K ultra HD curve TVs and more home entertainment. The retailer has ready released some deals online, with this DYSON V6 Absolute Cordless Vacuum Cleaner down to £279.99 from £449.99. Shoppers can also save on the LENOVO IdeaPad, now £549 (was £619) Online customers will be able to search for the latest deals and offers on the official Curry's Black Friday page or see Mirror Money's official Currys Black Friday guide. 4. Rumoured 50% off at Marks & Sparks M&S currently has a huge 3 for 2 offer running until Christmas (Photo: Getty) In 2015, M&S went huge on the week of Black Friday with up to half price home, clothing and beauty in its early offers. This included offers on Louis Chaurey Champagne, the Fitbit Charge, home gadgets and 30% off Per Una fashion. Keep your eyes peeled for further offers launching from now until Cyber Monday on 30 November 2015 on the Marks and Spencer Black Friday deals page. Plus signing up to the brand's newsletter in the field located at the bottom of their website, or opting into their SMS updates, will ensure you get all the latest information direct to your inbox or mobile. If you're still wondering how to save online at Marks and Spencer - read our guide here. 5. John Lewis in stores and online John Lewis is likely to price match against competitors this Black Friday John Lewis' commitment to being 'Never Knowingly Undersold' means the upmarket department store will most likely be slashing the price on hundreds of products over Black Friday in a bid to offer the best price. But be warned, most items sold out in just hours, after the sale went live at midnight last year. In 2015, the retailer featured deals on coveted tech items like the Apple iPad and Macbook Pro products, as well as usually high price tag items like designer handbags and household electrical appliances. This year we believe tech will also feature heavily in John Lewis' price cuts, as many shoppers look to pick up savings on items ahead of Christmas. Black Friday discounts will also be handy for those wanting to pick up designer fashion and accessories, large furniture items and toys. 6. Tesco in stores and online Supermarket giant Tesco has revealed it will take part in this year's Black Friday sale Customers are set to benefit from Tesco's "biggest ever Black Friday event" this year, with the retailer offering 11 days of amazing deals and savings up from four days last year. The event will run on the Tesco Direct website from Monday 21 November to Thursday 1 December, while over 700 Tesco stores opening their doors to customers from 5am on Black Friday itself. Last year Tesco went all out on tech deals for Black Friday, knocking two-thirds off the price of tablets, laptops Beats headphones and mobile phones. This year we expect a similar strategy from the supermarket giant, as they go head-to-head with other major high street retailers like Argos and Sainsbury's - with online becoming the most favourable way for customers to access the deals. You'll be able to track down the latest offers by visiting the retailer's official Black Friday page from Monday 21 December, or stay tuned on our Tesco Black Friday 2016 deals page. 7. GAME in stores and online It'll be video games galore at GAME this Black Friday Last year GAME turned their Black Friday offering into a five-day sale extravaganza. The high street retailer launched new deals every hour from 8am, featuring discounts on console bundles, accessories and best selling games. If you're wondering where you'll be able to view these top deals for 2016, bookmark this GAME Black Friday deals page. Many gamers will be holding out for price cuts on newer consoles like the Xbox One S or PS4 slim, as well as discounts on best-selling games like FIFA 17 and Forza Horizon 3. 5 key shopping tips for Black Friday Make a list of the things you want/need to get in the sale. Do your research beforehand. Bookmark pages of items you want ahead of Black Friday. Get online as early as possible on the day. Opt for click and collect services to avoid paying delivery charges. 8. House of Fraser tease home electrical deals House of Fraser has officially unveiled some its special Black Friday deals (Photo: Western Mail) Last year, House of Fraser slashed prices on luxuries including designer handbags, premium fashion and Shabby Chic furniture. And this year the retailer will follow suit, revealing some of the deals on fashion and home electrical items that will be available on the big day. Selected premium fashion items including this £79 Linea glitter wrap dress and £300 Label Lab leather bomber jacket will be half price. Designer and premium accessories including handbags like this Therapy London sequin bag, £20, will also be 50% off. Home electricals including the Nespresso coffee machines will feature in the Black Friday sales, with the Magimix black citiz machine reduced from £150 down to £105. Stay tuned here, for all the deals as they're released. 9. Very.co.uk top secret savings Retailers have been preparing for Black Friday for months - and sales are set to exceed £5 billion Last year online retail giant Very.co.uk shifted 9,000 tablets, 10,000 TVs, 12,000 games consoles, and 11,000 kitchen appliances during the shopping bonanza. Over 248K of parcels left the brand's warehouses, and 4.2 million website visits were recorded - in a word Black Friday 2015 was huge for the retailer. The retailer promises to be back with a bigger and better collection of deals on 25 November 2016, which will no doubt feature a similar array of TVs, laptops, tablets and kitchen appliance that flew off the shelves last year. Read More Has Very.co.uk accidentally revealed its Black Friday deals ALREADY? This hidden link reveals all 10. Boots early Christmas deals It's rumoured Boots' Soap and Glory range will drop to half price on Black Friday Over the years Boots has established itself as a staple for shoppers during the Christmas shopping season, most notably during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Last year the high street retailer launched hundreds of deals on beauty, perfume, toys and electrical ranges, and we expect similar discounts to run both online and in-store for 2016. The retailer has exclusively revealed it will be offering shoppers a free Soap & Glory phone charger and mirror handy handbag kit with every purchase of two or more full sized Soap & Glory products in the run up to Black Friday. The offer will run from 26 October until 22 November 2016, both online and in-store. See what exclusive Boots Black Friday deals the retailer has teased will be included this year at Boots.com.

Reuters/Lucy Nicholson Latest reports suggest that Apple is not likely to release the iPhone 8 before September 2017. The company may in the meantime release the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. It’s been just more than a couple of months since Apple released its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. However, rumours are already on about the next-gen iPhone. As per reports, the Apple iPhone 8 could have a bigger OLED curved display. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus may have 5 and 5.8-inch displays respectively. Apple could be using a bezel-less display to conform to the size of the handset. As per Macworld, Apple did apply for a patent in March 2015 for a bezel-less device. As far other specs are concerned, nothing is known about next year’s Apple iPhone 8 though the company may tie up with Intel for manufacturing the processor for the iPhone 8. There is no rivalry between Apple and Intel. Hence, Apple may choose to shift some of its orders there. It will also be in line with Washington’s policy of encouraging US companies to make products at home. Apple is known for using the best cameras for its smartphones. It also got a patent for a digital camera with light splitter. Thus, this new technology could be incorporated into the Apple iPhone 8 camera. This feature is generally available to professional video cameras. The technology is believed to produce excellent photos even in low light conditions. These are merely rumours and it will be interesting to see whether Apple really introduced these new features in its iPhone 8. Apple is also said to be working with Energous to introduce the wireless-charging technology to Apple iPhone 8. The iPhone can be successfully charged if the owner is within 15 feet of the transmitter, writes BGR.

Reuters/Stephen Lam Fresh reports suggest that the Apple MacBook Air 2017 could be the cheapest Mac laptop ever. The upcoming device is expected to feature Apple’s virtual assistant Siri and also the much-talked-about E-Ink keyboard. It will also reportedly feature some very high-end specs that Air fans have been long waiting for. The MacBook Air 2017 was expected to be unveiled in October during the Apple event. However, MacBook Air fans were left thoroughly disappointed when Apple revealed only the MacBook Pro 2016 and compared the MacBook Air to it. This led to wild speculations that the Cupertino-based company is closing down the Air line of products. What led fans to believe earlier that Apple would soon be coming out with a highly-upgraded Apple MacBook Air is the minor upgrade that the MacBook Air received this year. The 13-inch variant received an optional RAM upgrade. The insignificant update led many fans to believe the company would soon be releasing a MacBook Air 2017 with the latest specs & features. While a MacBook Air release in 2016 does not seem like a possibility, many tech enthusiasts feel that the device may be released in 2017 between March and May. As Apple has been absolutely tight-lipped about the device and has neither denied nor confirmed the many rumours, more rumours are cropping up every now and then. Certain reports have claimed that the Apple MacBook Air 2017 could be the cheapest Mac device in the market when it releases. The device is expected to be slimmer and thinner than its predecessor. As per an earlier Tech Radar report, Apple’s virtual personal assistant Siri will surely make its way to the Apple MacBook Air 2017. The assistant Siri was first unveiled for mobile at WWDC. It was running on an early build of macOS Sierra. The OS X 10.11 El Capitan successor will reportedly arrive alongside the new range of MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 2016 models. Other top features expected in the Apple MacBook Air 2017 are Retina Display, E-Ink keyboard, Intel Kaby Lake processor, ARM chips, Touch ID with Force Touch upgrade and a battery that could last up to 12.5 hours with web surfing. USB Type-C ports, SD card slots and Thunderbolt 3 are also anticipated. Submit Correction 0 0 0 Related New MacBook Pro spells doom for Apple MacBook Air 2017?

It describes the charismatic power of the genius leader who could force his team to breach the bounds of thinkable thought. In mundane MBA lingo, it is translated as thinking out of the box. The term, coined at Apple, is borrowed from the 1970s Star Trek series in which aliens create their own new world through sheer mental force. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s surprise announcement of overnight cancellation of 86% of the currency of the world’s third largest economy (by purchasing power parity) is something of a reality distortion field. In a large developing country with excessive cash dependence, this was an unthinkable thought, let alone an actual decision. It is audacious, bold, and a risky gamble, many say. It even hurts some of the core constituency of his own political party. But by his extraordinary persuasion and oratorical skills, the Prime Minister has got the nation on board, and one survey says 82% of the public supports him. “Corruption is a cancer” is a slogan we have been hearing for many years. When the rot is deep, you need harsh treatment with possible harmful side effects. Economists will forever debate the cost and benefits, and it looks like in the short term, the costs could be substantial. But seen from the RDF lens, the verdict that matters is the long-term verdict on this game-changer. For that, we will have to wait. This is the season of the unthinkables. A person with zero political experience is elected to the highest office in the world’s most vibrant democracy—the US. The UK leaves the European Union after 43 years. India’s largest corporate group abruptly sacks its chairman. And then Modi presses the nuclear button on 86% of India’s own currency. Maybe not just unthinkable, it is the season for resets. Now that the unthinkable is possible, the black-money hoarders can forever be on nervous alert about possible future resets. It will also reset public cynicism about the impossibility of curing the cancer. It may rebuild the confidence of citizens in governance institutions, something thought unthinkable till recently. While we wait for the impact of the RDF over the medium- to long-term, it is important to clarify two macroeconomic misconceptions. Firstly, no, this is not a negative monetary “shock”, at least in the conventional sense. Secondly, no, the fiscal side will not experience a windfall gain through the balance sheet of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Was this (so-called) demonetization a monetary shock? (An aside: strictly speaking, demonetization means the removal of the high-value currency in circulation. Not reintroduction of new notes.) Consider the opposite situation. Milton Friedman suggested a famous thought experiment of a helicopter dropping cash all over the economy. This would obviously lead to inflation in the short run. Helicopter money is currently in fashion in these times of quantitative easing, when the EU and Japan are struggling to inject some inflation. So is India’s demonetization the obverse of helicopter money, due to the sudden suction of 86% of cash? Not so, because, in theory, all those notes will be replaced with new notes instantly. In practice, this is facing considerable teething difficulty. During that interregnum, it does work as negative helicopter drop, and hence is deflationary in the short run. Consumption spending is down as new cash injection is slow due to the sheer challenge of logistics. More worryingly, as was articulated by Pronab Sen in this newspaper, the informal economy will bear some permanent costs. Those not linked with the banking system use high-value notes as a store of value. These are neither black-money hoarders nor tax evaders. These financially excluded households may also be socio-economically backward and low on financial literacy. They potentially face a huge negative shock. The other big constituency is the beneficiaries of the informal, cash-lending economy. They too face a negative impact on their working capital, with great danger of a wipeout of their businesses. So while technically cash replacement is not a negative monetary shock, it does have an impact on the informal economy. Then, what about the impact on the RBI’s balance sheet? There has been some wrong analysis, which claims that since some old cash won’t be turned in, it would simply reduce the central bank’s liability. Estimates of this windfall gain vary from Rs2-4 trillion, equivalent to India’s entire fiscal deficit. The cheerleading and misguided analysts then gleefully conclude that the RBI can simply issue a large dividend to the government of India, equivalent to the reduction in liability. This is wrong on many counts. Notes are of varying vintage. Their write-down is over a long extended period. So the gains are gradual, and get recorded as special reserves. Secondly, the RBI has to keep issuing new currency to keep pace with at least the nominal gross domestic product growth rate. Thirdly, if the RBI tries to encash its gains by selling assets from its balance sheet, that might exacerbate the liquidity crisis. If anything, the RBI should be on standby to inject funds, if there’s large capital outflow due to any number of reasons. These could be the Donald Trump-induced risk aversion, the closing of the rupee-dollar interest rate arbitrage gap, the weakening rupee, and so on. So, no, fiscal deficit ain’t benefiting from the currency reset. If it were that easy, then we should reset every 10 years. In summary, the macro impact is somewhat negative in the short run. But if the implementation glitches are sorted out quickly, then the RDF will hold sway. The unthinkable may happen again. Ajit Ranade is chief economist at Aditya Birla Group.

I've been testing the Plantronics BackBeat Pro 2 wireless headphones, and I'm totally impressed. I've tried a dozen or so different wireless headphones, and there are three areas I judge -- sound quality, comfort and how far can you wander and still hear the music. The BackBeat Pro 2 ($199.99) is a serious competitor to the Bose line of QuietComfort noise-cancelling headphones. They come in a handsome box with a sturdy twill carrying case that's lined with a soft material. There is also a Special Edition with a hard case available for $249.99. The headphones are not just shiny plastic. Almost every surface is textured, and the parts that touch your ears and the top of your head are soft. The inside of each ear cup is covered with vinyl padding, and the 40mm drivers are covered with a thin material that has a big L or R printed on it so you know which side is which -- very handy. There are control switches on each ear cup. The left side has a switch for the listening modes. You can listen to music naturally, or flip a switch to engage active noise canceling. There's also a mode that pauses the music and turns on the external microphone so you can have a conversation without removing the headphones. The left cup also has a play/pause button and buttons to go forward or backward in your playlist. On the outside of the control buttons is a volume ring. The right ear has the power button, a mute button for the microphone and a 3.5mm jack so you can attach an included cable to use the BackBeat Pro 2s with sources that don't have Bluetooth. I found the noise canceling to be effective, especially when cutting my grass, and it didn't degrade the sound quality of the music I was playing. There are sensors in the ear cups that know if you take them off. When you remove the BackBeat Pro 2s, the music pauses. Put them back on and the music resumes. You charge the headphones with an included microUSB cord. Battery level is shown on a series of small blue LEDs when you power them on. Plantronics says you can expect up to 24 hours of listening on a charge. At startup, there is also a whispered voice in your ear telling you the battery level and connection status. You also receive a voice confirmation when you change listening modes or go into pairing mode. Sound quality I'll be the first to admit I'm no audiophile. The BackBeat Pro 2s sound really good to me, but I realize there are headphones that can reproduce sound better. I'm not trying to tell anyone that wireless headphones with active noise canceling are going to be the best-sounding headphones they've ever used, -- but I was happy with the music I listened to with these in a variety of situations. There isn't a ton of bass, but the midtones and highs were very crisp, which is how I like it. These headphones also allow the wearer to take voice calls. Since Plantronics was a phone headset company for years before it made headphones, I expected good voice quality on phone calls, and I was not disappointed. A large button on the right ear cup is for answering and hanging up calls. Comfort There is plenty of cushioning and soft materials wherever your skin comes into contact with the BackBeat Pro 2s. The earcups have two-way pivoting adjustment, and it was easy to find a comfortable position for extended listening. The fit and finish are first-rate and on par with any other company's offerings. Buttons and controls were big enough to find and use without trouble. The ear cups fold flat for easy storage in the bag, which also has a pocket for the included cables. Wireless distance The BackBeat Pro 2s are a Class 1 Bluetooth device, which means they have a range of around 100 yards when paired with other Class 1 devices. My iPhone 6S is a Class 1 Bluetooth device, and I tested the range outdoors with a straight line of sight. I was able to walk almost 120 yards away from my phone before the sound cut out. At home, I was able to leave my phone on the back deck while I mowed my lawn. The music never cut out or even stuttered. The range outdoors is impressive. Indoors, the range will shrink according to how much interference is between you and the source. Conclusion If I were in the market for a set of nice noise-canceling headphones, I'd certainly put the Plantronics BackBeat Pro 2 on my short list. I think the combination of good, clear music reproduction and phone call quality coupled with active noise canceling at a price at least $100 cheaper than the competition makes them a compelling choice. Plantronics wireless headphones Pros: Comfortable, great range, stellar battery life, good call quality. Cons: Bass is a bit light, especially if you're used to Beats. Bottom line: These cans deliver the goods and cost less.

Could a similar problem be brewing this year for Apple’s iPhone 7? It’s certainly starting to look that way. According to a report from Bloomberg, it seems that researchers at Twin Prime Inc. and Cellular Insights have found that the iPhone 7 on Verizon’s networking isn’t performing as fast as it could, and it could be Apple’s own doing. The researchers have found that testing the phones on AT&T and Verizon’s network yielded similar results, but they also note that the iPhone on Verizon’s network could potentially hit higher internet speeds. If you might recall, it has been discovered that depending on which carrier you use, your iPhone’s modem could either be made by Qualcomm or Intel. Qualcomm’s modem is supposed to be faster with download speeds of up to 600Mb/s, while Intel’s model tops out at 450Mb/s. This means in theory Verizon’s iPhone should be capable of achieving faster download speeds. However some analysts speculate that maybe this was done on purpose to ensure a uniform experience across all iPhones, although right now we’re sure that some iPhone users probably aren’t too thrilled to learn that their iPhones could be artificially limited in some way. According to Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller, “Every iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus meets or exceeds all of Apple’s wireless performance standards, quality metrics, and reliability testing. In all of our rigorous lab tests based on wireless industry standards, in thousands of hours of real-world field testing, and in extensive carrier partner testing, the data shows there is no discernible difference in the wireless performance of any of the models.” Filed in Apple >Cellphones.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Some 15-inch MacBook Pros Are Misreporting The GPUs Inside It By Tyler Lee on 11/18/2016 17:37 PST It seems that some 15-inch MacBook Pros are affected by a bug that seems to cause the system to misreport that GPU that is installed on it. According to several user reports, users are claiming that instead of identifying the Intel HD Graphics 530 chipset that is supposed to be the integrated GPU in their laptop, the system is instead listing an Intel Iris Pro 580 GPU. Naturally this has led to confusion as some customers thought that they might have somehow gotten an upgrade. It also led to a bit of discontent as this inconsistency was also discovered on MacBook Pros shown off in Apple’s retail stores, leading some to believe that Apple was running higher-specced laptops that could potentially mislead customers, but thankfully that is not the case. According to a source of AppleInsider, this is simply a bug and that the innards and performance of the laptops that customers bought are as advertised. “The problem is a result of mistaken communication between the System Information developer team, and the hardware team. The [Intel HD Graphics] 530 is reporting to the OS right, it’s the System Information app database that’s leading users down the primrose path.” Apple has yet to acknowledge the bug and comment on it, and we have no idea when a fix will be issued to address this problem, but if you do see it when you check your MacBook Pro’s system information, you need not be alarmed.

SEE ALSO: The best TV deals to watch for on Black Friday 2016 Silly things are Stephen Colbert’s speciality, so you probably won’t be surprised to learn that The Late Show had a short sketch about the ultra-expensive Apple book on Thursday night, lampooning both its content and its price: Like any great Apple reveal video, The Late Show’s parody highlights the unique features of the Apple book, such as “touch page technology,” which allows you to swipe your finger on a page to turn it, and sequential numbering, which means that… the pages are in order. Page 3 comes after 4, which comes before 5. Oh, and in case you think this is a bit over the top, here’s an actual quote on Apple’s website from chief design officer Jony Ive about the book: “The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve’s motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future. This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.” “Gentle gathering.” What a world we live in.

Lifestyle Food and Drink Thanksgiving 2016: The 6 best cocktails The festive holiday might be more popular across the pond, but it seems Thanksgiving-themed tipples have made their way to the UK and that’s reason enough to celebrate Leighanne Bent Saturday 19 November 2016 00:00 BST Click to follow Indy Lifestyle Online You don’t have to live in the USA to participate in the turkey-gorging festivities Every year, on the fourth Thursday in November, Americans celebrate Thanksgiving as one of the biggest dates on the calendar. Although it’s primarily a national holiday across the pond, in recent years the turkey-gorging fever has hit London hard, with all-American feasts and themed events popping up all over the city. But perhaps more importantly, the celebrations have also inspired a wealth of dedicated Thanksgiving cocktails to try. So from boozy bourbon mixes to drinks with added cream cheese (no, really); here are London’s best.  Available for one night only, the Pumpkin Pie Flip is thick and creamy Dirty Bones – Pumpkin Pie Flip  Dirty Bones might be known for their meaty dishes, but this year they are turning their head towards creating one-off cocktails for the holidays. All set for Thanksgiving, head down to their Soho, Kensington or Shoreditch branches, and get your hands on their Pumpkin Pie Flip. This smooth mix is made with Sugar Shine Pumpkin Pie Moonshine, Bulleit Rye and Belsazar Dry Vermouth; all shaken with double cream and egg white. It’s only available on 24 November though, so if you want it, you gotta act fast.  With maple syrup, pumpkin puree and orange bitters, the Mayflower screams Thanksgiving Birdies – The Mayflower  Okay, heading to Birdies for a game of crazy golf might not be the most traditional of ways to celebrate Thanksgiving, but having said that, these guys have only gone and recruited Spirited Mixers to rustle up a special mix for the 24th. The Mayflower cocktail is a heady mix of Woodford Reserve, maple syrup, lemon and orange juice, pumpkin puree, finished with a dash of orange bitters. If you’re looking to celebrate a little bit differently this year, raise a toast (and a club) to Thanksgiving at Birdies.  The Wild Apple Gobbler has all the Thanksgiving flavours in it including pumpkin butter Jones Family Project – Wild Apple Gobbler  This year The Jones Family Project are putting on a Thanksgiving spread to please the masses. Make your way to their Shoreditch plot from the 24th to the 26th, and tuck into three wonderful courses for £30 (expect turkey escalope with all the trimmings and traditional pumpkin pie). To help you wash everything down, their bartenders have created the Wild Apple Gobbler. It’s made with Wild Turkey 81, Calvados, lemon, sugar, pumpkin butter and bitters. But be warned; one sip and you’ll be hooked.  Made from a mixture of fruity Bourbon and cinnamon sugar, the CUT also has a sweet blueberry compote  CUT at 45 Park Lane – My Kind of Gravy  CUT at 45 Park Lane is hosting a traditional Thanksgiving with all the trimmings on the 24th. Owned by Wolfgang Puck, this restaurateur’s impressive clientele list spans from Sir Elton John to the Obamas. Impressive. To complement each wonderful course, the mixologists at CUT have come up with My Kind of Gravy. It has a fruity Bourbon American whiskey base with cinnamon sugar, carefully balanced by lemon juice and sweet blueberry compote.  Christopher's decadent Pumpkin Pie Martini is made from gin, Cointreau, lemon juice, maple syrup, pumpkin puree and a spoon of mascarpone  Christopher’s Covent Garden – Pumpkin Pie Martini  Following the success of last year’s Thanksgiving-themed cocktails, Christopher’s have gallantly decided to jump on the holiday bandwagon once again. Focusing on martinis, they have created three distinctly delicious drinks; but we’re all about their Pumpkin Pie Martini. It’s made with Bombay Gin, Cointreau, lemon juice, maple syrup, pumpkin puree and one bar spoon of mascarpone. We know what you’re thinking. Cream cheese... in a cocktail? But trust us – it works.  The Magazine – Old Fashioned  A lot of people believe in pairing their Thanksgiving dinner with a whiskey-based drink. And it seems The Magazine have the same opinion. They have included the Old Fashioned as one of their specially crafted Thanksgiving-themed cocktails for their event on the 24th. Keeping things classic with a bourbon base, sugar, bitters, and a twist of orange rind, this old school drink, like their three-course spread, won’t let you down.  For more info on what’s on in London, visit DesignMyNight; and follow them on Twitter and Instagram, @DesignMyNight More about: Food and Drink Cocktails Thanksgiving 2016 Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

Tips and tricks for… OK, Google, what can you do? Tips and tricks for the Google Home By Dan Evon — November 19, 2016 10:00 AM Subscribe to this topic Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends The latest entry into the world of voice-activated assistants comes from a company you’ve probably heard of before: Google. The apt-titled Google Home functions in a similar way to its main competitor, the Amazon Echo, but has the added benefit of Google services such as Google Calendar and Google Keep. This enables the speaker to not only be the center of your smart home, but the center of your life. More: Everything that’s compatible with Google Home at launch The Amazon Echo has Alexa and Apple has Siri, but the brain behind Google Home doesn’t really have a name. Instead, the company has decided to name its AI “Google Assistant.” While the company opted for a rather mundane name, Google Assistant has plenty of tricks up its sleeves. If you just bought a Google Home, or if you’re curious about what this little device can do, here are some tips to get you started with your new smart speaker. Get the morning report What do you have to do today? Google Assistant knows. Simply ask Google Home to “tell me about my day” and you’ll get an audio report about future meetings, your morning commute, the weather, and any pertinent reminders you’ve set. This morning report is also easy to customize. You can choose to exclude any of the aforementioned categories, including info pertaining to your weather and morning commute, and can add items like a news report. Google Assistant also allows you to choose your preferred news sources, so you’ll only get the information that you care about. You’ll have to connect your calendar, and for now it only has the ability to share info from a single “main” calendar. That means your significant other’s events won’t get listed off, and neither will info from shared calendars. Embrace the ecosystem If you’re interested in Google Home, there’s a good chance that you already use several of Google’s other products. Google Home was designed to work within Google’s ecosystem, and as such, the product is most useful for people who frequently utilize services such as Google Calendar and Google Keep. With these services, Google Home can truly be your own personal assistant. You can have it check your schedule, set reminders, or add items to your shopping lists with a simple voice command. Google Home can still be a useful tool if you don’t use the company’s other services, sure, but you won’t be using the device to its full potential. Get connected While Google Home can’t match Alexa in terms of connected apps — at least not yet — the personal assistant does play well with a few notable services. For music, you can connect your speaker to Pandora, TuneIn, Google Music, Spotify, or YouTube. If you use any of those services, it’s a good idea to link your accounts. You can also choose your preferred music service, so when you tell Google to “play music” it will automatically start playing from your favorite music provider. Google Home also works with a few smart home products, including Google Cast, Nest, Philips Hue lights, and Smart Things. While most of Google’s connected services deal with products inside your house, you can also connect this speaker to your Uber account. Name your devices Google Home is meant to be the center of your smart home life. If you have a Google Chromecast connected to your TV, for example, you’ll be able to use Google Home to play a YouTube video or a song from Pandora from your television. This isn’t too complicated if you only have one connected device, but if you have multiple gadgets connected to your Google Home, you’ll want to personalize their names. You can change the name of your Chromecast to “TV,” for instance, or “Living Room.” You’ll want to pick a name that’s easier to say than “Chromecast,” and one that helps you remember the location of your device. Turn off the mic and get some privacy One of the reasons why Google Home is such a useful device is that it’s always listening. You can ask it a question or issue a command at any time with nothing more than your voice. However, this feature might be a little unnerving for some people. Do you really want Google, or any other company, to listen to everything you say? It’s also possible for Google Home to butt into your conversations even if you haven’t directly addressed it. Google’s four-syllable wake phrase, “OK Google,” will probably prevent this from happening too often, but we’ve had it perk up at very strange times. Whatever the reason, disabling the microphone on Google Home is pretty simple. There’s a “mic mute” button on the back of the device, which allows you to quickly turn the microphone on or off. Reset it If you find that your better half gets way more use out of the Google Home than you, then you might want to bequeath the benefits, like the calendar and commute times, to them. If your account is already linked, you can do a factory reset by holding down the microphone button for about 15 seconds. That allows you to link a different Google account, until the speaker becomes smart enough to set up different user profiles. Google it Google bills its Google Assistant as “your own personal Google,” and you should use it as such. Think of all the ways that you use Google on a desktop. Well, you can pretty much do all of that with this speaker. Want to find the best brunch spots in Chicago? How about convert ounces to cups? Ever wonder what the capital of Finland is? While Google Home can play music, set an appointment, call a cab, or dim the lights, the heart of this speaker is its search engine. In fact, Google Home’s search engine may even be better than its desktop counterpart. One interesting feature of the Google Assistant is that it remembers the context of your search. For instance, say you ask a question about President Barack Obama. You can ask follow-up questions using indirect terms, like the pronoun “he,” and Google Assistant will remember the topic of your question. If you want to delete an embarrassing query from your history, you can do so in the app. Go to My Activity under the More Settings tab in the menu, and you can playback and remove your history. The Google Home is learning all the time, so we’ll update this article as it learns more tricks.

It is interesting to note that software major Microsoft will also be closely involved in the making of the new HP handset.

Now, Microsoft, in a bid to thwart any missteps in the making of HP's new phone, has offered to allocate monetary funds and also technology such as glance screen, ClearBlack display, double tap to wake, and advanced camera functionality, which was used for building its former Nokia Lumia-branded phones, to the HP's new phone, Dr Windows blog reported citing two reliable sources. If all things go as planned, HP's new Windows phone is expected to get unveiled at MWC (Mobile World Congress) 2017, Barcelona (February 27-March 2), in the very same venue, where HP Elite x3 made its debut this year.

RocketNews24 Bringing you yesterday's news from Japan and Asia, today. RocketNews24 Japanese TOP » Japan » Piko Taro stops by Sesame Street to help Elmo and Cookie Monster with their version of PPAP【Vid】 Featured Weird Studio Ghibli Jobs Piko Taro stops by Sesame Street to help Elmo and Cookie Monster with their version of PPAP【Vid】 Oona McGee 12 hours ago Tweet The popular characters from the iconic TV series dress up in leopard print and sing in Engrish for Japan’s younger generation. By now, Kosaka Daimaou’s stage character Piko Taro barely needs an introduction, given he’s racked up over 87 million views on YouTube, had a Tokyo cafe open up in his honour, and received a Guinness World Record for his “Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen” hit, which became the shortest song ever to appear on the US Billboard Hot 100 charts. Just when we think we’ve heard the last of him, Piko Taro keeps popping up with all sorts of surprises, and this latest one might just be the very best of all, with the leopard-print-loving star recently paying a visit to Sesame Street in Japan for a quick dance with some of the show’s stars. Elmo and Cookie Monster were the lucky characters to join Piko Taro on screen in this clip, and while their human visitor prefers to sing about fruit and stationery, these two have only one thing on their minds: cookies! And what goes with cookies? Take a look at the hilarious video below to find out! The leopard-print-wearing trio singlehandedly delivers an unforgettable dose of Engrish to the next generation! With lyrics like “I have a choco!” and “I have a butter!”, “Cookie-Butter-Choco-Cookie” looks set to be the next anthem swimming around in the heads of toddlers and adults alike for days at a time. While the video is still waiting to be translated into English at the time of writing, Piko Taro’s mini dance lesson here is easy to understand. First, he explains the importance of really pushing that wrist out in the air while doing the “open-close-open-close” arm movements. Then he reminds them that their right hand needs to be shaped smaller than their left when holding the butter, seeing as they’re going to be jamming that butter right into the cookie. Then, when Piko Taro asks Cookie Monster what type of chocolate it is that they’re using, the blue monster replies, “Nama Choco”, which makes the star laugh. Nama choco is a “fresh” ganache chocolate, which has a soft, melt-in-the-mouth quality. Because of this, Piko Taro suggests holding it out in your right hand and smothering it all over the cookie. After the brief tutorial from the PPAP professional, the three then give it their all in a spectacular performance of “CBCC” that will live in our memories forever. After the music stops, Piko Taro looks at his watch and realises he has to run off to his “baito” part-time job, where he makes sneakers, and for some bizarre reason, only the ones for the “right (foot) side”. Despite Elmo’s pleas for him to stay, Piko Taro says he has no time, nor money, so he has to go to work. With one final wave and a flash of that killer grin, he’s off, leaving the two monsters to continue their dance to CBCC on their own. Meanwhile, the rest of us are left with a newer, and maybe even slightly weirder version of PPAP than we knew before. If that wasn’t crazy enough for you though, you might want to check out the release starring Ryuk the Shinagami Death Spirit from the Death Note movie series. Whether you’re a human, a puppet or a computer generated character, no one can escape the PPAP phenomenon! Source, images: YouTube/Sesame Street Japan Rate this: Like this: Like Loading...

The hype over cashless and cardless transactions took a U-turn when our Prime Minister declared ban over 500 and 1000 currency notes. Since last week, quite a chunk of India’s population is surviving on mobile wallets. We are either impatient, don’t want to take the hassle of standing in a bank or ATM queue or we simply don’t want to bother about demonetised currencies and black money scam. We prefer to go cashless yet pay utility bills on time. Those who are still unaware of how to go about with a cardless cashless transaction, here are the steps that will guide them through: Step 1- Download the mobile wallet apps from Google play store or Apple i-store. The wallets like Paytm, PayU, MobiKwik, Vodafone M-pesa, Citrus Pay, Oxigen Wallet etc can be downloaded from iOS or Android smartphones. Step 2- Once the app is downloaded or installed in the smartphone, it is ready to use. Choose from any of the options- credit card, debit card or internet banking to top up the wallet with cash. Step 3- The wallets have tie up with merchants like Zomato, Bookmyshow, Uber, Goibibo, makemytrip, Grofers, Pepperfry, Jabong etc. Any kind of online product purchase, booking tickets or payment of utility bills can be done with the help of these wallets. Go to payment section and choose ‘wallet’ from the payment options. Enter phone number and email id for the transaction. Then the pre-stored cash from the wallet will automatically get deducted. Step 4- Once the cash from the wallet gets deducted, you will get a notification in your mobile. Within minutes, that cash will get delivered to the merchant from where you have done the actual purchase. Step 5- Once the merchant receives the cash, you will get a notification too. And then your payment for online shopping or bill paying is done. Within days, you might also get a reminder about the remaining account balance of your mobile wallet.

The expectation that Cook could become another Steve Jobs was never realistic, but there’s an important role that Jobs performed that needs to be filled by someone at Apple,” Mark Hibben writes for Seeking Alpha. “That’s the role of product architect.” “What’s a product architect? It’s actually difficult to answer, and I find myself wanting to say “it’s what Steve Jobs did.” Elon Musk of Tesla has the title of Chairman, Product Architect, and CEO. Clearly, Tesla’s products bear the imprimatur of the tastes and judgment of Musk, just as Apple’s products once did of Jobs,” Hibben writes. “Product architects are generalists, not specialists. They may have a technical or engineering background, but they also have a wide range of interests beyond that. The key role of the product architect is to figure out how to turn innovative technologies into successful products.” “The ability of Steve Jobs to see the product nascent in a lab experiment was his true genius, but he also had the ability to guide product development efforts (such as the development of the Mac, iPod, iPhone, etc.) making crucial technology decisions along the way,” Hibben writes. “When I think about Apple’s management team, I really don’t see anyone who fulfills the product architect role. Jony Ive? Maybe it was intended that he perform that role, but if you look at his job description (on Apple), it’s not quite the same thing.” “If Ive was intended to be the product architect, I’ll be blunt. He isn’t cutting it,” Hibben writes. “The architect operates at a somewhat higher level. Product architecture combines many elements including marketing, technology and design. But it’s not primarily about aesthetics.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: The Apple TV remote is clear, incontrovertible evidence that Jony Ive either wasn’t involved or had mentally checked out during its so-called “design process.” Obviously, Steve Jobs is missed and, yes, Apple does need a Jobsian product architect. Unfortunately, Steve was a unique genius and his shoes, so far, have been impossible to fill. As we wrote over three years ago: Steve Jobs would get it. Tim Cook? Well, he released it. Just like he released Apple Maps. If it’s not crystal clear by now, it should be: Cook can’t see it. He’s very good at some things; other things he simply cannot see. This is not a knock. The ability to be so detail-oritented, so absorbed in the end user experience to the exclusion of all else, is a rare ability. “Tim’s not a product person, per se.” – Steve Jobs discussing Tim Cook, as quoted by Walter Isaacson in “Steve Jobs” Cook needs to assign people to these projects who can do what he cannot, who can see what he cannot see, and make sure these people are as focused and obsessed as Steve Jobs. There may only be one person at Apple who can do this reliably: Jony Ive. Unfortunately, he may be too busy being chief designer of all things Apple (hardware and software) to also do what Jobs did so incredibly well: Focus on a wide range of products, experience each of them as the end user does, and not allow products out the door until they can perform as Apple products should perform. It’s highly likely there is not enough time in the day for all Ive would need to do (or even to do all that he’s supposed to be doing already). Cook needs to find people who are obsessive about the end user experience and assign them to these type of projects. There should have been someone at Apple who became the planet’s preeminent authority on streaming radio, who knew every service, who used these services for hours each day, who lived and breathed and used streaming radio for months. This person should have been iTunes Radio’s shepherd and final arbiter, without whose approval, iTunes Radio would not be released. Was there such a person on this project? …To state the obvious: Steve Jobs was one-of-a-kind and truly amazing. No hyperbole. Cook needs to try to replicate Steve Jobs as much as possible with a group of people, each of whom can contribute various elements of Jobs’ wide range of skills. — MacDailyNews, November 11, 2013 Categories: News Tags: Apple, Jony Ive, Steve Jobs Thank You for supporting MacDailyNews!

I got tired of moving my laptop around from my desktop setup to the TV and figured I’d get one of the “TV” devices – immediately thought that would be an Apple TV until I researched what it could / couldn’t do. I can honestly say that I was literally shocked – taken aback – at how limited it was. The built in connectivity of my cheap 32″ TV matches what the Apple TV box could do as far as I could tell. And NO local storage? wtf Sad. fromilix Wednesday, November 16, 2016 - 11:40 pm · Reply but it’s ‘thin’ (which seems to be the biggest design criteria of Apple Design staff today). Matthew Tyler-Jones Thursday, November 17, 2016 - 1:08 am · Reply Yeah. I don’t think Cook is doing a bad job. He was always the brilliant logistics guy, not the visionary. I think Jobs hoped Ive would step up to the visionary plate, and though I sad to critique a talented countryman, he hasn’t been the visionary Apple wanted. No-one could replace Jobs. We all knew that, but we (I) hoped Ive would come closer than he has.

Yeah…that’ll work! It’s a free world so go and do better yourselves and spare us your incessant whingeing. Switched Thursday, November 17, 2016 - 9:51 am · Reply Ive’s design schtick is wearing thin. When there’s no more Braun products left to plagiarise you end up with the Mac Pro dustbin. The AppleTV is lamentable and it’s no longer funny that they call this a hobby. Hobbies are all about passion but Apple has no passion for the Apple TV. The new TV app is a bandage over a festering wound of an interface. I really am over the thin design of the iMac at the expense of processing power. Make it fatter and put desktop grade CPUs and dual mobile GPUs in the damn thing that can be run full throttle for days without fear of damaging it. Kev Saturday, November 19, 2016 - 11:17 pm · Reply And greed. Becoming like a cancer at Apple. Jobs warned that becoming greedy nearly killed Apple once. The new Apple is on a path to losing the goodwill of its most faithful customers. The examples of this greed are so rampant. « Previous 1 2 Add Your Feedback Name (required) Email (required) Web cancel reply Notify me of new comments via email. Notify me of new posts via email.

MacRumors reader Jesse D. unscrewed the bottom lid on his new 15-inch MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar and discovered, unlike the 13-inch model sans Touch Bar, there is no cutout in the logic board for removable flash storage. Another reader said the 13-inch model with a Touch Bar also has a non-removable SSD. Given the SSD appears to be permanently soldered to the logic board, users will be unable to upgrade the Touch Bar MacBook Pro's flash storage beyond Apple's 512GB to 2TB built-to-order options on its website at the time of purchase. In other words, the amount of flash storage you choose will be permanent for the life of the notebook. The discovery also increases the importance of backing up data using Time Machine or a similar solution in case of logic board failure. These are the first MacBook Pro models to ship with non-removable SSDs, following in the footsteps of the 12-inch MacBook. The photos also show "pretty large, nearly index finger width gaps" around the battery cells, possibly to keep the MacBook Pro's overall weight lower and to encourage better airflow. The fan placement and internal layout of Touch Bar models is significantly different than the standard function key model. Official teardowns from the likes of iFixit and OWC should confirm and provide a better look at the non-removable SSDs.

Do you want expand the storage with expansion card? Tough luck because new MacBook Pro doesn't have SD slot either. Did you have your data on the SSD when the logic board failed? Tough luck because you are not getting that data back.

Many people depend on the assistance that a librarian provides. This is all part of the governments overall austerity drive- we lose out on services, workers get a bad deal meanwhile Apple gets away with 13 Billion in unpaid tax. The staff of public libraries across the country are currently being balloted for industrial action by their trade union IMPACT such is the fear and concern that the Open Libraries Initiative will be forced upon them, leading to sacking of workers, the undermining of job security and endangering the terms and conditions of employment of workers who remain. If the strike goes ahead People Before Profit will offer our full support and the support of our elected representatives in councils and in the Dáil to aid the strike. The People Before Profit motion, by Councillor John Lyons, was intended to lay down a marker to Dublin City Council Chief Executive, Owen Keegan, also a board member of the LGMA, that a policy which will ultimately lead to staffless libraries is not acceptable and will not be tolerated. Text of Motion: This committee recognises the invaluable contribution public libraries and their staff have made to the educational and social life of communities across the city of Dublin and the country over many decades, is strongly opposed to the Open Libraries initiative and will support any moves by library staff and their trade union Impact to resist the introduction of staff less libraries in Dublin City. Related Link: http://www.peoplebeforeprofit.ie/2016/11/people-before-...ries/ Add Your Comments >> printable version with comments RSS and atom feeds allow you to keep track of new comments on particular stories.

Yes It's A Thing Jayson Derrick , Benzinga Staff Writer   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} November 19, 2016 7:27pm   Comments Share: After a company reports their quarterly results, management hosts a conference call with Wall Street analysts and investors. Normally, one would expect management to be on their best behavior, but as CNBC's Jim Cramer pointed out, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)'s recent conference call was full of hostility — from the analysts. For many investors, this may be the exception, but CNBC's Eric Chemi pointed out that there have been more than 1,000 instances of profanity used by executives over the past decade. In fact, the number of instances of cursing during a conference call so far in 2016 is more than all of 2014 and 2015. Chemi continued that he went through 100,000 conference call transcripts to find instances of profanity. He did acknowledge in some cases the use of profanity was humorous. For example, Carl Bartz, Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO)'s former CEO said, "So, we had a lot of people running around telling engineers what to do, but nobody f—ing doing anything." JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon said in 2014, "I want to [...] try to stop stepping in dog s—, which we do every now and then." Swearing Can Have A Positive Impact? Chemi pointed out that using profanity at work could actually help build credibility and confidence. "Our data shows if you take the companies that used the most profanity and put them in their own portfolio they would outperform the overall market by about 40 percent over the past decade," he explained. For those who are curious, executives at Mastercard Inc (NYSE: MA) were crowned as having the worst potty mouths. Winning Quote Finally, Chemi highlighted his most memorable use of profanity, courtesy of Albert Lord of SallieMae during a conference call in 2007, "There's no — no questions. Let's get the f— out of here."

REX Shutterstock. Bella Hadid’s mother has come to her defense after the supermodel’s recent Nike campaign sparked a torrent of comment from Internet trolls and Olympians Meryl Davis and Ashley Wagner. “You obviously don’t have to be an athlete to wear or enjoy Nike,” Yolanda said Friday during an interview with TMZ, adding that Bella was once an equestrian sports competitor from 3 years old until 15, when she began suffering from Lyme disease. Related Kylie Jenner Strips Down to Pink Pumps - and Not Much Else for Tyga's 27th Birthday On Monday, Bella unveiled her “New York Made” billboard in the Big Apple, but some of the detractors among the nearly 2,700 comments cried that she was “too skinny” to represent a sportswear brand. Davis, an ice skater, chimed in — tweeting that she thought a professional athlete would’ve been a better choice: “I’ll take the one promoted by the athlete please ,” she tweeted one day later along with a photo composite of Bella wearing Nike, Kylie Jenner in Puma and Team USA gymnast Aly Raisman wearing Reebok. ❤️Always remember who you were before the world told you who you should be…. @bellahadid #athlete #horselover A photo posted by YOLANDA (@yolanda.hadid) on Nov 17, 2016 at 12:54pm PST 🏁so excited to announce that I am OFFICIALLY PART OF THE @NIKE FAMILY! More coming very soon ❤️👟🏁 A photo posted by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Nov 14, 2016 at 10:15am PST Fellow Olympian Ashley Wagner joined the chorus, commenting on the tweet, “Strong is my kind of beautiful!!” Reebok Women responded on Twitter: “@AshWagner2010 @Meryl_Davis @Aly_Raisman Couldn’t agree more with you, ladies! #ToughIsBeautiful.” Yolanda shared an image of daughter on Friday in action on a horse. “Always remember who you were before the world told you who you should be…. @bellahadid #athlete#horselover,” she captioned an Instagram photo . I'll take the one promoted by the athlete please 💪🏼 pic.twitter.com/MRe1baOBtX — Meryl Davis (@Meryl_Davis) November 15, 2016 @AshWagner2010 @Meryl_Davis @Aly_Raisman Couldn't agree more with you, ladies! #ToughIsBeautiful — Reebok Women (@ReebokWomen) November 17, 2016 The “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star revealed earlier this year that Bella’s woes with Lyme disease prevented her from continuing in professional riding sports. “[Bella] had to give up her lifelong dream of having a professional riding career and a shot at the Olympics due to her severe symptoms and inability to ride,” Yolanda shared in January. “[She] struggles with symptoms of chronic Lyme every day.” Yolanda has said that some of the symptoms of her own battle with the disease included loss of eyesight, migraines, joint pain, numbness, short-term memory loss, among other issues. Speaking to Entertainment Tonight on Friday, Davis clarified that she intended to say she supports a “diversified ideal of beauty” when she tweeted about Bella’s Nike campaign. “As someone who has experienced just how hurtful comments on the Internet can be, my intention is to promote the use of a diversified ideal of beauty and support the role I believe female athletes can play in the pursuit of that,” Davis said. “I feel very strongly that all women should be represented in the media for young girls to see and my intention is to encourage inclusiveness. I am about women supporting women and building one another up.”   — Sign up for the FN Newsletter — Fashion, Focus, Athletic & Outdoor, Celebrity Style, Women's, North America, Bella Hadid, Kylie Jenner, Nike, Puma, Reebok, Yolanda Hadid Share This Article Email Tumblr WhatsApp LinkedIn Post navigation ← Kylie Jenner Strips Down to Pink Pumps – and Not Much Else for Tyga’s 27th Birthday Prince Harry’s Girlfriend Meghan Markle Arrives to Film ‘Suits’ in These Sleek Flats → Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

NOVEMBER 20 ― Britain’s vote to withdraw from the European Union followed by Donald Trump’s election in the US constitute a single giant political event — one that makes 2016 a vintage year in history that will long be studied. Big political events have big causes. For the last three years I’ve been working on a book about what’s been happening beneath the surface — in the plumbing and wiring of the world — that’s roiling politics in so many places. My answer begins with a question: What the hell happened in and around 2007? 2007? That’s such an innocuous year. But look again. Steve Jobs and Apple released the first iPhone in 2007, starting the smartphone revolution that is now putting an internet-connected computer in the palm of everyone on the planet. In late 2006, Facebook, which had been confined to universities and high schools, opened itself to anyone with an email address and exploded globally. Twitter was created in 2006, but took off in 2007. In 2007, Hadoop, the most important software you’ve never heard of, began expanding the ability of any company to store and analyse enormous amounts of unstructured data. This helped enable Big Data and cloud computing. Indeed, “the cloud” really took off in 2007. In 2007, the Kindle kicked off the e-book revolution and Google introduced Android. In 2007, IBM started Watson — the world’s first cognitive computer that today can understand virtually every paper ever written on cancer and suggest to doctors highly accurate diagnoses and treatment options. And have you ever looked at a graph of the cost of sequencing a human genome? It goes from $100 million in the early 2000s and begins to fall dramatically starting around … 2007. The cost of making solar panels began to decline sharply in 2007. Airbnb was conceived in 2007 and change.org started in 2007. GitHub, now the world’s largest open-source software sharing library, was opened in 2007. And in 2007 Intel for the first time introduced non-Silicon materials into its microchip transistors, thus extending the duration of Moore’s Law — the expectation that the power of microchips would double roughly every two years. As a result, the exponential growth in computing power continues to this day. Finally, in 2006, the internet crossed well over a billion users worldwide. In time, 2007 may be seen as one of the greatest technological inflection points in history. And we completely missed it. Why? 2008. Yes, right when our physical technologies leapt ahead, many of what Oxford economist Eric Beinhocker calls our “social technologies” — all of the rules, regulations, institutions and social tools people needed to get the most out of this technological acceleration and cushion the worst — froze or lagged. In the best of times social technologies have a hard time keeping up with physical technologies, but with the Great Recession of 2008 and the political paralysis it engendered, this gap turned into a chasm. A lot of people got dislocated in the process. How could they not? What happened around 2007 was that connectivity and computing got so fast, cheap, ubiquitous and leveraged that they changed three forms of power — in really differentiated ways — all at once: the power of one, the power of machines and the power of ideas. What one individual or small group can now do — the power of one — to make or break things is phenomenal. When Trump wants to be heard he now gets his message out directly from his New York penthouse through Twitter to 15 million-plus followers at any hour of the day he pleases. And the Islamic State does the same from a remote province in Syria. Machines can now not only beat humans at “Jeopardy!” or chess, they are starting to become truly creative, offering architectural and other designs and writing news stories, songs and poetry that are indistinguishable from the work of humans. At the same time, ideas now flow digitally through social networks all over the world faster and farther than ever. As a result, new ideas (including fake news) can suddenly take root, and long-held ideas — think opposition to gay marriage or transgender rights — can suddenly melt away. So if you look down from 30,000 feet you see that technology, globalisation and, I would add, Mother Nature (in particular, climate change, biodiversity loss and the impact of population growth) are all accelerating at the same time, and feeding off one another: More Moore’s Law drives more globalisation and more globalisation drives more climate change. And together, climate change and digital connectivity drive more human migration. I recently met with economic and climate refugees in West Africa who made it clear to me they didn’t want aid from a rock concert in Europe. They want to come to the Europe they see on their cellphones — and they are using WhatsApp to organise vast illicit migration networks to get there. So no wonder many in the West feel unmoored. The two things that anchored them in the world — their community and their job — are feeling destabilised. They go to the grocery store and someone there speaks to them in a different language or is wearing a head covering. They go into the men’s room and there is someone next to them who looks to be of a different gender. They go to work and there’s now a robot sitting next to them who seems to be studying their job. I celebrate this diversity of people and ideas — but for many others they’ve come faster than they can adapt. That’s why my favourite song these days is Brandi Carlile’s wonderful ballad called “The Eye,” the main verse of which is: “I wrapped your love around me like a chain/ But I never was afraid that it would die/ You can dance in a hurricane/ But only if you’re standing in the eye.” These accelerations in technology, globalisation and Mother Nature are like a hurricane in which we’re all being asked to dance. Trump and the Brexiters sensed the anxiety of many and promised to build a wall against these howling winds of change. I disagree. I think the challenge is to find the eye. For me, that translates into building healthy communities that are flexible enough to move with these accelerations, draw energy from them — but also provide a platform of dynamic stability for citizens within them.

Few things are more frustrating than an iPhone on the fritz. Case in point: the dreaded touch disease, which generally manifests as a flickering gray bar atop the screen and ultimately renders the device's touchscreen useless. The issue is widely reported by iPhone 6 Plus owners and often presents itself gradually, becoming worse over time until, eventually, the screen loses responsiveness altogether. Despite widespread customer complaints and a class-action lawsuit, Apple has not acknowledged the problem — until now. The company, which previously refused to help iPhone owners affected by "touch disease" unless the affected phone in question was still under warranty — a rarity for devices that are now two generations old — has launched a new repair program for the widely reported issue. According to Apple, which will now fix your infected phone for a service price of $149 through its Multi-Touch Repair Program, "touch disease" is not a design flaw, but rather a result of "being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress."

Babar Awan to represent PTI in Panamagate case 20-Nov-16 ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e- ... WASHINGTON: Ford Motor Co, one of Donald Trump's prime corporate targets on the campaign trail, offered the President-elect a chance to claim a victory late on Thursday by informing him it would not shift production of a Lincoln sport utility vehicle to Mexico from Kentucky. Trump jumped at the chance, claiming in a tweet that he had "worked hard" with Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. to keep the plant in Kentucky, even though Ford had never considered moving the whole factory south of the border. In letting Trump claim a victory, Ford made what appeared to be a calculated, public appeal to the next president in an attempt to soothe concerns about outsourcing jobs and to gain some leverage with the new administration as the automaker pushes for favourable policy changes in Congress. "Ford is not going to make a decision on a purely political basis," said Kristin Dziczek, director of industry, labour and economics at the Centre for Automotive Research in Michigan. "They are going to make a decision that makes business sense, economic sense and if it happens to align with political goals, that's great," she said. The No. 2 automaker in the United States is not the only company in Trump's crosshairs working out how to deal with the new political reality in Washington. Apple Inc, criticized by Trump for not building products in the United States, is studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to the United States, Japanese news service Nikkei reported on Thursday. Apple did not reply to a request for comment on Friday. Trump campaigned heavily on bringing jobs to the United States and attacking companies such as Ford that plan to take some production overseas, a message that resonated in the economically ravaged center of the country. Ford gave Trump plenty of ammunition, confirming in September that all of its remaining small-car production in the United States, at its facility in Wayne, Michigan, would go to lower-cost Mexico by 2019. Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said no plants would be closed as a result, and no US jobs would be lost as capacity at the Wayne plant would be taken up by two new models. The Mexico plans remain in place, despite the fact that Trump vowed on the campaign trail to stop Ford opening a new plant in that country and promised to slap 35 percent tariffs on any Ford vehicles made there. Ford went further this month, announcing on Election Day a new $195 million investment in India to add 3,000 jobs over the next five years in a technology and business center in Chennai. Ford said this week it would import its Ford EcoSport built in India to the United States. Trump has not made any public comment on that plan. On Thursday, Ford said it had been reviewing where to build the Lincoln MKC, just one vehicle built at the Louisville assembly plant, but had decided to keep it in Kentucky. As such, nothing changed, but letting Trump announce the decision gave him the opportunity to claim he saved US jobs and cast Ford as a patriotic manufacturer. "Both sides will claim a certain level of victory because nobody wants a significant negative impact on the industry," said Dave Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research. It was unclear how many, if any, jobs were actually saved by the decision. Ford decided last year to move MKC production by 2019, on the assumption that production of the Ford Escape, a similar vehicle made in the same plant, would grow. But recently Escape demand has slumped, which may have prompted Ford to reconsider. According to Cole, Ford's olive branch to Trump was a clear indication that it needs help from the next administration as it faces a host of issues from fuel economy standards and the rise of autonomous vehicles to trade and currency. Cole said Trump, who boasts about his deal making skills, may choose to focus on bargaining with companies he has targeted - even if only for small concessions - rather than pursue more punitive measures such as tariffs, which would take time to implement and potentially damage the economy.

Lifestyle Savvy Shopper guide to navigating Black Friday, Cyber Monday 5 Black Friday tips from our Savvy Shopper Savvy Shopper's guide to navigating Black Friday. Savvy Shopper's guide to navigating Black Friday. Natalie JosephContact Reporternjoseph@dailypress.com Every year, hundreds of people leave their homes late Thanksgiving Day or early Black Friday morning to stand in the cold for one purpose — scoring the biggest shopping deals of the year. Black Friday and Cyber Monday have solidified themselves as two of the largest shopping days of the year, causing shoppers across the nation to mark their calendars in hopes of scoring the best deals on electronics, home goods, appliances, toys and much more. The National Retail Federation (NRF) reported 74.2 million people shopped in stores on Black Friday in 2015. The NRF also reported 34.6 million shopped in stores on Thanksgiving Day. This year, the NRF predicts that holiday shopping will increase by 3.6 percent, with a majority of sales coming from shopping done on Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The NRF senior director of media relations, Ana Serafin Smith, said Black Friday weekend numbers are predicted to be similar to or stronger than in 2015. NRF reports that consumers plan to spend about $589 on gifts this holiday season. Gloucester groups join #GivingTuesday Frances Hubbard Several organizations and businesses have joined "Giving Tuesday" – a worldwide fundraising campaign that follows Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Shop Local Saturday and Cyber Monday. "We are working hard to raise funds with the online charitable giving opportunity that GivingTuesday provides," said... Several organizations and businesses have joined "Giving Tuesday" – a worldwide fundraising campaign that follows Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Shop Local Saturday and Cyber Monday. "We are working hard to raise funds with the online charitable giving opportunity that GivingTuesday provides," said... (Frances Hubbard) If you're worried you missed out on deals in 2015, WalletHub, in a news release, reported that 11 percent of deals this Black Friday are recycled from last year. It reports top retailers recycling deals are Sears (28 percent recycled), Office Depot/OfficeMax (20.5 percent) and Staples (18.2 percent). Shopping tips •Make a list. Before you get to the store, make a list of a few items you want to purchase ahead of time. This will help you keep focus, shop faster and get a better position in the checkout line so you can move on to the next store. A list also is helpful in case you find the hot deal you originally wanted is sold out, allowing you to move down your list for your second-most-wanted deal without scrambling.

Many stores allow you to stack coupons on Black Friday, allowing you to use multiple coupons on one purchase to maximize savings. Start saving coupons now and collect the coupons you receive while shopping on Black Friday. Organize your coupons according to store and group them together in little plastic bags or with paper clips so when you get to the register, you can pull out all of your coupons for one store together, which makes checkout faster and easier. •Get in line early (especially for electronics). At almost any major retailer, lines get long fast. Most department stores only have a limited number of electronics or large door-buster items, so I suggest arriving at the retailer about an hour before the doors open. Typically stores give out tickets for electronics or appliance items while you wait in line. Once in the store, the customer then takes the ticket to the checkout counter to redeem the item, so getting there early increases your chances of getting the deal you want — and snagging a shopping cart, which is a Black Friday rarity. •Save receipts. With so many incredible deals in one place, it can be overwhelming and exciting, leading to shopping regret. Although receipts are easy to lose in the chaos of Black Friday, it is important to remember to save them just in case you want to return any impulse buys or defective items. Also, rebates are big on Black Friday, and your receipt is the key to scoring money back on some of your most expensive purchases. •Bring a shopping partner. Bringing someone with you for your Black Friday shopping adventures is important for many reasons. First, because shopping carts are so rare, a partner can help you hold shopping items. Second, the two of you can also split the shopping list to maximize your chances of getting a great item. It also helps to have someone to wait with in line. If you fly Black Friday solo, bring a smartphone or game to pass the time while waiting. Door-buster deals Big box retailers compete with one another to offer customers the best deals of the season. Depending on what you are looking for, or who you are shopping for, Black Friday shopping may take you to one store or multiple stores or may cause you to stay at home in your pajamas and shop online. Newport News shopping blogger and co-founder of blackfridaycentral.com and crazytowndeals.com, Jerry Tietjens, said the key to getting the most out of your Thanksgiving Day or Black Friday shopping is to look for multiple deals in one place. "Don't go to a store based on one deal you see in the advertisement," Tietjens said. "Stores only have like seven or eight TVs in stock, and that's usually the max. The first five people get them and that's it. Look for ads with a few Christmas gifts so you get more of what you want." Electronics One of the top deals on electronics can be found at Kohl's on Black Friday. The department store has a Samsung 4K Smart TV for $249 (limit one per customer) and a Canon EOS Rebel T6 DSLR camera with Wi-Fi for $449.99, $300 off its regular price. Kohl's is also giving out $15 Kohl's Cash for every $50 spent. Wal-Mart has the iPhone 5S for $99, RCA 7-inch Android tablet for $28 and a 40-inch Classic Element or Hisense television for $125. Kohl's and Wal-Mart are selling the Fitbit Alta for just $99 (regularly priced at $129.95). Best Buy is the place to go if you want to get deals on Apple products, such as the Apple Macbook Air for $799.99 ($200 off) and the 22.5-inch iMac desktop for $899.99. Another hot deal at Best Buy is the Amazon Fire 8-inch tablet for $59.99. Staples has great deals on office electronics like the Canon PIXMA MG3620 Color Inkjet All-in-One Printer for $29.99 and Logitech wireless computer mouses for $8.99, one the best deals out there. Home and pet goods Macy's has select brands of kitchen appliances such as electronic skillets, panini makers, slow cookers, blenders, toasters and waffle makers priced at $7.99 on Black Friday, after a $12.99 rebate. For foodies, JCPenney is offering a Pyrex eight-piece sculpture bowl set or 24-piece anchor storage set for $10. PetSmart has a fantastic deal on dog cuddler gift set that includes a dog blanket, bed and pillow for $14.99 before noon. The store opens at 7 a.m. Friday. From 6 a.m. to noon at Bed Bath and Beyond on Black Friday, shoppers receive a coupon for 20 percent off their entire purchase all day Friday, which is valid for items such as a Dyson Ball Animal Upright Vacuum for $299.99 ($200 off the regular price). Also, coffee lovers can get $55 off a Keurig K55 Elite Brewing System ($89.99 on Black Friday). If you are looking to spruce up your home with a new appliance or two, Sears has the Kenmore Built-In Dishwasher with PowerWave Spray Arm for $399.99 ($430 off the regular retail price). The Home Depot has up to 40 percent off top-brand appliances and $79 7.5-foot pre-lit LED Christmas trees. Clothing Macy's is offering 50 percent off all Lauren, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger suit separates after 1 p.m., and $15.99 puffer coats for juniors that regularly retail around $80. Kohl's has $8.99 women's watches, and GameStop has graphic T-shirts for $1.99. Toys and games Some of the best toy deals come from Wal-Mart, including the Disney Princess Cinderella Royal Dream Dollhouse with furniture by KidsPlay for $88, Granite Peak Mountain Bikes for $58 and $22 three-piece TeePee sets that include a teepee, sleeping bag and pillow. Shop at Toys R Us for 40 to 50 percent off toys and toy sets, including some of the most popular brands this year, including Pokémon, Barbie and Paw Patrol. If you are a digital gamer, GameStop has a three-for-$20 deal on pre-owned video games. Save $50 on an Uncharted 4/ 500 GB PlayStation 4 Bundle for $249, and check out the store's exclusive deal on the new Gold PS4 DualShock 4 Controller for $64.99. Black Friday online Many Black Friday deals already have begun at large online retailers such as Amazon and Groupon. According to the NRF, in 2015, 41 million people shopped online on Thanksgiving Day, and 75.3 million shopped online on Black Friday. Many stores that offer in-store Black Friday deals also will have the same deals online the morning of Thanksgiving or Black Friday, Tietjens said. "You will see a lot of those same deals pop up online first. Some of them leak in the days leading up to Black Friday," Tietjens said. "For example, a large deal that we found online is that Wal-Mart has a 55-inch 4K Smart TV for $298. Don't wait until the stores open." Like department store websites, Amazon offers Black Friday deals and is the key online retailer to look out for Thursday if you want to find discounts on electronics, home goods, furniture and a variety of other items without leaving your comfortable space. According to Tietjens, Amazon most likely will price-match large department stores. Cyber Monday Last year, 121.3 million people shopped on Cyber Monday, more than on Black Friday. This year, the NRF expects that number to increase, because large retailers are upping their Cyber Monday deals. "We noticed that retailers are offering online-only deals on purpose to compete with other online shopping deals that other retailers are offering. We see this when retailers are offering exclusive deals give them more bang for their buck," said Smith, NRF's senior director of media relations. Amazon has started its Countdown to Black Friday by releasing new deals every five minutes on its website. Amazon's best deals of the season most likely will be on Cyber Monday with discounts on clothes and electronics, specifically Amazon-made products like the Fire tablet. Also check Best Buy's website on Cyber Monday, which will have the latest 4K Ultra HD televisions on sale. Also online, find deals at Crocs (40 to 60 percent off), 30 percent off at UGGs Australia, discounted vacations at Travelocity and coupons for special offers at Target. Most stores also offer free shipping on Cyber Monday. Online shopping tips According to Tietjens, Cyber Monday is the biggest day for clothing and textiles, so explore your favorite store's website for deals ahead of time. Tietjens explained that Cyber Monday has more apparel deals than any other day of the year, and suggests that if people are looking for handbags, shoes or winter clothing, Cyber Monday is a better day to shop. He also said Cyber Monday will have deals that mirror Black Friday's on laptops, televisions, tablets, smartphones and other high-end technology devices. "We see lots of crossover with Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals. Most deals after that will depend what didn't sell on those days. Some TV prices will drop after if they didn't sell as much," Tietjens said. Shop local •Williamsburg Premium Outlets: There are plenty of special deals at the Williamsburg Premium Outlets on Black Friday. The first 500 shoppers who visit Simon Guest Services (located in the Food Court) will receive a holiday-themed "Black Friday Swag Bag" that holds discounts, seasonal treats and more.

The Amazon Echo device. Photo: / Image 2 of 2 Living With Technology: Talking to computers 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Ever since I saw the first Star Trek shows and they would say: “Computer, red alert!” and the red lights would flash and the siren would sound, I was hooked. Talking has been a great idea for how to communicate with a computer, but always extremely difficult to achieve. In particular, it takes a lot of computer power to convert a voice into text that a computer can process. In addition, figuring out what someone means can be equally difficult. Luckily, the rise in cloud computing has provided virtually unlimited computer horsepower to decipher what people are saying and what they mean. The net result is that we now have a handful of speech interaction technologies available to us. One of the first widely popularized technologies is Apple’s Siri, a feature on iPhones that receives commands and will execute them on your mobile phone. Google came along with additions to its lineup with “OK Google” that lets people talk to their devices and through the Google Chrome Web browser. Amazon surprised the world about a year ago with its Amazon Alexa products (Echo, Tap and Dot, $179.99, $129.99 and $49.99, respectively) that is a standalone product for the home that doesn’t require any computer or subscription to let you ask questions, play music and interact with it solely with your voice. So far, Amazon Alexa is intended to be an open platform, intended for people to develop other “skills” that add functionality, such as controlling home automation, ordering a Uber, ordering items from Amazon and more. About two weeks ago, Google released their voice enabled device, Google Home ($129 at madeby.google.com/home). Where Google Home shines is its deep search engine capabilities. It clearly was very good at looking things up. I put some of the services to a few basic questions: Google Home was able to tell me the driving distance from my home to the White House (283 miles by car). Amazon Alexa said it was 249 miles away “as the crow flies.” Cortana thought I wanted to drive TO my home, so told me I was only 4 minutes away. Google Home couldn’t tell me about local movies, but Amazon Alexa was quite happy to rattle off the local movies showing and their times. Cortana gave me a matrix of movie poster thumbnails that I could pick from to find more. Listening to what people say and figuring out what they want is really hard to do. Add to that ambiguity, accents, popular culture and it’s amazing that computers can decipher what we’re saying at all. Even so, we’re lucky to be living in a time where we can talk to a computer and have it react meaningfully. Next up, I want a transporter so I can teleport myself around the world in the blink of an eye. And, like these voice activated devices, I’d like the service to be free.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Ford Motor Co., one of Donald Trump's prime corporate targets on the campaign trail, offered the President-elect a chance to claim a victory late on Thursday by informing him it would not shift production of a Lincoln sport utility vehicle to Mexico from Kentucky. Trump jumped at the chance, claiming in a tweet that he had "worked hard" with Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. to keep the plant in Kentucky, even though Ford had never considered moving the whole factory south of the border. In letting Trump claim a victory, Ford made what appeared to be a calculated, public appeal to the next president in an attempt to soothe concerns about outsourcing jobs and to gain some leverage with the new administration as the automaker pushes for favorable policy changes in Congress. "Ford is not going to make a decision on a purely political basis," said Kristin Dziczek, director of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan. "They are going to make a decision that makes business sense, economic sense and if it happens to align with political goals, that's great," she said. The No. 2 automaker in the United States is not the only company in Trump's crosshairs working out how to deal with the new political reality in Washington. Apple Inc, criticized by Trump for not building products in the United States, is studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to the United States, Japanese news service Nikkei reported on Thursday. Apple did not reply to a request for comment on Friday.   JOBS = VOTES Trump campaigned heavily on bringing jobs to the United States and attacking companies such as Ford that plan to take some production overseas, a message that resonated in the economically ravaged center of the country. Ford gave Trump plenty of ammunition, confirming in September that all of its remaining small-car production in the United States, at its facility in Wayne, Michigan, would go to lower-cost Mexico by 2019. Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said no plants would be closed as a result, and no U.S. jobs would be lost as capacity at the Wayne plant would be taken up by two new models. The Mexico plans remain in place, despite the fact that Trump vowed on the campaign trail to stop Ford opening a new plant in that country and promised to slap 35 percent tariffs on any Ford vehicles made there. Ford went further this month, announcing on Election Day a new $195 million investment in India to add 3,000 jobs over the next five years in a technology and business center in Chennai. Ford said this week it would import its Ford EcoSport built in India to the United States. Trump has not made any public comment on that plan.   BOTH CLAIM VICTORY On Thursday, Ford said it had been reviewing where to build the Lincoln MKC, just one vehicle built at the Louisville assembly plant, but had decided to keep it in Kentucky. As such, nothing changed, but letting Trump announce the decision gave him the opportunity to claim he saved U.S. jobs and cast Ford as a patriotic manufacturer. "Both sides will claim a certain level of victory because nobody wants a significant negative impact on the industry," said Dave Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research. It was unclear how many, if any, jobs were actually saved by the decision. Ford decided last year to move MKC production by 2019, on the assumption that production of the Ford Escape, a similar vehicle made in the same plant, would grow. But recently Escape demand has slumped, which may have prompted Ford to reconsider. According to Cole, Ford's olive branch to Trump was a clear indication that it needs help from the next administration as it faces a host of issues from fuel economy standards and the rise of autonomous vehicles to trade and currency. Cole said Trump, who boasts about his dealmaking skills, may choose to focus on bargaining with companies he has targeted - even if only for small concessions - rather than pursue more punitive measures such as tariffs, which would take time to implement and potentially damage the economy. Ford nodded to those wider issues in a statement on Friday, saying it was encouraged that Trump's economic policies "will help improve U.S. competitiveness." Ford, like other global U.S. corporations, agrees with key aspects of Trump's economic plans. It has called for U.S. tax reform and raised concerns about the costs of federal regulations. Ford also shares Trump's concerns about currency manipulation. © 2016 Thomson/Reuters. All rights reserved. Click Here to comment on this article Close  More ways to share...
