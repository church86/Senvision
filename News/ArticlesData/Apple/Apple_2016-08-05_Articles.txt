But navigating separate apps is a horrible way to watch TV, and it seems that Apple has finally seen the light.” Last year, Apple was working on actually selling a TV package of its own, a take on the “skinny bundle” that everyone from Hulu to YouTube to AT&T is rumored to be launching. But now it’s just focused on building the interface. So how will the interface work and what could be its content? Learn more by clicking here. BITCOIN’S UNHACKABLE. BITCOIN BANKS? NOT SO MUCH Marketplace reports, “There was a major heist today worth at one point $77 million. No guns, no getaway cars, though, it was all done digitally. In fact, there were no dollars either, it was a theft of digital currency: Bitcoin. Thieves hacked into a bitcoin exchange based in Hong Kong called Bitfinex — a bitcoin exchange is kind of like a bank and a trading floor all wrapped up into one – and stole the currency. This has happened dozens of times, but this incident was pretty big. The value of bitcoin plummeted by 25 percent from $650 per bitcoin to $480 before recovering to around $560. Bitcoin, the actual digital currency, has, in fact, never been hacked.  Nobody has been able to hack the actual code that a bitcoin is actually made of in order to forge or steal it.  What have been hacked, however, are the bitcoin exchanges that hold it. “Bitcoin is like gold, someone can come and steal it,” said Rupert Goodwins, a technology journalist in the U.K. “A bitcoin does have a record of its movement, from bitcoin wallet to bitcoin wallet, “but it doesn’t tell you anything at all about who controls that wallet,” he said. The same attribute that makes bitcoin so highly prized – its anonymity – is the same thing that makes it so easily stealable.” For the complete read, follow this link. $25,000 GOLD MEDAL BONUSES AVAILABLE FOR AMERICAN OLYMPIC ATHLETES Forbes says, “The 2016 Olympic Games in Brazil officially open on Friday, and they bring with them some of the world’s biggest superstars. Yet while some members of Team USA rake in tens of millions of dollars annually – Kevin Durant and Carmelo Anthony rank among the Games’ highest-paid athletes with over $80 million between them – the vast majority of American Olympians are low-paid amateurs. One silver lining? Rich payouts for those able to come home with a medal in tow.” That’s because the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) rewards American Olympians with bonus payouts for podium finishes. USOC pays athletes $25,000 for a gold medal, $15,000 for silver and $10,000 for bronze. In the question of team sports, each participating athlete also receives a full medal bonus. So when the US women’s soccer team took home gold in London, all 18 team members got a $25,000 payout. When did this practice start and is the U.S. the only country that pays big bucks for medals?

The main way members of these organizations drive their own learning is by experimenting with how they structure roles, relationships, responsibilities, and decision making processes. Nothing is sacred,” writes Harvard Business Review. Of course, if experimentation is your organization’s primary path to learning, you have to brace yourself for unexpected things to happen. That’s because you’ve got people interacting with (and within) interdependent systems, and both are highly unpredictable. “In light of that, how do self-managed organizations make learning productive? Most actually strike a balance between traditional and newer ways of structuring and learning, which mitigates the risks and costs of trial and error. For instance, teams that prioritize reliability over adaptability (think accounting departments) may require highly stable structures — and they’re often well served by traditional training (in regulated environments, the rules are the rules, and you have to know and apply them). But in areas where adaptability is critical — say, in new product development or marketing — responsive structuring and learning can help you meet the needs of your customers, your employees, and the business.” So, even if you’re in a largely hierarchical organization, you may want to experiment with some principles of self-organizing to learn to be more adaptable in certain circumstances. We’ve outlined a few things here for you to try in DIY fashion. OBAMA: TRUMP’S A RIDICULOUS CRYBABY “No, no, no, Donald Trump can’t be president, won’t be president, is more like a child whining in a sandbox than a prospective commander-in-chief, President Barack Obama thinks. So stop asking him about it,” reports POLITICO. Unless, of course, there’s a way to ask him about it that will let him showcase just how ridiculous he finds the thought of having Trump in the Oval Office, and let him laugh at the Republican nominee, and try to lead the country in laughing along with him. And that’s exactly what the president did at a podium at the Pentagon Thursday afternoon. Go to this link for more on how he blasted the Republican nominee. TRUMP’S PATH TO VICTORY DEPENDS ON SURGE OF WHITE MEN “Clinton has significant leads over Trump among minority voters and women, and is handily defeating him with white college-educated women. That puts pressure on Trump to win white men like no other candidate in recent history,” posts The Hill. Trump would seem to face tough prospects. A new Franklin & Marshall poll of Pennsylvania voters released Thursday found him facing an 11-point deficit to Clinton, 49 percent to 38 percent. “The survey shows Trump beating the Democratic nominee in Pennsylvania 53 percent to 31 percent among whites without college degrees, but only 45 percent to 35 percent among white men. Clinton leads Trump in the poll among college-educated whites, 58 percent to 28 percent. She also leads among white women, 57 percent to 29 percent. GOP strategists say Trump needs to close that gap by driving white men to the polls in numbers that haven’t been seen in recent election cycles.” For more on this story, go to this link. CLINTON’S POST-CONVENTION BOUNCE: WILL IT STAY OR GO? In a post for Real Clear Politics writer Sean Trende says, “I’ve been holding off writing the post-Democratic convention state-of-the-race update for two reasons. First, polls continue to pour in, as pollsters seek to measure the full effect of the two conventions. Second, and perhaps more importantly, the news cycle is moving very, very fast right now; it’s hard to find a good time to stop and write something that won’t be out of date 15 minutes after publication.” I think the best way to approach this is to give the “normal” take on the state of affairs, then the “Trump-centric” take.  Which one you think is closer to reality probably depends a fair amount on your prior views of the race; my sense is that the truth is somewhere in the middle.

California announced that premiums would rise by an average of 13.2 percent on the exchanges, after years of being one of the standouts for low premium growth. Meanwhile, Anthem, a large insurer, said it would expand its presence in the Obamacare exchanges–but only if its merger with Cigna is allowed to go through.” Aetna is only the most recent insurer to struggle to make money on these policies; after expressing optimism in April, the company now expects to take large loses in these markets and is cutting back on its offerings for 2017.  The market, says one quoted analyst, is still “very volatile.” “Where are the markets going? We can sketch out a few possible futures at this link. LUCY STATUE TOO SCARY USA Today reports, “Scary Lucy” is getting a makeover.” A new statue of Lucille Ball, the comedian who starred in “I Love Lucy,” will be unveiled Saturday in her hometown of Celoron, N.Y. on Ball’s 105th birthday, replacing the current statue that has received national attention for its unpleasant portrayal of the actress. Who is the new sculptor and what will the new sculpture “aim to portray”? The original statue, unveiled in 2009, has been mocked as “Scary Lucy,” and locals started a Facebook page in 2012 calling on the town to get rid of the statue. The statue and the desire to have it removed went viral last year when local and national media picked up the story. Take a look here if you dare. AMERICA’S FIRST POKEMON GO MASTER HAS CAUGHT EVERY POKEMAN Well it’s happened, posts Business Insider. “It’s official: Less than a week after leaving on a global Pokémon Go adventure to complete his collection, Brooklyn-based Nick Johnson has caught all of the 145 Pokémon that are currently available — very likely making him the world’s first Pokémon Go master.” According to the original video games that Pokémon Go is based on, there are 151 total monsters. We know that there are 142 you can catch in the US, six rare Pokémon that are currently unaccounted for, plus three more exclusive to certain international regions. In late July, Johnson became the first in America to capture all 142 Pokémon available in the USA. And so, with accommodations covered by Marriott Rewards and travel paid for by Expedia, Johnson set off last week to find those three international Pokémon and complete the set. Click here for the story on Johnson’s successful quest. FIVE LESSONS KIDS CAN TEACH YOU ABOUT PITCHING YOUR STARTUP Fast Company says, “If you can’t explain your business model to kids, then you’re not ready for prime time in front of investors. That’s the idea behind Pitch-a-Kid, a new Austin, Texas-based organization that puts kids in the judge’s seat as they analyze adult entrepreneurs’ pitches and choose the strongest pitch of the bunch.” Kids learn critical thinking and problem-solving skills, while local entrepreneurs get an unfiltered assessment of where their pitch falls short and what parts might be confusing. “Kids at the elementary school age are very honest and are comfortable asking questions about things they don’t understand,” says Mike Millard, who started Pitch-A-Kid earlier this year with his daughter Audrey, who’s currently in fourth grade. “For the entrepreneurs it really pushes them to use simple, straightforward, and understandable language.” Get the scoop by “pitching” here.

While the programme will be an invite-only one, Apple won’t turn away new researchers if they provide useful insights, as it plans to expand the programme, it said. “It’s getting increasingly difficult to find some of those most critical types of security vulnerabilities,” said Ivan Krstic, Apple’s head of security engineering and architecture, while addressing the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas. He said Apple’s security-bounty programme will reward researchers who actually share critical vulnerabilities with Apple. With the ‘bug bounty’ programme, Apple joins the list of technology companies, including Microsoft, Facebook, Google parent Alphabet, that have been shelling millions of dollars in bug bounty programmes over the past few years. Uber, Fiat Chrysler and the US Department of Defense too have launched similar programmes this year. At the Black Hat conference, Apple announced a list of vulnerabilities that would command big bounties, including $25,000 for ways around Apple’s digital compartments and into its customers’ data, $100,000 that allows extraction of confidential material from Secure Enclave, $50,000 for bugs that give hackers access to iCloud data and $200,000 for vulnerabilities in Apple’s firmware components. Earlier this year, The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reportedly paid hackers more than $1 million for a back door into Apple’s iPhone 5C that was used by San Bernardino Shooter Syed Rizwan Farook.

The unsettling trick was discovered by website designer Joonas Kiminki, who had his phone stolen from his car during a holiday in Turin, Italy. Kiminki said he 'immediately did the obvious things' people are told to do after losing a phone - he marked it as lost in the Find my iPhone app, and checked the boxes to receive a notification if it is turned back on - before continuing on with his day. Thieves have figured out a new one to break into locked stolen iPhones and potentially steal the identity of their victims (stock image) He forgot about the phone and bought a new one, only to receive a notification 11 days later that his old one had been found. But that's when he realized something was wrong, and he could be walking into a potential online trap. 'I of course rushed to the address on the link and then started typing my credentials, but then suddenly stopped. Something was just not right,' he wrote in a blog on Hackernoon.  He clicked on a link in the notification, which took him to a website - www.show-iphone-location.com - asking him to enter his Apple ID and password.

Share this article Share 188 shares But Kiminki said there were 'two things that alarmed' him about the page. 'First, the address seemed a little off. Not really something Apple would use, is it?' he wrote.  'The real thing, however, was that connection to the server is not encrypted — you would see it on the address bar, like on a genuine Apple page.'  After some quick online detective work, Kiminki discovered the email was not from Apple. The unsettling trick was discovered by website designer Joonas Kiminki, who had his phone stolen from his car during a holiday in Turin, Italy (stock image) Joonas Kiminki was directed to a fake website (pictured) that tried to con him into entering his Apple ID and password At that point he knew it was a scam, but the questioned remained, why would someone set up such an elaborate fake? 'As mentioned above, you can’t activate an iPhone as long as it’s connected to someone’s iCloud account,' he wrote.  'However, when you steal a phone, you can perfect the crime by stealing the poor b*****d’s identity as well. 'What strikes me the most is that everything seemed very "right" and professional. After some quick online detective work, Kiminki discovered the email (pictured) was not from Apple 'The email and the website content looked great, my phone really was an iPhone 6 and they even got the timezone right in the email.' At the end of the post, Kiminki said he wrote it so any other people who have their phones stolen can avoid the con. 'This is what Google.com and Apple should’ve told me 12 days ago when I searched for what to do,' he wrote. 'Hopefully this post helps prevent at least one online scam and thus doesn’t feed the growing monster of internet fraud.'

This is the ultimate deal that may change how iPhones, iPads, and their entire product line operates. Unlike their previous purchases, which involved a single product, this buy is a total game changer, as award-winning tech journalist Mark Gurman explained to Bloomberg. “Turi has a very vast portfolio of different services, platforms, and algorithms that Apple could use Across its entire portfolio… It is very much relevant across the product line… This is one of Apple’s biggest steps forward in artificial intelligence and machine learning.” Apple has fallen behind other companies including Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Amazon, in the AI and machine learning fields, according to Gurman. This is something the company aims to change in a huge way, with their new purchase. Mark attributed their previous shortcomings to an atmosphere of secrecy that led to isolation in a field that requires a lot of outside collaboration. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aHuLDhh3Rxw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Turi Inc. began its history as GraphLab, an open-source project that greatly benefited companies such as Pandora. The company was also called Dato not so long ago. The Turi team will remain in Seattle and it is doubtful that there will be any extensive personnel changes. The team is headed by Carlos Guestrin, University of Washington’s Amazon professor of machine learning. Apple has been extremely concerned about user privacy, and this has led them away from collecting user data. User data is vital to AI functions that make recommendations to users, according to Recode. This has been a great obstacle in the development and evolution of Apple’s personal assistant, Siri. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P2uoM-eLtNM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Currently, Apple developers have been gingerly moving toward the use of differential privacy to protect individual users’ data to enhance Siri’s capabilities. User privacy commitments have been quite a development handicap. That could change, as they make use of the human resources recently acquired in the purchase of Turi. Apple’s Tim Cook [Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images]Turi Inc. projects are not exactly applications or finished products, but rather a set of tools that allow developers to build apps that use machine learning and artificial intelligence. The apps produced will automatically scale and tune. According to GeekWire, these project tools are very flexible and help to build apps that companies large and small can use, as well as features that could help individuals. “The Turi Machine Learning Platform, GraphLab Create, Turi Distributed, and Turi Predictive Services — are largely designed to help large and small organizations make better sense of data. Use cases include recommendation engines, fraud detection, predicting customer churn, sentiment analysis, and customer segmentation.” iPhone [Photo by Carl Court/Getty Images]Turi Inc. perhaps has far more to offer in the long run in terms of human genius than the short term gains in AI made so far. Professor Carlos Guestrin leads an impressive team of innovative thinkers on the cutting edge of AI, according to Recode. Guestrin currently runs a highly-attended conference that meets regularly to discuss advances in the field. Will Apple allow him to continue this mind stimulating activity? Apple’s confidentiality agreements could fly in the face of Turi employee culture. Open-source thinking evolving into corporate thinking overnight could be way too much to expect, even from geniuses. More importantly, how creative will they remain if they are sequestered? All of these issues are well worth ironing out gradually, but will Apple see the logic in that? The Turi Inc. purchase has so far stirred only the instinctive Apple company secrecy, as GeekWire reports in a statement sent to them. “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.” Turi Inc. team leader Carlos Guestrin is following Apple policy so far, and declined to comment on the purchase.

Photo: Ray Stubblebine More On: new york giants The secret to Eli Manning's success revealed Giants expect best offensive lineman back — in nick of time Politician to Odell Beckham Jr.: The Bronx more than a strip club Giants' 'quiet assassin' is waking up and looks worth every penny For the first time since training camp began, cornerback Eli Apple showcased the coverage that led the Giants to select him with the 10th overall pick in April’s NFL draft. Apple, getting first-team reps, enjoyed his best practice, starring in one-on-one drills against wide receivers and twice blanketing Victor Cruz and forcing incompletions. A former Ohio State star from Voorhees, N.J., Apple got called for two holding penalties while defending fellow rookie Sterling Shepard, but that was his lone hiccup on a stellar afternoon. “He had some tight man-to-man coverage, he was physical out there, and he forced some guys to the sideline, to the boundary, leaving the quarterback no room to throw,” Giants coach Ben McAdoo said. “That was exciting to see.” Odell Beckham Jr. followed his return in Friday’s walk-through by being a full participant in Saturday’s practice. The dynamic wide receiver caught a long pass over cornerback Janoris Jenkins in 11-on-11 team drills and didn’t appear to be limited at all by the left lower-leg injury he suffered last Sunday, which cost him three practices. Beckham suffered lacerations to his left leg after Jenkins cleated him while going up for a pass, but he seems well past that now. “He looked good to me,” McAdoo said. “He was right in the mix, right in the protocol, exactly what we’re looking for.” Saturday’s practice was the longest of training camp at two hours and 20 minutes. It included pads for the fourth time in eight practices and a lot of hitting. McAdoo was pleased with the high-intensity workout. Both the offense and defense had their moments, from Beckham’s long touchdown catch to Jason Pierre-Paul recovering an Eli Manning fumble and returning it 60 yards for a touchdown. “Today was a big day for us,” McAdoo said. “This was a big moment for us in the training camp, a heavy-hitting, physical practice. We had a lot of explosive movements in tight quarters. “A lot of contact, a lot of physicality, and we got through it. We checked the box. It wasn’t as good as it could be, but we checked the box. It will be the starting point for a good foundation.” McAdoo’s eclectic mixture of music continued Saturday, including Tupac Shakur, Frank Sinatra and the theme song to “Law & Order.” Andre Williams got stuffed at the goal line by linebacker Kelvin Sheppard in 11-on-11 drills, an all-to-familiar sight for Giants fans. The third-year big-bodied running back out of Boston College, drafted by Big Blue in the fourth round in 2014, is supposed to be a short-yardage back, only he rarely moves the pile. Darius Powe, a rookie wide receiver from Cal battling to make the team, made the play of practice, hauled in a bomb through double coverage from backup quarterback Ryan Nassib and holding on after getting hammered by safety Nat Berhe. Defensive tackle Jay Bromley (ankle) and linebacker J.T Thomas (hamstring) remained on the side in the rehabilitation area and on the Physically Unable to Perform (PUP) list. Otherwise, the Giants are injury-free.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Microsoft exec thinks Apple is ‘doing customers disservice with old tech’ 2 by Greg Jordan  @solo_g06 Aug 6, 2016 at 21:14 GMT4 months ago With rumors of a Surface Pro 5 and a Surface Book 2 on the horizon, Microsoft seems to be adamant about keeping its customers updated with the latest and greatest, with yearly iterations of the original Surface Pro since 2013, and some variants as well. While Redmond fans get to look forward to new tech every year (at least in the PC division), what about those dedicated to Cupertino? It seems as though Apple has been lacking when it comes to innovation, let one Microsoft exec tell it. Brian Hall, general manager of Microsoft’s Surface line, had this to say about his long time competitor: I compete with Apple and respect them. but they ARE doing their customers a disservice at times with old tech… https://t.co/PR2pC6TsJh — Brian Hall (@IsForAt) August 5, 2016 Now Apple does have a slightly diverse product line, with PCs, Macbooks, iPads, and iPhones, but lest we forget, the MacBook Air was last redesigned six years ago, and the MacBook Pro’s design hasn’t changed since 2012. In addition, many of the Macs have not been updated with the latest processors, which may be why Apple’s computer shipments declined 11.5% annually last quarter. However, there are rumors which suggest a new MacBook Pro with a new touchscreen keyboard and the latest and greatest Intel chips will be coming this fall, but i wouldn’t get my hopes up. While Apple has yet to respond, it has just released an ad for the iPad Pro, touting it as more than a tablet, more like a computer. While I can’t say I agree with this, the ad is very impressive, and would probably make due for another piece of hardware. Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

Mass hysteria, seas boiling, and dogs and cats living together, as Bill Murray puts it in Ghostbusters. Or at least you’d think that was the case from people’s reactions to the rumour that the company might remove the headphone jack from the new iPhone this September. Audeze has included a built-in microphone allowing users to take phone calls – a great way to unnerve strangers by making them think you’re talking to them in the street There are even promises from die-hard Apple-istas to do the unthinkable and switch to Android. That’s the tech equivalent of Donald Trump buying a house in Mexico. Using a paired app, you can tweak the sound, graphic-equaliser style, until it is more like a sonic weapon than anything resembling music. Don’t do this after a heavy meal Whether or not Apple actually does it this year – which would mean that iPhone users would have to plug in their old headphones via an adaptor – it seems likely that it’s in the pipeline. For both Apple and its rivals, the advantage would be to build far thinner phones. In anticipation of that time, Audeze has launched its new Sine headphones that connect through the iPhone’s charging (Lightning) port. The phones also incorporate a digital-to-analogue converter, which generates far higher sound quality – in fact, you’d struggle to find anything that sounds better bar £1,000-plus home-listening headphones. Audeze has included a built-in microphone allowing users to take phone calls – a great way to unnerve strangers by making them think you’re talking to them in the street. Like most early-adopter technologies, these cans are instantly enviable – but so over-the-top they’re faintly silly. The headphones are pretty hi-tech though: they’re ‘planar magnetic’, which means they have a huge magnetic driver that gives absolutely ridiculous bass response. Using a paired app, you can tweak the sound, graphic-equaliser style, until it is more like a sonic weapon than anything resembling music. Don’t do this after a heavy meal. For hi-fi fans, these are an object of lust. For everyone else: don’t panic, a cheaper alternative will come along soon. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Mexit?

Sounds creepy, right? The latest update for the Apple Store app – version 4.0 – now allows the discovery of the device you’re using, and suggest other Apple products that you might like. For instance, if you’ve bought an iPhone 6S, it might suggest an accessory like a case or camera attachment. Similarly, if you’ve got the iPad Pro, the app might suggest a Smart Keyboard accessory. Apple’s version update changelog reads: "Get recommendations and shop for new products based on what works with the Apple devices you already own." You can find the new recommendations in the Discover section of the app. If you find the whole thing creepy however, then you can disable Apple’s access to your device model number in the settings. The new update went live this week, and also added a new Account tab for easily managing your profile. The app will also show off “helpful workshops and exciting events” that are happening at your nearest Apple Store, if you’re into that kind of thing. The Apple Store app lets you buy products online, directly from Apple. It weighs in at a fairly light 30.3MB, and even works on the Apple Watch. To use the app, you need to be running a device with iOS 9.0 or later. The current version has 3.5 out of 5 stars based on 87 ratings. All versions to date have scored 3.5 out of 5 stars, based on a total of 54,300 ratings.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Earlier this summer Apple sparked rumors that it could be pushing into the electricity business after establishing a new company called Apple Energy. Now the Cupertino firm officially has permission to start selling power back to wholesale markets, Bloomberg reports. That means Apple Energy could sell power to public utilities, but can’t offer its electricity directly to consumers. The ruling was ordered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which noted that Apple wasn’t capable of hiking up prices unfairly. The decision goes into effect this Saturday. Apple has been putting a big focus on renewable energy under Tim Cook’s leadership, even building a massive 130-megawatt solar farm in California. The company also owns smaller facilities in Nevada and Arizona. That power is primarily used for its offices and data centers, but Apple clearly has some electricity to spare. The Cupertino company will join Google parent company Alphabet, which also has permission to sell the power it generates through a Google Energy subsidiary. You won’t be paying your utility bill to either tech giant anytime soon, but the power you use could be coming indirectly from a Google or Apple-owned facility.

Google's Android now holds 97 percent of the market as Apple struggles to win customers over with the iPhone. Most devices sold in India are cheap handsets. According to data released yesterday by Strategy Analytics, Android now has an overwhelming command of the Indian smartphone market. Shipments grew 19 percent annually to reach 31 million units during the second quarter of 2016 but only a tiny minority represented Apple's handsets. The company managed to sell just 800,000 phones in the region during the quarter, a significant decline from its already dismal results last year. It shipped 1.2 million iPhones to India in the second quarter of 2015, 50 percent more than it managed in the same period this year. The company's market share has been halved from four percent to just two percent in India during the past year. This has allowed Android to climb up seven percent to a record high of 97 percent market share, achieved through 29.8 million sales during the second quarter of the year. Analysts blamed Apple's famously high pricing for its struggles. It doesn't compete in the low-end budget market, preferring to concentrate on creating premium products that people aspire to and regard as high quality. In India, this approach has been doomed to failure though. With few consumers able to afford an iPhone and the smartphone market still developing, Apple is unable to find buyers for its devices. India is being hailed as the most promising smartphone market in the world, the last remaining significant region that hasn't yet fully emerged onto the Internet. The average price paid for mobile phones in the country is still below $70 though, a problem for Apple which starts its pricing at around $300. "Apple iOS fell 35 percent annually and shipped 0.8 million smartphones in India in Q2 2016," said Woody Oh, Director at Strategy Analytics. "Apple’s smartphone marketshare has halved from four percent to just two percent in India during the past year. Apple iOS will need to reduce iPhone pricing to cheaper levels, attract more operator subsidies and enlarge its retail presence through Apple stores or online channels if it wants to regrow significantly in the future." Apple can't solve its issues simply by selling cheaper phones. It has demonstrated countless times before that it won't create a deliberately low-end or budget-friendly product. Reducing the cost of iPhones could lead to an expectation of price drops in other emerging markets too, leaving Apple unable to raise prices later on without aggravating consumers. However, if the company is to conquer India as it has America and Europe, it needs to start shifting phones. With only 800,000 moving per quarter, iOS is hardly going to be a familiar platform to the majority of Indian consumers. Strategy Analytics said that Android currently looks "unbeatable," supported by a wide range of handset manufacturers and popular services like Google's Gmail. Many of Apple's services, such as iCloud and iTunes, remain relatively obscure in the region. Apple is aware of its problems. During his tour of India earlier this year, CEO Tim Cook told local TV channel NDTV that Apple is "taking a step back" to view India in a more strategic light. He noted that India's smartphone market currently resembles China's as it was "seven to 10 years ago," suggesting Apple could simply wait until it reaches maturity before aggressively promoting phones. That approach is unlikely to work though. With Android already popular in the country and rapidly gaining new features, consumers could become too attached to Google's platform to consider moving to iOS. Apple is already stepping up its efforts in India. It has invested in new facilities in the country and setup an app accelerator to encourage Indian app developers to build for iOS. The company is approaching the country with a long-term development plan to enable it to have a presence "for a thousand years," although it could be a decade before it meets with any real success.

August 6, 2016 10:29am Nasdaq:AAPL ShareTweet News broke on Friday that Apple acquired artificial intelligence company Turi Inc. for around $200 million, fueling speculation on how Apple will leverage the new technology to improve its devices and services. In its typical fashion, Apple was mum about its plans. “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,” the company said in a statement. Turi, which was founded in 2013, offers a slew of advanced services for businesses. From Bloomberg: Turi helps developers create and manage software and services that use a form of AI called machine learning. It also has systems that let companies to build recommendation engines, detect fraud, analyze customer usage patterns and better target potential users, according to the Seattle-based startup’s website. Apple could use this to more rapidly integrate the technology with future products. The most obvious fit for Turi within Apple’s ecosystem is to improve Siri, Apple’s personal assistant. Siri has been around for nearly four years now, and hasn’t changed all that much since its launch. As such, Apple has fallen behind companies like Amazon, whose open-to-developers Alexa service has quickly made huge inroads in the world of voice recognition and commands. Apple has since followed suit and opened Siri to developers as well. Apple has been on a bit of a spending spree acquiring A.I. companies lately. As Bloomberg notes: In January, Apple acquired Emotient, a startup that uses AI to recognize and act upon facial expressions. Last year, Apple acquired a pair of voice-centric AI startups, VocalIQ and Perceptio, to bolster Siri. VocalIQ specialized in using machine learning to allow voice assistants to engage in more realistic conversation. Perceptio focused on helping AI systems run on devices while sharing limited amounts of personal user data. With sales growth of its flagship iPhone faltering, Apple is looking in several different directions to help differentiate its products and offer compelling add-on services to their hundreds of millions of users. Investors can bet that these recent acquisitions will be a big part of its offerings moving forward. AAPL shares closed the week at $107.48 per share, up $1.61 (+1.52%) in Friday trading. The stock has now gained 2.11% year-to-date, versus a 7% rise in the S&P 500 during the same period.

New laptops are purchased, phones are upgraded, accessories are bought, and much more. This year, we’ve decided to give you a breakdown of some of the best technology you can buy for the upcoming school year. In this day and age, laptops are almost essential to the success of a student, especially in college. The idea of dropping over $1000 on a new laptop seems daunting, but thankfully Apple has a handful of incentives in place for students. If you head over to Apple’s Education Store, you’ll see discounts on all of Apple’s laptops and desktops. The 12-inch MacBook starts at $1249, the MacBook Air starts at $849, and the MacBook Pro starts at $999. Apple’s iMac, Mac Pro, and Mac mini are also discounted, but those aren’t necessarily the best choice for students that will be constantly on the move. Personally, my recommendation for students – and what I will be using this school year– is the 12-inch MacBook. The combination of the slim and portable design and beautiful Retina display makes it the best in my opinion for students. Of course, you’ll want to invest in at least a few adapters, but that’s the price you pay for such a portable design. In addition to the existing education discount Apple is providing, the company is also offering a free pair of Beats Solo2 Wireless Headphones with the purchase of a MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, or Mac Pro. This offer will only run for a limited time, however, so don’t wait too long. No matter which MacBook you end up choosing, there are a variety of accessories that will pair nicely. First off, you’ll want to invest in some USB-C accessories if you choose the 12-inch MacBook. Below are some of my favorites: Griffin BreakSafe Magnetic USB-C Charger (full review) Multiport USB 2.0/3.0 Adapter AV Multiport Adapter with USB 3.0 & HDMI Anker PowerCore+ 20100 If you chose any of the other Mac choices, there are some other accessories that I would recommend, as well. (These can also be used with the 12-inch MacBook, just make sure you have the correct adapter if necessary). Despite our ever-growing reliance on the cloud, I still like to carry a flash drive with me at all times, while the TwelveSouth HiRise is the perfect option to free up some much-needed desk space. Additionally, I love to use Bluetooth keyboards when I use a stand with my MacBook. Check out all of my recommendations below: SanDisk Ultra Fit 128GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive TwelveSouth HiRise Stand Apple Magic Trackpad 2 Logitech Performance MX Master Wireless Mouse Western Digital 1TB My Passport Portable Hard Drive If you would like an external monitor to hook up to when needed, my personal favorite remains the 4K-capable Samsung U28E590D, which can be picked up on Amazon for $399 in 28-inch or $339 in 24-inch. Now that you’ve got your computer situation all squared away, there are variety of things that make life easier when it comes to your iPhone and iPad. First and foremost, I highly suggest that anyone living in a dorm or with any roommates pick up a pair of noise-cancelling headphones. After reading Seth’s review earlier this summer, I went out and bought myself a Bose’s new QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones, and I’ve never looked back. They’re pricey at $349, but the ability to have peace and quiet while doing school work is invaluable. If you’re looking for something slightly cheaper, Bose’s QuietComfort 25 headphones are available for $299, but I’d strongly suggest to drop the extra $50 and get the 35s. A variety of other affordable options are available, with reviews, on Amazon. You’ll also definitely want to pick up a pair of earbuds for walks from class to class, downtime, and maybe even during that really boring lecture. Personally, I’m a fan of the urBeats In-Ear offering, which come in at $69.99. Though if Apple is indeed removing the 3.5mm headphone jack with the iPhone 7, a wiser investment might be a solid pair of Bluetooth earbuds. The Jaybird X2 Sport are a great affordable option, especially if you plan on hitting the gym a lot to combat the deadly freshmen 15. Another thing you’ll definitely want to have is a solid Bluetooth speaker. A variety of options exist, but it really just depends on your use cases. Below are some great options at every price point: Small & affordable: UE Mini Boom $37.99 – $46.95 refurbished Midsize: JBL Charge 2+ – $99.89 Powerful: Bose SoundLink III – $299 Runner up: UE MegaBoom – $261.99 For all elements: UE Roll 2 – $99.9 One of my favorite ways to unwind is with Netflix, and at this point the best entertainment box on the market is the fourth-gen Apple TV. With support for apps and games, the Apple TV will be a hit in college dorms for everyone. You can pick one up for $149, although we frequently see deals for far less, so keep your eyes on 9to5Toys, as well. One of the best decisions I made during last school year was investing in an iPad Pro + Apple Pencil. The Apple Pencil Personally, I’m partial to the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. It starts at $579 with the student discount, while the 12.9-inch model starts at $779. For a limited time, you’ll also get a pair of Powerbeats 2 Wireless Headphones for free. If you invest in an iPad Pro, the Apple Pencil is essentially a must have. It makes things like taking notes, annotating papers, peer-reviewing essays, and so much more a lot easierEarlier this year, I rounded up the best apps for taking notes on the iPad Pro with your Apple Pencil, and GoodNotes 4 remains my top choice at the moment. The Apple Pencil runs $99. Finally, there are a handful of less exciting things that are very useful for students, especially those living in a dorm. You’ll want to keep all your electronics clean, so investing in a cleaning cloth and spray is a must. A desk lamp is also vital for late-night studying. Cable management is also vital, otherwise you’ll end up with a mess of wires and a fire hazard. View my picks for all of these problems below: Lightline 1250 LED Desk Light w/ USB Port  Tech Armor Complete Cleaning Kit Velcro Cable Ties Bluelounge CableBox Anker PowerCore 5000 Do you have any recommendations for students when it comes to tech products and accessories?

By Mark Gurman and Sarah McBride. Added by Agency Staff on 6 August 2016. Saved under Top, World Tags: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Siri, Turi Tweet Turi’s technology could feed into Apple’s Siri digital assistant Apple has acquired artificial intelligence start-up Turi for about US$200m, according to people familiar with the situation, in the latest deal by the iPhone maker to accumulate advanced computing capabilities for its products and services. Turi helps developers create and manage software and services that use a form of AI called machine learning. It also has systems that let companies to build recommendation engines, detect fraud, analyse customer usage patterns and better target potential users, according to the Seattle-based start-up’s website. Apple could use this to more rapidly integrate the technology with future products. Apple’s move on Friday is part of a broader battle among Google, Facebook and Amazon to gain an edge in AI, particularly in the field known as pervasive computing, where software tries to automatically infer what people want, one of the people said. Turi’s technology could feed into Apple’s Siri digital assistant, the person added, and help define new ways computers interact with people. “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,” Apple said in a statement. GeekWire earlier reported the acquisition. Apple sees its Turi acquisition as a way to better tap into the growing community of AI researchers, said a person familiar with the deal. Apple has been criticised by researchers for being too secretive about its AI work. In contrast, Turi held a two-day machine-learning conference in July in San Francisco for data scientists and academics. Formerly known as Dato, Turi raised more than $25m from venture capital investors including New Enterprise Associates and Madrona Venture Group, according to CrunchBase. Turi couldn’t be reached for comment on the deal. The Turi team will remain in Seattle, one of the people familiar with the situation said. Apple has purchased multiple firms over the past couple of years that specialise in artificial intelligence. The company has also begun to integrate these technologies into products such as its iPhone software and Siri. In January, Apple acquired Emotient, a start-up that uses AI to recognise and act upon facial expressions. Last year, Apple acquired a pair of voice-centric AI startups, VocalIQ and Perceptio, to bolster Siri. VocalIQ specialised in using machine learning to allow voice assistants to engage in more realistic conversation. Perceptio focused on helping AI systems run on devices while sharing limited amounts of personal user data. Machine learning and AI help computers automatically understand images, videos and spoken words. The technologies also allow systems to take actions or make recommendations on such data. Apple has already begun to show the fruits of its AI investments via better keyword recognition by Siri across multiple product lines. Apple will release a new version of its photo management program for iPhones and iPads that uses AI to recognise objects in photos. For example, a user will be able to search for “sushi” and photographs of the food will appear. Apple will also bring machine-learning capabilities to its iMessage application by adding a feature this fall that translates words in texts into emoji icons.  — (c) 2016 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 9Why SA Connect tender was cancelled 9Vodacom to launch VOD platform 7A radical proposal for state-owned fibre 5MTN’s Mteto Nyati takes the fight to No 1 5One day I will tell you the truth – Zuma Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

The race is on against rivals such as Google, Amazon or Facebook, but Apple lately bought itself some aces to keep up its sleeve.  ( Apple ) Advertisement Apple puts the pedal to the metal to take over its rivals from Google, Amazon and Facebook in machine learning capabilities, and for that it recently purchased Turi, an AI startup from Seattle. Turi's technologies should help Apple boost its advances in pervasive computing capabilities. For those who skipped that lesson, pervasive computing allows a software (such as a virtual assistant) to make appropriate suggestions to a user on whatever topic they may ask about. For example, the suggestions that appear when a movie, music video or article ends could get better via pervasive computing. To broaden its resource pool, Apple bought AI startup Turi in a transaction rumored to be around $200 million. Turi has impressive expertise in developing and managing various software that tap into a very specific type of Artificial Intelligence, dubbed machine learning. Machine learning is also able to generate better recommendations and crunch customer data to determine or pinpoint accuracy user patterns. All these will come in handy for Apple, which is allegedly going to implement Turi's tricks into its virtual assistant, Siri. When asked about the perspectives of integrating Turi with Siri, Apple chose discretion. In a statement, the company notes that it is common for it to purchase small-scale technology companies and underlines in that discussion that the purpose and plans of the acquisitions fall outside of Apple's modus operandi. Apple scored a consistent list of recent purchases, and Business Insider points out that most of them seem to be AI oriented. Noteworthy buyouts are counting names such as VocalIQ, Perceptio, Emotient and Faceshift, with the first two sharing some of Turi's traits. VocalIQ made use of machine learning to help voice assistants respond in a highly realistic fashion to inquiries. Perceptio, on the other hand, aided the internal processes of AI by sharing bits of personal user data from the respective systems. These two should be important pillars to improve upcoming versions of Siri, insiders familiar with the matter point out. On the visual side of the spectrum, Emotient and Faceshift were startups that specialized in enhancing the capabilities of AI to recognize facial expressions. Apple's helm, Tim Cook, stated that his company's AI focus went toward building features that would "enhance the customer experience." The CEO went on to add that the company plans to deploy machine learning in a variety of products and services.

In English На русском Հայերեն Full version August 6, 2016 - 15:58 AMT SHARE Apple buys Seattle-based AI startup Turi for $200 million Apple has snapped up a Seattle-based startup called Turi that specializes in machine learning, likely in an effort to boost its products' AI capabilities, Engadget said. Ever the secretive corporation, Cupertino hasn't released details about the acquisition besides confirming it to Recode and other publications. A spokesperson merely answered all questions with this statement: "Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans." According to GeekWire, though, the company bought the startup for around $200 million. It's still unclear what Apple plans to do with Turi, but a Bloomberg source said its machine-learning technology could give Siri new ways to interact with people. Since company also uses AI to recommend songs and apps, predict words you're about to type and to recognize images, among other things, it could do a lot more than improve Apple's voice assistant. The source added that the acquisition would enable Apple to connect with the growing community of AI researchers, as well. Unlike the tech titan, which is very tight-lipped when it comes to the products it's developing, Turi has a better relationship with third-party researchers. It even held a machine-learning conference for data scientists in July. SHARE PanARMENIAN.Net © 2000—2016

(Kagan McLeod / For The Times) Russ Mitchell If you're wondering about Elon Musk's latest vision for Tesla, think Apple. Apple succeeded in turning a bland market for electronic devices into a coveted and connected lifestyle where your phone, your tablet, your computer, your watch and your television can all be bought in one place and work seamlessly together. It’s about passion too. People continue to line up at Apple stores overnight to be the first to possess the latest iPhone. The company’s launch events resemble the gathering of a cult. At Tesla Motors, Musk tapped into that kind of branding magic when he built electric cars that drive fast and look good. The spring launch of the upcoming Model 3 evoked an Apple-like frenzy in stores and online. Now he’s looking to create his own ecosystem, this one centered on sustainable energy, solar panels and batteries. It’s a much less sexy realm than cars but at least as ambitious. In recent weeks, Musk began to rapidly expand the Tesla footprint: merging with SolarCity to bring a major solar energy company into the fold, and laying out a sweeping “master plan” to transform Tesla beyond cars, by expanding into eco-friendly trucks and buses, ride-sharing and more. The bold entrepreneur envisions Tesla stores as all-in-one destinations for green-minded shoppers, where one can buy an electric car, a charging station, a solar rooftop for the house and a futuristic-looking battery to store the excess power, all in the same place. What really matters is how do we get a lot of people to make the transition, not just a few. — Elon Musk, Tesla CEO “In order for people to go en masse to sustainability, you really need to create something that doesn't have a lot of compromises,” Musk said Friday in an interview with The Times. “Easy to order, easy to install, looks great when done.”  But unlike Apple, which sells far less expensive consumer products, Tesla is venturing into new territory at a time when it hasn’t proved that it can make money or meet production deadlines. To become the first provider of a comprehensive clean energy lifestyle, Musk needs to sell not just products, but present the combined company as a fresh creator of a new way of living, with image and branding and marketing that convince consumers of all kinds to shell out big bucks to be part of it. “We’ve got to reach people for whom the environment is not their top priority,” Musk said. “What really matters is how do we get a lot of people to make the transition, not just a few.”  Noah Hagey, 43, a lawyer and co-founder of the BraunHagey & Borden law firm in San Francisco, is already part of the tribe.

This week, Autopilot helped me drive a Tesla Model S luxury electric sedan from the Bay Area to Reno, about 240 miles on Interstate 80. The next day, it helped me drive back. Everybody I talk to wants to know: Did I like the car? Did I like Autopilot? Is it ready for prime time? My answers: Yes,... (Russ Mitchell) First his family bought a Tesla Model S sedan, which they considered a jumping-off point for environmental good deeds. A few months later, they installed solar panels on the roof of their Oakland hills home. When Tesla’s Powerwall went on sale, Hagey put in an order. “It just seemed like the obvious thing to do, to see how off the grid you can get,” Hagey said. He didn’t buy panels from SolarCity. Instead, Hagey chose a local contractor experienced with tricky-to-work-with Spanish tile roofs. But if the Tesla showroom had had solar panels on offer, “I could have seen doing a package deal,” he said. “It’s kind of shocking how well the stuff this guy builds works.” Now Musk needs many, many more customers like Hagey for his plan to work. Right now, Tesla’s main draw is upper-income households. Most people can’t afford a Model S, which starts at $70,000, and many millennials can’t even afford a house, much less a solar roof. Hagey knows this and is counting on Musk to lower costs over time. “This thing has to be mass market,” he said. “That’s the only way it’s going to work.” But to be mass market, going green has to have mass appeal. As it is, early adopters have flocked to the save-the-world philosophy espoused by Musk, but many everyday consumers simply aren’t there yet -- and cool marketing might not be enough to convince them otherwise. “You buy Tesla because of the brand,” said Shayle Kann, a vice president at news and research firm GreenTech Media. “You’re not doing it to save money. Whereas with solar, the single thing that has been most important in getting the widespread adoption of solar … is people saving money on their electric bills.” Most people have reliable electric service, and many aren’t convinced that they’ll save enough money with solar to make installation worth it. And the subject can be enormously complicated. Fewer than 5% of U.S. homes have solar panels, although that number is growing fast. Meanwhile, the market for storing power from solar panels – which was less than $200 million in 2012 – will have grown to $19 billion by 2017, according to a report by IMS Research. Tesla store in Pasadena. Al Seib / Los Angeles Times Tesla store in Pasadena. Tesla store in Pasadena. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times) Musk figures that Tesla stores will offer a convenient spot for consumer education. By consolidating the buying process using Tesla’s established — and rapidly growing — footprint of retail stores that are trafficked by serious buyers and people who just want to look at a hot car, he predicts that he can move solar into the mainstream. “You want one sales process, one installation event, no finger-pointing if something's not working, one service contract, one app to see how it’s doing and make adjustments,” Musk said during the interview. “It’s what you’d want as the end customer.” Tesla has opened 260 stores to date -- most in upscale markets -- and plans a total of 441 by the end of 2017, when Tesla's relatively affordable Model 3 is expected to become available. Owned by Tesla and staffed by Tesla employees, the stores serve as retail showrooms for the company's sleek and expensive Model S electric sedan and Model X electric SUV. Soon, solar panels will join the merchandise mix. Many of these showrooms are located within walking distance of Apple stores, and in fact Tesla consciously drew on those stores for inspiration, with their airy feel, dutiful employees and emphasis on fine design. The company has counted 3 million visitors so far. They demonstrate an interest in solar living just by walking through the door. They might be attracted by the vehicles, but Musk said it’s the connection between home-solar batteries and rooftop panels that’s the key to his energy ecosystem. Already, the Powerwall, Tesla’s new solar battery for the home, is on prominent Tesla showroom display. It stores excess energy during the day to charge a car, provide electricity at night or serve as backup in a blackout emergency. The price starts at $3,000.

(Jerome Adamstein / Los Angeles Times) The Powerwall’s most notable aspect is its appearance. Competing batteries, just as functional, look like chunks of industrial equipment. The Powerwall is a sleek piece of sculpture, harmonizing with the lines of the Model S it hangs next to. SolarCity's rooftop panel installations aren't nearly so sexy. Musk said he wants to address that. They need to be “beautiful,” he said. "This is very important," he said at a media event last month at Tesla’s new battery factory near Reno. "This needs to be an asset to your house. It needs to be so good that when it's done you call your neighbors over to show them how proud you are. " Before he makes solar panels beautiful, Musk will have to make them look attractive in the stores and online, to fit the stores’ Tesla motif.  Three weeks ago, Tesla lured Chester Chipperfield – a handsome young man with blond locks – from Apple and named him global creative director. Although a customer will be able to buy what might be called the Full Tesla, a complete package including car, charger, solar rooftop and battery, the company will be happy to break it into sub-components for customers who don’t want it all. Those pieces, however, all will come with Tesla software to manage home and auto energy use. The more the software is integrated into a full system, the more powerful the system becomes. And, as with Apple, the less likely you are to switch to someone else’s information ecosystem. That’s called lock-in. If you like the system, great. If not, you’re kind of stuck. Longtime Silicon Valley watcher Rob Enderle, who runs Enderle Group research, said it’s likely that Tesla could expand its energy management software throughout the home, covering major appliances and smaller household objects equipped with silicon chips and connected through the so-called Internet of Things. “It moves Tesla from being a car company to being a home automation company, and a powerful one,” Enderle said, going up against companies like Google’s Nest. And it will distinguish Tesla from other automakers. “Tesla would be part of your home, not just part of your transportation system,” he said. “That brings them much closer to their customers, far more than any other car company. That’s something no one else has.” At this point, there’s more theory than substance to Musk’s vision. There’s no guarantee that people are ready to flock to solar power in the numbers necessary for success. There’s no assurance that he can bring prices down for cars and energy systems low enough to appeal to the masses. It’s unclear whether a market exists for a home energy software ecosystem powerful enough to hold customers loyal. “It doesn’t make any business sense at all,” says Jim Nelson, chief executive at Sunworks, a SolarCity competitor and a corporate customer of Tesla’s Powerwall. “The solar business and the electric car business are unrelated businesses. They are artificially connected.” A self-driving trip down the 101 Freeway in a Tesla Jason Fudenberg, president of the Los Angeles Tesla Owners Club, drives a Tesla using autopilot on the 101 Freeway near Sherman Oaks.

The SolarCity deal seems more like a bailout by the better-capitalized Tesla than an organic business strategy, several financial analysts have opined. But Musk has proved himself capable of beating odds and delivering the goods, from his early days at PayPal, to the surprising success of his SpaceX rocket launching company, to the rabid consumer embrace of Tesla automobiles. Except for the short sellers, nobody’s counting him out. One aspirational fanboy is Michael Figueroa, 39, of Laguna Hills. One day, he plans to trade his Acura or Volkswagen for a Tesla Model X. He’s already had a SolarCity array installed on his home’s roof. A Powerwall is on the wish list too. “I want to manage my energy on my own. That’s where the future’s going,” Figueroa said. “No other company is trying to capitalize on that, and that’s what I’m looking for.” Times staff writers Samantha Masunaga and Ivan Penn in Los Angeles contributed to this report. russ.mitchell@latimes.com @russ1mitchell   MORE BUSINESS NEWS Long Beach Airport gets more routes as competition heats up Cheap fares fueled the rise of ride-hailing.

Courtesy of #DisarmTheiPhone — New Yorkers Against Gun Violence   Caitlin Dewey Washington Post     Gun control measures have stalled in the legislature repeatedly. But there does appear to be one place where gun control is catching on: the ever-more-political world of emoji. On Monday, Apple announced that the next update to its emoji catalog would style the "gun" icon as a toy, rather than a pistol. That follows the recent, unusual decision by the Unicode Consortium, the tech industry group that approves emoji, not to include glyphs of a rifle and a man shooting a pistol in its next release. "If guns are to be controlled, then they need to be marginalized, not mainstreamed," said Gill Marshall-Andrews, the head of the U.K.'s Gun Control Network and one of many advocates cheering the disarmament of emoji. "I think it's a good move to take them away ... It's a small step, but it says something." Marshall-Andrew's group, the oldest in the U.K., is one of two major gun-control organizations to make emoji an issue of late. Last year, the group's charitable arm, Infer Trust, condemned two characters that were proposed to the Unicode Consortium ahead of the 2016 Olympic Games: one, a rifle, was meant to signify "marksmanship, sport shooting, hunting," according to its proposal; the other, which included a man shooting a rifle, depicted the "modern pentathlon." Speaking to the BBC in October 2015, a representative of Infer Trust called the characters "offensive" to victims of gun violence. (Neither was approved for use as emoji by the Unicode Consortium.) Meanwhile, in the U.S., the nonprofit New Yorkers Against Gun Violence has spent the past year waging a high-profile PR campaign against Apple's pistol emoji. The campaign, called #DisarmTheiPhone, urged Apple to nix or redesign the icon in order to draw attention to the toll of gun violence and continued legislative inaction. While Apple has declined to release any statement on its new pistol emoji design, making it unclear what prompted it, NYAGV has already taken some credit. "We welcome Apple's decision to dump the pistol emoji," the organization's executive director, Leah Gunn Barrett, said in a statement. "We believe that Apple, a socially progressive company, was influenced not only by our campaign last summer but also by the horrendous toll gun violence continues to take on American society, with over 33,000 dead and 84,000 maimed each year at a cost of $229 billion." And yet -- unsurprisingly -- not everyone is happy to see Apple involve itself in the great gun control debate. At Business Insider, the tech reporter Rob Price argued that one company's unilateral decision to change the meaning of an emoji constituted a "terrifying abuse of power" that could confuse, and even endanger, its users. Jeremy Burge, the founder of Emojipedia and an expert on emoji use, is similarly concerned that the change will prompt miscommunications between people using Apple's emoji keyboards ... and those using Samsung, Google, Facebook and Twitter's. (Notably, police have arrested several people based on nothing but their emoji use.) "Is this not endangering iOS users if they send a water gun emoji for fun in a tweet which is seen as a gun by everyone else?" Burge said. "Some emojis are strange, perhaps inappropriate, but they are there for legacy reasons." The National Rifle Association did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but we can't imagine they're particularly pleased, either. Followers of the account @NRANews erupted in a frenzy of gun emoji and promises to switch to Android after the account tweeted Apple's emoji news. Gun-rights advocates shouldn't fret too much, though: At the very moment Apple was disarming its gun emoji, one of its competitors was doing the exact opposite. Microsoft has long represented the "gun" emoji as a toy on its devices; in the Microsoft 10 Anniversary release, however, the character will become more realistic.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Health Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Apple falters in India as Android continues to grow; why iPhones don't sell Apple's iPhones sales in India have plummeted in the second quarter (Q2) of this year, while Android saw a huge growth. Raymond Ronamai   August 6, 2016 17:40 IST 12 Shares 12 Shares Apple Inc.REUTERS/Mike Segar While several smartphone companies are looking at India as a leading emerging market, Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook seems to be more interested in China at the moment. And that is apparent from the sales of the iPhone in India, the world's second most populated country and the world's third largest smartphone market, after China and the United States. According to a data released by market research firm Strategy Analytics (via BusinessWire), Apple's iPhones sales in India have plummeted in the second quarter (Q2) of this year, while that of its rivals — Android phones — saw a huge growth. Why advertise with us? Related IPhone 7 release date, features, price, other details: Front panel leaked; launch imminent Will iPhone 7 Plus don blue colour? According to the report, total smartphone shipments in India grew 19 percent annually from 25.8 million units in Q2 2015 to 30.7 million in Q2 2016. It says that 29.8 million or 97 percent smartphones run on Google's Android. The share of Android in the Indian smartphone market was 90 percent last year. However, Apple sold only 0.8 million iPhones in the Q2 this year in India as compared to 1.2 million units sold in Q2, 2015. This means the company's share in Indian smartphone market has dropped to 2.4 percent from 4.5 percent in Q2 last year. Apple's iPhone sales usually drop in the first half of every year as it's an off season but the rate at which it falls may worry the company's think-tank. It is not just the numbers but the need for Indian consumers to be comfortable in iOS ecosystem is a vital concern as well. At the moment, Apple does not appear to be seriously considering penetration into India's smartphone market, as it hasn't done two basic things — to expand its stores and reduce the price of its products. Indian consumers are price-conscious, which is why Chinese companies that offer feature-rich smartphones at reasonable price are witnessing phenomenal growth in the country. So Apple has to consider the pricing of its iPhones if it wants a reasonable share in Indian market. The company also need to expand its stores across the country — even in small cities and towns. It is the only way to find consumers, the company may soon realise.

Apple is betting big on India. But it seems that the company has a tough task at hand. According to a report from Strategy Analytics, the company shipped 800,000 smartphones in India in Q2 2016, this compares to 1.2 million smartphones it shipped during the same quarter last year. Says, Woody Oh, director at Strategy Analytics, added, "Apple iOS fell 35% annually and shipped 0.8 million smartphones in India in Q2 2016. Apple's smartphone marketshare has halved from 4% to just 2% in India during the past year." According to him, it's time Apple works on iPhone's pricing in the country as cheaper devices will surely help boost sales. "Apple iOS will need to reduce iPhone pricing to cheaper levels, attract more operator subsidies and enlarge its retail presence through Apple stores or online channels if it wants to regrow significantly in the future," adds Oh. This surely is not a good news for the Cupertino giant who is planning to open its company-owned stores in India. At its recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said, "In the first three quarters of this fiscal year, our iPhone sales in India were up 51 per cent year-on-year. We are looking forward to opening retail stores in India down the road and we see huge potential for that vibrant country," Cook told analysts during an earnings call on Tuesday. Apple's fiscal year 2016 runs from September 27, 2015 to September 24, 2016." During the call, and China during his recent visit to these countries. The company said that iPhone sales during the April-June quarter grew in double digits in key markets, including India, Japan, Turkey, Brazil, Canada and Sweden. Cook also reiterated that Apple has launched a centre to support Indian developers creating applications for its iOS operating system and has opened an office in Hyderabad to accelerate map development. Currently, India is the world's third-largest smartphone market after China and US. Smartphone shipments grew 19% annually to reach 31 million units in India during the second quarter of 2016.

Solar power from Apple could light up your home https://t.co/0CxKyQBa2V pic.twitter.com/hYjTqjS9Kt— Fortune (@FortuneMagazine) August 5, 2016 With the new agreement, Apple will begin to sell energy generated at its $850 million solar power farm in California. Apple has been operating the solar power facility since 2015. A year ago Apple entered into a $850 million partnership with sun-farm firm First Solar. The 2,900-acre plant is located in Monterey County. The plant generates around 130 megawatts of solar energy per year. The agreement was reached between Apple and the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Tim Ream (@ourcarbon): "Court rules Apple can legally start selling #solar power." The excess energy (beyond what Apple needs for its own uses) will be sold onto the wholesale energy market. On paper, the amount of energy passed on would be enough to power 60,000 California homes each year. However, this might not be achieved in practice. According to Dr Niall Mac Dowell, who is a lecturer in energy and environmental technology at Imperial College London, "Just because Apple has invested in that capacity does not mean they'll get the same level of energy from it." Other commentators see a more positive outcome. GTM Research analyst Colin Smith, in an interview with Money Herald, said: "It allows them to sell electricity into the wholesale markets and also use the wholesale markets as sort of a hedge." Smith added: "If they’re buying power at 10 cents per kilowatt hour and wholesale power prices happen to move up to 15 cents, they can actually sell power directly and pocket the difference. This turns them much more into an independent power producer and really enables them to work the energy markets more freely." Prue Turner x (@PrueTurnerxx): "Apple should put solar panels on the back of the next iPhone so we can charge our phones with solar power." In related news, by varying the types of environmental gases researchers have been able to enhance the efficiency of solar cells so that they 'grow' in power on exposure to a special gas mixture.

This hasn't gone far enough according to some campaigners, who remain worried about the symbolism of the emoji. Can you imagine if everyone had these instead of real guns? We could go from Dead for being black to Wet https://t.co/e25fVcqmAd— Ugo Daté (@ugodate) August 6, 2016 Apple have been urged to rethink a gun emoji change made last month. Apple, in response to a further round of shootings in the U.S., altered an emoji of handgun to a seemingly less offensive water pistol. For some campaigners, concerned about the accessibility of firearms and violence in the U.S., the new graphic — if sent to an unsuspecting person — could still be misconstrued as a symbol of violence. In addition, campaigners are concerned that any graphic resembling any kind of firearm is insensitive and inappropriate in 2016. The main call for a further change has come from the Emojipedia website. The custodians of all things emoji argue that the sanitized symbol may still appear as a lifelike gun, especially in messages received by non-iOS users. The before and after pictures to the emoji are shown below: Apple has launched a series of more than 100 new and updated emojis. It's replaced the gun with a water pistol and put out new designs it hopes will be more inclusive. Apple Quoted by the BBC, Apple has said it wants to "ensure that popular emoji characters reflect the diversity of people everywhere". Despite the modification Jeremy Burge, editor of Emojipedia, told the BBC: "The thing is, emojis already look different on different platforms and it does cause confusion. "When we're dealing with guns and toys as a comparison, that's a whole new level of problems that we have there." The change has also bee poorly received on social media, with some thinking the change still hints of danger to others mocking the change: Ugo Daté (@ugodate): "Can you imagine if everyone had these instead of real guns? We could go from Dead for being black to Wet." AMIR® (@yoitzmir):@ "Whats the difference?" jessicaღ (@xojessmarie): "cause we can have gun control in emojis, but not real life." The Twitter feed on the subject is extensive. Perhaps oddly, in light of the Apple decision, Microsoft has announced this week that its toy gun symbol is to be redesigned as a more realistic-looking firearm.

The smartphone giant has reportedly acquired AI startup Turi for $200 million. According to a report in GeetWire, "The acquisition reflects a larger push by Apple into artificial intelligence and machine learning. It also promises to further increase the Cupertino, California-based company's presence in the Seattle region, where Apple has been building an engineering outpost for the past two years." In a statement Apple told GeekWire, "Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans." Incidentally, this is Apple's standard reply to queries regarding acquisitions made by the company. Seattle-based Turi offers machine learning tools. "Turi toolkits simplify development of machine learning models. Each incorporates automatic feature engineering, model selection, and machine learning visualizations specific to the application," says the company on its website. Apple has also acquired some other machine learning and AI-related startups in recent months like VocalIQ, Emotient and Perceptio. The company uses artificial intelligence to power its Google Now and Microsoft Cortana-rival Siri. The iPhone maker, however, is also said to be working on some other AI-based initiatives too. Over the last few months, there appears to be a race among IT giants to grab AI startups. Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook and many other IT companies have increased their focus on artificial intelligence. The companies are said to be making big investments in the technology. There have been several big acquisitions in the area in 2016. Last month, Google acquired Moodstocks, a Paris-based startup that develops machine learning-based image recognition technology for smartphones. Just weeks earlier, Twitter acquired Magic Pony to advance its machine learning capabilities.

What the hell is going on with Project Titan?! Come on, Apple, throw us a bone, or a seed, or whatever fits the metaphor. Photo by VCG/Getty Images Until Apple actually comes out and says, "Here's what we're doing with cars," the media will continue to make wild guesses as to what its secret project entails. The rumor mill has been at full steam lately, and it's bound to stay that way with Apple's latest hire. The tech giant acquired the services of Dan Dodge earlier this year, Bloomberg reports. Dodge is a former CEO of QNX, BlackBerry's automotive-software division. He'll be part of the team that reports to yet another recent hire, Bob Mansfield, a former Apple hardware executive. According to Bloomberg's sources, this hiring points to a shift in Apple's automotive strategy, apparently codenamed Project Titan. Those sources claim that Apple's shifting its focus from hardware (a car) to autonomous software development, which means Apple's efforts could be used in cars other than its own. Of course, we have our own ideas as to what Apple's up to. Thanks to an investment in Didi Chuxing, a Chinese Uber rival, Roadshow's editor-in-chief Tim Stevens thinks Apple could be deploying an autonomous ridesharing service. Given Apple's continued silence on the matter, there'll likely be plenty more conjecture before we figure out what's actually going on.

But that hasn't stopped people from leaking vital details, including release date, features and design. Now, a photograph showing the front panel of the purportedly smartphone has been published, giving a hint that its launch is imminent, most probably in the next few weeks. The Cupertino giant is expected to release the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in the third quarter of the year as its predecessor the iPhone 6s will complete a year cycle in the market by this time.

And now that Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is official, the Apple iPhone 7 is the next big launch to happen soon. Apple is expected to launch its new iPhone range in September, which is the usually the month when Apple hosts iPhone launch event every year. Rumors and conjectures so far have suggested the launch of Apple iPhone 7 and Apple iPhone 7 Plus. Rumors have hinted that the new iPhones will not feature audio jack. Previous reports have also showed off what could be the next iteration of iPhone headsets. SEE ALSO: Future group & Paytm tie-up to take Big Bazaar online To back the previous rumors, a new photograph has surfaced that purportedly shows the front panel of the Apple iPhone 7. Leaked photos show the cutouts for the speaker and the proximity sensors, but these contradict with the previous leaks of the iPhone 7. However, the design of the iPhone 7, as seen in the leaked photos, goes in line with Japan's Mac Otakara's report which mentioned that iPhone 7 will have a larger ear speaker and feature two proximity sensors. Going by everything rumors have suggested so far, the Apple iPhone 7 will have significant design change. The phone will be launched without a 3.5mm earphone jack, because the space for jack will be used to place the second set of speaker grilles on the bottom of the phone. The company has reportedly also removed the antenna lines, and moved it the top edge and bottom edge of the phone.

People who wanted to purchase an updated iPad Air were left disappointed in 2015 as Apple decided to launch a new version of the smaller iPad Mini 4 and the much larger iPad Pro (12.9-inch), which the company has since shrunk down to feature another offering with a 9.7-inch display. According to Macworld UK, we can expect an Apple iPad Air 3 to be announced this year. Several people expect to the launch of the new iPad in September, along with the iPhone 7. At the moment it still remains unknown if Apple is actually planning on releasing an iPad Air 3, but it is likely that it will announce a new line of iPad’s this fall. Rumours around the iPad Air 3 remain as rife as ever, with one particular one suggesting that the new iPad might feature a digital crown like the Apple Watch. It is also expected to be thinner than the previous generation. Other rumours include the introduction of a Smart Connector, that will allow users to connect to devices like the Apple keyboard and pen. The iPad Air 3 design is also rumoured to feature 7000-series aluminium like the iPhone 6S/6S Plus, which will make it much tougher than its predecessor. The new iPad might come in four colours that have been well known with Apple’s mobile lineup – Space Grey, Rose Gold, Gold and Silver. Apple iPad Air 3 is also rumoured to pick up a few things in the hardware department from the iPad Pro, including the A9X chip and rear-facing LED flash. It now remains to be seen if Apple really has done away with the Air series for good, or will the iPad Air 3 rumours come to fruition.

The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Google’s Android captured 97% Indian smartphone market share in Q2 2016: Report Google’s Android captured 97% Indian smartphone market share in Q2 2016: Report Google's Android OS captured 97 per cent share of the India's smartphone market in Q2 2016, while Apple iOS fell 35 per cent annually. By: Tech Desk | Published:August 6, 2016 2:49 pm Google’s Android OS captured 97 per cent share of the India’s smartphone market in Q2 2016, while Apple iOS fell 35 per cent annually. Google’s Android OS captured 97 per cent share of the India’s smartphone market in Q2 2016, reveals a report by Strategy Analytics. “Android maintained first position across India with a record 97 percent OS share for the quarter, up from 90 per cent a year ago. Android dominates the India smartphone market and looks unbeatable right now, due to its deep portfolio of hardware partners, extensive distribution channels, and a wide range of low-cost apps like Gmail,” said Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytic. Android shipped 29.8 million smartphones in India in Q2 2016 as compared to 23.2 million in Q2 2015. According to Rajeev Nair, who is Senior Analyst at Strategy Analytic, the total smartphones shipment grew 19 per cent annually from 25.8 units in Q2 2015 to 30.7 million in Q2 2016. “India is currently the world’s third largest smartphone market, after China and the US. India is growing quickly due to low smartphone penetration rates, an expanding middle class with more disposable income, and intense competition among major vendors, retailers and operators,” he said. The report highlights Apple iOS shipped only 0.8 million smartphones in India in Q2 2016. Apples’ marketshare in India has halved from 4 per cent last year to 2 per cent in Q2 2016. “Apple iOS fell 35 percent annually. Apple iOS will need to reduce iPhone pricing to cheaper levels, attract more operator subsidies and enlarge its retail presence through Apple stores or online channels if it wants to regrow significantly in the future,” says Woody Oh, Director at Strategy Analytics. Apple iOS fell 35 percent annually. Apple, however, had a different story to tell at its third quarter earning call last month. According to Apple’s report, the company saw 51 per cent growth in iPhone sales in India. Clearly, with Android OS capturing 97 per cent market share in India; the Cupertino giant will need more than just pacing up to get closer to these numbers.

A USA Today Network – Ohio investigation found all of this seemingly happened without its board noticing until it was “within months” of running out of money, but the former CEO contends that’s not the case. Marion-based META Solutions is a taxpayer-financed entity that provides internet and technology services for schools, and runs a digital academy. It provides services for about 200 school districts across Ohio. At least 13 public agencies in Richland County have worked with META’s purchasing co-op, including Mansfield City Schools and the Mansfield-Richland County Library, according to an online list. Some may also contract for other services. While META was touted as a boon to districts, the rise of financial problems has coincided with the departure of most of its top executives and much of its board. The investigation reviewed numerous public records to determine how the situation became so dire. Was it moving too fast to lower fees for new customers? Or were leadership’s use of taxpayer money – meals at a five-star restaurant, hundreds of Apple Watches for staff, and cars for personal use – responsible? It’s a combination of things, according to Jim Sotlar, who was promoted to president of META’s board in June. “You trust the people who are running an organization are telling you the right information ... You live and learn,” Sotlar said. Sudden cuts META Solutions’ first-ever five-year financial forecast seemed rosy at first glance — revenues more than doubling to $49.5 million by 2019 and its fund balance maintaining about $2 million every year. But only if its board of public school superintendents acted quickly to slash $3.1 million in expenses. Although dozens of staff were cut, META’s interim CEO Wade Lucas, a former superintendent at Coshocton City Schools and Olentangy Local Schools, said it will be the end of August before he and interim CFO David Varda know if more cuts are needed. They’ll also be evaluating a future fee increase for core services. “We will run this organization as efficiently as we can, and whatever has to be done, we’re going to have to get it done,” Lucas said. The board requested the financial forecast in April — more than a year after META was formed through a merger signed in February 2015. The board began to increase its oversight, specifically with CEO Mike Carder and CFO Adam Collier, in February when issues at would-be partner South Central Ohio Computer Association in Piketon were discovered, said board President Jim Sotlar, who served as vice president from day one until his June promotion to president. The month before, Collier had taken over the position from Scott Armstrong who stepped back into the role of deputy chief fiscal officer. The board learned of nearly $1 million in unpaid bills at SCOCA and email records indicate concerns about how federal subsidies were handled. The Ohio auditor is investigating, and Lucas confirmed there also is a federal investigation at SCOCA. MANSFIELD NEWS JOURNAL Feds probe SCOCA not paying Ohio schools tech cash “Anytime you have something like that ... you want to make sure you’re doing everything right,” Sotlar, superintendent at Canal Winchester schools, said, noting he can’t divulge details about the concerns at SCOCA. As the board began asking questions about operations of META — which grew from about 50 districts to 200 within a year — Sotlar said there were “red flags” and “discrepancies” related to personnel, revenues, and expenses. “Not having a good business plan along with a staffing plan ... that is what led to today,” Sotlar said, adding they’re trying to make sure it doesn’t happen again. “We did ask the right questions (of the administrative team). We didn’t always get the right answers.” There also are overdue bills — the overall number and amount of which are unclear because Lucas and Varda started less than a month ago, Lucas said. A July bill from K12 Enterprise, which sold human resources management software to META districts, shows a balance of more than $60,000 with most of it past 60 days due. Lucas said they are in the process of challenging some of the charges, but overall are getting a better grasp of what is owed and developing a plan to get them paid. In April, the board approved a no confidence vote in Carder, Collier, and Chief Operating Officer Jamie Grube. Armstrong's title wasn't among those noted in meeting minutes. Carder contends the issues derived from a difference in philosophy from the merged boards as well as among the two men chosen to succeed him and Armstrong. However, Sotlar admitted board members have learned there are things they could do better. For example, read contracts. Every. Single. Word. Perks of the job When META officially formed in March 2015, the boards of its two parts — Tri-Rivers Education Computer Association and Digital Academy and Metropolitan Education Council — blended into one. Sotlar came from MEC while Bob Britton, superintendent of Ridgedale Local Schools in Marion County, came from TRECA. Britton was president until he resigned in June along with Carder and Armstrong. The merger was touted as a way for school districts to save thousands of dollars on information technology services. Ohio law created regional information technology centers to lower the cost of services like internet and technicians, by sharing the cost among districts. They are owned by their public schools and overseen by a board of school superintendents. The merger aimed to boost those savings even more. Carder and Armstrong both came from TRECA, where they had previously retired and had been rehired, and their contracts carried over to META for approval. Details on their severance/retirement payouts — both under TRECA and from this year — have been requested but not yet received. According to Sotlar, at least the bulk of the board didn’t notice the perks included for the two men in those contracts. Carder contends the board was aware of the details and that there was discussion to mirror them when directors from the merger partners came on staff. Carder, who was paid $182,653.87 in 2015, was provided a 7 percent annuity along with a car — fueled, maintained and insured by META — and fully-paid health insurance, legally required retirement, Medicare, and a $250,000 life insurance policy. Carder paid taxes annually on the car. He’d had a car in his contract since at least 2004, a decision made, Carder said, because it was cheaper than the mileage he racked up driving to meetings across the state. Carder was assigned a 2014 Grand Cherokee, one of four similar vehicles provided for work and personal use to specific administrators. In January META paid $128,478.50 to a Marion car dealership. Armstrong received similar perks, with the exception of the car, and his annuity was 3 percent. His base salary in 2015 was $127,500, but he earned $138,212.99, thanks in part to profit-sharing incentives and a $3,000 bonus for an audit. Armstrong’s contracted incentives included sharing in the monthly investment income and the year-end cash balance. The incentives were a way to encourage him to “build account balances up” and build interest, Carder said. The thought was the more revenue they could get outside of district service fees would mean those fees wouldn’t increase. “Instead of just being a school district treasurer, this is a business ... We wanted a more business feel,” Carder said. Carder and Armstrong were two of 11 executives who earned more than $100,000 with META in 2015. Barbara Shaner, interim executive director of the Ohio Association of School Business Officials, said anecdotally, bonuses and annuities for school treasurers aren’t the norm. On average, OASBO’s 604 treasurer members make a base salary of $91,239. Sotlar and Lucas both said these types of contracts — vehicles for personal use and profit sharing — would “absolutely not” continue in future administrative contracts. However, the three administrators with vehicles will get to keep them since it’s in their contracts.  (Photo: Submitted) Hot eats, cool treats Perks for administrators weren’t the only questionable expenses. Last year staff received Apple Watches at an annual health convocation as an incentive to be healthier and drive insurance rates down, said marketing director Josh Ebert. META bought at least 226 Apple Watches, the cheapest of which retail at $299 in the online Apple store. According to Carder, the watches served multiple purposes: they were used to show staff appreciation after TRECA and MEC merged; were cheaper than a 2 percent raise also discussed; and were tied into the health program. “It was very well-received by staff and it saved us money,” Carder said. META also often was paying for food. Credit card purchases from January 2015 through May 2016 show at least 229 food purchases totaling $17,655, with 21 percent of charges coming in over $100. Panera Bread was a favorite, taking in at least $3,644.52 from META. However, the biggest one-time purchase of $983.71, went to the Signature Room, an upscale Chicago restaurant with dress codes. Ebert reported the cost covered at least 12 people who were attending an annual leadership conference from Ohio school districts. Records show at least $57,750 also was put on credit cards, which were paid in full each month, for travel, lodging, and conferences. There were trips to at least 11 different states that Sotlar said he is “hoping were for professional development,” but doesn’t know. According to Carder, some travel was for professional development, but a lot of it - even some international trips - were related to contracts with other businesses to build revenue. They had employees who would do professional development for Cisco and Apple, which brought in revenue and boosted employee expertise for schools, Carder said. Despite pending financial concerns, January bank records show a check going to QOMO HiteVision for $477,648.53 to purchase interactive white boards in bulk. The agreement with QOMO, according to Lucas, was to buy the technology in bulk at a reduced rate and then sell them to the schools. The thought, Lucas said, was it could be a different source of revenue that would save member districts money by driving down the cost of core services toward zero for districts. In May — amidst the $3.1 million in staff cuts — the board approved a $3 million credit line with Fahey Bank for the QOMO plan. Lucas said that credit line hasn’t been tapped and claims it won’t be because they aren’t moving forward with the QOMO agreement at this time. META was able to attract or retain schools partly because it offered the lowest per-pupil rate, $9.75 approved in June 2015, for core services. “I think you’ll see in the future that $9.75 (per student core service fee) is probably going to go back the other way instead of going toward zero. I think it has to,” Lucas said. Lucas acknowledged a $2 per pupil infrastructure fee approved in April raised concerns among some districts, and confirmed a $3 per pupil fee was approved in July for 50-to-60 districts using Progress Book, a web-based grade book. He and Sotlar both pledged to give districts better notice of increases in the future. “Even if we raise the cost a few more dollars, it’s still going to be less than before META,” Sotlar said, noting that MEC’s charge before the merger was $20 and some other centers charge even more. Lucas questioned if the decrease to $9.75 wasn’t too aggressive as prior META administrators worked to cinch outside business revenue, but he said he expects fees will remain a savings for districts compared to other centers. Carder boasts the rate was a result of a business model began at TRECA that had been working until the past year. In summer of 2015, he and Armstrong began mentoring a succession team to take over. Some outside business was lost and as the new year started, concerns were raised about district fees not being enough to cover costs. The mentors and mentees “didn’t see eye-to-eye” on how to do business, Carder said. “Things kind of got out of hand,” he said. Instead of looking for more outside business, Carder contends the focus turned toward districts. In hindsight, Carder admits attempting to shift the top two administrators in the midst of massive growth “probably wasn’t good.” Upheaval provokes change Buy Photo  (Photo: Gannett Ohio file) Spending is one thing both Lucas and Sotlar admit contributed to the need to cut $3.1 million — a need that was conveyed in a note typed on the May forecast. “If we do not make those reductions, according to my data and what I have presented to the Board then META will be out of money within months ... The reductions will be deep and hurt everyone.” Another factor was the merger itself, which led to a projected $2.5 million decrease in revenue from the two successfully merged parts due to reducing the core service fee. The merger also increased META employees by 100 and they agreed to keep them at least one year, despite unnecessary duplications in some positions, Carder said. The merger process, and subsequent SCOCA issue, also has led to increased attorney fees. Check records show by May, META had already exceeded the $133,203 it paid to law firm Bricker and Eckler for all of 2015. “We probably would never do this (merging) again until they were really looked at under a lens ... We just went into them too fast,” Carder said. Initially, the December merger wasn’t supposed to happen until this summer, about a year after initial discussions, but the timeline was moved up to align with deadlines for federal subsidies, Carder said. There were 36 jobs eliminated with at least half of the cost savings, which included benefits, connected to 13 administrative and management positions. Lucas, who was approved for his current role in July, had been hired in November as an account manager and was among those cuts, saving $151,250. Even with the administrative cuts, META retained six of the 11 positions that paid more than $100,000 in 2015. Sotlar and Lucas were emphatic that things will continue to change at META. Another at least dozen positions have been absorbed through attrition since May, Lucas said, and they are continuing to evaluate every position when someone quits. More change is expected to come, especially with nearly half of META’s leadership changing — since February, six of 15 board members have resigned and seven of 13 administrators are gone. Sotlar chalks up the resignations of board members this year as “professional decisions” to focus more on their school districts. At least one board member, Hilliard City Schools Superintendent John Marschhausen, who resigned in March, confirmed that he foresaw a greater commitment needed for META in light of the mergers and had a levy to focus on in his district. Moving forward, the board plans to replace those openings to help institute a system of checks and balances to ensure not just one person has all the control anymore and that META operates “morally, ethically right,” Sotlar said. jison@Gannett.com Twitter: @JonaIson 2015 top 10 META Solutions earners Name Job title Compensation Job status Mike Carder CEO 182,653.87 Retired Scott Armstrong CFO 138,212.99 Resigned Bret Longberry Sr. VP Core Services 132,634.30 Laid off* James Grube COO 130,504.55 Employed Tim Snyder Sr. VP technology 114,377.96 Employed Tim Hilborn Sr. VP education 113,275.81 Resigned* Larry Zimmerman Chief Officer Business Development & Personnel 107,787.33 Resigned* Michael Struck VP of information technology 107,046.72 Laid off* Bob Alexander Sr. VP operations 105,665.46 Laid off* Adam Clark Sr. VP instructional services 102,330.69 Employed *Job duties were assigned to others and the position was cut. 55 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/2b1J9em TOP VIDEOS Extra 'edge' to The Game 0:44 Buckeyes must win up front 0:30 Playoffs aren't on Barrett's mind 0:39 Talking Michigan 0:20 Wanted this 'so bad' 0:20 Holiday Parade downtown Mansfield, Ohio 1:12 'Script' Ohio 0:45 OSU cornerback Marshon Lattimore 0:27 Saturday is "payday" for Buckeyes 0:33 OSU offensive coordinator Ed Warinner 0:33 What changed for OSU? 0:20 Lexington at Clyde football 3:11 Lexington wins 0:14 Sleep-Out for the Homeless fundraiser 1:24 Big catch for Buckeyes 0:31 Every week's a dogfight 0:21 Is Samuel being used right? 0:20 Defending his offense 1:10 Halloween parade 0:42 Road to Wrestling: The Tryout 3:35 MANCI Cattle Auction 2:52 Road to Wrestling: Day 40 0:47 Mansfield police mentoring kids at Friendly House 2:25 Make A Difference Day Food Drive 2:49 Butler Apple Festival 2:12 Lillith recovering from being shot 1:52 OSU's Raekwon McMillan 0:38 OSU's Parris Campbell 0:19 Ohio State DB Marshon Lattimore 0:17 Big Guns 20: William vs. Odom 0:53 Big Guns 20: White vs. Johnson 0:30 Big Guns 20: Cody Stevens vs. John De Jesus Highlights 2:59 Road to Wrestling: Day 27 3:25 So much depth at OSU 0:19 Buckeyes act like underdogs 0:23 OSU: competition at WR 0:31 Final Horn Week 6 6:49 Lt.

Turi helps developers create and manage software and services that use a form of AI called machine learning. It also has systems that let companies to build recommendation engines, detect fraud, analyse customer usage patterns and better target potential users, according to the Seattle-based startup’s website. Apple could use this to more rapidly integrate the technology with future products. Apple’s move yesterday is part of a broader battle among Google, Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. to gain an edge in AI, particularly in the field known as pervasive computing, where software tries to automatically infer what people want, one of the people said. Turi’s technology could feed into Apple’s Siri digital assistant, the person added, and help define new ways computers interact with people. “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,” Apple said in a statement. GeekWire earlier reported the acquisition. Apple sees its Turi acquisition as a way to better tap into the growing community of AI researchers, said a person familiar with the deal. Apple has been criticised by researchers for being too secretive about its AI work. In contrast, Turi held a two-day machine-learning conference in July in San Francisco for data scientists and academics. Formerly known as Dato, Turi raised more than US$25 million from venture capital investors including New Enterprise Associates and Madrona Venture Group, according to CrunchBase. Turi couldn’t be reached for comment on the deal. The Turi team will remain in Seattle, one of the people familiar with the situation said. Apple has purchased multiple firms over the past couple of years that specialise in artificial intelligence. The company has also begun to integrate these technologies into products such as its iPhone software and Siri. In January, Apple acquired Emotient, a startup that uses AI to recognise and act upon facial expressions. Last year, Apple acquired a pair of voice-centric AI startups, VocalIQ and Perceptio, to bolster Siri. VocalIQ specialised in using machine learning to allow voice assistants to engage in more realistic conversation. Perceptio focused on helping AI systems run on devices while sharing limited amounts of personal user data. Machine learning and AI help computers automatically understand images, videos, and spoken words. The technologies also allow systems to take actions or make recommendations on such data. Apple has already begun to show the fruits of its AI investments via better keyword recognition by Siri across multiple product lines. Apple will release a new version of its photo-management program for iPhones and iPads that uses AI to recognize objects in photos. For example, a user will be able to search for “sushi” and photographs of the food will appear. Apple will also bring machine learning capabilities to its iMessage application by adding a feature this fall that translates words in texts into emoji icons. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Chinese-made US$100b city in Johor 'scares the hell out of everybody' Merkel ‘not happy’ Trump scrapping Pacific trade deal Automakers seek to cut inventories with Black Friday, holiday promotions Lufthansa pilots’ strike wreaks havoc on flight schedule Australia’s Crown Resorts casino staff arrested in China Chinese-made US$100b city in Johor 'scares the hell out of everybody' Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: China goes global as Trump puts America first Reuters Video: Facebook crafts censorship tool to re-enter China, says NYT Kids and parents react to 'Beauty and the Beast' MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants MMOTV: A Red Shirts supporter hurls abuse at Bersih supporters Related Articles So, is it worth asking Santa for an iPhone 7 (or 7 Plus)?

 Apple's App Store just had its best month ever — and here's why Kif Leswing Aug. 3, 2016, 5:22 PM 5,438 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty Summer's here, school's out, and people are downloading and paying for apps on their iPhones.  Apple CEO Tim Cook announced on Wednesday that the company had set a record for total billings and amount paid to developers for the iTunes App Store in July. "App Store developers have now earned over $50 billion! Congratulations on your success and such inspired creativity. July was a record-breaker for the App Store! Highest-ever monthly billings and money paid to developers," Cook wrote on Twitter.  One reason why the App Store might have had a banner month is Pokémon Go, the mobile phenomenon that much of the world has been playing all month. Pokémon Go generates money through in-app purchases, of which Apple takes 30%. Apple said that Pokémon Go set a new App Store record for first-week downloads on iPhones and iPads. And last week, CEO Tim Cook said that "in terms of [augmented reality] and the Pokémon phenomenon, it's incredible what happened there." One estimate from investment bank Needham suggests that Apple could possibly book $3 billion over the next two years, thanks to Pokémon Go. And it appears that the sensation is already having an impact on Apple's top line — at least in its services division.  Apple has signaled that it is emphasizing the App Store as an increasingly important part of its business. In December, Apple put Phil Schiller, its head of marketing and one of former CEO Steve Jobs' top lieutenants, in charge of the App Store. July was a record-breaker for the @AppStore!

Microsoft Exec Says Apple Is Hurting Its Users with Old Tech GO Surface executive criticizes Apple’s old technology Aug 6, 2016 07:23 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Microsoft and Apple are going head to head in today’s technology industry, and the two companies are competing in several businesses, including services, software, and hardware. The competition between the two has often led to remarks that excite their fans, most of them made during press conferences when either Microsoft or Apple introduced new products. This time, however, Brian Hall, who is the general manager of the Surface line at Microsoft, turned to Twitter to criticize Apple and its recent investments in innovations. “I compete with Apple and respect them. but they ARE doing their customers a disservice at times with old tech...” Brian Hall tweeted, clearly hinting that Apple is doing nobody a favor by not investing more in product research and bringing innovations to the market. And while Hall says that Apple customers are the ones directly affected by Apple’s lack of innovation these days, Microsoft itself is suffering too because the Cupertino rival is losing ground in today’s competitive climate, so it can no longer act as a catalyst for other companies to improve their products. It’s not just about computers But Hall does have a point, and it’s not all about computers - although this is clearly the market he was referring to. The last major revision to the MacBook was launched more than four years ago, and Apple is doing the same thing in phones too, though this isn’t exactly impacting Microsoft’s business, but it shows that Cupertino does have a problem maintaining its products fresh. The existing iPhone lineup is very similar to the one before, and the 6s models look exactly the same as the standard 6, although they do bring certain hardware improvements. The bigger problem, however, is that the upcoming generation, called iPhone 7 or the 2016 iPhone, will boast the same look, once again with some improvements, but nothing the market doesn’t have already. Furthermore, Apple’s latest phone is called iPhone SE and has the exact same design as the iPhone 5, only that it features new parts in an attempt to move those who still love 4-inch phones to latest generation hardware. Many have criticized Apple for launching a product that looks exactly the same as a model released in 2012, and once again, the company’s declining innovation level was the main aspect brought in the spotlight in pretty much every discussion. As usual, Apple continues to remain completely tight-lipped, even following these new accusations, but expect new remarks to be made at the company’s upcoming iPhone unveiling due in September. #Microsoft#Apple#iPhone 7#Surface#MacBook subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news China Doesn’t Care About Windows 10 Anniversary Update, Still Loves Windows XP Windows 10 Should Ban Downloads of Pirated Content, Organization Says Microsoft Releases Update for the Best Email Client on iPhones Microsoft Wants to Make iPhone’s Siri Irrelevant with New Cortana Update iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks    Microsoft and Apple are competing in software, hardware and services New Apps Mudlet: An easy to use application that stands as a multi-functional graphical MUD client with built-in native Lua scripting capabilities Spencer: An intuitive and user-friendly software solution that allows you to access all the items that were typically accessible within the Start Menu of XP CopyQ Portable: Install-free clipboard manager that can be used in order to store multiple body texts, images and HTML content, and paste content whenever needed 4D: A fully-featured integrated development environment that allows you to create and deploy a wide range of applications that rely on databases and servers reWASD: Remap your Xbox One controller's buttons to perform keyboard actions with this handy application that comes with a user-friendly interface EMCO Ping Monitor Professional: Monitor connections to network hosts and generate reports about response time, activity status or ping statistics with this accurate application Mullvad: A virtual private network application that conceals your computer's real IP address, hiding your identity while navigating online Reader comments Load old comments   Antivirus Firms Unite Against Microsoft Push for Windows Defender in Windows 10 more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

According to a GeekWire report, the move is set to increase Apple's presence in the Seattle region where the tech giant has been building an engineering outpost for the past two years. "Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans," said Apple in a statement given to GeekWire. Turi offers tools that are meant to let developers easily scale machine learning applications. The startup is expected to remain in the Seattle region and continue to grow as Apple builds out further expertise in data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning, the report added. The Cupertino-based company has recently bought some machine learning and AI startups like VocalIQ and Perceptio and facial recognition startup Emotient, among others. Apple has recently been making a push into artificial intelligence through Siri personal assistant and related technologies.

The company, Paline, said the machine will hold 70 pizzas at a time. Customers will use a touch screen to pick one of the $10 pizzas, which will be heated for several minutes, placed in a cardboard box and ejected through a slot. Apple joins tech companies that offer rewards to hackers Apple said it will start offering cash rewards of up to $200,000 to hackers who come forward with information about security flaws in the company’s software. The iPhone maker is joining other big tech companies that offer “bug bounties” to people who discover vulnerabilities in their computer code. To start, Apple said it will offer rewards to a limited number of researchers it has worked with before. Walmart implements new scheduling system for some Walmart has launched a new scheduling system in about 650 Neighborhood Market stores that gives hourly workers more certainty about their schedules. The system was launched in late July and eventually could be rolled out to all 4,600 U.S. Walmart stores, said Mark Ibbotson, Walmart’s executive vice president of central operations. The hourly workers at the neighborhood stores now have two scheduling options. Those choosing fixed shifts are guaranteed the same weekly hours for up to six months. The remainder will stick to the current system of having three weeks’ notice and being able to choose their hours based on what’s available.

What Took Them So Long? World | Andrea Peterson, The Washington Post | Updated: August 06, 2016 11:05 IST EMAIL PRINT COMMENTS Apple will offer cash rewards to hackers who will inform about security flaws in the company's software. Apple will finally start paying out cash rewards to researchers who find security problems in their products, the company announced at the BlackHat cybersecurity conference in Las Vegas Thursday. But the news left some experts wondering why Apple was so late to the party. So-called "bug bounty" programs are now standard among most tech giants. They can help keep consumers safe by encouraging independent researchers to help companies fix security flaws. When a researcher finds a legitimate problem, rewards can range all the way up to the six figures. But Apple historically had a different approach -- offering a tipline where people could report security problems, but not handing out any reward other than putting the researcher's name on a thank you page on its website. "It was kind of an insult," said Matthew Green, a computer science professor at Johns Hopkins University who has previously told Apple about security problems in its products and didn't know why it took them so long to launch a bounty program. "Maybe after San Bernardino they felt there was some pressure to acknowledge that it wasn't enough to give people a pat on the back -- even if they can't pay enough to compete with the free market," he said. Apple's lack of a bug bounty program drew criticism earlier this year when the FBI paid an unknown entity more than $1 million for help breaking into an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters. Without a bug bounty program, some argued, the only way researchers could make money from finding bugs in Apple's products was selling them off to the highest bidder -- in this case, the FBI. But now, Apple has a chance "to compete for the type of exploits available and control how they'll be used," said Jeff Pollard, principal analyst focused on IT security at Forrester Research. Apple's new rewards program will launch in September, but won't be open to anyone. Instead, it will be invite-only -- at least in the beginning. But researchers who approach the company with a major problem also will be invited to join. Most programs are open to all researchers. The program will only reward researchers for finding a few categories of problems at launch. The biggest payouts will be for bugs affecting software built into components that help Apple's devices start-up securely: Researchers who find one of those could get up to $200,000. That makes Apple's bug bounty program one of the most lucrative out there. Google's program, which launched in 2010, upped its largest bounty -- for breaking the security of its Chromebooks -- to $100,000 this March. Microsoft's largest per bug payout is also $100,000. Apple's potential big rewards may be aimed at convincing researchers to turn to the company when they find a problem, rather than the open market where vulnerabilities might be bought up for use in criminal or state-sponsored hacks. But even with Apple's hefty new payouts, other places may still pay a better premium for ways to hack into the company's products. Last year, Zerodium, a company that deals in buying zero-day vulnerabilities from researchers and selling them to large corporations and government agencies, said it paid $1 million to researchers who were able to remotely hack into the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS. The company doesn't offer the same massive payouts for problems in other products. "No software other than iOS really deserves such a high bug bounty," Zerodium founder Chaouki Bekrar told The Post last year, citing Apple's strong security built into its products. That internal focus on security may be one reason Apple held out against an official bug bounty program so long while, even as other sectors like the automotive industry, airlines and the Department of Defense started to get in on the game. The rise of Apple Pay may be another factor that pushed the company to be more aggressive about getting help from the larger security community, according to Green. "They really need to know that system is secure" because there's actual money at risk, he said. "I think a lot of researchers would rather hand vulnerabilities over to Apple than to someone who is going to use it to steal people's payment information." © 2016 The Washington Post (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Apple is said to have paid more than $100 million to acquire the company, which was known as "Dato" until earlier this month. Turi is designed to help developers build apps with artificial intelligence capabilities that automatically scale. It has developed the Turi Machine Learning Platform, GraphLab Create, and Turi Predictive Services, used for functions like recommendations, fraud detection, sentiment analysis, and more. Turi toolkits simplify development of machine learning models. Each incorporates automatic feature engineering, model selection, and machine learning visualizations specific to the application. There is no faster way to build performant models. Citing people familiar with the acquisition, GeekWire says Turi employees will remain in the Seattle area, where Apple has been establishing a presence over the past few years. Apple confirmed the acquisition with the standard purchase statement it gives to media outlets: "Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans." It is not known what Apple will do with Turi's technology, but Apple has made several AI-related purchases in recent months including VocalIQ, Perceptio, and Emotient.Tags: Apple acquisition, Turi Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Bloomberg Technology - on August 5, 2016< > Embed Why Is Apple Buying AI Startup Turi for $200 Million? 02:38 Aug. 5 -- Apple acquired Turi Inc., a startup specializing in artificial intelligence, for about $200 million, according to two people familiar with the situation, in the latest deal by the iPhone maker to accumulate advanced computing capabilities for its products and services.

By Kedar Grandhi August 6, 2016 05:33 BST Close Embed Feed Apple could be the biggest winner from Pokemon Go's success IBTimes UK <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/19561" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> Apple is said to have acquired Turi, a machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) startup, based in Seattle, US. The news was confirmed by various unnamed sources who pegged the deal value at around $200m (£153m; € 180.39m). Upon contacting Apple on the same, the California, US headquartered technology giant said, "Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans," according to GeekWire, an American technology news website. GeekWire said this was a standard comment Apple was known to give after making such acquisitions. Apple has since 2015 made 15 acquisitionsGetty Images It added that the deal reflected Apple's efforts to increase its presence in the Seattle region, where it has been building an engineering presence for the past two years. The Washington city is said to become an epicenter for the emerging AI industry. Another news report citing unnamed sources said that the deal reflected Apple's efforts to gain an edge over Google, Facebook and Amazon in the AI space. The source said these tech giants were particularly interested in a field known as pervasive computing, where the software tries to automatically infer what a user wants. The person added that Turi's technology could be integrated into Siri, Apple's intelligent personal assistant and knowledge navigator. This could in turn help define new ways for computers to interact with people, the person added. For Apple, the acquisition comes at a time, when the company is seeing a decline in sales of its flagship product, the iPhone. It has since 2015, made 15 acquisitions of which two are in the AI/machine learning space. These include Perceptio and VocalIQ, both of which are start-ups similar to Turi. Turi, which has raised more than $25m till date, was formerly known as Dato and GraphLab. It began as an open-source project at Carnegie Mellon in 2009. Its products include Turi Machine Learning Platform, GraphLab Create, Turi Distributed, and Turi Predictive Services. These are designed better evaluate data and are used for various purposes such as fraud detection, predicting customer churn, sentiment analysis, customer segmentation and recommendation engines.

GeekWire first reported the news, citing anonymous sources close to the deal. TechCrunch also reported the acquisition. Both quote an Apple statement indicating the tech giant has purchased the company. A search of Washington state records shows the corporate registration for Turi, Inc., expired April 30 and became inactive on Thursday. Calls and e-mails to Turi executives and its Fremont neighborhood headquarters were not answered Friday afternoon. With a reported sale price of around $200 million—again according to unnamed sources cited by GeekWire—the exit would appear to be a substantial win for Turi’s founders and investors. The company, co-founded in early 2013 by Carlos Guestrin, Joseph Gonzalez, Danny Bickson, Haijie Gu, and Yucheng Low, raised $6.75 million from Seattle-based Madrona Venture Group and New Enterprise Associates in May of that year. Guestrin. In early 2015, the company announced an $18.5 million Series B funding round led by Paul Allen’s investment vehicle Vulcan Capital, and Opus Capital Ventures, along with existing investors. (Oddly, no record of that funding could be found in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s online database under any of the company’s names, nor by searching Guestrin’s name.) The idea underpinning Turi began in the halls of Carnegie Mellon University, where Guestrin was an associate professor, five years before founding the company. He led a group working on large-scale machine learning algorithms to extract and analyze relationships between entities in multi-dimensional graph datasets. Facing limits of existing software, Guestrin’s group developed GraphLab—a name inspired by Guestrin’s Labrador retriever—to parse these modern databases. “We threw it out into the open source community, kind of as an afterthought,” Guestrin said in a 2013 interview. The community ran with it. GraphLab the company was formed to commercialize the technology and make it easier to use for people outside of the data science priesthood. Now its products enable companies to quickly implement predictive applications and other advanced machine learning methods for things like recommendations, churn prediction, and fraud detection. Guestrin referenced his dog again to explain the intelligent applications his company helps developers build. A dog, Guestrin said at Madrona’s machine learning and artificial intelligence conference in Seattle this spring, “listens to commands. It observes something about the world. And, in real time, makes decisions. For example, what does he have to do to go fetch that ball? But what makes my dog really interesting is that he can learn over time how to take those actions better.” That dog might have been a Pittsburgh, PA-based startup if not for the influence and money of one Jeff Bezos, and others in Seattle’s tech industry. Guestrin and his spouse, Emily Fox, were recruited to the University of Washington in 2012, where they both remain Amazon Professors of Machine Learning. On short notice, Bezos ponied up $2 million to endow their professorships. Microsoft Research head Peter Lee was also instrumental in recruiting the pair to the region. A poster of GraphLab in the New Ventures Facility. Turi began life in the University of Washington’s New Ventures Facility, a startup incubator now known as CoMotion Labs. In a year there, it grew there from four employees to 23, says Vikram Jandhyala, UW vice president for innovation strategy and executive director of CoMotion. The company is not based on any UW intellectual property, and the UW has no equity position, so the acquisition won’t result in a financial return for the university. But Jandhyala was nonetheless excited to read of the acquisition, as it underscores the new emphasis at CoMotion, which is looking to help startup companies grow even if they don’t have an explicit link to the UW. In this case, of course, the on-campus incubator space made it easier for Guestrin to be both a professor and a startup CEO, and helped with access to resources, advisers, and VCs, Jandhyala says. “It was a great story for our incubator,” he says. It’s not immediately clear what Turi’s future holds inside of Apple, but the reports say the team is likely to remain in Seattle and bolster the company’s presence here, and its capabilities in Turi’s areas of expertise.

Though the iPad Pros resemble previous iPad models, they’re tricked out with a magnetic Smart Connector for use with a Smart Keyboard cover, and they also work with the new Apple Pencil stylus. Apple’s emphasis with the iPad Pro is on productivity, an angle I’ve embraced with gusto. Though I have long been fond of writing and doing other work on an iPad, the iPad Pro has taken over for an Apple laptop as my preferred workhorse while on the go. The question is, which iPad Pro? There’s the rub. I’ve made extensive use of both models in recent months and love them both for different reasons. While they seem nearly identical on the surface – apart from size and weight, of course – they are quite distinct in some ways. The newer 9.7-inch model boasts certain advanced features that its older 12.9-inch sibling lacks, while the big iPad Pro outpaces the smaller one in several significant ways. Advantages of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro -- The smaller iPad Pro, because it’s newer, incorporates cutting-edge technology that presumably wasn’t ready when Apple released the bigger iPad Pro. Display: Apple advertises the small iPad Pro as having the “brightest and least reflective” screen anywhere, with colors that “are more vivid, true to life and engaging.” It adds that the smaller tablet “uses the same color space as the digital cinema industry,” with a wider color gamut that gives the device up to 25 percent greater color saturation than previous models. Fair enough, but I’m not sure I would have noticed this without being prompted. And, after much squinting at the two displays, I can’t honestly think a user of the bigger iPad would feel cheated. In another respect, the display on the smaller tablet is starkly different. It offers a “True Tone” screen with built-in sensors that alter its appearance based on ambient lighting conditions. This feature adjusts the display color and intensity to match lighting around it. I found True Tone jarring at first but grew to like it. Peering at the two iPads in my customarily dim home office on a late afternoon, for instance, the screen on the larger iPad Pro had a decidedly bluish tint while the smaller iPad appeared warmer and more inviting. True Tone is different and separate from the Night Shift feature that aims to make a screen more comfortable to read in low-light conditions. True Tone and Night Shift often seem to behave similarly, although Night Shift is based on timers and not physical sensors. I solved the confusion by keeping Night Shift switched off on the 9.7-inch iPad. Cellular access: Integrated support for cellular data connections in some iPad models sets them apart from Apple laptops, none of which can yet boast such connectivity. However, the two iPad Pro models have different cellular capabilities. The 9.7-inch model supports a cellular data feature called LTE Advanced that is available from some carriers, including AT&T. LTE Advanced can boost Internet performance dramatically. In my speed tests, cellular downloads tended to be as much as 50 percent faster on the smaller iPad Pro model than on the large one. Apple also eliminated the need for an add-in Apple SIM in the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, though the tablet still has a nano-SIM tray if your carrier requires a physical SIM. Instead, it has a new feature called embedded Apple SIM that internalizes the SIM card’s features. Regardless of whether the Apple SIM is embedded or not, it exists to make life easier for those who need cellular service in foreign lands. Obtaining a physical SIM for such service has been a longtime ritual for overseas travelers, but Apple SIM users can sign up for cellular service right on their tablets as they move from place to place. So the difference between the two Apple SIM types seems a minor one, allowing most users of the smaller iPad Pro to ignore the nano-SIM tray. Camera and photos: People like taking photos with their iPads, no matter how awkward it may look, and those who do should know that the cameras on the iPad Pro models differ in significant respects. The larger iPad has an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera with an f/2.4 aperture that shoots 1080p video. Its front-facing camera has a 1.2-megapixel resolution with an f/2.2 aperture and takes 720p video. Neither camera has a flash, which is a distinct disadvantage. The smaller iPad has a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera with an f/2.2 aperture that shoots 4K video. It adds a True Tone flash, found on certain iPhone models, whose white and amber LEDs can produce more than 1000 different color temperatures to achieve a better white balance. Its front-facing camera has a 1.2-megapixel resolution with an f/2.2 aperture and shoots 720p video. It adds a Retina Flash feature that, as on the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, turns the screen into a flash and makes for an unusual selfie experience as the screen momentarily turns bright white for subtle illumination. The smaller iPad can take Live Photos, a capability absent from the larger model. Hey Siri: Only the smaller iPad boasts the always-on feature that puts Apple’s intelligent assistant at your beck and call. Advantages of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro -- The larger of the iPad Pro models, though older, is superior to the small one in several tangible ways. Lightning port: The Lightning port on the bigger iPad incorporates the zippy USB 3.0, while the one on the smaller iPad offers only the slower USB 2.0. This difference likely means little to most people, but it has serious ramifications for certain types of users, such as photographers. “For photographers who want to transfer photos for review or editing from a camera to the iPad, this is almost crippling,” my TidBITS colleague Jeff Carlson recently observed on his personal blog. Jeff found that transferring 1.5 GB of images took 30 seconds via USB 3 and 2 minutes 20 seconds via USB 2. Performance: Though roughly similar to the 9.7-inch model in terms of internal specs, the 12.9-inch model offers slightly superior performance. It has 4 GB of RAM, compared to the smaller tablet’s 2 GB. And while both tablets have an A9X chip, both raw processing and graphics are zippier on the larger iPad. Honestly, though, I seldom noticed the difference while using both iPads. Faster charging: As I noted in “iPad Pro Charges Faster with MacBook Adapter and New Cable” (27 April 2016), charge times on the large iPad can be reduced by about half by swapping out its standard charger for the 29-watt USB-C Power Adapter that comes with the 12-inch MacBook and pairing it with one of Apple’s new USB-C to Lightning cables. The fast-charging capability in the 12.9-inch iPad makes this trick possible; alas, the 9.7-inch model lacks the fast-charging feature. The Intangibles -- In many ways, purchasing an iPad is a highly personal decision. One potential buyer might find the larger iPad Pro too big and heavy, while it might be just right for another. For some, the version of the Smart Keyboard for the 9.7-inch iPad might feel intolerably cramped, but not for others. I’ll focus here on my experiences while broadening my discussion to include others who might be considering a purchase. Smart Keyboard: The dimensions of the Smart Keyboard for the bigger iPad are deliciously ample. I expected the smaller Smart Keyboard, like other keyboards and keyboard cases designed for 9.7-inch iPads models, to feel scrunched to me. However, my concerns were laid to rest when I started using it. I did serious work on the thing with little discomfort. Your mileage may vary; I recommend trying both in a store. Screen considerations: The larger iPad’s generous screen size can be critically important for some people. On the larger iPad, each side of the screen in Split View has as much display area as the smaller iPad’s display, which is great for productivity. Split View on the smaller iPad is less useful given the narrowness of each panel. This, of course, assumes app developers have updated their offerings to support Split View. Some have not. As I’ve previously noted, Google’s refusal to implement this basic feature in some of its iOS apps (such as Google Docs, which I’m using to type these words) is one of the great mysteries of the universe. That issue impacts both iPad Pro models, but there’s a related one that involves only the big iPad. In many cases, developers have been slow about updating apps to take advantage of the 12.9-inch screen. I’m looking at you, Facebook. Google has been maddeningly inconsistent in this regard, updating some apps (such as Inbox) but not others (like Gmail). Size and weight: At just under 1 pound (454 g), the 9.7-inch iPad Pro feels much more portable than the 12.9-inch model, which weighs 1.6 pounds (726 g). The larger iPad Pro initially struck me as ridiculously large. It seems like a cafeteria tray – and I have even used it to transport meals from the kitchen to the front porch a few times. For those with similar concerns but lusting after that big screen, I’d suggest a couple of strategies. Go for the Smart Cover (and, optionally, the matching Silicone Case) instead of the bulkier Smart Keyboard. With the cover and the case, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro struck me as a thin and light laptop. Then, when you need it, add an external Bluetooth keyboard. There are many such options, some of which I covered in “Three Alternatives to the iPad Pro’s Smart Keyboard” (8 February 2016). One of the accessories in that article, the Zagg Messenger Universal, remains my favorite as a large and comfy keyboard with an integrated fold-out stand that is more than stable enough to hold the larger iPad (in either portrait or landscape orientation). I get a ton of work done on it at home. The Zagg Messenger Universal is thin enough that I have been known to take it on the road with the iPad despite the added weight and bulk, though it is mostly for home use. Keyboard cases for the larger iPad Pro don’t make a lot of sense to me — why bulk up the already large device? They make more sense for the smaller iPad. Again, numerous options are available. I prefer Zagg’s Rugged Book, which bulks up the tablet a bit, but seems indestructible (I throw it into my bike pannier every morning for my commute without a second thought) and has four positioning/viewing modes. The tablet detaches, as well, when I just want a touch experience. When I need to type, the Rugged Book’s keyboard feels fantastic, though, of course, a bit cramped. Be sure to buy the version for the iPad Pro. The similar iPad Air 2 model will fit the iPad Pro form factor, but does not have its magnets correctly positioned to activate the tablet’s sleep mode when the lid is closed. Conclusion -- Most people won’t have both iPad Pro models available to compare. I’m lucky to have both versions on loan from Apple, which has been a revealing experience. I’ve found a role for each tablet. The larger iPad Pro is mostly for home use – on my front-porch workstation, for instance, when I want to get some serious work done while enjoying a bit of fresh air. The smaller iPad Pro is my mobile model. It goes with me everywhere. I tuck it into a small messenger bag if I’m walking, chuck it into my pannier when biking, and have it with me in my car at all times. If I had to choose? I’d get the 9.7-inch model because it does everything the bigger tablet can, though sometimes in a more cramped manner, and it has some cool new features. You’ll make your own decision based on your particular set of needs and circumstances, but you can’t lose. Both models are great, though with key differences that you should mull over carefully before making your purchase.   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

Ex2bot  2016-07-28 14:12 I'm using RooCASE's Origami "smartcase" for my 12.9" iPad Pro (bought from Amazon). It's only $15, but it's done a good job of protecting my iPad. I don't know how well it does protecting the iPad in the event of a fall. Thankfully, I haven't dropped it yet. I noticed Apple seems to have made their case back very thick. The Origami isn't nearly as thick. Maybe the extra thickness is necessary to protect in a fall, not sure. The corners on the Origami are reinforced, and they protect the screen by extending slightly above the screen. Very good cover / case. Barry Z  2016-07-28 21:43 Question. Do u know whether either of the iPads can be connected to a monitor for home use. If so this way u get the advantage of a larger screen (monitor) when home and portability when on the road?? RickC63  2016-07-29 08:21 Yes, Apple makes a lightning to HDMI adapter for about $50. It includes an additional lightning port for charging while using the adapter. e  2016-08-02 12:24 Apple needs to update the 12" ipad, and also stop hamstringing the smaller one. It's only using 2 cores of the processor vs. the 12" which uses all 4. They intentionally disable/hamstring/restrict the performance of the 9.7" pro to not eclipse the 12".  Search   Unless otherwise noted, this article is copyright © 2016 Julio Ojeda-Zapata TidBITS is copyright © 2016 TidBITS Publishing Inc.

This new video captured by a drone shows us the construction progress. DON’T MISS: The only bad cell company is Sprint Matthew Roberts periodically flies his DJI Phantom 3 Professional drone over the construction site, recording the progress made in gorgeous 4K video. Aside from the main building, there are several other buildings that Apple is developing, including a massive R&D center, a 100,000 square foot fitness center, and a brand new auditorium for its product unveiling events. There’s plenty of parking space underneath these buildings, which will be covered by huge solar panels that will power Apple’s impressive new campus. It only takes a look at that massive mountain of dirt next to the project to realize how large the project it. Speaking of said mountain, it seems that landscaping has already started, which means the mountain will be shrinking.

Data released on last week by Strategy Analytics show that sales in India of iOS-enabled smartphones, meaning iPhones, fell 35 per cent in the second quarter from a year earlier. What’s worse, that decline left the US company with just 2.4 per cent of a market that grew 19 per cent. While Apple has experienced decreasing sales and shrinking share in many parts of the world, what’s particularly worrying is its inability to capture customers so early in the Indian market’s development. It’s true that the second quarter is often a trough for iPhone sales, because it occupies that dead zone between old and new devices in Apple’s annual release cycle. Yet such a deep plunge indicates just how little loyalty Cook and his design chief Jony Ive have managed to build for its products. Even in China, where Apple slipped to No 5 during the same period, the company still managed to garner a 6.7 per cent share of a much larger market. The risk for Apple is not in this quarter’s or next quarter’s earnings, but in building a habit among Indian consumers to use and rely on Apple’s iOS ecosystem. Selling just 800,000 phones in a quarter isn’t going to get the market addicted. Swapping between Android and iOS is notoriously cumbersome, despite attempts by both camps to make it easier. Cook surely realises that if smartphone users buy into, and enjoy, the Android OS, it will be a mammoth challenge to convince them to swap over to his higher-priced offering. An obvious workaround is to start selling cheaper devices, but that’s a strategy Apple knows is fraught with risks. For one thing, once a price standard is set it becomes ingrained in consumers’ minds, making subsequent increases almost impossible. And Cook doesn’t want to start selling cheap phones globally. Price is as much part of the iPhone brand as its design and ecosystem, and avoiding price wars has been a point of pride for the company. While Apple could, in theory, release a cheap phone just for India, stopping exports out of the country would be difficult. It also would be out of sync with the strategy of making devices that are global and universal. Another way, expensive and by no means assured, would be for Apple itself to subsidise its phones through telecom operators or other outlets that could lock consumers into contracts in return for cheaper upfront pricing. There are many reasons why that might fail, including the fact that most Indian connections are pre-paid. — Bloomberg About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Asian stock markets mostly up after BoE rate cut, stimulus Crude slump sees oil majors’ debt burden double to $138 billion → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Study warns more hurricanes likely to hit northeast US Saffron harvest offers jobs, opportunity in Afghanistan Giza Zoo, one of the world’s best zoos Worsening scene Read More ...

But it's really not. It's a drop in the bucket for these companies. And it would be surprising if the tech bond binge doesn't accelerate in the coming months and years. Already this year, tech companies have sold about as much investment-grade U.S. debt as they did in all of 2015, and double the level of 2014.  Tech Explosion Technology companies are selling U.S. bonds at an accelerating pace this year Source: Bloomberg Apple, Microsoft and Google parent company Alphabet are responsible for more than 40 percent of the 2016 tech bond sales. Those three companies don't really need the money; they have a combined $423 billion in cash plus short- and long-term securities. But most of their cash is parked overseas, and if the companies tapped the cash they would have to pay U.S. corporate income taxes. Bond buyers are helping fill the cash gap. Microsoft this week sold $19.75 billion in bonds to help pay for its proposed acquisition of LinkedIn. Apple in recent days sold $7 billion in bonds -- its seventh multibillion-dollar debt sale since 2013 -- to finance its huge share repurchases and dividends to stockholders. Alphabet is using its $2 billion of fresh bond sales to repay old debt. Combined Cash of Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet $423 Billion Combined, the companies are paying roughly $4.6 billion of coupon payments on all their bonds. That's equal to less than a week of Apple's sales. And it's laughably dinky compared with the $130 billion these companies would have to pay in taxes if they repatriated the cash they hold overseas. The Taxman (Doesn't) Cometh Microsoft, Apple and Google's parent company hold most of their cash and investments abroad, where they aren't subject to U.S. taxes. If they paid income taxes on the overseas cash, it would amount to a collective $130 billion. Sources: the companies Note: Cash and investments are as of the end of June. Apple's cash holdings also include long-term securities. Let's say Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet didn't raise money through bond sales and opted to bring money home from some other country. They'd have to pay about $59.5 billion in taxes. In comparison, that $4.6 billion looks like pocket change. And it's even more of a bargain than it looks. These tech companies also get favorable tax treatment for incurring debt because any interest paid is deducted from its pretax profits. What's more, they're borrowing at ever-lower rates and for longer periods. Microsoft just sold $2.25 billion of bonds that mature in 2056 and are paying a coupon of 3.95 percent. That's equivalent to the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries back in 2007. So you'd think perhaps investors would be wary about buying this stuff, right? After all, who knows what the world will be like in 40 years. Consider that 40 years ago, Microsoft was a year old. But investors aren't wary at all. They're fighting each other to buy these bonds. There was so much demand for Microsoft's bonds that the tech behemoth ended up paying a lower rate than it initially offered, and prices on the debt still rose after its initial sale, trading up almost 2 cents on the dollar in the three days after its issuance. Price Surge Microsoft's $2.25 billion of 40-year bonds have risen since they were first sold Source: Trace, Bloomberg The only loser here is the U.S. tax collector. Is it good that tax laws are encouraging these companies to leverage up their balance sheets rather than pay taxes? Probably not. But you can't blame the companies. Forget banks, tech companies are the modern financial innovators. From their perspective, and the perspective of the buyers of their bonds, it's a slam dunk. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. That is assuming the three companies paid the 35 percent corporate income tax rate on the collective $369 billion they hold in non-U.S. subsidiaries.   To contact the authors of this story: Lisa Abramowicz in New York at labramowicz@bloomberg.net Shira Ovide in New York at sovide@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story: Daniel Niemi at dniemi1@bloomberg.net Leaping Deere Leaping Deere Deere shares spiked to a record after the company reported earnings that weren't as awful as expected Source: Bloomberg Overkill Enough Fawning Over Deere Industrials Brooke Sutherland Leaky Roofs Leaky Roofs Foxtons shares have been hit hard by the Brexit vote but have also underperformed web-based peers Source: Bloomberg Fee Fail Tech's Big Chance to Help Generation Rent Real Estate Lionel Laurent That Sounds Gross $1.32 Fine-Tuning AT&T Plays It Forward Tech Rani Molla Annual Revenue From PC Hardware $174 billion Hold the Eulogy Don't Write Off the PC Just Yet Tech Shira Ovide Peaked Interest Peaked Interest The market expectations for a Fed interest rate increase in December have hit 100% Source: Bloomberg Switchback Bond Market's November Surprise Markets Lisa Abramowicz Wrong Way Wrong Way Rocket Internet's shares are far below their initial public offering price Source: Bloomberg Startup Factory Rocket Internet's Trajectory Shift Tech Leila Abboud Back in Black Back in Black The big five panel manufacturers have posted enough profit in 2016 to wipe out two-and-a-half years of aggregate losses Source: Bloomberg Note: Shows aggregate net income for JinkoSolar, Trina Solar, JA Solar, Canadian Solar, and Yingli Green Energy.

Expect Comcast’s Xfinity TV app to join that mix as it moves ahead with an integration deal with Roku.   Word of Apple’s new angle emerges after the CE giant failed to cut the deal needed to build its own national pay TV service in large part because programmers and broadcasters balked at Apple’s demands and assertive negotiating style, according to The Wall Street Journal.   “Apple just wants too much,” an industry source familiar with those discussions told me last year.   According to Recode, the current plans also stem from a new single sign-on (SSO) authentication system for TVE apps that Apple will be making available on the Apple TV as well as iOS-powered smartphones and tablets. Adobe and Synacor, which provide authentication systems for programmers and MVPDs, have already announced they are getting behind Apple’s SSO initiative.   Apple, the report said, has been in talks with programmers about obtaining the metadata needed to build the new guide.   Apple CEO Tim Cook cropped some hints about the company’s TV plans on last month’s fiscal Q3 call.   “The introduction of Apple TV and tvOS last October and the subsequent OS releases and what’s coming out this fall…think of that as sort of building the foundation for what we believe can be a broader business over time,” Cook said. “But you shouldn’t look at what’s there today and think we’ve done what we want to do.”      Additionally, Apple’s Eddy Cue, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, chatted up Apple TV’s ability to stream content from other distributors and tossed cold water on skinny bundles.  TAGS: Apple Apple TV virtual MVPDs user interfaces Share This Post View the discussion thread.

When I recently updated devices running five different operating systems, I took the opportunity to compare how they installed their latest patches. The tests were run on July 27th. Hardware-wise, all the devices were old, but their software was reasonably up to date, lacking only the latest round of updates. All in all, it seemed like a fair fight. I cold booted each device and waited for it to settle down before updating the operating system. Typically a computer does some housekeeping when it first boots and/or when it first goes online. So, I let each device sit for a while. Then, on Windows and OS X, I updated Firefox to insure that the internet connection was working well. On iOS, I waited for the app store to phone home. It initially said that 5 apps needed to be updated, but after a short delay, upped that number to 31. On Chrome OS, I just waited a few minutes. In each case, the operating system update was the only thing the device was doing. Four devices used the same 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network with a very strong signal (they were in the same room as the router). The fifth device, a Windows 7 desktop, used Ethernet as that's all it had. Timings are reasonably accurate but I wasn't using a stopwatch. I tried to limit the updates to just the operating system, something that comes quite naturally in iOS and Chrome OS. Windows 7 and 8.1 offer this as an option, but I am not aware of any way to limit OS X. In my test, it also updated Safari, iTunes and a couple other applications.  THE PLAYERS The five tested devices were: 1. A 64 bit Windows 7 desktop PC running an Intel Core i5-3470 (3.2GHz) with 8GB of RAM and a mechanical hard drive connected via SATA III. It had last been updated on June 17, 2016. 2. A 32 bit Windows 8.1 tablet running an Intel Atom CPU model Z3745 (1.3GHz) with 2GB of RAM and a 32GB SanDisk SDW32G connected with an interface that Speccy calls "SD." It was last updated on June 25, 2016. 3. A first generation iPad Mini model MD531LL/A running iOS version 9.3.2. 4. A MacBook Air laptop dating back to November 2010 (model A1370). It's running an Intel Core 2 Duo (1.4GHz) with 2GB of RAM and OS X Yosemite version 10.10.5. 5. An Acer C710 Chromebook with 2GB of RAM, manufactured in May 2013. It was on the stable channel, running the 64 bit edition of Chrome OS version 51.0.2704.106, which has a build date of July 6, 2016. THE BAKE OFF Windows 7 has been plagued, for months, with OS updates that take forever to install. Sadly, this remains true, it took Windows 7 longer than any other system to install its bug fixes. Windows updates itself in two phases; first it figures out the missing bug fixes, then, in phase 2, it downloads and installs them. The first phase took 1 hour and 38 minutes to complete, by far, the slowest of the tested systems. The first phase found seven missing patches but defaulted to only installing six of them. For whatever reason, it opted not to install KB971033. The six patches totaled 74 megabytes, and it took 5 minutes to download and install them. The shutdown and reboot took 2 minutes. TOTAL TIME: 1 hour 45 minutes Windows 8.1 Windows 8.1 updated itself faster than Windows 7, even though the tablet hardware was far less powerful than the desktop system. Still, it was the second slowest device. The first update phase, determining the missing bug fixes took an hour and 6 minutes. The system needed 11 patches, totaling 199 megabytes. Phase 2, downloading and installing the patches, took 7 minutes. At one point in the reboot process, the screen was totally blank. Maybe it always does that, I don't use Windows 8 much and never paid particularly close attention.The shutdown and reboot took 3 minutes. TOTAL TIME: 1 hour 19 minutes iOS 9 Updating iOS 9 was a drastically different experience. As soon as the process started, the system already knew that it had to install version 9.3.3, and, how big the download would be. The process however, was the most confusing of the five systems. The early stages are confusing because it reports the status of the update in three different locations. The later stages are confusing because there is so little status information. It also tried to calculate a time estimate, but never did. The initial statuses were "Update requested" and "Downloading". Then, while it was still downloading, it was also in "Preparing update" status. Then a small white window was displayed but it disappeared before I could read what it said. After the download completed, one location reported that it was "installing" while another location reported that it was "verifying the update." Apple likes progress bars, but, for whatever reason, makes them very thin. So thin, it is hard to see the progress. It's not for lack of space, even with the screen mostly empty, the progress bar height is measured in molecules. And none of the progress bars were accompanied by a percentage, which just adds insult to the injury of barely being able to see them. At one point the screen went totally black, then a white apple appeared, then all black again. Then a white apple with a progress bar. Then the progress bar disappeared, then another progress bar appeared, but there was no progress for a while, it appeared to be hung. To paraphrase an old movie: Words? We don't need no stinking words.  Eventually there was movement on the latest progress bar, then it disappeared, leaving a black screen with white apple on it. Finally, the normal logon screen appeared for a few seconds, then the screen went black again.  From start to finish the process took 29 minutes. As I was finishing up this blog, Apple issued another iOS update, 9.3.4, which took me 23 minutes to install. AVERAGE TIME:  26 minutes OS X Yosemite Like iOS, Yosemite knew very quickly that it needed to install security update 2016-004. As noted earlier, I was unable to install just this update so it also downloaded and installed Safari, iTunes, Remote Desktop Client and something called SU_TITLE - 768 megabytes of software. I was able to ignore the updates to Pages, Keynote, Numbers, GarageBand and iPhoto. The download started quickly, but after about 600MB, it slowed down. The initial time estimate was 2 minutes but with 108MB to go, there were an estimated 6 minutes remaining. After downloading 734MB, it estimated that the remaining 34MB would take 2 minutes.  I don't think that the slowdown was on my end. When the download started, the MacBook had the Wi-Fi network all to its own. During the download, the Windows 8 tablet downloaded its 199MB payload very quickly. Even after the Windows 8 tablet was done, the MacBook download continued to crawl. In the end, it took 18 minutes to download the 768 megabytes. After rebooting, the system estimated that it would take 7 minutes to install the new software. There was a progress bar and a time estimate that continued to adjust. Nice. Then, another reboot and yet another progress bar. The initial estimate was pretty good, installing the software and rebooting took 8 minutes. After all this, the system was still running version 10.10.5, which I found puzzling. I'm not a Mac user, this may be normal, but I wondered if something had gone wrong. A little poking around (Apple icon -> About This Mac -> System Report.. button) turned up a System Information report that includes a log of software installations. The log confirmed that Security Update 2016-004 had just been installed, so OS X loses brownie points for not fully indicating the operating system version. Both iOS and Chrome OS display an operating system version number that increases when the OS is updated, which, to me, seems like a better approach. The log also showed that the MacBook was at a dis-advantage in this contest. The previously installed Security Update was 2016-002 so this was the only device missing two rounds of bug fixes. And, it showed that along with the Security Update, it also installed Safari 9.1.2, iTunes 12.4.2, Remote Desktop Client Update 3.8.5.1 and the mysterious SU_TITLE which has no version number (more points deducted).  TOTAL TIME:  26 minutes Chrome OS The transparency of software updates is, to me, one of the best things about Chrome OS. End users are not asked or told anything about updating any software. It just works. That said, Chromebook users can opt into the bug fix game if they want.  To kick off a software update, run the browser and do: Help -> About Chrome OS and then click on the "Check for and apply updates" button. In my test, the check for updates took seconds, then it transitioned to "Updating your device..." During this phase it displays a completion percentage, but offers neither a time estimate (hat tip to OS X) nor an indication of how how much data is being downloaded. When the completion percentage hit 100% it sat there for a bit before telling me to "Restart your device to finish updating." At this point the black upward pointing arrow (the standard indication that a reboot is needed) also appeared in its usual spot on the bottom right of the screen. Unlike the other OSs, when Chrome OS reboots to install new software, it is a standard, ordinary restart. There is no warning not to turn off the computer as in Windows. There is no non-standard user interface as in OS X and iOS. There is no progress bar. It tells the end user nothing. It just reboots. As noted earlier, the system started out at version 51.0.2704.106 (Help -> About Chrome OS from the browser). After the update, it was running version 52.0.2743.85. A nice thing about Chrome OS is that it also assigns a date to the operating system. The "About" page has a "more info..." link that when clicked shows the Build Date of the system. I started with a system that was built on July 6, 2016 and ended with one built on July 21, 2016. The date is a bit more hidden than I would like, but still, Chrome OS is the only system that provides dates. TOTAL TIME:  4 minutes BAKE-OFF OBSERVATIONS The Windows devices had a hardware advantage, not that it mattered. To recap the timings: Chrome OS took 4 minutes, OS X Yosemite took 26, iOS 9 needed 29 minutes the first time and 23 minutes the second, Windows 8.1 took an hour and 19 minutes, and Windows 7 needed an hour and 45 minutes. I think it's fair to say that Chrome OS does the best job of self-updating. Not only is it fast, but it's also automated far beyond any other system. It is so automated, that it doesn't have to tell the end user anything. Chromebook users are not even aware that software is being updated - a small black arrow is the only user interface for software updates, and it can be ignored without penalty. I like that the version number of the operating system increases as updates are installed and it's the only OS that assigns itself a date in human readable format. Finally, Chrome OS auto-updates everything, the operating system, extensions, plug-ins and, yes, Flash too. It is the gold standard for software updating.  FLASH The Adobe Flash Player, while not part of any operating system, is a thorn in the side of many. It may well be the most dangerous software in the world, considering both how buggy and how widespread it is.  Flash is not an issue on iOS, which offers no support, or Chrome OS, which auto-updates it, but on Windows and OS X, it's a mess. Windows 8 and 10 will at least update Flash along with the operating system, but just for Microsoft's browsers. OS X however, is totally hands off. In my test, even the just-updated Safari browser was still using an old version of Flash.  On both Windows and OS X, the Defensive Computing approach is to limit Flash to the Chrome browser, which both auto-updates it and tries to disable its use in advertisements.  Related: Apple Mac Apple iOS Chrome OS Windows PCs Apple Google Microsoft 1 2 Page 1 Next 12 steps to lower your espionage risk Shop Tech Products at Amazon You Might Like Notice to our Readers We're now using social media to take your comments and feedback.

And that means another Primal Blueprint Real Life Story from a Mark’s Daily Apple reader. If you have your own success story and would like to share it with me and the Mark’s Daily Apple community please contact me here. I’ll continue to publish these each Friday as long as they keep coming in. Thank you for reading! My wife (a naturopathic physician) has always been interested in the pursuit of a healthful lifestyle. Wanting to lose the last 15 pounds, feeling a bit bloated and believing she may have issues with bacterial overgrowth, she started researching the paleo diet. After months of trying the paleo diet, she couldn’t figure out why it wasn’t helping, until she came across MDA (and read The Primal Blueprint) that she began to understand the importance of monitoring carbohydrate intake. As soon as she started abandoning starchier foods, she watched the numbers on the scale go down. Given that we enjoy cooking together, it was only natural for me to adopt the Primal lifestyle, too. I used to eat extremely un-healthfully and was very addicted to sugar. To give you an idea of how addicted I was, I often emptied seven packets of sugar in my cafeteria-sized coffee; I drank energy drinks every day with entire chocolate candy bars; I ate desert with every meal; every evening I consumed a pint of Ben and Jerry’s; every weekend I munched on doughnuts and each morning I had a fun, sugary cereal. My non-sugar “meals” (if you can call them that) consisted of the dollar cheeseburgers and meals at McDonalds. Dinner was usually the “healthiest” meal, which consisted of an array of cafeteria food or pizza. Of course, as aforementioned above, I completed my meal with desert and a Pepsi (water and I were not friends back then). I always knew that I wanted to eat more healthfully but I never really knew how to do so until my wife started coaching me on nutrition, sharing what she was learning from The Primal Blueprint, and I saw how well she responded to her diet changes. After a while, I slowly weaned myself off sugar and began eating more whole foods. However, it wasn’t until I fully switched to Primal that I began to understand how this lifestyle would truly impact my life. Two months into the diet, I started to notice that my sciatica was not flaring up as frequently as it used to. In fact, prior to implementing my new eating habits, I experienced debilitating pain one to two times per month. It had been a 15-year struggle. Despite this breakthrough, I remained a bit skeptical of the reasons behind my two month sabbatical from pain. My skepticism was quickly halted after I attended a work function that offered foods such as Korean beef sliders and beer. I decided a little veering off of primal eating couldn’t hurt me too much. After indulging in wheat buns and beer, I had severe sciatica for a week following my binge and instantly I made the connection between carbohydrate-laden foods and inflammation in my back. I’ve since learned my lesson and I haven’t had any sciatica pain since that time. Not only have I been pain free, but my seasonal allergies decreased significantly. The first year I started eating primal, when allergy season approached, I was able to switch from over the counter medications to natural nutraceuticals for two months or so, until the pollen count dwindled. The following year of remaining on The Primal Blueprint, I didn’t even need the natural supplements and only took a couple capsules once or twice during the entire season! In fact, my immune system seems to be operating so well that I have been able to bypass the cold and flu season each time it visits my colleagues at work. My co-workers have all been sick at least a half a dozen times in the last two years; however, it passed me by every time. While I did catch a minor cold after being cold free for two and a half years, it passed quickly and I haven’t been sick since. My boss actually had to ask me to call in “not sick” to use up my sick days because I hadn’t touched them. Along with the change in my diet, I have also been experimenting with high intensity interval training using body weight and strength-building exercises. I’ve been using Mark Lauren’s “You Are Your Own Gym” DVDs and have really benefited from the functional bodywork. I have incorporated a pull up bar into my workouts and have noticed a huge difference in my upper body strength. On the weekends, I enjoy a lengthy hike or walk with my wife. We’ve even incorporated play into our workouts by longboarding at the park. Even at 41, my wife enjoys longboarding with me. The results of working out 20 minutes three times per week have far outweighed the minimal results I experienced with my two-hour gym workouts. The at-home workouts have provided quick results and made cancelling my gym membership an easy decision, considering both the time and the money I was consuming trying to get fit. After just a few short months of working out in a more primal fashion, my belly fat has nearly disappeared and a six pack is starting to show. I was never a heavy guy or “overweight,” but I’ve always had a little fat layer over my belly. For the first time, my abdomen area is no longer pudgy. Now, two years into this lifestyle, my appetite for sweets is completely different. I used to want the entire candy bar, but now, two pieces of dark chocolate is enough to satisfy me. When it is doughnut day or pizza day at work, I am no longer tempted. Everyone at work thinks I am superhuman because I easily decline these foods, including birthday cake (which occurs often in a large office). My typical meals now are relatively simple but very satisfying. For breakfast I have black coffee with a bit of butter, a protein smoothie with a few berries and a tons of greens. Lunch is usually more greens, grass-fed beef or organic chicken breast with a quality mayonnaise-based or avocado-based dressing. Snacks are usually nuts or pumpkin seeds and dinner is roasted veggies with salmon or grain-free meatballs or steak. Of course, most nights I indulge in a glass (or two) of quality dry red wine. It is hard to say if I am mentally and emotionally any different, but I can go great lengths without eating and not feel like I’m going to go crazy. Before I changed my eating habits, I experienced low blood sugar symptoms (i.e. crankiness) that often accompany glucose deregulation. These days, skipping a meal here and there is no big deal. Overall, the primal lifestyle has completely overhauled my health, my body composition and my outlook on life. I am pain free, I am allergy free, I am nearly cold and flu free, I am gym membership free, I am time-sucking-workout free, I am prescription free and I am food addiction free. The best part is that I don’t feel like I am missing out on anything! The recipes on the MDA resource list are all incredible. My wife and I like the Nom Nom Paleo cookbook as well and have even enjoyed creating recipes of our own that fit the primal parameters. I love that I still get to enjoy red wine and dark chocolate and I never feel deprived, now that my sugar addiction is gone. I can’t think of better preventative medicine than taking control of your health (and reversing symptoms) by simply changing what you stick your fork into! Thank you, Mark, for sharing your knowledge and vast research on the proven benefits of this lifestyle. It has saved me many trips to a doctor’s office – both presently – and more importantly, in the future!

How differently you must experience life and body, now that you’re free from allergies, pain, meds and food addictions! Wonderful example of how sticking to a supportive paleo-primal eating plan offers such freedom to live a fuller, more ease-filled, more vital life. 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ John 3 months 13 days ago Thank you Dr. Dana. You are correct, I experience life in such a different way now. In the past when I had bad sciatica flair ups, one leg would be noticeably shorter because of how inflamed my body was. I limped around a few times a month at least. Vital is definitely a great word for that!!! 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ oxide 3 months 18 days ago How was your wife simultaneously high-carb and Paleo?

In fact, most grocery stores have an entire section devoted to Paleo breads, pastas, and desserts–which misses the point entirely. Merely replacing one form of junk food with another (via substitute foods), and calling it Paleo, means a better understanding is needed as to what a healthy diet really consists of. I’m not saying John’s wife did this, but it’s a marketing trap that many people get caught up in. 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Casey 3 months 16 days ago I’ve done “high carb” paleo. I ate sweet potatoes and/or white potato every day and a few servings of fruit. So, every meal had a good sized portion of potato, and then there was all the fruit. I didn’t make a bunch of paleo sweets to accomplish this, either. You still reap the benefits of paleo, for sure, but the scale didn’t budge! 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ John 3 months 13 days ago Good question: Yes, lots of sweet potatoes and plantains, with coconut sugars! 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Nocona 3 months 18 days ago You musta been eating 400 grams of carbs a day before Primal.

I have a very similar bone structure. Those long arms can really complicate things when it comes the the free weights. It’s good to hear that your seasonal allergies are subsiding. I feel as if mine get better when I’m really dedicated to eating clean, but have never been sure if it was all in my head! 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Paul 3 months 16 days ago I’m convinced that allergies themselves are mostly in our heads.

I doubt it is in your head if you notice a difference. The allergy meds I took years before this were pretty serious and my nose would get so clogged that my ears would be effected. After I found Primal, I thought it might just be a low pollen year or something but I noticed that everyone around me was suffering. There are a few times a year where I have some small symptoms but no where near what it used to be. 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ John M 3 months 8 days ago I have noticed the same kind of thing for seasonal allergies. I used to take Claritin almost 6 months of the year because EVERY season got me. Since switching to a Primal lifestyle, I haven’t taken Claritin in over two years or any other kind of allergy medicine for that matter. And we had a bad spring for allergies this year. The only time that I have noticed an issue is when I have decided to have a few cheat meals over a weekend. 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Whitney 3 months 18 days ago Great work John!

Love that you are pain free and no longer sick. And amazing how that pain came back when you strayed! Tell your wife she is a badass for learning to longboard. I’m going to have to try that! 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ John 3 months 13 days ago Thanks Elizabeth, it is amazing when we allow our bodies to take care of themselves. It’s nice to know what foods I have a hard time with and stay away. When people think I am strong for keeping distance from a certain food, I tell them that it’s not necessarily because I have strong will power but I think of the consequences and it’s easier to avoid. I will send your regards to my wife, just don’t try any large hills on a longboard like I did trying to show off 🙂 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Mark 3 months 18 days ago Excellent story, thanks for sharing.

Since he has been on this program he has experienced significant progress as well. So proud of him! I have been extremely fortunate to have a lean and healthy genetic make up.

We know that the company’s rivals such as Google are heavily invested in the technology, especially considering the launch of Google Assistant, an AI that learns more about you the more you use it. That being said, it certainly sounds like Apple is interested. According to a report from GeekWire, they have learnt that Apple has recently acquired machine learning AI startup Turi. In a statement provided to GeekWire, the company gave a rather boilerplate response which reads, “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.” GeekWire’s sources have also told them that the deal is said to be worth around $200 million. Following the acquisition, Turi is expected to remain in Seattle, meaning that it sounds like Apple plans on keeping them intact as opposed to shutting them down and just keeping their technology and some key personnel. This isn’t the first machine learning AI company that Apple has acquired. According to TechCrunch, back in 2015 Apple acquired Perceptio, a company that specializes in machine learning and image recognition. It is unclear yet as to what Apple has planned for Turi, but given what Apple’s rivals have done with Google Now, Google Assistant, Cortana, and etc., it is possible that Apple might be trying to improve its efforts with Siri, but we guess only time will tell.

This will give Apple flexibility in developing electricity generation for its own use. It also demonstrates how technology giants have developed renewable energy traditional utilities have been slow to build. Solar farm from Apple Environmental Sustainability Report Apple has numerous renewable energy projects around the world. These projects are part of the company’s drive to have 100% of its global energy be renewable. Apple built or invested in solar farms in California, Nevada, and Arizona, as well as smaller efforts in North Carolina. The ability to sell excess capacity into the wholesale market becomes a hedge when determining how much capacity to build. Get ‘Er Done The most interesting thing is how Apple could make these investments when confronted by a lack of renewable supply. This is a huge shift made possible by the enormous wealth Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon have amassed. All four companies have been involved in renewable energy projects in the States. Public utilities have served an important role in the nation’s development, but private companies have done a better and faster job of developing renewable sources. I’m hoping that has positive ripple effects throughout the industry. In the meanwhile, the ability to sell into the wholesale market won’t be a noticeable revenue stream for Apple. The power to hedge against its own needs is the biggest benefit of this approval to a company of Apple’s size.

(Photo by Carl Court/Getty Images) ORG XMIT: 659228091 ORIG FILE ID: 586113570 (Photo: Carl Court, Getty Images) Apple is continuing to make inroads into artificial intelligence. The Cupertino, Calif.-based tech behemoth bought Turi, a machine learning platform, for $200 million, according to sources at GeekWire. Apple would not confirm the move to USA TODAY, but said the company buys smaller technology companies “from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.” The Cupertino-based tech behomouth appears to be coming to terms with slumping demand for the iPhone by expanding into other markets, including artificial intelligence. CEO Tim Cook has said Apple will continue to enhance services through artificial intelligence, like improving facial recognition in photos and recommending user-specific songs and news, in a conference call to investors. Apple announced improvements to its digital assistant Siri to future operating systems during its most recent World Wide Developers Conference in June, indicating a stronger reliance on AI. The company also revealed a new Home app that aggregates all connected home appliances. Turi did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the buy. Apple (AAPL) shares were up 1.52% at 107.48 Friday afternoon following the news. Amazon, Google and other tech giants have been investing in AI for years. Amazon’s Echo connected speaker, which can turn on lights, access online music and answer questions, is “hard to keep in stock,” according to CEO Jeff Bezos who would not reveal sales numbers. Google answered with their own voice-activated home speaker, Google Home. 52 CONNECTTWEET 20 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2aM95qY
Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 6 August 2016 | MYT 7:00 AM Apple is replacing the pistol emoji with a squirt gun by jessica roy Fun, not deadly: In fall, when the new version of its operating system rolls out, what was previously a pistol emoji will be replaced by a green squirt gun. — Apple The right to bear arms is enshrined in the US Constitution, but not in your text messages.  As a tech company, Apple doesn't have an obvious stake in the gun control debate. But a recently announced change to its emoji library suggests the Cupertino company is taking a stance on the issue.  In fall, when the new version of its operating system rolls out, what was previously a pistol emoji will be replaced by a green squirt gun.  In its announcement about the new set of emojis, Apple did not explicitly mention the gun. In addition to touting new options that make existing emojis more diverse and a rainbow flag, it referenced "beautiful redesigns of popular emoji." The only emoji that was a redesign of an existing emoji was the squirt gun.  In July 2015, the group New Yorkers Against Gun Violence published an open letter to Apple chief executive Tim Cook asking the company to symbolically "disarm the iPhone" by getting rid of the gun emoji. It's not clear whether the decision was in response to the letter. (Apple did not respond to requests for comment on this story.)  Emojis are not made by Apple. They are selected, designed and coded by a nonprofit organisation called the Unicode Consortium. The Unicode Consortium was incorporated in 1991 to standardize how text and characters are read by computers. Unicode ensures that when you type something on one kind of computer or device, it can be read by someone using any other computer or device.  Platforms like Apple, Microsoft, Samsung and Facebook decide exactly how those characters will appear on the device you're using. A paper published earlier this year by researchers from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities showed how different some emoji can look across devices.  In this case, Apple is reinterpreting how it will "read" the pistol emoji. Instead of depicting it as a metal revolver, it will show the green toy water pistol. Emoji encyclopaedia Emojipedia's entry on the pistol character suggests it will still look like a gun if you view it on most other devices and platforms.  Jeremy Burge, founder of Emojipedia and a member of the Unicode Consortium, said the change will not require any input or updates from Unicode. Apple is just changing the design of an existing emoji. And it wouldn't be the first company to make this particular change: On Microsoft devices, the pistol emoji looks like a toy ray-gun.  "Any vendor is free to change how they design each emoji, no matter how confusing it could be. For instance, Samsung uses some crackers instead of a cookie for the cookie emoji," he said in an email. "It's confusing, but Unicode doesn't have much to do with how each company designs its emojis."  It's not the first time Apple has opted against a gun emoji: In June, Apple asked the Unicode Consortium to exclude a scoped shooting rifle from the upcoming set of emojis. Unicode complied, and the rifle was scrapped. — Los Angeles Times/Tribune News Service You May Be Interested Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Yew Sin-Ee Yi continue fine run in Hong Kong Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Fraud in Felda Global Ventures Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Others Also Read Putting the city at risk M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Japan enlists Sailor Moon to promote safe sex advertisement Latest News Philippines money laundering body charges bankers for ignoring cyberheist Google nears tax settlement with Indonesian government: sources The new Vivo V5 takes the selfie crown Self-driving car group urges US regulators to clear road Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers Most Viewed in Tech Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Viral video will crash your iPhone The new Vivo V5 takes the selfie crown Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Google nears tax settlement with Indonesian government: sources Self-driving car group urges US regulators to clear road Israeli firm can steal phone data in seconds Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers Pokémon Go says thanks and reshuffles CP Watch your self-ie!

jalopnik Deadspin Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker Jalopnik Reviews Foxtrot Alpha Black Flag Truck Yeah Lanesplitter The Garage Here's An Easy Idea For What To Call The Upcoming Electric Mercedes Brand Justin T. Westbrook8/05/16 8:25pm Filed to: Mercedes Benz Mercedes Benz AMG Maybach electric cars EVs branding brand 88 12 Edit Promote Dismiss Undismiss Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Mercedes is reportedly planning to spin-off a new, all-electric sub-brand for its electric vehicle efforts, similar to BMW’s i-brand. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but Mercedes is an automaker with a history full of great names, which is exactly why they shouldn’t try anything new. Advertisement I get why BMW named its electric vehicle lineup with the “i-” moniker. Well, it was probably the success of a small tech company called Apple. There was even a moment where Apple was actually touring the i-brand facilities with rumored interest in developing autonomous systems for transportation in the near future. That fell through, though. But now Mercedes is doing the same thing—creating a separate brand with its own name and likely a distinct, futuristic style (I am guessing) for its future electric automotive efforts. According to Bloomberg, the new brand will be introduced with a lineup of two electric SUVs or crossovers and two electric sedans. Advertisement Reportedly, Mercedes doesn’t have a name for the new brand yet, but I’d argue that they, in fact, do already have a name! Perhaps multiple options! You see, Mercedes has a bunch of great people, names and brands associated with them. Mercedes-Benz is synonymous with sturdy German engineered cars, and AMG is synonymous with performance. Maybach just sounds drenched in class and luxury. Because of all of this, I’m convinced that Mercedes can’t best what they already have in naming a new electric brand something different—which is why they shouldn’t. My crazy idea? Well since most of the “Mercedes” brand is just referred to as Mercedes or Mercedes-AMG nowadays, the “Benz” name has slightly fallen to the wayside. So why not split Benz off from Mercedes and call the new electric car brand, well, just Benz? Sponsored This is brilliant, when you really think about it. If Mercedes names its EVs under the “Benz” name, you bring “Mercedes Benz” back with an entirely new meaning. Each is its own brand with a distinct difference, but all of the cars are still a Mercedes. Mercedes sort of shot itself in the foot all those decades ago when it started calling things an “E-Class.” Modern simpletons would easily associate the “E” with “electricity,” but alas that can’t happen. Advertisement Advertisement But I think Benz is still a good, strong-sounding name. On top of that, it’s only four letters, and any modern branding expert will tell you less letters for new things is always better. It also has a “z” in it, which is inherently cool. So how about it Mercedes? Karl and Bertha Benz deserve their rightful place as automotive innovators, so why not honor them with the next-largest automotive innovation second only to when they slapped a petrol engine on a horse carriage—electric cars? Meet Bertha Benz, The Woman Who Took The First Real Drive Meet Bertha Benz, The Woman Who Took The First Real Drive Meet Bertha Benz, The Woman Who Took The First… As Google's doodle reminded me, today is International Women's Day. It's kind of… Read more Read more We get to call some of your cars “Mercedes Benz,” and your branding and marketing departments get a short and simple word that’s just as cool-sounding as “Tesla.” Advertisement But no, you’ll probably go with something else. Something that’s been overthought by chairmen in committees and youth focus groups, and we’ll end up with the Mercedes lektric or eevee or e-v-wgn or Elek and I’ll just have to hate it.

The Friday Wrap is, my weekly collection of news stories, posts, studies, and reports designed to help organizational communicators stay current on the trends and technology that affect their jobs. These may be items that flew under the radar while other stories grabbed big headlines. As always, I collect material from which I select Wrap stories (as well as stories to report on the For Immediate Release podcast, along with stuff I just want to remember to read) on my link blog, which you’re welcome to follow. If you want to make sure you never miss an edition of the Wrap, along with extra material only for subscribers, sign up for my weekly email briefing. News Facebook’s latest algorithm change demotes clickbait—You know the headlines: “Woman asks husband if dress makes her look fat. You won’t believe what happened next!” Okay, I made that one up, but you’ve seen tons of clickbait in recent years. Facebook’s latest change to its News Feed algorithm is designed to categorize such headlines that “withhold or distort information” as clickbait and allow them to slip through less often. It’s the first time Facebook has targeted clickbait. The takeaway: Facebook is working hard to make the News Feed a more satisfying experience in an effort to retain users. This change, at least, won’t have an effect on brands’ efforts to reach customers. Read more Saatchi’s Roberts resigns—Saatchi & Saatchi Chairman Kevin Roberts, who was already under suspension following tone-deaf comments about gender, has resigned. Parent company Publicis put Roberts on leave after he told an interviewer that the gender debate is over. The takeaway: An IABC study from the late 1970s defined the communications industry as a “velvet ghetto” where women outnumbered men but rarely broke through into management and leadership positions. It’s amazing that this continues to be an issue nearly 40 years later. Read more FTC crackdown on paid celebrity posts is coming—Influencer marketing includes paying celebrities to display their products in their social media channels. The FTC is not amused when those pictures, videos, and posts aren’t clearly labeled as paid ads. Use of hashtags like #ad, #sp, and #sponsored are often inadequate. An FTC spokesperson said, “We believe consumers put stock in endorsements and we want to make sure they are not being deceived.” The takeaway: Disclose, disclose, disclose. Full stop. That goes for native ads, too. Read more Apple replaces pistol emoji with a Super Soaker—Among new emoji Apple is introducing is a replacement for the pistol emoji; it’s now a classic Super Soaker water pistol. The move comes amidst activist pressure to get rid of the gun. The new emoji also include a host of athletes in anticipation of widespread use during the Olympics. The takeaway: The move is another indicator of the move toward social activism among corporations. It also speaks to the widespread adoption of emojis. Read more Google AMP appears in all mobile search results—Google’s mobile web initiative, Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP), is designed to make web pages appear quickly on mobile devices wherever they may be (as opposed to Facebook’s Instant Articles, which are also lightning-fast but only work when you’re on Facebook). Google is planning to display AMP links in all mobile search results. They’ll appear accompanied by lightning bolts. Rankings won’t be affected, but as users come to understand an AMP page won’t keep them waiting, they’re likely to click on them most. The takeaway: Talk to your web people about producing AMP versions of content if they’re not already. Read more If you’re not a paying sponsor, steer clear of the Olympics—Newsjacking is great, but the Olympic Committee’s Rule 40 spells trouble for those attempting to leverage it at the Games that are just about to start. Non-sponsor companies have received a letter from the U.S. Olympic Committee warning them not to use Olympics intellectual property, which include obvious properties like logos, but also hashtags. “Do not create social media posts that are Olympic themed, that feature Olympic trademarks, that contain Games imagery or congratulate Olympic performance unless you are an official sponsor,” the letter read. The first response you’ll get if you violate the rules is a demand to remove the content. Legal action could follow. The takeaway: Your desire to ride on the Olympics coattails will be crushed by the negative publicity of a lawsuit. Even having to remove content will draw unwelcome attention. The best advice: Just don’t go there, even though it’s too bad the Committee isn’t just a little flexible in terms of such posts as a congratulations to a home-town athlete.. Read more Database of Millennial opinions available for free—A database of over 130 million Millennial opinions is now available for free searching by anyone who wants insight into what this important demographic is currently thinking on a range of issues. The database is from Whatsgoodly. The takeaway: While too much focus is placed on age demographics, the data here can be invaluable—and did I mention that it’s free? Read more Dropbox opens Paper beta to everyone—Any Dropbox user is now able to give Paper a try via an iOS or Android app. Paper goes head-to-head with Google Docs for online document creation. Designed for mobile, Paper has given rise to more than a million documents from the early beta users. The takeaway: Easy document creation via phones and tablets is increasingly important as part of the mobile shift. Being able to create documents that go straight to a Dropbox folder of your choosing is a great idea. Read more Facebook introduces Page Sections—Marketers, beset by Facebook algorithm changes that make it harder and harder to reach customers, finally have something to cheer about. Facebook has introduced new sections for Company Pages to promote goods and services. Shop is a section available in emerging markets that allows businesses to list products that customers can buy through Messenger. Services, which will be available in all geographies, also lets companies list products and services with prices, a description, and photos. The takeaway: The Messenger connection for actual purchases speaks volumes about Facebook’s commitment to mobile. Facebook recently announced that 1 billion people access the social network via mobile on any given day. Read more New index measures consumer attitudes toward online marketing—The Digital Satisfaction Index is a new tool that lets marketers grasp “how consumers make connections with a brand leading up to their final decision to either engage and purchase or go elsewhere.” The index was developed by Intent Lab, a partnership between the Medill School of Journalism and Performics Worldwide. Intent Labs will conduct original research linked to major brands to help those brands better understand the online behavior of their customers. The index is based on research that identified four key elements of consumer satisfaction: trust, utility, social, and privacy. The takeaway: As a measurement geek, I love the idea of an index targeting digital satisfaction. I’m curious how it’ll correlate to the long-standing reputation index. Read more Trends Podcast marketing gets serious—NPR went far beyond traditional podcast marketing to launch the second season of “Invisibilia.” More than 200 listening parties were held in 32 states and three countries. Videos and other sharable content was produced for social media; one video posted to Facebook got more than 700,000 views. Invisibilia was expected to top the 50 million downloads its first season produced. The takeaway: Podcasting is an increasingly important part of the content mix for media companies. If every company is a media company (as Tom Foremski postulated back in 2009), most companies are falling behind the media curve. Podcasts are hot and will only get hotter. Explore the potential for podcasting in your organization. Read more Marriott taps into Pokeman Go frenzy—Joining a roster of brands that are capitalizing on Pokemon Go’s unprecedented popularity, Marriott is sponsoring one player’s efforts to capture the entire collection of Pokemon. Nick Johnson captured every creature available in the U.S., leading Marriott’s loyalty operation to offer to sponsor his international travel tab in his quest to get the rest. Marriott Rewards and Johnson are chronicling the quest on Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram. The takeaway: This is a smart move by Marriott and a clever way to ride the Pokemon wave without looking like just another me-too brand. The investment is small and the publicity returns are high. Read more Kik’s Bot Shop is paying off—Kik, the mobile messaging app that was among the first to introduce chatbots via its Bot Shop, is seeing growing use among users and businesses. Some 1.8 billion messages have been communicated between users and bots from the 111 featured bots. Research also found the use of bots results in 32% more time spent on the app and that they drive greater completion rates for brands. The takeaway: Bot adoption is surging and will become routine faster than you’re probably anticipating. Read more Organizations learning to use the right tools for the audience—If you want your message to resonate with Millennials, you should communicate with them using the kinds of tools they’re accustomed to using. A pro-fracking website funded by players in the industry is doing just that, using memes, spoof videos, emojis, quizzes, and listicles. Love fracking or hate it, you have to admire this advocacy group for understanding what it takes to get a message through to an audience that won’t sit and read reports and studies on their phones. Read more Price Waterhouse Coopers lists blockchain among essential technologies—PWC studied some 150 emerging technologies for an executive report and settled on eight that are essential for companies to grasp, including blockchain, a technology that will disrupt more than you can imagine yet few communicators understand. The other essential technologies include Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, drones, the Internet of Things, robots, Virtual Reality, and 3D printing. The takeaway: I know I ask you to get up to speed on all kinds of different technologies, but no kidding, blockchain is coming fast and will have a profound impact on every aspect of business. It is, effectively, a new network that runs in parallel to the Internet. If you need a quick start, try “The Blockchain Revolution,” by Dan Tapscott and his son, who works in the blockchain space. I’ll be reviewing it soon for For Immediate Release’s book review podcast. Read more Research Most native ads are done wrong—Native advertising is clearly a savior for publishers and a boon for marketers. The greatest risk to native advertising is a perception that it is inherently deceptive. Current practices suggest that this perception could take root, leading to regulation. A study of native ads appearing on home pages of the top 100 news sites found that 71% didn’t adequately disclose that they were ads. The study identified 43 distinct terms or phrases used to label the ads. While “and” and “paid” are clear enough, others can confuse readers into thinking their looking at editorial content. These include “sponsored by,” “powered by,” “special coverage,” and “recommended for you.” The Online Trust Alliance, which conducted the study, noted that a failure to self-regulate will negatively affect “consumer trust and confidence in online advertising and the brand reputation of sites…poor transparency will backfire, driving calls for regulatory oversight.” The takeaway: It has been two years since Richard Edelman said the PR industry has a small window to become the stewards of native advertising and ensure it’s done right. I fear that window has closed and native ads are headed for government regulation. Read more After-hours email is exhausting—The result of checking work email after-hours and on weekends is burnout, according to a new academic report. It’s not the actual checking of the email that’s so exhausting; it’s the “constant worrying about off hour email.” The study from researchers at three universities, “Exhausted but Unable to Disconnect,” found employees “are growing exhausted by the expectation that they will always be available, never knowing what kind of work requests will be asked of them off hours.” The takeaway: There’s a difference between expecting employees to answer work-related emails when they’re supposed to be on the “life” side of the work-life equation and giving them access to content they may want to consume. Rules about off-hour email should be implemented but shouldn’t restrict off-hour access to the intranet and other company content. Read more Most companies’ customization efforts need work—Brands everywhere are trying to deliver customized products and services, but consumers say marketers “get it right” less than 30% of the time. According to Radius Global Market Research Vice President Shira Horn, the “survey shows that consumers are potentially very receptive to efforts to customize the brand experience. But if marketers don’t do the homework involved to provide and communicate highly relevant benefits to their specific audiences, they are unlikely to capitalize on the opportunity.” The takeaway: I’ve seen it. You have too. “Personalized” ads for things we already bought or have no interest in. When a marketer gets it right, though, it can be gold. Read more Video LinkedIn adds influencer videos—A select group of highly influential LinkedIn users is answering questions in short videos that are being aggregated in a new LinkedIn platform. The group of 500 influencers are using a proprietary app called Record to capture their answers of up to 30 seconds. The takeaway: I was skeptical when I heard about this new feature, but having seen a couple of the questions and the collection of video answers, I’m now a fan. When the program expands, it could be invaluable to have your company’s subject matter experts contributing, just as it’s useful to have them appear in Quora answers. Read more Pinterest introduces native video player—A fully integrated native video player is under development at Pinterest The player, along with personalized video recommendations, will appear in the next few months. Video viewing has grown 60% over the last year on Pinterest. The takeaway: It’s hard to think of a platform that isn’t ripe for video. If Pinterest is part of your communication effort, consider increasing the volume of videos you pin. Read more Marketers to increase social video ads—Most U.S. marketers will spend more on social video ads, with Facebook getting most of the attention. With 70.8% of marketers surveyed planning to invest in social ads and boosting the ads, 65.8% will do it on Facebook. The next most popular platform is YouTube, with only 42.3% planning to spend there. The takeaway: The media model to embrace is PESO—paid, earned, shared, owned. Video advertising is demonstrably effective and worth considering, even for corporate and PR messaging, as the “paid” part of the model. Read more Marketers optimistic about digital video advertising —Forty-two percent of marketers are increasingly optimistic about digital video advertising, with B2B marketers in particular making it an investment priority: 84% plan to grow their video marketing budgets this year and 83% said video ads were effective. Across both B2B and B2C companies, Facebook and Snapchat have overtaken YouTube as the social platform of choice for video ads. The takeaway: The two studies cited in this report just add to the pile of evidence that video marketing works, even as the field gets crowded. Time to brush off your video production skills (if you haven’t already). Read more Media companies pursue TV content—Here’s another media company trend brands aren’t following: Publishers including Vox Media, BuzzFeed, Thrillist Media Group, and Mashable are doing deals to broadcast content on TV. One example: Daily digital magazine Ozy is producing a 16-part program for PBS about an array of political candidates from American history. Vox Entertainment is developing a show for the FYI network about prefabricated homes. BuzzFeed is developing the web show “Mom vs. Chef” for NBCUniversal. The takeaway: With small cable networks hungry for new content and the ability to stream content through apps on services like Roku, Amazon Fire TV, and Apple TV, companies that want to behave like media companies should start exploring the potential for original TV content. Read more Facebook testing mid-roll ads on Live—If you’re live-streaming over Facebook Live, you could find your stream interrupted for 15 seconds for a commercial break as Facebook tests mid-roll video ads as part of the platform. It’s currently a small test with publishers injecting ads into their own streams. CEO Mark Zuckerberg dislikes the idea of pre-rolls; they could ruin the viewing experience, but mid-roll ads, which appear after you’ve been watching for at least five minutes, are more appealing. Some issues still need to be ironed out, such as ads appearing in the middle of coverage of a tragic news event. The takeaway: The live streaming world is maturing in a hurry. With Twitter’s sports deals and the Olympics being consumed mainly on mobile devices, viewership of live streams will only get more common. Read more Lowe’s introduces 360-degree DIY videos—As viewing of 360-degree videos gets more popular, home improvement retailer Lowe’s—already known for being an early adopter of Vine—has introduced a new initiative titled “Made in a Minute” on its Facebook Page. The Facebook 36-degree clips provide viewers with step-by-step instructions on home improvement projects. The takeaway: 360-degree videos is another innovation that costs basically nothing to start using. Watch the videos for an idea of how Lowe’s has applied them to its marketing efforts and dream up some inspiration for your company or client. Read more Instagram Stories Instagram adds Snapchat-like Stories feature—The new Instagram section offers photos and videos from users that vanish after 24 hours, just like Snapchat Stories. Instagram’s version appears across the top of your feed “as a series of circles with the avatars of people and brands you follow. When you tap on a Story, it loads, begins playing, and advances from moment to moment automatically…When you finish one person’s Story, the app automatically advances to the next person or brand, and so on.” The takeaway: The collective eye-rolling over a clear copying of Snapchat Stories misses the point. After all, if brands didn’t copy best-in-class innovation, Tide would still the only marketer of laundry pods. The point here is that Instagram has done a better job of implementing the feature that will be used by a lot more people. Read more Stories is better on Instagram than on Snapchat—While the accusations of copycatting are rampant, TNW argues that the experience is better on Instagram. While Snapchat’s interface confounds many adults, Instagram’s approach is “useful to the masses> It also has desirable features that reduce confusion, with labeled buttons instead of swipes. The takeaway: There’s no cost for a brand to start publishing Instagram Stories. Even if you’re already fully immersed in Snapchat, Instagram’s much larger base is a desirable target. As the TNW piece notes, “It’s liberating to be able to see the stories of people I’ve never met but followed on Instagram for years.” At the very least, duplicate your Snapchat efforts on Instagram. Read more Marketers prefer Instagram Stories to Snapchat—It may be brand-spanking new and the subject of considerable derision on line as being just a Snapchat copycat, but marketers seem to like Instagram’s new Stories feature. Nike saw 800,000 views in the first day it used Instagram Stories; the best performance Nike has seen on Snapchat has been 66,000 views for a video. Marketers also like the feedback Instagram provides via its heart icon (the equivalent of a like); there is no way to like a Snap. Instagram also allows marketers to restrict viewing to people over 21, important to alcohol brands. And there are simply more people on Instagram. The takeaway: So it’s a copycat move. So what? Snapchat is going to have to move quickly to adopt features that make Instagram preferable, especially a like feature that offers some quantitative feedback to marketers. Snapchat is already under some fire for inadequate marketing metrics. Read more Mobile and Wearables Most Olympics viewing will happen on phones and tablets—The Summer Olympics are upon us and research finds that most people will use their smartphones and tablets as their “first screen” for watching the competitions. The reason? They can watch events in real time rather than wait for the recordings broadcast over television. The takeaway: If you’re waiting for a good reason to start broadcasting some brand or corporate content, consider the consumer desire for more control over the content they want. Rather than wait for your YouTube or Facebook video to be uploaded, a growing number of people are looking to see it live and know they can do that wherever they are on their mobile devices. Read more Most companies don’t have a long-term mobile strategy—Everyone knows how important mobile marketing is becoming, yet 80% of brands don’t have a mobile marketing strategy that covers the next year, according to an Adobe survey of 4,000 marketers and digital decision makers. The takeaway: If your organization is part of the 80%, suggest a strategic planning session. Strategies always produce better results than flying by the seat of your pants.

But that’s about to change. Speaking at the Black Hat conference, Ivan Krstic, Apple's head of Security Engineering and Architecture, said the Cupertino company will begin offering cash rewards ranging from $20,000 - $200,000 to researchers who discover security flaws in Apple’s products. In a departure from most bug bounty programs, Apple is encouraging those who receive the rewards to donate them to charity, at which point the company will match the donation if it approves the institution. When the program first starts it will be invite-only and consist of a few dozen researchers who have previously made valuable vulnerability disclosures to the company. TechCrunch reports that the firm decided opening the program up to the public could bring a slew of fake reports that may overshadow some of the higher-risk bugs. The publication also notes, however, that Apple plans to expand the program over time and will open it up to any non-members that find significant security issues. Apple is limiting its program to five areas of vulnerabilities: the highest payout is for the discovery of bugs in secure boot firmware components; researchers that find ways of extracting confidential data from the secure enclave will receive up to $100,000; executions of arbitrary or malicious code are worth up to $50,000, as is access to iCloud account data; and access from a sandbox process to user data outside the sandbox offers rewards up to $25,000. While Apple says it is launching the program simply because bugs are becoming harder to find, the San Bernardino iPhone case from earlier this year is likely to be a major factor behind the introduction. After the company refused to help the FBI unlock the device that belonged to shooter Syed Rizwan Farook, the government agency reportedly paid third-party hackers $1 million for an exploit that allowed them to circumvent the iPhone’s brute-force protection features.

Now, the Korean giant looks set to face more claims of plagiarism from the iPhone maker, after its latest patent included images of what appears to be the Apple Watch. Samsung’s patent for the “wearable device,” which was filed back in January and published yesterday, contains numerous images showing different watches and fitness bands. But as noted by Patently Apple, some figures are clearly Apple Watch designs with its digital crown and backside charging array. They even show the watch in the same positions as the photos found on Apple’s website. The patent says the device “may be coupled with the band for fixing through a structure, such as a separated buckle or a continuous integral buckle, through a magnetic attracting force, or through a hooked ring or hooked member.” Despite IDC figures that show the global smartwatch market has shrunk 32 percent in the last year and Apple’s market share declining from 72 percent to 47 percent, the Cupertino firm has sold a million more smartwatches than Samsung in 2016, though the gap between the two is quickly closing. It will be interesting to see what comes of Samsung’s smartwatch patent. The company may claim it is merely offering up the images as examples of how other smartwatches use the bands - though Apple proabably won't see it this way. "Other aspects, advantages and salient features of the disclosure will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description which, taken in conjunction with the annexed drawings, discloses various embodiments of the present disclosure," reads the patent. Neither Samsung nor Apple have commented.

According to a report on Recode, citing unnamed sources, Apple’s current plan is to work on a "digital TV guide" for the Apple TV and its other devices that would display content from sources like Netflix and HBO all in one place. The company already partners with a few dozen content providers for its voice-controlled universal search feature on tvOS, with more being added regularly. But the proposed guide would allow users who are not looking for a specific program to browse content from their subscribed channels without having to open up each app individually. Combined with the single sign-on feature introduced at the WWDC 2016 event, users would be able to start playing TV shows and movies with one click. In order to make the guide useful Apple needs content providers to share meta data for their offerings on a real-time basis. Apparently some networks are still apprehensive about making surfacing content from multiple sources on the Apple TV too convenient, as it would presumably diminish the ability to promote their own shows, and some are also concerned about upsetting the cable cash cow and lose their leverage to dictate prices.

After all, Samsung did make smartwatches long before Apple did. And a Samsung patent application clearly shows images of the Apple Watch. DON’T MISS: The only bad cell company is Sprint Yes, I am kidding about Samsung inventing the Apple Watch, but Samsung is dead serious about copying Apple. For some very strange reason, the company thought it’s really okay to just publish drawings in a legal document that are blatant copies of a piece of hardware belonging to the competition. That’s even more worrying considering that Samsung is copying Apple. Again. From engineers to designers to the lawyers who submitted the documentation, it seems that nobody working for Samsung cared about the fact that drawings depicting what has already become an iconic product in this nice are present in the patent. Check them out: Anyone who’s ever seen an Apple Watch will recognize some of its apparent design markings, including the rectangular watch face, the Digital Crown, and the secondary button, and the heart rate sensor on the back. Even the straps resemble actual Apple products. As Business Insider explains, the patent application also contains generic smartwatch drawings, so it’s puzzling to see an Apple product in a patent that’s supposed to describe strap technology that might be seen in future Samsung smartwatch designs. Samsung has a long history of copying the iPhone, with US courts having already ruled for Apple in the past – although Samsung managed to gain a few notable victories in appeals itself. Many people already regard Samsung as an Apple imitator, regardless of what courts say. And Samsung may not be done copying just yet.

It’s working on technology to help businesses build applications that make sense of massive amounts of data. Share story By Rachel Lerman Seattle Times technology reporter Turi, a Seattle machine-learning startup formerly known as Dato, has reportedly been acquired by Apple. The deal was worth about $200 million, according to Bloomberg News, citing two people familiar with the situation. Geekwire reported news of the acquisition earlier. Turi, which previously was also called GraphLab, did not immediately return a request for comment. A source close to the deal confirmed the acquisition Friday.

Apple generally is tight-lipped about its smaller acquisitions. The Cupertino, Calif., company quietly scooped up Seattle company Union Bay Networks in 2014 and used the acquisition to launch an engineering office in Seattle. “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,” an Apple spokesman said in a statement. Turi is led by University of Washington professor Carlos Guestrin, who was recruited to the area by Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos to hold the title of “Amazon professor” at the school. Guestrin will remain a UW professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department, said Ed Lazowska, who holds the Bill & Melinda Gates Chair in the department. Lazowska declined to comment on the report of the acquisition. Turi is developing a way for businesses to build predictive analytics applications that make sense of massive amounts of data. The idea is for the companies to develop artificial-intelligence technology and incorporate it into their own apps. Apple CEO Tim Cook emphasized the company’s commitment to AI technology during an earnings conference call in July. Turi, which is headquartered in the Fremont neighborhood, raised an $18.5 million funding round in 2015 from Vulcan Capital, Opus Capital Ventures, New Enterprise associates and Madrona Venture Group.

The company confirmed to Recode it is buying Turi, which earlier in life was known as both GraphLab and Dato, It grew out of the GraphLab open-source project, which companies such as Pandora used to power recommendations. Carlos Guestrin Carlos Guestrin "Apple buys smaller companies from time to time and we generally do not discuss our purposes or plans," Apple said, repeating the statement it gives whenever it buys a company. The team, which is expected to remain in Seattle, is led by Carlos Guestrin, the Amazon professor of machine learning at the University of Washington. According to GeekWire, a Seattle-area tech news site which broke news of the deal, Apple is paying around $200 million for Turi. Guestrin also runs a well-regarded conference in the field, the most recent edition of which took place last month in San Francisco, drawing hundreds of experts in the field. Apple’s purchase of Turi comes as it and the other giants of the tech world — Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Amazon — are increasingly focused on computer learning and artificial intelligence. While Apple was early with its Siri personal assistant, other companies have made big moves into bots, while Siri has evolved rather slowly. Also, with Apple’s big push around privacy, the company has historically had less access to user data than its rivals. The company did announce a plan at this year’s Worldwide Developer Conference to open up Siri to developers and start collecting more user data. It said it would use a technique known as differential privacy to protect individual users’ data. CEO Tim Cook also spoke about the importance of machine intelligence in the company’s most recent earnings call. "We have focused our AI efforts on the features that best enhance the customer experience," Cook said. "For example, machine learning enables Siri to understand words as well as the intent behind them. That means Siri does a better job understanding and even predicting what you want, then delivering the right responses to requests. Apple is also using the technology in other areas, including recommending songs, apps and news, Cook said. "Machine learning is improving facial and image recognition in photos, predicting word choice while typing in messages and mail, and providing context awareness in maps for better directions. Deep learning within our products even enables them to recognize usage patterns and improve their own battery life." Investors in Turi include Seattle-based Madrona Venture Group, New Enterprise Associates and Paul Allen’s Vulcan. recode_divider More From Recode Donald Trump told Tim Cook that Apple is going to ‘build a big plant’ in the U.S. Post-election ‘terror and hysteria’ over Trump is not justified, says Observer editor Ken Kurson Recode Daily: Facebook built a censorship tool that could help it get back into China Can the journalists who work for Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner still cover the White House fairly?

But not everyone was happy with the change. People have found varying uses for the cavalcade of emoticons available, but the gun emoji was used in a way to signify people were frustrated and finished with a situation. It seemed to be funny in the moment, but if you really think about it, it’s kind of dark. It has been subbed for a standard green water gun with a white trigger. Harmless, right? Well, a number of people are not thrilled they have to use a water gun to show they’re angry, and Fox News wasn’t impressed either. Apple wants to make every #iPhone firearm free by replacing the pistol emoji with a squirt gun. pic.twitter.com/DawVvitfum — Fox News (@FoxNews) August 2, 2016 Apple just replaced the gun emoji and I don't really understand why such powerful company subliminally promotes weakness and shallowness. — Mediner (@BrianMediner) August 2, 2016 @AppleSupport If you remove the gun emoji I promise I will never buy another iPhone — Jeremy Cummings (@JeremyRC1) August 2, 2016 Apple replaced the gun emoji with a water gun. That’s fine, I’ll just switch to the knife emoji. — Kyle Hale (@kylethale) August 2, 2016 Apple wants to replace the gun emoji to a water gun because the gun emoji is to "threatening".

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) New coalition: Apple's move into electricity a warning for fossil fuels By John Siciliano • 8/5/16 6:12 PM John Siciliano Energy and Environment Correspondent The Washington Examiner http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.washingtonexaminer.biz/images/static/authors/JOhnSiciliano2.jpg Share Tweet Mail Print SMS More A new renewable energy coalition started up the same day technology pioneer and iPhone maker Apple received federal approval to begin selling renewable electricity on Saturday. The group's first mission appears to be getting behind Apple as a harbinger of things to come and a warning to coal utilities. "This is another indicator that fossil fuels are on the way out," said Andy Maggi, executive director of the Nevada Conservation League Education Fund, a member of the RenewNV coalition that started Thursday in support of clean energy policies in the Silver State. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the nation's grid watchdog, approved Apple's subsidiary, Apple Energy, on Thursday to sell power across the nation's wholesale electricity markets that the commission oversees. The company is authorized to begin selling electricity Saturday.

"Apple, the same company that revolutionized computers, cell phones and music, is looking to do the same with clean, renewable energy," said RenewNV, a coalition of solar energy advocacy and progressive groups in solar-rich Nevada where Apple owns the third largest chunk of its power generating assets. Apple Energy owns 19.9 megawatts of generation in the Nevada market, owns and operates 50 megawatts in the Arizona utility region and another 130 megawatts of generation in the California market. One megawatt can power about 1,000 homes. "Apple uses clean energy to provide 100 percent of the power for its data centers in Nevada, California and around the world — but it still has energy left over," Maggi said. "This has implications for everyone, but especially for companies and consumers in Nevada. "We know that other tech giants are making similar investments in Nevada and around the world," Maggi added. "Our next challenge is to ensure utility companies and state regulators embrace innovation and these types of renewable energy initiatives at all scales." The Las Vegas Sun reported Thursday that RenewNV's launch comes ahead of major November referendums on the future of the state's electricity market and the proper way to structure rates for rooftop solar. Also from the Washington Examiner Despite rumors, Elton John will not perform at Trump's inauguration "Elton will not be performing at Trump's inauguration," a representative for the "Tiny Dancer" singer said. By Joshua Axelrod • 11/23/16 1:07 PM The coalition plans to rally the public around energy-efficient, large-scale renewable projects and an increased deployment of rooftop solar, the newspaper said.

It’s working on technology to help businesses build applications that make sense of massive amounts of data. Share story By Rachel Lerman Seattle Times technology reporter Turi, a Seattle machine-learning startup formerly known as Dato, has reportedly been acquired by Apple. The deal was worth about $200 million, according to Bloomberg News, citing two people familiar with the situation. Geekwire reported news of the acquisition earlier. Turi, which previously was also called GraphLab, did not immediately return a request for comment. A source close to the deal confirmed the acquisition Friday.

Apple generally is tight-lipped about its smaller acquisitions. The Cupertino, Calif., company quietly scooped up Seattle company Union Bay Networks in 2014 and used the acquisition to launch an engineering office in Seattle. “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,” an Apple spokesman said in a statement. Turi is led by University of Washington professor Carlos Guestrin, who was recruited to the area by Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos to hold the title of “Amazon professor” at the school. Guestrin will remain a UW professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department, said Ed Lazowska, who holds the Bill & Melinda Gates Chair in the department. Lazowska declined to comment on the report of the acquisition. Turi is developing a way for businesses to build predictive analytics applications that make sense of massive amounts of data. The idea is for the companies to develop artificial-intelligence technology and incorporate it into their own apps. Apple CEO Tim Cook emphasized the company’s commitment to AI technology during an earnings conference call in July. Turi, which is headquartered in the Fremont neighborhood, raised an $18.5 million funding round in 2015 from Vulcan Capital, Opus Capital Ventures, New Enterprise associates and Madrona Venture Group.

Apple Inc. acquired artificial intelligence startup Turi Inc. for about $200 million, according to people familiar with the situation, in the latest deal by the iPhone maker to accumulate advanced computing capabilities for its products and services. Turi helps developers create and manage software and services that use a form of AI called machine learning. It also has systems that let companies to build recommendation engines, detect fraud, analyze customer usage patterns and better target potential users, according to the Seattle-based startup’s website. Apple could use this to more rapidly integrate the technology with future products.  Apple’s move Friday is part of a broader battle among Google, Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. to gain an edge in AI, particularly in the field known as pervasive computing, where software tries to automatically infer what people want, one of the people said. Turi’s technology could feed into Apple’s Siri digital assistant, the person added, and help define new ways computers interact with people.  “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,” Apple said in a statement. GeekWire earlier reported the acquisition. Apple sees its Turi acquisition as a way to better tap into the growing community of AI researchers, said a person familiar with the deal. Apple has been criticized by researchers for being too secretive about its AI work. In contrast, Turi held a two-day machine-learning conference in July in San Francisco for data scientists and academics. Formerly known as Dato, Turi raised more than $25 million from venture capital investors including New Enterprise Associates and Madrona Venture Group, according to CrunchBase. Turi couldn’t be reached for comment on the deal. The Turi team will remain in Seattle, one of the people familiar with the situation said. Apple has purchased multiple firms over the past couple of years that specialize in artificial intelligence. The company has also begun to integrate these technologies into products such as its iPhone software and Siri. Exclusive insights in your inbox, from our technology reporters around the world.

Last year, Apple acquired a pair of voice-centric AI startups, VocalIQ and Perceptio, to bolster Siri. VocalIQ specialized in using machine learning to allow voice assistants to engage in more realistic conversation. Perceptio focused on helping AI systems run on devices while sharing limited amounts of personal user data. Machine learning and AI help computers automatically understand images, videos, and spoken words. The technologies also allow systems to take actions or make recommendations on such data. Apple has already begun to show the fruits of its AI investments via better keyword recognition by Siri across multiple product lines. Apple will release a new version of its photo-management program for iPhones and iPads that uses AI to recognize objects in photos. For example, a user will be able to search for “sushi” and photographs of the food will appear. Apple will also bring machine learning capabilities to its iMessage application by adding a feature this fall that translates words in texts into emoji icons.

These next-generation iPhones might not be the most exciting smartphones Apple has ever released, but they’ll undoubtedly be among the best-selling smartphones in history following their release, which is expected in mid-September. As has been the case in years past, we already know just about everything there is to know about Apple’s upcoming new iPhones, including their updated design thanks to countless leaked photos that have emerged over the past couple of months. But why do so many photos of unreleased iPhone designs leak ahead of Apple’s official announcement? MUST SEE: This leaked photo sure makes it look like the iPhone 7 will come in a new color If you’ve been living under a rock for the past decade, we have a news flash for you: iPhones are kind of a big deal. Sentiment varies ahead of launch — the theme this year is that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are “boring” — but Apple always seems to sell new iPhones as quickly as its Eastern manufacturing partners can build them. Of course, with all those new iPhones hitting the streets so soon after launch, accessory makers have to do everything in their power to have things like protective cases ready as soon as possible, lest they miss out on a huge opportunity to capitalize on the rush of new iPhone purchases. That brings us to the reason we get to enjoy so many iPhone leaks ahead of launch each year. The following images were pulled off of Weibo and reposted by Twitter use The Malignant: The images show Apple’s upcoming iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus/Pro, but as we repeatedly explain each time new leaks pop up, those aren’t really iPhones at all. Instead, they’re models built to scale in factories in China, and they’re based on actual iPhone schematics that were leaked from Foxconn. Why build all of these iPhone 7 models? As you can see in the second and third photos above, a case maker has used those mockups to design and build a protective case that fits the models perfectly. Since the models were built using real iPhone 7 schematics, the cases will obviously also fit the new iPhones perfectly. This way, the case maker doesn’t have to wait for the iPhone 7 to launch to start designing and building cases. They’ll be ready for action on day 1. Apple’s new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus/Pro are expected to be unveiled in early September ahead of their release, which is rumor to be scheduled for September 16th.

I’ve written about the reason why a number of times but to recap briefly, Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6s Plus are just bigger iPhones. That’s it. There are no exciting features unique to Apple’s phablet line (unless for some reason you’re excited by optical image stabilization), and there are no differences in the phone’s design. It’s just bigger for the sake of being bigger. Apple knew people wanted a bigger iPhone, so it built one without putting any effort at all into differentiating it or making use of the additional size. Samsung, on the other hand, is the best in the business when it comes to the phablet market. Its flagship phones aren’t just bigger for the sake of being bigger, they add a wide range of exciting features that make use of that added size and display real estate. Never has that been more true than it is now, with the brand new Galaxy Note 7 unveiled on Tuesday. MUST SEE: 10 awesome Galaxy Note 7 features you won’t find on any iPhone View the full Samsung Galaxy Note 7 gallery See all 10 photos Samsung finally took the wraps off the hotly anticipated Galaxy Note 7 this morning, and nothing shown off on stage at New York City’s Hammerstein Ballroom came as much of a surprise to Android fans. Leaks leading up to the event revealed just about everything there was to know about the new Note 7, as has been the case with other recent flagship phones. Of course, as has also been the case in the past, leaks never do a good job of painting a complete picture of the experience afforded by a new smartphone. I spent some time with the new phone ahead of today’s announcement though, and I came away very impressed. Samsung’s new Galaxy Note 7 features a design that is similar in many ways to last year’s Galaxy Note 5. As a brief aside, you’ll notice that Samsung skipped the “Galaxy Note 6” name in order to bring its Note flagship line up to speed with its Galaxy S lineup. Samsung released the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge earlier this year, and now the Galaxy Note 7 will join those models. While the Note 7’s design and shape are strikingly similar to last year’s flagship phablets, there are some subtle differences. My favorite among them are the symmetrical curved glass on the front and back of the handset, and the smaller overall footprint that was achieved without decreasing the size of the display. Regarding that curved screen, some Samsung fans will be upset to learn that there is no Galaxy Note 7 with a flat display. Recent leaks and rumors suggest that there will be a second version released at some point in the near future, but Samsung isn’t announcing anything at this time. The curve on the Note 7 is shaped a bit differently than last year’s Galaxy S6 edge+, which launched alongside the Note 5 as a curved-display version with no stylus. The curved area on the Galaxy Note 7 occupies less of the phone’s face, and it slopes more quickly toward the outer edges of the handset. The sloped glass on the back of the phone mirrors the front this time around, and the result is a phone that feels remarkably comfortable in the hand for such a large device. Many people will still find it tricky to use with one hand though, which is why Samsung has a special feature that shrinks down the size of the display to make it usable with one hand. Inside, the Galaxy Note 7 features a 64-bit quad-core processor with two 2.15GHz cores and two 1.60GHz cores. As a result, the phone can sip power slowly when the user isn’t doing anything too complex, or it can kick things up a notch when an app needs more power. Other key Galaxy Note 7 specs include Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM, 64GB of UFS 2.0 storage, microSDXC support up to 2TB, a 12-megapixel Dual Pixel rear camera, a 5-megapixel front-facing camera, a huge 3,500 mAh battery with fast-charging support, and a 5.7-inch quad HD Super AMOLED display with a pixel density of 518 ppi. Two things need to be called out from within those specs: the first is the fact that the phone only comes in one storage size, 64GB. The second is the rear camera, which is the exact same camera as the one in the Galaxy S7. The S7’s camera is the best the world has ever seen on a smartphone in my opinion, but at the same time, Samsung historically offers some upgrades with each new model. There’s plenty more to discuss beyond the Galaxy Note 7’s specs, of course. The S Pen stylus is new and improved, offering a writing experience similar to a real ballpoint pen; there are a bunch of new S Pen-specific features and enhancements like the ability to quickly select a video clip and convert it into a GIF; there’s a remarkably fast iris scanner that lets users unlock the Note 7 or authenticate mobile payments; and more. Since I only spent a short amount of time with the phone though, I’ll wait for the full review before diving in too deep. Now, the $64,000 question: When can you buy one? Samsung’s new Galaxy Note 7 becomes available for preorder tomorrow, August 3rd. Customers who preorder the phone will also be able to choose a nice bonus along with their purchase — either a free 256GB Samsung microSD card or a free Gear Fit2. The phone will then be released on August 19th, and will be available from a wide range of retailers including all four major US wireless carriers and U.S. Cellular. Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 will be sold in three colors in the US market, including silver, black and Blue Coral with rose gold metal around the edges of the phone. As always, pricing will vary by carrier and will be announced by each wireless provider individually, likely at some point Tuesday morning. Also up for preorder beginning tomorrow is a new and improved Gear VR virtual reality headset, which still costs $99. The new model features a tweaked design with a larger flush trackpad and a dedicated button for accessing the Oculus VR store, a new USB-C connector, and it also increases the field of view from 96 degrees to 101 degrees. The new Gear VR will also launch on August 19th alongside wider availability of the $349 Gear 360 camera.

Sign up now Menu ARN Apple announces invitation-only bug bounty program at Black Hat conference Apple announces invitation-only bug bounty program at Black Hat conference The company had lagged behind competitors in providing financial incentives to report exploits to it. Glenn Fleishman (Macworld.com) 05 August, 2016 11:52 - - - - print email Comments An Apple security chief unexpectedly announced the company will pay for vulnerabilities found in certain aspects of iOS and iCloud. The program is invitation only, and payouts will be based on severity and category. The top fees across five areas range from $25,000 to $200,000, but could be much lower. The announcement came during a presentation by Ivan Krstić, Apple’s head of security engineering and architecture, at the Black Hat security research conference in Las Vegas. The presentation also included a level of technical detail and disclosure of security—here, related to AutoUnlock, HomeKit, and iCloud Keychain—that has been mostly absent in the past at conferences, according to those present. The fees offered aren’t enough to deter those merely in it for the cash, as major flaws can command cash from malicious and legitimate parties alike that far exceeds Apple’s top rates. But it could help convince researchers to disclose problems to Apple and remain mute until the bugs are patched. In some instances in the last few years, those who had discovered exploits went public after they decided sufficient time had passed without Apple providing updates. Most of Apple’s competitors for customers and eyeballs already run so-called bug bounty programs, in which researchers or hackers turn over what they know in exchange for a fee, usually paid in cash, and keeping quiet until fixes ship. Some sponsor hacking events, paying out in cash, equipment, or both for achieving a goal, like breaking out of a browser sandbox designed to contain malicious software from the rest of a system. Amazon now remains the exception among large Internet firms. Details were assembled from participant reports; the presentation isn’t available online, and Apple hasn’t posted details yet. We have a query out to Apple for more information; some researchers and publications were briefed under embargo ahead of time. Krstić listed five categories of bugs and the top fee paid for each. Those who attended say that macOS isn’t yet covered as part of the program. Secure boot firmware components ($200,000 cap) Extraction of confidential material protected by the Secure Enclave Processor ($100,000 cap) Execution of arbitrary code with kernel privileges ($50,000 cap) Unauthorized access to iCloud account data on Apple servers ($50,000 cap) Access from a sandboxed process to user data outside of that sandbox ($25,000 cap) Each of these aspects represents key vectors for attack by governments and criminals alike. While iOS has never had exploits spread significantly in the wild, jailbreaking software has made use of various methods of running arbitrary code. In a separate Black Hat presentation, the makers of the Pangu jailbreak for iOS 9 (fixed in 9.2) described how they achieved that kind of code execution. So far, there’s been no known extraction of data from Secure Enclave, the dedicated hardware in iOS devices with an A7 or newer process that acts as a one-way valve to store fingerprint characteristics and certain data associated with Apple Pay. It’s also used to prevent downgrading iOS to exploit a bug in a previous release. While iCloud accounts have been compromised in the past through certain weak password entry endpoints and social engineering of celebrity accounts, there’s been no reported breach of iCloud servers. Those invited to apply to the program will have to provide a proof of concept that works on current software and hardware. Bounties will be based on a combination of factors, as with other corporate bug programs, such as how much interaction is required from a user to trigger it, the exploit’s severity, how novel it is compared to previously known issues, and how clearly the flaw is described. Apple has also offered a bump to bug finders who want to donate their awards to charity. At its discretion—potentially to avoid supporting charities at odds with its image or public stances—Apple will match donated awards dollar for dollar. Security researcher Rich Mogull, a contributor to Macworld and other Apple-focused publications, noted in a post on his company’s blog that Apple will consider adding those who discover bugs but haven’t been invited to the bounty program. Apple won’t publish a list of invitees, he writes, but those participating are free to disclose it. Mogull writes a couple of dozen researchers have received initial invitations. This is clearly intended to reduce the volume of reports and keep the quality high. Apple has long accepted bug reports without the potential of compensation, and that continues. Apple began to acknowledge researchers who conformed to its advance disclosure and testing rules several years ago and includes their name and company affiliation (if any) in security updates. Apple withholds credit and sometimes publishes those who work outside its guidelines, most prominently suspending Charlie Miller, who had previously discovered many flaws, from its developer program in 2011 after he had an app approved in the App Store with a proof-of-concept flaw embedded. Bugs pay big on gray and black markets, with criminal syndicates and government agencies sometimes vying for the same exploit before it’s found and patched. These so-called zero-day bugs, ones that aren’t patched before they’re used to exploit a weakness, allow malicious and legitimate parties alike ways to crack servers, operating systems, and sometimes individual computers and mobile devices. Effective cracks can go for tens of thousands of dollars, with reports putting the top rate at a million dollars. The Department of Justice dropped its attempt to force Apple to create a specialized version of iOS that would allow the FBI to attempt to crack a work-provided iPhone used by San Bernardino mass-killer Syed Rizwan after it obtained a bypass from a third party. Fees at other companies range from a starting point from $100 to $500, and are capped at from $20,000 at Google to $100,000 at Microsoft. Some companies don’t have an announced cap, and may offer far higher fees for major exploits.

As usual with an Apple acquisition, it's picking up a small company whose products will likely make their way into the fabric of other Apple services. In this case, Turi offers tools that are meant to let developers easily scale machine learning applications. Apple's been putting a heavy focus on machine learning recently While it's possible that Apple could make these available to third parties in the future, it may simply want the tools and the team behind Turi for itself. Apple has been talking up machine learning quite a bit lately — as has, you may have noticed, the entire tech industry — and this acquisition is likely part of the plan to make its apps and services much smarter. Every big tech company is racing in that direction, and Apple certainly wants to get out in the lead. Turi was acquired for around $200 million, according to GeekWire. Apple confirmed the purchase in its usual detail-free statement. Apple has purchased other machine learning and AI startups in recent months as well, including VocalIQ, Emotient, and Perceptio.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software iOS 10 Beta 4 Speed Test Comparison Against iOS 9.3.3 On Compatible iPhone Models By Ali Salman Posted Aug 2, 2016 16Shares Share Tweet Submit Yesterday marked the day for Apple’s release of the fourth iOS 10 beta to developers. While the update mainly constituted of the obvious bug fixes and performance enhancements, there were a bevy of minor tweaks and additions as well. However, apart from the visuals, the real question is if the update made iOS 10 any faster than the current firmware that we’re running – iOS 9.3.3? iOS 9.3.3 is Apple’s last public release before the company officially rolls out the iOS 10 update to the public. So let’s find out how does iOS 10 beta 4 speed test compares against iOS 9.3.3. iOS 10 Beta 4 Speed Test Comparison With iOS 9.3.3 The speed test comparison has been conducted by iAppleBytes that compares iOS 10 beta 4 head to head with iOS 9.3.3. A pair of each compatible iPhone model have been selected, running both the beta 4 and iOS 9.3.3 side by side. This will ensure performance improvement on an individual and collective scale. For more details, you can check out the videos embedded below for iOS 10 beta 4 speed test comparison against iOS 9.3.3. In terms of the iPhone 6s, there weren’t any significant improvements in the performance department. Frankly, the same case has been witnessed in the previous iOS 10 beta. The boot up speed has bumped ever so slightly. However, when it comes to launching apps, multitasking or browsing the web, the improvements aren’t ground shaking compared to iOS 9.3.3. iOS 10 beta 4 shows similar results on the iPhone 6 when compared against iOS 9.3.3. However, instead of improving the boot up speed, it has reduced slightly. General performance, albeit, remains the same throughout the entire system. While the speed may not be a total bummer for now, since iOS 9.3.3 is already pretty quick, the futuristic approach might suggest otherwise. iOS 9.3.3, OS X 10.11.6 Public Beta 2 Now Available - How To Download The iPhone 5s shows faster boot up speed on iOS 9.3.3 compared to iOS 10 beta 4. Moreover iOS 9.3.3 is also faster in loading apps including the Camera app. However, the difference in performance between the two firmware is minor. Advertisement What took us aback was the fact that iPhone 5, which has older internals compared to iPhone 5s, booted up fast on iOS 10 beta 4. Moreover, the app launch time is also better on the iOS 10 beta 4 compared to iOS 9.3.3. iOS 10 beta 4 brings a handful of minor tweaks such as faster folder opening speed. New emojis have been added as well, while many of the previous ones have been revamped. This is it for iOS 10 beta 4 speed test against iOS 9.3.3. Probably, the update was not centered towards improved performance in newer devices. Possibly, we’ll adhere to greater improvements in the next beta release. This is it for now, folks.

Roston - Aug 5, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Apple has acquired Seattle-based AI and machine learning startup Turi, according to sources, for around $200 million. Apple has not confirmed details about the acquisition, instead proffering its blanket statement that, on occasion, it buys small tech companies and generally doesn’t talk about why. Sources say the Turi team will probably remain in Seattle, but it isn’t known what exactly Apple has planned for the company. The information comes from GeekWire, which says it has received word from multiple sources, though neither Apple nor Turi would confirm any details. The acquisition highlights Apple’s latest push into the realm of artificial intelligence, and may have a place in helping shape Siri’s future. The move also shows a growing presence for the company in Seattle, where it has been operating since a 2014 acquisition of Seattle-based Union Bay Networks. Turi was initially known as GraphLab, later changing its name to Dato. That latter name ran afoul of data company Datto, however, leading to a legal squabble over claims that using the name Dato was trademark infringement. In what was probably a disappointing move for the company, it soon changed its name again, this time from Dato to Turi. The company is merely the latest in a long line of AI and machine learning startups nabbed by Apple; past examples include companies like Perceptio and VacallQ. As for Turi itself, the company has focused on developing apps that aid companies in better understanding data, doing so using AI and machine learning.

By Rowena Lindsay, Staff August 5, 2016 Save for later Saved Passers-by pose for photos with emoji masks fixed onto a wall at a shopping mall in Guangzhou in south China's Guangdong province. Emoji icons are popularly used for social media communication as they transcend cultural barriers and are fun to use. Chinatopix/AP View Caption About video ads View Caption of Earlier this week, Apple announced that more than 100 new emojis will be added as part of the iOS 10 update this fall, and the examples they gave show that the company isn’t just aiming for cuteness.  "This exciting update brings more gender options to existing characters, including new female athletes and professionals, [and] adds beautiful redesigns of popular emoji, a new rainbow flag, and more family options," Apple said in a post . Twenty-first century typers and texters have a complicated relationship with emojis: on the one hand, they have been blamed for stunting our ability to communicate , lacing even meaningful interactions with sarcasm. Yet the Oxford English Dictionary has tried to classify emojis as words , a proposal some linguists quickly shut down. Recommended: Think you know Steve Jobs? Take our quiz! Emojis, the evolved version of the emoticon, may have started out as playful. Over the years of their young life, however, they have also become a reflection of cultural change and way for the tech world to take a stance on social justice issues.  Test your knowledge Think you know Steve Jobs? Take our quiz! Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/22 "We have officially entered the era of wokemoji – a safe way for Silicon Valley's biggest players to demonstrate their progressiveness via adorable illustrations without explicitly saying or doing anything else," writes The Ringer's Alyssa Bereznak.  The last major emoji update included five new skin shades , in addition to the classic smiley face yellow, after Apple received criticism for the fact that all the people represented in the emoji alphabet were white, amid the Black Lives Matter movement's push to bring racism in the US to the foreground of national debate. And as discussions around gun violence continue to escalate in the wake of a series of recent mass shootings, Apple has changed the gun emoji to a water pistol. "A lot of the conversation in the media kind of feeds back into the committee," Jennifer 8. Lee, a nonvoting member of the Unicode Consortium emoji subcommittee, told The Ringer.  Back in March, Always released a commercial showing pre-teen girls' reaction s when they realized that the only emoji representing them were a bride, a Playboy bunny, a girl getting her haircut, and a surfer – nope, never mind, they realize: that's just a boy with long hair.  Apple has responded accordingly.Their next update will include women representing professions that are not stereotypically girly: a female detective, a construction worker, and several female athletes. "We are told we are the new generation of American women; no longer a minority, we are, in fact, the majority of breadwinners in American homes. And yet the best we can get is the flamenco," Amy Butcher, an assistant professor of English at Ohio Wesleyan University, wrote in an opinion column for The New York Times . Dr. Butcher described her search for an emoji that would appropriately celebrate her female friend receiving academic tenure – an accomplishment, she felt, that deserved to be represented by more than the sassy Spanish dancer emoji. "My friend had not danced her way to the provost's office, had not shimmied her tweed-blazered body into scholarly stardom," Butcher wrote.  Apple has received criticism over the emoji changes for myriad reasons: being too politically correct, not being politically correct soon enough, and for not making real progress in the real world, offscreen. Overall, however, much of the sentiment is positive.  "Apple and Google in particular have realized that people really care about emoji and they maybe need to be on the front foot with the messaging around them," Jeremy Burge, the founder of Emojipedia, told The Ringer . "Companies are are saying, 'Hey, we believe in this. We're Google and we believe in rights for women, and women equality. So we want this.'" Also coming to iOS this fall is a gay pride flag, which will join the more than 250 country flags already available, and 24 new iterations of the family emoji. The line-up will include single parent families and more same-sex parents. Next up Test your knowledge Think you know Steve Jobs? Take our quiz! Snapchat: the one app to rule them all?

At the Black Hat hacking conference, Apple announced a list of vulnerabilities that would command big bounties, including $25,000 for ways around Apple’s digital compartments and into its customers’ data, $50,000 for bugs that give hackers a way into iCloud data and $200,000 to turn over critical vulnerabilities in Apple’s firmware — the software that lies closest to the bare metal of the machine. Apple said that if hackers donate their rewards to charity, it would match their donation. “We want to reward the people, and frankly the creativity it takes to find bugs in these categories,” said Ivan Krstic, Apple’s head of security engineering and architecture. For six years, nearly every Silicon Valley company has been rewarding hackers who turn over bugs — a term for flaws that can make a product vulnerable to intrusion — in their systems, with cash. The hope is that the money will be an incentive to keep those flaws out of the hands of organized groups or spy agencies willing to pay big money to learn about them. But Apple had stayed away from the practice. Instead, it had credited anyone who turned over bugs by putting their names on its website — a far cry from the tens of thousands of dollars, and in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars, companies like Google and Facebook were willing to pay. The lack of an Apple bug bounty program made headlines this year when the FBI announced that it had paid hackers more than $1 million for a backdoor into an iPhone that had belonged to one of the San Bernardino shooters. The annual Black Hat conference, now in its 19th year, is a gathering place for all sorts of experts on computer security, including hackers, tech industry executives and government officials. Dan Kaminsky, a respected security researcher, said in a keynote speech that the industry is falling far short of expectations. The onslaught of regular, high-profile hacks, like the recent penetration of computers run by the Democratic National Committee, is beginning to make customers believe that little can be done to protect them. “We made promises in technology, and people are starting not to believe them,” Kaminsky told the audience. “Everybody looks busy, but the house still burns.” Kaminsky argued for a cybersecurity equivalent of the National Institutes of Health or a Manhattan Project to fund research. Notably, a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton coincided with this year’s conference. Security experts at the conference, echoing earlier reports, said that Russia was behind the Democratic National Committee hack. A number of organizations cited research suggesting that the committee was hacked by two Russian intelligence groups in what they believe is a campaign aimed at hurting Clinton’s presidential candidacy.

A pistol character included among glyphs for messages sent using coming iOS 10 software powering Apple mobile devices looked like a toy instead of a real firearm. New emojis teased by Apple in a blog post included women athletes, single parents, a rainbow flag, and a green water pistol. A pistol glyph included among emoticons for messages sent on Apple's coming iOS 10 software looked like a toy instead of a real firearm, while a Microsoft operating system update rolled out this week came with a pistol emoji shaped like a revolver ©Miguel Medina (AFP/File) California-based Apple promised that more than 100 new or redesigned emoji characters will be available to iPhone and iPad users when iOS 10 software is released later this year. Apple billed it as "an exciting update" with emojis that "reflect the diversity of people everywhere." Apple did not respond to an AFP request for comment regarding the apparent decision to make a gun emoji that appeared less menacing than the real thing. It remained unclear whether Apple made the change in response to recent high-profile episodes of gun violence, as some theorize. While the change was welcomed by groups devoted to preventing gun violence, it provoked online backlash by those unhappy with the move. "I have never seen an emoji change so poorly received," Emojipedia.org founder Jeremy Burge said in a blog post. "And this isn't even in the hands of most people yet." Meanwhile, a Windows operating system update rolled out this week by Microsoft came with a pistol emoji changed from a cartoonish ray gun to a revolver. Microsoft said in a blog post that it had a team design new emojis from scratch for the major Windows 10 anniversary update. "They needed to feel more human, more personal, more expressive," Microsoft said in the post devoted to the new array of 'glyphs' that have become a standard for mobile messaging. "The effect is clear, and pretty striking." A Microsoft spokesperson told AFP that the company's intent with every glyph is to "map to industry designs or our customers' expectations" regarding what emojis mean. Apple's toy gun emoji, if it isn't changed before the official release of iOS 10, would break from more realistic looking glyphs offered by major messaging platforms.

Apple acquires Turi, a machine learning company Posted Aug 5, 2016 by Greg Kumparak (@grg) 0 SHARES Next Story Christoph Waltz gets goofily patriotic in Samsung’s new Galaxy Note 7 spot Word just started going around the rumormill that Apple has acquired Turi, a company that describes itself as a “machine learning platform for developers and data scientists.” We reached out to Apple for confirmation, and sure enough — we got the standard reply they give when they’re confirming an acquisition but not saying much else: “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans.” Apple declined to comment on the financial terms of the deal, but Geekwire suggests that it was upwards of $200 million. This isn’t the first acquisition Apple has made in the AI/machine-learning space. It acquired Perceptio, a company that specialized in machine learning and image recognition, back in September 2015. In addition to its machine-learning products, Turi also runs the Data Science Summit — a two-day conference focusing on, as the name implies, data science. Turi was previously known as “Dato” (and before that, “GraphLab”), but changed its name in July of this year after a trademark dispute. Turi began reaching out to its customers to let them know their products would no longer be available at the end of July, the first indication that an acquisition had occurred. Turi’s own blog, meanwhile, no longer loads. We’re hearing that Turi’s team will remain in Seattle, rather than moving down to Apple’s Cupertino HQ. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Founded 1976 Overview Apple is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications.

Work on the R&D center, which will be located in the Vietnamese central province of Da Nang, was uncovered following a local government meeting on foreign direct investment. Da Nang, image via VnExpress Rumors earlier this year suggested Apple would invest up to $1 billion to build an Asia-focused research and development center in Vietnam, designed to "enhance its competitiveness over major global electronic manufacturers present in the country." Last October, Apple also established an Apple Vietnam LLC in Ho Chi Minh City, led by Gene Daniel Levoff, Apple's VP of corporate law who is also in charge of international operations. Companies like Microsoft, Intel, and Samsung have had investment projects in Vietnam for several years, but the R&D center will be Apple's first major project in the country. A final decision on whether the research center plans will move forward is expected in late August. 35 comments Top Rated Comments (View all) El Hikaru 16 weeks ago I am thinking that this investment is something to do with the pile of money sitting outside of US which has to be spent outside of US.

The company also buys companies with impressive frequency -- five so far this year. Actually, make that six, because Apple just picked up a significant Seattle-based artificial intelligence outfit, Turi. The news comes in a report from GeekWire, which heard about the deal through sources. Neither Apple nor Turi is confirming right now, although Apple is famously tight-lipped about these kinds of deals. The acquisition is rumored to be worth more than $100 million. DON'T MISS: Leaked video shows off the iPhone 7’s Lightning EarPods from every angle That's barely a dent in Apple's hundreds of billions of cash, but it's also not pocket change. Why would Apple spend so heavily on a company most people haven't heard of? Turi is a startup based in Seattle that focuses on machine learning and artificial intelligence. Those are hot topics right now, and AI looks like it will form the backbone of big software projects for the next decade. Apple has already begun building machine learning into macOS and iOS, Siri has finally come to the desktop, and machine learning and AI are core components behind autonomous cars. Suffice to say, it's a popular industry right now. Apple's acquisition could have two aims: to steal Turi's envious engineering talent, or to incorporate some of the startup's work into upcoming Apple projects. The reality is likely a mix of the two, but we're unlikely to find out exactly how and why this deal went down for a while.

So You Bought Apple Stock in 1980 The Atlantic 8/4/2016 Adrienne LaFrance © Kimberly White / REUTERS steve jobs wozniak Everybody knows that going back in time to make yourself stinking rich is not advisable. (See: Biff Tannen.) But let’s just say, for the sake of a thought experiment, that you have access to a time machine and little regard for the integrity of the space-time continuum. Popular Searches Eli Lilly and Co LLY ▼ 67.82 -8.17 -10.76% Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 110.76 -1.04 -0.93% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 779.60 -5.74 -0.73% Urban Outfitters Inc URBN ▼ 35.39 -3.63 -9.29% You’re totally going back to 1980 to buy Apple stock, right? That’s the year Apple Computer went public. (It dropped the “Computer” from its name to become Apple Inc. in 2007, right in time for the introduction of a transformative device: the smartphone.) If you had spent $1,000 on Apple stock in 1980, you would have been able to buy about 45 shares at $22 apiece. But! Apple shares have split four times since then—when a stock splits, it increases the number of shares an individual has—which puts the adjusted initial offering price at closer to 39 cents a share. Using that figure, an investment of $1,000 in Apple back in 1980 would yield close to $272,000 today. You don’t actually have to go back to the Apple IPO to see the potential for an investment windfall. Imagine you’d invested $1,000 in Apple in April 2003, when shares bottomed out at $6.56. Today, those shares would be worth more than $226,000. (Remember that’s taking into account a 2-for-1 split in 2005 and a 7-for-1 split in 2014.) But, hey, that’s the thing about investing. No one really knows what’s going to happen. Sometimes you get lucky, other times not so much. Back in 1982, The New York Times cautioned against investing in hyped-up tech companies like Apple. “Strong performance of a new issue in its fledgling months, of course, is no guarantee of longevity,” the newspaper wrote at the time. “Dozens of offerings from last year are currently outright disasters, and even the most talked about deals of the past two years—Genentech, Apple Computer, and Cetus—are all trading significantly below their offering prices.” After boasting the then-largest initial public stock offering in United States corporate history in 1981, the biotech firm Cetus fell apart in the early 1990s. Genentech, another biotech pioneer of the era, was acquired by Roche in 2009. For what it’s worth, the legendary investor Warren Buffett is still betting on Apple—despite his general reluctance to invest in technology companies. Buffett said back in May that his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, has 9.8 million shares of Apple. If that’s still the case, several market watchers have pointed out, the recent uptick in Apple’s value means Berkshire Hathaway likely made more than $60 million off the investment in a single day last week. The lesson here: The best way to get filthy rich off Apple is to have a time machine, exceptionally good luck, or a whole lotta money to begin with.

Ivan Krstić, head of security engineering and architecture at Apple, said the company was going to begin offering rewards now because of how hard Apple has made it to find critical vulnerabilities. "What we've heard consistently both from my team at Apple and also from researchers directly is that it's getting increasingly more difficult to find some of the most critical types of security vulnerabilities," Krstić said. "So, the Apple Security Bounty program is going to reward researchers who actually share critical vulnerabilities with Apple and we're going to make it a top priority to resolve these issues as quickly as possible." Apple's bug bounty program will offer five categories of rewards -- three for critical vulnerabilities found in iOS, one for unauthorized access to iCloud data on Apple servers and one for access from a sandboxed process to user data outside the sandbox. The rewards max out at $200,000 for a flaw in the iOS secure boot firmware components and up to $100,000 for extracting confidential material from the Secure Enclave processor, up to $50,000 for execution of arbitrary code with kernel privileges or unauthorized iCloud access, and up to $25,000 for accessing user data from within a sandboxed process. "We believe that these payment amounts are commensurate with the difficulty in hacking some of these systems," Krstić said, adding that donations could be doubled if researchers choose to donate it to charity. "And, I mention these are all maximum payments. The exact payment amount will be determined after we on the engineering team review the actual report that is submitted." Apple will provide public recognition for the researcher, unless otherwise asked, and said rewards will depend on factors like the impact to users. The bug bounty program will go live in September and will feature an invitation system. Apple will invite a few dozen researchers to participate in the program at first, but will open up the program so if an outside researcher submits a critical vulnerability deemed worthy of a reward, they will receive that reward and also be asked to join the program.  Next Steps Learn more about why some companies are initiating invitation-only bug bounty programs.

You can hide, but you can't delete When David Gewirtz started researching this article, it was meant as a simple organizing tip. But he wound up uncovering a really unfortunate privacy issue in how Apple manages apps. By David Gewirtz for DIY-IT | August 5, 2016 -- 12:51 GMT (05:51 PDT) | Topic: Apple Image: CNET I like Walt Mossberg. Most of us in tech have been reading him since, well, we could read. He spent more than three decades at The Wall Street Journal and is now at The Verge. I'm telling you this because Walt came out with a helpful article the other day that got me thinking. What's Hot on ZDNet Buying a PC on Black Friday? Here are five trends to watch out for Internet of Trash: The printable electronics you can just throw away Nintendo's NES Classic shortage hurts fans and itself IBM's computer vision research zeroes in on identifying skin cancer Walt went through his iPhone apps and deleted half of them. Like me, he has the maximum amount of storage on his iPhone (128GB), so it's not as important to him as to those suffering on 16GB phones. Even so, clearing out apps can remove clutter. Removing clutter is always a good thing. I don't have all that many apps installed on my phone, although it's still worthwhile cleaning them out. But I do have is an insanely large library of purchased (or "purchased" if you count free apps) apps in my App Store library. I bought my first iPhone eight years ago. It was within weeks of the App Store opening, and there were all of 25,000 apps on the store. I remember because I scanned through every... single ... one. If you were dedicated (and considering getting into the app business), you could do that back then. I won't bore you with the story of my limited adventures as an app developer. You can read all the sordid details (including financial results) here, if you want. In any case, the point is that I was exploring what apps were becoming, and so I downloaded a metric frak-ton of them. They are still in my purchased list to this day. That's clutter. You might wonder why that's an issue. After all, they're not all installed on your phone, right? Thou speaks truth to power, my young padawan, but there's more to it than that. Take, for example, my need to find a teleprompter app yesterday. I had used it a few years before and I suddenly needed it in a hurry. Yes, I have a life where I have sudden teleprompter emergencies. I liked this app because it had an iPad component as the prompter, as well as an iPhone remote control capability. Anyway, I didn't remember the exact name, and I found myself on my phone scrolling down screen after screen after screen, seemingly forever. It would be nice to delete all those old apps from my library so they didn't show up on that massive purchased list. As I looked into how to do this, I found another, um, less savory reason to delete apps from the purchased list. One guy (who I'll let remain anonymous) said he was getting married and didn't want all of "those" purchases visible to his new spouse out of fear of embarrassment. Then there's the more serious version of that argument. Let's say you're looking up medical information, and then find an app about some condition you don't want others to know about. Or you've downloaded an app from a political party, and you don't want others to easily find out your affiliation. The reasons you might not want anyone to know about certain apps you downloaded go on and on. Privacy is important. For some people, it can be a life and death issue. For all these reasons, being able to delete apps from your purchased history is a good idea. Fortunately, there's a way to do it. Sadly, because this is an Apple product, it's only a half-ass solution (more on that below). But, hey, it's better than nothing. Abandon hope all ye who enter here That's right, folks. We're about to go where no one wants to go: iTunes. To pull off this little trick, you're going to need to launch iTunes. Let's say you want to remove Pokémon Go from your purchased list. Go ahead and launch iTunes on your computer. I'm sorry. I didn't design it this way. You can take a two hour shower after. Once you're in iTunes, click over to the App Store. If you can't find the App Store in your desktop iTunes application, tap the drop down menu on the upper left of the iTunes window that typically says "Music, Movies, and TV Shows". Here's how to show apps in iTunes. Click Edit Menu, then check the Apps item, and click Done. Don't forget to click Done, or the Apps item won't show up on the menu. Now, click Apps, and you'll be in the App Store for your mobile devices. Aside: how odd is it that, on your Mac, when you add Apps to your iTunes, it's not the Mac App Store? Just saying. When you use iTunes, you pass into the city of woe, you pass into eternal pain, you go among the people lost in a black sulkiness which can find no joy. I am convinced Dante Alighieri is a member of the iTunes dev team. Now that you're in the city of woe, go up to your Account menu and click Purchased. You can also do it from the App Store by clicking the little Purchased link on the left side of the screen. You can also get to your purchased apps from the menu. This will drop you into the big list of all the apps you ever bought (or got for free). In a slight nod to usability, Apple does allow you to sort the list by Most Recent or Name, and do a search. So, yay to that. Our target for this example is the Pokémon Go app in the middle of the list below. See that little X pointed to by the arrow? When you hover your mouse pointer over an icon, that X appears. No, I don't play Pokémon Go. It's like the surface of the sun here in August in Florida. No way. Click it, and the app will be hidden. In the before/after shot above, you can see that the app has disappeared. Here's the before and after on the iPhone itself. The app vanished almost immediately after I removed it on iTunes. By the way, here's one of the times it might be nice to hide an icon. As you can see, the first icon on the list is for the Republican National Convention. No, I'm not a Republican. I'm also not a Democrat. However, I do mock them as part of how I make my living, so having the app is useful. See my tweet history, if you're really curious. Apple giveth, and Apple taketh away Actually, in this case, it's more like Apple taketh away, and then Apple giveth. In any case, it's really annoying. But this story wouldn't be complete without the last iTunes bite-you-in-the-butt detail of the day. By now, you probably think you're all good. You've finally and permanently removed those apps you no longer wish to be associated with -- or those that are simply cluttering up your iCloud-based life. Not so much. For once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will. Yes, I'm mixing the Divine Comedy with Yoda quotes. In any case, when you look at the dark side, careful you must be. For the dark side looks back. Here's how. Follow along with me. Still within iTunes on your Mac or PC, go to the Account menu and then select View My Account. You'll need to log in, even if you're already logged in. On your Account Information screen, you'll see a section called iTunes in the Cloud. In the middle of that section, you'll see a line for Hidden Purchases. Yep, the devil is in the details. Click Manage. Apps are part of iCloud, but the only way you can get to this list is in iTunes. Not via apple.com. And there you go. The purchases you were hoping to delete were not, in fact, deleted. They're just hidden. For certain users with certain applications they'd like to delete, this could pose a very serious problem. Yes, that makes the process of sorting and organizing your application collection easier. But if you wanted to permanently remove an app for any of the reasons I discussed above, Apple will not allow it. That's right. Like almost everything else you now do online, apps you install on your iDevices leave a permanent and non-expungeable breadcrumb trail. So, the next time Apple goes on national TV and spouts off about protecting your privacy, remember this. Private isn't private. It's just hidden for now.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple iPhone 7 may ship with advanced Bluetooth earbuds Yoni Heisler BGR NewsAugust 5, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share With Apple all but guaranteed to say goodbye to the traditional 3.5mm headphone jack when it releases the iPhone 7, there has naturally been a tremendous amount of speculation centering on what special audio plans, if any, Apple might have in store for us in the near future. Sure, we've seen reports and leaks pointing to Lightning based headphones, and yeah, there are even rumors that Apple may include a Lightning to 3.5mm adapter with each iPhone 7. That's all well and good, but if Apple is truly keen on eliminating a port as universal and reliable as the headphone jack, it surely must have something cool waiting in the wings to replace it, right? DON'T MISS: Leaked iPhone 7 photo shows some previously unknown little changes Citing a source familiar with Apple's plans, Forbes reports that Apple has spent the last few years developing a "custom Bluetooth radio chip for wireless earbuds." What's more, the report adds that Apple's take on wireless Bluetooth earbuds could launch alongside the company's iPhone 7 this coming September. According to the report, Apple's Bluetooth earbuds will have stellar battery life, a feature which will a) help them stand apart from a growing field of competing headphones and b) perhaps convince users that a world without the 3.5mm headphone jack is in fact something worth embracing. The low-power Bluetooth chip comes from technology developed by Passif Semiconductor, a startup Apple purchased in 2013. But the project has hit performance snags. Apple originally planned to launch the Bluetooth gadget in 2015, but Bluetooth performance issues stalled the release, the source told FORBES. “The way it works at Apple is if it doesn’t work 100%, it gets cut,” the source said. Whether Apple’s wireless earbuds arrive with a custom Bluetooth chip by Apple, or instead use a third-party supplier (like Broadcom) is still unknown. Apple's iPhone 7 may not be big on wild new features, but the company's decision to abandon the headphone jack will, oddly enough, make this year's upcoming iPhone unveiling uniquely interesting to keep an eye on.

Home About Contact Trends, Uncategorized POKEMON GO: THE GAME THAT LEFT THE WORLD CRAZY Date: August 5, 2016Author: Omer Bilal 0 Comments Pokémon Go is constantly setting records around the world. According to Apple, the app now holds the largest number of downloads during the first week of launch in the App Store. Apple did not disclose the exact number of downloads, but said the brand surpasses all other applications launched in the eight years of App Store. The multiplayer game is based around augmented reality, and on the location of users, though it is not yet available officially around the globe, but is already among the most popular applications in the mobile world. But what makes the Pokémon Go such a great success? According to data from SimilarWeb, Pokémon Go has already been installed in more than 5% of Android devices, which makes this application more popular today than Tinder (dating app). The number of daily active users is already larger than Twitter, and the average time spent on the application is 43 minutes. In this sense, Pokémon Go have even surpassed Instagram and WhatsApp for Android. According to Business Insider, the global release of the game is temporarily paused due to constant drops in the game servers because of the volume of hits. In other words, it seems that the developer of the app did not imagine that a franchise 20 years ago could achieve such success in this much little amount of time. In less than a week, Pokémon Go installed in a little over 5% of Android devices in the US alone / © SimilarWeb What makes Pokémon Go a great success? First off, Pokémon Go is a multiplayer game and, like any good game of this style, is based on interacting interact with other players. And that makes it a kind of community or even a social network. For those who have not downloaded the game, you must know that the goal of Pokémon Go is to capture the largest possible number of Pokémons. Therefore, the player must face battles with other players and other Pokémons. To play the game it is necessary to explore the world around us. Through the use of augmented reality, Pokémon Go simulates the universe of the character around the user. Thus, by using the phone’s GPS, the application will show when a Pokémon is nearby. Thus, in order to find them, you really have to walk to their region in search of one of the 250 characters available. A kind of community or even a social network The curious thing is to see that, with the exception of Facebook, Pokémon Go shook the application bases that were there for some time in the first positions, such as WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger. Coincidence or not, all these services are part of the same company Facebook. Pokémon Go is available for now only in Japan, Australia, New Zealand, USA, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Honk Kong to a limited extent. However, downloading the APK through third-party sites like APKMirror, you can run the game.   Like what you see? Subscribe for more!

In the first three quarters of this fiscal year, our iPhone sales in India were up 51 per cent year-on-year,’ said Apple CEO Tim Cook during the most recent financial call,” Evans writes. “Apple already claims to support over 640,000 iOS app developer jobs and other positions related to the iOS ecosystem.” “That this is followed a few weeks later by a Strategy Analytics report claiming Apple’s iPhone market share had collapsed is inevitable, but it’s a blip,” Evans writes. “Apple will launch new devices next month, but in the far longer term it is already putting in place an extensive range of strategic plans designed to build a sustainable business there.” Read more in the full article here.

Tech News | 05 Aug 2016 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (2) Apple Reports on its 2016 Diversity Efforts by Michael E. Cohen Apple has released the latest report detailing its continuing efforts to promote inclusion and diversity within the company. Available on a colorful, anecdote-heavy Web page that begins with a large headline reading, “The most innovative company must also be the most diverse,” the report presents interactive charts and statistics that describe the ethnic, racial, and gender distribution of its employees over the last three years. Once you scroll past the anecdotage from eight representative employees and inspirational headlines, you get to the facts and figures. These tend to break out into two kinds of data: global gender diversity and percentages of U.S. underrepresented minorities (or “URMs”), the latter defined as “groups whose representation in tech has been historically low — Black, Hispanic, Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Other Pacific Islander.” For a global company like Apple, such a breakdown makes a certain amount of sense: although every country in which Apple operates has roughly equal numbers of males and females, the ethnic and racial composition of different locales’ populations can vary widely. Choosing to present figures for URMs only in the United States sidesteps having to deal with which groups are underrepresented in places like Ireland or Singapore. What’s missing in the breakdown as presented, of course, is the gender diversity within individual URM groups, which would provide a more complete picture. One of the quickest ways to change the gender and minority representation within a company is through newly hired employees, and that is the category that Apple presents first. Apple reports that 37 percent of new hires are female compared to 32 percent of current employees. Similarly, 27 percent of new recruits belong to URM groups compared to 22 percent of current employees. What’s missing here is the percentage of Apple’s total employee count that new hires constitute: if that percentage is small, even large changes in the minority and gender makeup of new hires would have a minimal effect on the company’s overall diversity. Confusingly, having said in the first set of charts that 27 percent of new hires this year are URMs, the next section of the page proclaims that 54 percent of the new hires in the United States are minorities. Apple arrives at that number by adding in employees who are Asian or multiracial; they may be minorities, but they’re not underrepresented in the tech world. The minority group breakdowns show an interesting mix. For example, 24 percent of new hires are Asian compared with 19 percent of current employees; both percentages vastly exceed the percentage of Asians among the general United States population, which is less than 6 percent. On the other hand, blacks make up 13 percent of new hires (compared to 9 percent of current employees), a figure that closely matches the percentage of blacks in the United States. As for pay differences between groups, Apple simply says that it has “achieved pay equity in the United States for similar roles and performance,” and that it is examining salaries, bonuses, and stock grants among non-US employees and aims to address any pay inequities it finds. The final set of interactive charts shows gender and minority representation over the last three years, broken down into job categories. Here you can see that Apple is slightly less masculine globally than it was three years ago, with men constituting 68 percent of the employee base today versus 70 percent in 2014. That small shift, however, is absent in the leadership ranks, which remained at 72 percent male from 2014 through 2016. In the United States, Apple is also slightly whiter in 2016 than it was in 2014: 56 percent white this year versus 55 percent in 2014 (and the company was only 54 percent white in 2015). On the other hand, blacks make up slightly more (8 percent) of the workers in technology positions than in 2014 (6 percent). All of the figures presented, however, are not quite comparable, in that 8 percent of employees in 2014 declined to state their ethnicity; that figure is zero for 2016. Diversity, of course, isn’t just a matter of numbers but of culture. Apple lists eleven different internal groups that provide support for minorities, such as the Apple Muslim Association and Women@Apple. Moreover, the diversity page links to the Creating Opportunities page, which describes the various programs and initiatives that foster technology training among underrepresented groups for which Apple provides support, such as President Obama’s ConnectED initiative and the highly regarded App Camp for Girls. On the whole, the latest diversity report is a typical Apple product: attractive, inspiring, and with most of the operational details hidden from view. Still, market-driven as the page appears, it does seem to reflect the Apple leadership’s mindset: that diversity is important to the company and is a quality worthy of continued support.   Smile makes tools so you can have a productive day.

If Apple is interested in its products and services reflecting a broad diversity of life experience, culture, and the like, ensuring that the company's workforce represents both the young and the old would seem to be a relevant goal alongside ethnic, racial, and gender diversity.  Search   Unless otherwise noted, this article is copyright © 2016 Michael E.

Screen Rant You Are Reading: iPhone 7 Leak Reveals Design With No Headphone Jack Share On Facebook Comments (41) Next Follow Us Follow @screenrant SR EXCLUSIVES MOVIE NEWS TV NEWS REVIEWS VIDEOS LISTS + TRAILERS PODCASTS TOP MOVIES Comics Gaming Up Next iPhone 7 Leak Reveals Design With No Headphone Jack By Chris Agar 08.05.2016 41 Comments 28 Shares 41 It’s no secret that smartphones have become one of the most important and valuable items in people’s daily lives. The mobile devices can perform a plethora of tasks, including staying in touch with contacts, downloading apps for any possible situation, and organizing entire personal media libraries. One of the leading manufacturers in this realm of technology of course is Apple, whose iPhone has sold phenomenally well since it was first introduced in 2007. With Samsung emerging as a rival in smartphones, Apple is always looking for new features to incorporate in their latest iPhone designs, trying to get an edge on the competition. The iPhone 7 is expected to hit stores in September 2016, which means soon people will be making pre-orders and getting ready for the launch event. Now, thanks to a new video (watch it above), consumers can get an early look at a mockup of what the new model is expected to look like when it is made available. Posted by YouTube channel Unbox Therapy, the video is mainly compares and contrasts the iPhone 7 Plus with the iPhone 6s Plus. For the most part, the two are similar; The 7 does include a second camera and is a bit thinner. There is one noticeable difference though, and it’s sure to be a controversial one. Apple has removed the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 (as was previously rumored), putting a second speaker in its place. There are ways around this (the video mentions a dongle or possibly wireless headphones), but it will no doubt be a frustrating development for those looking to upgrade this fall. With people on the go constantly, many watch videos and listen to music on their phones, obviously using headphones during their travels. Now that the jack is completely gone, it will arguably be difficult to hear audio while in public places. When using an iPhone in the privacy of one’s home, the second speaker should be a nice addition, but it’s a trade off many would probably rather not make. Though there are reasons to explain why Apple would want to do this (producing a thinner iPhone, improving audio quality, Apple selling their own special headphones), none of them make a particularly strong case for moving forward with this. It’s a curious development, and it will be interesting to see if this has any kind of impact on sales figures. Samsung has already mocked the iPhone 7 while showing off their new Galaxy Note 7, and they’ll certainly make a point to reference it in television advertisements. The audio jack is something many people use frequently, after all. It’s worth pointing out that Apple has a long history of moving on from technologies they perceive to be obsolete. One only has to recall the removal of the floppy disc drive on the iMac as an example. Still, this does seem like an odd decision and unless they have a plan in place, it may not pay off in the long run. At the same time, Apple has found plenty of success time and time again, so it’s worth giving them a shot to prove themselves with the iPhone 7. The iPhone 7 Plus is expected to hit stores in September 2016.

With no official release in sight and no worthy alternatives on the market, it seemed the only way to get your hands on one was to pay insane eBay prices. But that’s all changed this morning. Clockwork Synergy, a watch accessory maker based in Maryland, has just launched a Pride version of its Classic NATO Apple Watch band featuring a rainbow design that looks nearly identical to the one Apple gifted its employees. What’s more, both bands are made of nylon. Clockwork Synergy’s Pride band is available in 38mm/42mm with 2 buckle and 7 adapter color options so you can customize it to fit your style. Its 11 adjustability holes should fit “most wrist sizes.” Better yet, the band is covered under a 1-year warranty in case you happen to run into any issues. The Clockwork Synergy Pride 2-Piece Classic NATO Bands for Apple Watch are priced at $24.95, but if you use coupon code 9to5mac20 at checkout you’ll knock $4.99 off your order. That brings your total down to just $19.96 with free shipping.

Follow TechnoBuffalo The iPhone 7 is all but certain to arrive without a traditional headphone jack. We’ve already seen leaked photos of a new set of some redesigned Apple EarPods with a Lightning connector, but it turns out the company could also have a Bluetooth alternative in the works. Forbes reports that Cupertino has been developing a set of wireless Bluetooth earbuds for the past few years with some special in-house technology. Specifically, Apple is working on a low-power Bluetooth chip which could improve battery life for the earbuds. That’s a major pain point for Bluetooth headphones in general, which often need to be recharged several times per week. Apple acquired its new Bluetooth chip technology in 2013 through a purchase of a startup called Passif Semiconductor. Cupertino apparently planned to launch the new earbuds last year but pushed the release back after it failed to meet company standards. “The way it works at Apple is if it doesn’t work 100%, it gets cut,” an inside source told Forbes. The Apple-designed EarPods would be totally wireless and come with a carrying case that doubles as an external battery pack, according to previous reports. Multiple companies already offer similar products, including Samsung’s Gear IconX (pictured above). But Apple’s special energy efficient Bluetooth chip could set it apart from the competition. It’s still unclear when these rumored wireless earbuds will be ready to launch. Ideally, Apple would unveil the new Bluetooth technology this September when the iPhone 7 makes its debut, but it sounds like it could be a while before the new earbuds actually arrive.

Riind RIIND is a young design studio founded by two MIT engineering graduates, and its first product is a pen. You might be thinking, okay, two MIT engineers design a pen. It must send digital copies of your writing to your phone via Bluetooth, or enable AI-powered handwriting. But nope. The pen—dubbed, breathlessly, The Pen—is really just a pen. Not a stylus, not an e-pencil, but an ink-to-paper pen that’s made out of aluminum and looks like a bullet. According to RIIND’s Kickstarter page, its founders got the idea for The Pen ($99) in October 2014. Twenty months worth of engineering later, and The Pen is here. It comes with a suite of features, chief of which is its clip. The clasp rotates to the left or right, making it possible for users to affix it snugly to the inside of a button down shirt, rather than just vertically onto a pocket. Plus, the knurled section at the top of the pen swivels around 180 degrees either way, causing the pen’s tip to protract and retract—a feature the founders say two years to invent. Once the ink cartridge is empty, users can refill it with 35 different kinds of ink—kind of like choosing your preferred font, but, you know, the medieval way. Go Back to Top.

Over at Flowing Data, Nathan Yau has organized this trend into the handy set of graphics you see above. The maps here visualize the steady rise in the prevalence of adult obesity by turning from green, used to indicate obesity rates of less than 20 percent, to purple, for rates higher than 20 percent. Most articles on the so-called “obesity epidemic” use broad-strokes statistics to describe the issue, as in: “about 38 percent of American adults were obese in 2013 and 2014, up from 35 percent in 2011 and 2012,” from The New York Times. Yau’s infographic breaks down the numbers by state. Strikingly, the states appear as a grid of equal-sized squares—a mapping strategy that Yau borrowed from FiveThirtyEight. “When you size by geographic area, the bigger states inevitably get more visual attention,” he says. Now, with the map’s 8-bit looks, all states have equal representation. It won’t change the appearance of overarching trends, but it’s a helpful distortion if you want to isolate patterns happening in individual states. Go Back to Top.

Black Friday 2016 TV Deals Frequent Flier Miles Are Kaput—The Game's About Credit Cards Now 6 Just last month, the Internet decided we’d hit “peak LaCroix.” The alleged watershed moment had to do with a cake decorated like a 12-pack of lime-flavored LaCroix, spotted at the newly opened Whole Foods in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. The cake even came with little LaCroix sidekick cupcakes. It seemed LaCroix memes could go no further. Turns out they can, and this LaCroix flavor-generator is proof. It’s from Nelson Cash, the same creative studio that recently released the Stranger Things type-generator. The online fanfare over Make It Stranger gave the Chicago designers and lovers of LaCroix the idea to build another interactive web toy. The result is MyLaCroix.com, a meme-generator that looks like somebody built it with GeoCities. “I think a lot of people—and millennials my age—like LaCroix because it has that ‘90s jazz vibe,” says Mike McMillan, the designer at Nelson Cage who led the LaCroix project. “We thought, okay, we should design it like Windows 95. It’s an homage to the past.” To create your bespoke LaCroix flavor, you first need to name it. You can play it safe with something mildly exotic yet cheeky, like “cilantro,” or “imitation crab,” or you can show everyone how topical you are, with “Uber”-flavored LaCroix. Or you can go really meta. The most convincing cans feature a considered color scheme, but finding one that works is no small task. LaCroix’s cans bear splashy combinations of six hues, and the flavor-generator web toy gives you two gradients for selecting each one, which adds up to a lot of potential combinations. Getting them right is important—like McMillan says, the frothy scrawls on the outside of the can are integral to the LaCroix experience. That’s where the fizz hits you first. Go Back to Top.

And before Arkanoid, there was Atari’s Breakout. In all of these games, a ball ricochets around the screen, destroying bricks. Your job is simple: keep that ball bouncing upward, eliminating bricks. Architectural prodigy Bjarke Ingels’ firm, BIG, just turned its website into a BIG-branded version of Arkanoid. The makeover wasn’t all that drastic; the firm’s home page design already featured an array of neon-hued icons, each linked to a project. Now, rather than a chronological arrangement, the icons cluster by color. A mouse-controlled “paddle” at the bottom bats the ball around. Why the gimmick? Unclear. You can’t navigate the page if you aren’t busting bricks, and there’s no obvious incentive to play beyond nostalgia or beating your high score. The Konami Code also does nothing. That said, Ingels is a fan of virtual worlds, including Minecraft and its analog predecessor, Lego. (Both appear to have influenced his design of London’s latest Serpentine Pavilion.) “These fictional worlds empower people with the tools to transform their own environments,” Ingels has said. “This is what architecture ought to be.” Perhaps that’s all there is to it: diversion for diversion’s sake. The Arkanoidification of BIG’s website won’t help you navigate the firm’s roster of projects, and it probably won’t inspire you the way a bucket of Lego bricks would—but Ingels, and BIG, are clearly big proponents of play.

Giger Made Alien‘s Monster Beautiful and Terrifying When Alien hit theaters in 1979, the monster on screen was unlike anything moviegoers had ever seen. The film’s deadly, parasitic Xenomorph was terrifying and grotesque, yet graceful and stunning. “I always wanted my alien to be a very beautiful thing, something aesthetic,” production designer H.R. Giger has said of his creation. “A monster isn’t just something disgusting; it can have a kind of beauty.” Giger, a Swiss artist known as much for his darkly surreal paintings as for his cinematic work, is the subject of a new video essay that explores how his background in design informed not just the appearance of Alien‘s titular interstellar stowaway, but the look, feel, and pacing of the film, itself. The video, made by Kristian Williams, is a reminder of just how brilliant Giger’s Academy Award-winning design work was, and still is. As Williams explains it, director Ridley Scott came across Giger’s Necronomicon, Giger’s first book dedicated to his macabre, biomechanical aesthetic, while trying to conceptualize what the film’s monster should look like. An illustration titled Necronom #4, depicting a sinuous creature with an elongated head, so affected Scott that he asked Giger to alter his original design only slightly. More H.R. Giger Never-Before-Seen Sketches That Inspired the Birth of Alien Probing the Alien Artist’s Mind H.R. Giger’s Cyborg Horror Merges Sex, Tech, Legend Giger wound up working on the film’s entire production design. “Down the line I realized it made a lot of sense for Giger to design everything that was to do with the alien,” Ridley recalls in the video. “That includes the landscape and the spacecraft.” Giger’s morbid biology-meets-industrial touch can be see everywhere in LV426, but his alien was the showstopper. Williams says that Giger himself fabricated the costumes, which made good use of his industrial design background. Every piece of the costume was considered, from the mouth-breathing apparatus on its back to the fact that its acidic blood required an acid-resistant exoskeleton (fun fact: the costume incorporated real bones, human and animal). Giger built the xenomorph’s lips from condoms, and nestled a real human skull into the tip of the alien’s cylindrical head. As the video points out, Giger’s aesthetic has become so acknowledged it has its own adjective “Gigeresque.” In a time where monsters are the result of clicking around on a computer, it’s no wonder we’re still in awe of Giger’s wildly creative alien. Like all movie monsters, it’s a product of an artist’s imagination, but it’s a whole lot scarier when you can actually reach out and touch it. Go Back to Top.

We’ve dissected all of season 1, right down to the opening titles and props. Now we’re stuck waiting for an as-yet unannounced date in 2017, when season 2 will drop. In the meantime, here’s a neat toy to tide over any nostalgia cravings: Ramsophone, an online music-maker that lets you click and tap to create your own synthwave score. Designer and developer Robert Vinluan created it, and although he says that “resemblances to the Stranger Things theme may or may not be intentional,” we know what we hear. This is a DIY Stranger Things-style synth machine, and it’s seriously fun. The Ramsophone sounds like the 1980s, but its looks are firmly rooted in the ’50s and ’60s, when Dieter Rams (after whom the Ramsophome is named) was designing for Braun. The interface features little more than a few white knobs and push buttons to compose your beats, and a tiny red button to turn the music on and off. To mix up the music-maker’s form factor, just refresh the page. You can do this endlessly—Vinluan doesn’t know the exact number of available layouts, but says somewhere between 50,000,000 and 100,000,000 combinations sounds reasonable. His code is available on Github, if you want the nitty-gritty on how that works. Even with those millions of configurations, the Ramsophone, like a good Braun gadget, keeps it simple. You really can’t mess this up—your score will be perfectly eerie every time. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. dieter rams Music stranger things Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

Though the famed German art school existed in physical form for just 14 years, its legacy lives on in many ways. The latest incarnation: Harvard’s massive online archive. The school recently made more than 32,000 digitized artifacts—paintings, drawings, photos, sculptures, and more—available for browsing, and it’s a beautiful time-suck for design lovers. Harvard’s first Bauhaus show was held in 1930. Organized by undergrads, it was also the first Bauhaus exhibition in the United States. We are revisiting Bauhaus materials, such as this 1930 catalogue, as we prepare to host another Bauhaus exhibition in 2019—the 100th anniversary of the school’s founding. See our profile for the link to the Bauhaus Special Collection. #bauhaus #archives #harvard #bauhaus100 — Image credit: Catalogue of the 1930 Bauhaus exhibition, Harvard Society for Contemporary Art, Harvard University Archives, HUD 3298, Box 1. A photo posted by Harvard Art Museums (@harvardartmuseums) on Aug 15, 2016 at 12:17pm PDT Architect Walter Gropius founded the Bauhaus in 1919 with the goal of creating a utopian school where the disciplines of art and design could overlap and dissolve into a unified artistic language. The school ran workshops on everything from architecture to weaving to graphic design, but its most famous exports, by far, were the people who studied there. Bauhaus alumni were a prolific and influential bunch. Even after the school shuttered in 1933 due to pressure from the Nazi regime, the artists and designers who studied there continued to spread the school’s teachings. Mies van der Rohe, the architect and final director of the Bauhaus, immigrated to Chicago to become director of the School of Architecture at the Armour Institute, now the Illinois Institute of Technology. Designer Josef Albers departed for Black Mountain College in North Carolina before heading to teach at Yale. Gropius landed at Harvard, where he chaired the Graduate School of Design from 1937 to 1952. And thus began Harvard’s deep ties to the Bauhaus. Over the years, Bauhaus masters and lesser-known students have donated their work to Harvard’s Busch-Reisinger Museum, giving rise to one of the largest collections of Bauhaus ephemera in the world. Harvard has done an excellent job in making what could be a paralyzing amount of information accessible. The archive is organized by medium and showcases the student work of famed designers. The items are searchable by keyword, title, artist, or object number. Though the archive helps to contextualize the massive amount of work produced by Bauhaus designers, it frankly doesn’t have much work to do. The Bauhaus’ legacy is already-well established through its long lineage of influential designers— now it’s just easier to find their work. Anni Albers’s “Design for a Rug” (1927) is one of the more than 32,000 objects whose records are now accessible in our Bauhaus Special Collection. Albers taught in the influential school of modernist art and design active during the years of Germany’s Weimar Republic (1919–33). Bauhaus artists were known for realigning hierarchies of high and low by embracing new technologies, materials, and media.

Designed by type foundry Monotype, it’s the first update to the typeface since the late 1970s, when it was adjusted for new typesetting technology. It’s meant to do two things: (1) Update Johnston so that it’s as legible as possible on screens and (2) Bring back some of the “soul” and “quirk” from the original 1916 design. Off-kilter details like the diagonal bowl on the lowercase ‘g’ and the unusually wide ‘U’ were lost over the years, but have been reintroduced in Johnston100. Monotype TfL, the governing body for all things Underground-related, has used Johnston since 1916. Johnston is a friendly, sensible, sans serif typeface that was totally ahead of its time. A calligrapher created it, but its looks are unembellished. That’s largely how it endured all these years; its uncluttered proportions were ideal for a typeface that lives in a frantic, schedule-driven environment like the London Underground. Monotype Endure it did, but as prescient as Edward Johnston was about type design, it’s not like he predicted that one day travelers would check train schedules primarily through an app. The other new elements of Johnston100 exist purely to make the typeface internet-appropriate—like the @ and # characters. The original Johnston never had, or needed, those icons. Slapdash ones were added in recent years, but Monotype has carefully redrawn them to fit in with the rest of the font family. This is one way TfL is modernizing its signage; the other is through the five new weights of Johnston100. In its original weight, Johnston would be far too thick to read on a smartphone screen. The new “thin” and “hairline” weights, however, are much more pixel-friendly. That’s a crucial update for users: 100 years after Johnston was born, the London Underground doesn’t exist solely underground. It’s on desktop browsers, touch screens, and in travelers’s pockets.

Despite appearances, our icy neighbor to the north is 1.5 times smaller than India, more than four times smaller than the United States, and 14.5 times smaller than Africa. In fact, Greenland is about the size of Saudi Arabia, though you’d never guess it by looking at the world’s most ubiquitous map. The Mercator projection is an inherently flawed design. It exaggerates the size of countries closest to the poles while depicting size most faithfully at the equator. Though it was once a handy navigational tool for sailors, the map has instilled in the rest of us a gross misunderstanding of geography and relative country size. For the perspective-challenged among us, there’s hope yet. A new web app called The True Size Of is an interactive map that its creators, James Talmage and Damon Maneice, hope will give people a better understanding of a country’s true size. Dragging one country across the map causes it to change size and shape in real time, allowing you to place it beside countries at other latitudes and compare their relative sizes. For example, as you overlay the United States on top of Greenland, the former stretches and bloats. Meanwhile, dragging Greenland down toward Saudi Arabia, causes the northerly country to shrink dramatically in size. For even more accuracy, you can use a compass in the bottom lefthand corner of the screen to rotate each country for alignment. It’s a simple tool, but it’s wildly effective at granting a new perspective on the size and shape of the world’s various land masses. As we all know from years of staring at maps that tell us otherwise, that kind of perspective is pretty hard to come by. You can play with the map here. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

For his master’s thesis, Choi, who recently graduated from Design Academy Eindhoven, created benches and stools that lay flat but pop open. He calls it De-dimension, and it’s flatpack with a perceptual twist: a perspective drawing come to life, its planar form conveying the height, width, and depth of the “assembled” stool. In the video, Choi pulls one from the wall and, with a smooth, quick gesture, opens it like the page of a pop-up book. Click over to Choi’s website and you’ll find that his furniture is the physical embodiment of a thesis exploring heady ideas about perspective and how we perceive the similarities and differences between 2-D and 3-D objects. “If our perception of an object is not different on a plane image and an actual subject,” he asks, “isn’t it possible to substitute the two with each other?” In the case of De-Dimension, the stools and benches are never truly 2-D; but the fact our brains can appreciate their dimensionality, even when flat, is a clever visual trick that would earn Choi an awful lot of money if he decides to sell his designs.

Try This Interactive Chart Daniel Smilkov and Shan Carter If you’ve recently found yourself wondering what the f*@k neural networks are and how they work, you’re hardly alone. The rise of machine learning has made artificial neural networks—the computer programs that facilitate that learning—a common topic of conversation. Google, Facebook, and most other big players in the tech industry are investing heavily in them. News articles about artificial intelligence (including ours) are littered with references to neural networks. Still, getting inundated with an idea doesn’t mean you understand it. Daniel Smilkov, a member of Google’s Big Picture Research Group, and Shan Carter, who creates interactive graphics for The New York Times, decided to make the concept more easily digestible. They collaborated to create this interactive data-visualization that lets users toy around with and design their own neural network. It’s not quite kindergarten for neural networks; you need to have a grasp on notions like inputs, regularization, and ratio train data going into what Smilkov and Carter call their “playground.” If you do, the data-viz functions like a plug-and-play interface for trying out different programs.

Venngage, the company that lets you make infographics with the click of (a few) buttons, recently launched a new product called Beam. Beam does for charts what Venngage does for infographics as a whole. Which is to say, it makes the process of transforming data into useful visuals very, very easy. Beam is built on a template. Swap out the default text and data for your own, and you’ve got the bones of a chart. The web tool comes with four chart options—pie, bar, column, and line—and a handful of formatting choices. If we’re being real, the variety isn’t Earth-shatteringly cool. It would be a lot more fun if you could choose your own color scheme as opposed to Beam’s pre-packaged swatches, for example. But what the tool lacks in choice it makes up for in efficiency. Beam holds your hand through the entire process. Embedding the chart is a matter of copy and pasting a link, and Beam makes it super easy to share on social media. It’s clear that Beam is trying to be the go-to chart design tool for the Instagram set (the company said so itself!). And fair enough—the tool, for better or worse, does democratize the process of making clean, accurate graphics. I’m not sure how many teens are going to be uploading pie charts to their profiles, but who knows.

Today you’re 40. To celebrate, we’ve compiled a list of the company’s 15 most pivotal products, starting with the design of the iPhone and ending with the San Bernardino iPhone. But to see all of Apple’s products from the past four decades, at once, look to “The Insanely Great History of Apple 3.0” ($90)—a comprehensive visual overview of Apple’s oeuvre, from the folks at Pop Charts Lab. The Brooklyn infographic-makers created the original chart in 2011, when the iPad 2 was the latest innovation. Now, they’ve updated it to include everything up to the iPhone SE and 9.7” iPad Pro, both of which were added to Apple’s lineup after the recent Apple event in Cupertino. The updated poster, like the original, is organized by year and device category (software, all-in-ones, handhelds, and so on). You can watch as Apple shrinks from the bulky Lisa to the Apple Watch, but you can also see, quite clearly, the impact of Steve Jobs’ return to the company, in 1997. The y-axis of “The Insanely Great History of Apple 3.0” shows the year, and the top half of the chart is a cluster of tiny icons. Toward the poster’s bottom half (which chart’s the period after Apple bought NeXT, and Jobs returned), the data visualization becomes sparser. Apple rolled out the bulbous, colorful iMac, the iBook, and, a few years later, the iPod. The trend toward fewer offerings reflects a shift in Apple’s strategy: Rather than asking consumers to choose between a slew of options, Apple would choose for them. The post-Jobs years have followed that trend, with the exception of the handheld category, where options remains an important selling point. You can see it spelled out in the data, on the bottom-righthand corner of the poster: it’s a swarm of gadgets, in a range of sizes. Go Back to Top.

Now, a national referendum has put the idea to rest: New Zealand will keep the Blue Ensign it’s used since 1902. In keeping the venerable banner, New Zealanders rejected the Silver Fern, designed by architect Kyle Lockwood of Auckland. His design kept the current flag’s four red stars but replaced the Union Jack a silver fern frond as its primary motif. The silver fern is a familiar symbol throughout the country, one used by the All Blacks rugby team and a few official tourism campaigns. #NZ flag results https://t.co/vljBZKoQjY pic.twitter.com/nzU9fzPUuW — nzherald (@nzherald) March 24, 2016 Of the votes cast, 56.6 percent were in favor of keeping the current flag, and 43.2 percent favored the fern. Prime Minister John Key, a vocal advocate for this campaign, which cost New Zealand a reported $26 million, told reporters he would not revisit the topic. After the government announced in October, 2014, that it would consider exploring a new flag, thousands of aspiring designers submitted ideas. Many can only be described as batshit insane, and we’ll let John Oliver tell you about them. But there were plenty of good designs, according to the rules of vexillology, and the Silver Fern was among them. It’s simple enough to remember, but its meaning is unique to New Zealand: local lore traces the fern’s origins to the Māori, the country’s indigenous Polynesian population. Adopting it in place of the Union Jack icon would have symbolically divorced New Zealand’s flag from that of Australia and the United Kingdom.

If you stop typing for more than five seconds, all progress will be lost.” Those are the directions for The Most Dangerous Writing App, a brutal new web tool designed to help you get over your writer’s block. The app is the work of Manuel Ebert, who describes himself on Twitter as a “Ex-neuroscientist, data wrangler, designer, and engineer.” He’s also a founding partner of Summer.ai, a small data consultancy agency. Ebert made The Most Dangerous Writing App on his own time, and released it for free. There are lots of tricks for overcoming writer’s block. One of the most commonly prescribed bits of advice is perhaps the most obvious: just write. That could mean banging out a rough draft in one fell swoop, or it could mean pretending like you’re writing in a diary, letting out a stream of consciousness. Or, as editors love to say, “just pretend you’re at a bar, having a beer, talking to your friend.” The Most Dangerous Writing App The goal of all these strategies is to force you to get over your ego. Stop waiting for a romantic surge of inspiration and just write. The Most Dangerous Writing App doesn’t care what technique you use, provided you keep typing. If you stop, even for a second, the edges of the screen become tinged with red. The longer you go without typing, the redder the edges become, until, after five seconds of inactivity, your progress is unceremoniously erased. Forever. While writing this I somewhat predictably experienced a small bout of writer’s block, so I gave the app a try. The interface is a clean, no-nonsense text editor. You’ll find nothing in the way of formatting tools; if it wasn’t already abundantly clear, the app is purpose-built for writing and writing only. It allows for plenty of backspacing and typo-correcting, both of which can be useful for procrastinating in micro-doses, but I mostly felt compelled to write. Somewhere towards the tail end of my five minutes (you can choose to write nonstop for five, 10, 20, 30, 45, or 60 minutes, if you’re a masochist) the pressure starts to set in, and I’m really rambling. The UX is cleverly conceived, if a bit stressful at first (my heart rate went up while I was using it). The Most Dangerous Writing App But then, that imposed sense of urgency is the whole point. If you’re someone who thrives under pressure, or feels most productive when you’re working at the eleventh hour, the Most Dangerous Writing App could be a good way for you to apply that pressure, artificially. And for the record, it did get me over my writer’s block. You’re reading this article now, aren’t you? Go Back to Top.

Letters are easy enough—we learn the alphabet as children and then cease to consciously notice them as time goes on—but typography, the art of crafting the written language, is a tricky business. Typographers create fonts in type design software, where letters are mapped with a series of coordinates. By tweaking each vector a millimeter here, and a hair there, designers can create the kind of expressiveness that differentiates Baskerville from, say, Courier. Both are serif typefaces, but they feel extraordinarily different. “The Taxonomy of Typography,” a new print from the Pop Chart Lab poster-makers, explains the typographer’s palette. Painters have colors; typographers have neo-grotesque type, ascenders, and letter-spacing. Like a periodic table of type elements, the chart explains typography by breaking down varieties of type, letter anatomy, measurements and spacing, and typesetting. Whether you’re a type neophyte or a seasoned designer, it’s a handy chart. You can snag one through Pop Chart Lab’s pre-order sale, for $29, here. Pop Chart Lab Go Back to Top.

There was this book. Then these posters. Now, there’s yet another set of visualizations that looks at the unsung heroes of literature. Inspired by Nicholas Rougeux’s “Between The Words” posters, scientist Adam Calhoun decided to put his own spin on punctuation as visualization. Calhoun was curious to see how the punctuation in his favorite books stacked up, so he wrote a script that strips the words from the pages. Next to Rougeux’s swirling posters, Calhoun’s visualizations are less abstract, more straightforward. In one, he simply leaves them as-is—a block of periods, commas and dashes in all their geometric, grammatical beauty. In another, he assigns each glyph a color, creating glowing heatmaps that show which marks are most prevalent. Calhoun takes it one step further by breaking down the data into digestible bar charts that show words per punctuation mark, words per sentence, and overall use of punctuation. Unsurprisingly, Earnest Hemmingway’s “A Farewell to Arms”  is lacking in punctuational flourishes, relying only on periods and quotations to fill out the author’s stark writing style. William Faulkner, on the other hand, wasn’t afraid of a wordy sentence and a semicolon or ten. It’s hard to say what’s behind the recent spike in interest in punctuation. For Calhoun, the intrigue seems to lie in the unspoken impact punctuation has on an author’s writing. For others, it might be that the glyphs, themselves, are admiration-worthy pieces of design. Either way, it’s clearly a good time to be a word nerd. Adam Calhoun Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Books charts Data Visualization punctuation Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

Kyu is part of Tokyo’s Hakuhodo DY Holdings, and includes other agencies like Sid Lee, Red Peak Group, and Digital Kitchen. The dollar value of the partial acquisition, and the fraction of Ideo’s business that it constitutes, have not been made public. In a post on Medium, Ideo’s CEO Tim Brown explains: The rate of change has been dizzying, and today’s advanced technologies — AI, genomics, robotics, data science, the Internet of Things — have so outpaced our industrial-era organizations and infrastructure, they end up hitting institutional cul-de-sacs. The technologies don’t come to a halt, of course, they simply move on, seeking out other places where they race ahead. If our institutions are to survive, they’ll have to create new roadways. That’s a design problem — one that requires new rules of engagement with a broad set of collaborators. We’re excited to have found those collaborators in a few like-minded design firms. In the same post, Brown quickly dismisses the idea that Ideo is “caught in the much ballyhooed death spiral of the independent design firm.” Instead, he says the decision to sell a stake in Ideo’s business and join a collective is part of a larger mission to “apply our collective design practice to greater challenges.” Whatever the reason, the business deal fits the larger trend of big firms buying up smaller design studios. McKinsey bought Lunar; Yves Béhar sold a majority stake in fuseproject to the Chinese holding company BlueFocus. In many ways, these transitions aren’t new. There’s a long history of commingling between design and business (more on that here). Ideo is just the latest—and most high-profile—firm to make such a move. Go Back to Top.

The happy Mac. Susan Kare designed them all. In creating these and most of the other icons on the original Apple Macintosh, she established the visual language that would form the foundation of point-and-click computing.  Here, Kare, icon of icons, talks about the creative decisions behind some of the best-loved symbols of the past four decades. Kare delivered this presentation at last year’s Layers Design Conference in San Francisco, but the video was only recently posted online. It’s full of fresh observations about the creative process, insights about her time at Apple, and advice for designing with accessibility in mind; so even if you’re familiar with Kare and her work, we’re willing to bet you’ll find something new here. We knew from Kare’s 2013 book, for example, that the command icon (⌘) was originally a symbol used to denote interesting features at Swedish campgrounds, but the story of how she stumbled upon the symbol in the first place, and how she weighed its merits at the time, was new to us. (Her description of her first trip to Sweden, decades after she copped the command icon for Apple, is also pretty damn charming.)   Her talk’s about half an hour long and well worth watching in its entirety. The second half of the video, a Q&A between Kare and Daring Fireball’s John Gruber, is also worth a watch. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

He’s got a bushy beard, a DGAF attitude, and, you know, a bunch of really awesome graphic design work to his name. He’s done identities for Patagonia and Nike Skateboarding, record covers for Conor Oberst, print work for WIRED, and is the guy behind those ubiquitous Field Notes notebooks. Draplin is a branding man who’s ultimately become a brand himself. Now the designer is dropping a book called “Pretty Much Everything” (out May 17), and according to the official announcement it’s going to be a “mid-career survey of work, case studies, inspiration, road stories, lists, covers, and logos.” Chances are it’s probably going to be pretty damn funny, too.

Artist Leo Villareal designed a massive installation that transformed the bridge that stretches between Oakland and San Francisco into a canvas of shimmering lights. It was public art on a grand scale; like the Eiffel Tower in Paris, only bigger. Some numbers: 25,000 lights, 1.8 miles long, 500 feet high. It twinkled for two years and then in March of 2015, the lights turned off. Now, just in time for the Super Bowl, the lights are coming back. Thanks to $4 million in funding, Illuminate the Arts commissioned Villareal to design a new light show, which we can only assume  will surpass the original in terms of ambition. They turn on tomorrow evening (Jan. 30), and this time, word is, they’re sticking around for good. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

The iconic doll now comes in four different sizes: petite, tall, curvy, and original. You know the original size—it’s the one that, if Barbie were a life-size human woman, would leave her with a 16-inch waist and an inability to walk on her own two feet. It’s also the size that’s outraged critiques for years, prompting Mattel to make a radical design move. That move was unveiled this morning, in a TIME magazine cover story. The TIME story covers the business and design choices that went into launching the new Barbie body styles, but it also sheds some light on the origins of Barbie’s unattainable figure: Barbie has courted controversy since her birth. Her creator, Ruth Handler, based Barbie’s body on a German doll called Lilli, a prostitute gag gift handed out at bachelor parties. Her proportions were designed accordingly. When Handler introduced Barbie (named after her daughter Barbara) in 1959 at the New York Toy Fair, her male competitors laughed her out of the room: nobody, they insisted, would want to play with a doll with breasts. Still, Barbie’s sales took off, but by 1963 women were protesting the same body men had ridiculed. That year, a teen Barbie was sold with a diet book that recommended simply, “Don’t eat.” When a Barbie with pre-programmed phrases uttered, “Math class is tough,” a group called the Barbie Liberation Organization said the doll taught girls that it was more important to be pretty than smart. The new sizing lexicon is deliberately neutral, but in plain English it means that in addition to the original doll you can now buy a short Barbie, a tall Barbie, or a Barbie with hips, thighs, and a hint of meat on her bones. It’s this last one—curvy Barbie—that is the real game changer, and the one that’s stirring up reactions. They are, of course, mixed: So love this! ABOUT TIME!

The building, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, is a wonder to wander through, with its soaring atrium and gleaming, spiraled ramps. It’s a museum best experienced in person, of course—but for those of who can’t make it in the flesh, good news: You can now visit through your computer. Following museums like the Museum of Modern Art and the Tate in London, the Guggenheim is the latest addition to Google’s expanding Cultural Institute project, which has digitized more than 32,000 pieces of artwork from more than 150 museums around the world since 2011. Using Google’s Street View technology, digital visitors can now explore Wright’s building, ascending and descending its ramp with a digital pair of feet. More than 120 artworks have also been digitized and made available online. The museum explains it was quite the challenge to capture the essence of the building, given its unique architecture. Apparently, it took a fleet of drone, tripod, and street view trolley cameras to get the shots that were then stitched together for a 360-degree view. We have to admit that, while it’s way cooler to see see the museum IRL, the circularity of the Guggenheim does lend itself quite nicely to the 360 experience. Go Back to Top.

Embrace the Danish Concept of Hygge Getty Images The Danish have a word, hygge, that crudely translates to “cozy.” More accurately, it translates to, that profoundly content feeling you get when it’s frigid outside but you’re inside wearing flannel and drinking hot toddies in front of a fire. Hygge, pronounced “hoo-gah,” is a bit of a polysemy. It’s derived from the Norwegian word for “well-being,” and you can feel hygge, be hygge, or do hygge. Denmark’s official tourism website has a page called “The art of Danish hygge,” which explains that hygge high season starts at Christmas, “when Danes pull out all the hygge stops,” but reassures you that you can still experience hygge in the summer. “Picnics in the park, barbeques with friends, outdoor concerts, street festivals and bike rides can all be very hygge.” According to the BBC, hygge is even a course subject at Morley College in London. Hygge is also the best way to explain the principles of Scandinavian design. Think of it like an aesthetic adaptation to the harsh winters there; when it’s below freezing and dark for 16 hours a day, making your indoor environment warm and welcoming is imperative. As Fredrik Carlström, the founder of a Scandinavian design studio called Austere, put it to me (in a separate interview), “Scandinavian design isn’t austere. It’s what is outside that’s austere and it makes our homes really nice.” It’s why furniture and lighting from that part of the world is of such high caliber. If you’re not yet hip to hygge, now might be a good time to embrace the Danish attitude towards the cold. Menacing news reports of the “crippling” and “deadly” blizzard that’s headed for the east coast will remind you to stock up on bottled water and batteries. (And you should, we’re not here to be flippant about potentially dangerous storms). But hygge, aptly described by this travel website as, “the art of creating intimacy,” might help you pull through, too. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

The latest expansion was just announced, and it’s 3.2-million square feet of ziggurat-like buildings, parking areas, and mixed-use facilities. That’s massive. By comparison, Apple’s new spaceship campus will be a reported 2.8-million square feet. To pull it off, the athletic wear company is working with three different studios—ZGF Architects, SRG Partnership, and Skylab Architecture—and one landscape architecture firm. Judging from the materials available, it’s early days for the expansion. Nike released two renderings. One is an aerial view of the arrayed offices that “takes inspiration from human movement, speed and the strength and energy of competition.” The other shows off a basketball court and a series of outdoor staircases that echo Renzo Piano’s famous design for the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris. CEO Mark Parker said the new designs are good for employees, which makes them good for the athletes who wear Nike’s stuff. “We relentlessly evolve how we inspire our own teams and design environments that foster chemistry and collaboration.” It’s slated to open in 2018.

The folks over at Threadbase, a newly launched data project, know this and are here to help. The founders are on a mission to, “organize clothing data and make it searchable,” and for their inaugural database, they’ve analyzed men’s t-shirts, by washing, drying, measuring, and weighing an insane 800 of them. Threadbase’s findings, rendered in chart form, tell you that a size small Uniqlo crew neck shirt is the same size as a medium Alternative Apparel crew neck shirt, chest width-wise. They inform you that Alternative Apparel, Banana Republic, and H&M sell some of the shortest t-shirts out there. It also explains that with tees, weight—a sensory detail that can often evoke a sense of luxury—does not correlate to price. And much, much more. A t-shirt is a personal thing—a 2013 story in The New York Times Sunday Magazine said that 9 out of every 10 Americans clings to at least one old shirt for sentimental reasons.

The withheld payment has to do with copyrights over Hadid’s design. The Japan Sports Council wants them, and Hadid is refusing the hand them over. If she did, it would give the JSC license to use any element of her design, without any additional payment. It’s a confounding request, especially in light of the JSC’s very recent (and very public) decision to name Kengo Kuma as the stadium’s new architect. The stadium project has been mired in trouble from the start. In 2013, Japanese designers made noise by calling Hadid’s design too large, and even started a petition to halt construction. In 2014, Hadid and the JSC struggled to maintain a budget, and the cost of the stadium ballooned to a reported $2 billion. This summer, Tokyo killed it. In October, Hadid requested payment. In reply, the JSC sent documents, with the new copyright stipulations, to Hadid’s office. After the JSC chose Kuma and his design for the stadium, in December, Hadid’s firm issued a statement that mentions the “remarkable similarities of our original detailed stadium layout and our seating bowl configuration with those of the design announced today.” The timing of the different events—the JSC’s request to hand over copyrights in the fall, followed by Hadid’s accusations about copycatting in December—would suggest that Hadid and her team believe Tokyo to be using her design, under the guise of a new architect. Kuma, of course, has denied the accusation. Unfortunately for Hadid’s case, lots of stadiums are bowl-shaped, and that’s a building typology that you can’t protect under copyright. We recently spent some time unpacking the ins and outs of copyrighting architecture in this article, but cases such as this often boil down to a “total look and feel test,” in which a judge looks at two designs and asks, “do these things look substantially similar?” It’s a flimsy rule, and if you look at Hadid’s design and Kuma’s, it doesn’t look so good for the former.

The Pritzker is perhaps architecture’s most coveted and prestigious award. Recent winners have included Frei Otto, Shigeru Ban, and Toyo Ito. Less recent winners list industry celebrities like Zaha Hadid and Renzo Piano. At a time when architecture headlines tend to paint the industry as catering to the elite (see coverage of Jean Nouvel’s luxury condo tower in New York City’s midtown, or the scandal over Zaha Hadid’s now-scrapped $2 billion stadium for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics), it’s notable that the Pritzker Prize jury would choose an architect who seems to work very deliberately for the people. In a statement, Tom Pritzker, president and chairman of the Hyatt Foundation, which sponsors the award, said: “Alejandro Aravena has pioneered a collaborative practice that produces powerful works of architecture and also addresses key challenges of the 21st century. His built work gives economic opportunity to the less privileged, mitigates the effects of natural disasters, reduces energy consumption, and provides welcoming public space. Innovative and inspiring, he shows how architecture at its best can improve people’s lives.” Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Architecture Pritzker Prize Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

He was 69. During times of communal grief, people often cling to a symbol to pay tribute to the departed. It looks as though this GIF, by illustrator Helen Green, might be that symbol today. Green, a young artist from the UK, actually created the animation a year ago, for Bowie’s 68th birthday. She called it “Time May Change Me” (you know, from Changes), and it comprises 29 colored pencil drawings of Bowie during various stages of his chameleon-like career. There’s Bowie as Ziggy Stardust, Aladdin Sane, and Major Tom. And then there’s Bowie as Bowie, visually reinvented again and again. Amidst the outpouring of mourning across the Internet, design and arts organizations are sharing it on Twitter, Instagram, and the like to honor his memory. Bowie was an artist—but he was also art, himself. There will be many visual tributes to the icon in the days to come, but Green’s homage, which celebrates Bowie’s capacity for reinvention and unabashed self-expression, strikes us as particularly fitting.

These remarkable hairstyles, perhaps most famously found atop the royal head of Marie Antoinette, were typically made from human, horse, or goat hair, and their voluminous height was boosted by padding and various other tools.  To solidify the style, a paste made from pig fat would be applied. Lovely. Buying a wig, one can imagine, was quite an investment in the 18th century. And indeed, a wig’s material and accessories were an outright display of wealth and status. The more elaborate your hair, the more elaborate your wealth. While hardly a practical accessory, the wigs were, objectively, works of art. And so, it makes sense that an art museum has decided to pay homage to them by creating a perfect time-suck of a website. The V&A of London just launched Design a Wig to celebrate the re-opening of its 1600—1815 galleries. The interactive website allows users to build a powdered wig wielding only a computer mouse. It’s as simple as grabbing the avatar’s shock of blonde hair and pulling it upward and outward to create a mushroom cloud. Powder your wig with digital flour of various hues. Add flowers, a sailboat, feathers! The wig is your oyster. Go crazy! And lest you feel bad about wasting 30 minutes of your employer’s time hypnotized by your newfound love of wig-making, just remind yourself: This isn’t a silly game; it’s a history lesson.   Go Back to Top.

And while atlases are technically just collections of maps (be they of roads, outer space, the world wide web, or the human body), the good ones also have a way of presenting a more holistic picture of the things they document. American Panorama, a cool new project from the University of Richmond’s Digital Scholarship Lab, is a great example. American Panorama aims to be an internet-era update to Charles’ Paullin’s sweeping Atlas of the Historical Geography of the United States from 1932. It recounts America’s history through interactive cartography, letting users drag sliders and click on bubbles to take an even deeper dive into specific moments in history. American Panorama American Panorama comprises four maps created by design studio Stamen. And these maps have depth. Adding a layers of technology and interactivity to an otherwise daunting trove of data helps us make connections we might otherwise miss. For example, in a map that looks at the foreign-born population from 1850 to 2010, I was able to see that my ancestors’ arrival to Nebraska in the 1880s coincided with the influx of Swedish immigrants at the time. Dragging the scrubber along the dateline reveals how, a century later, the foreign-born population in the state was mostly Asian (the map explains that 1980 was the first time the country’s largest immigrant population was not European), and how, by 2010, European immigrants had been largely superseded by people from Latin America, Vietnam, China and Iraq. Paullin’s atlas examined the country’s social, economic and political history through a hyper-focused lens. The maps at American Panorama are similarly incisive, with titles like “Forced Migration of Enslaved People from 1810-1860,” “Canals from 1820-1860,” and “Overland Trails.” That there are currently just four maps to choose from means that—unless you’re a history buff—there’s probably a slight barrier to entry. And, if we’re being honest, these aren’t perfect data visualizations. The interaction is still a little clunky, and I found myself wanting to be able to drill down even deeper into the data. Despite all that, as American Panorama develops into a full-fledged digital atlas, it’s only going to become more powerful and compelling. Because as it turns out, the addition of even the simplest interactions can make it feel as though you’re looking at history with a very powerful magnifying glass in hand—and that’s a very cool thing.

In his review of 2015’s best book covers, Matt Dorfman, art director of The New York Times Book Review, describes that kind of work. “The covers that lure me into the pages,” he writes, “often do so by posing questions that I don’t want to ignore.” Rodrigo Corral and Zak Tebbal. What’s cool about this, at least right now, is that book cover designers seem to have more devices than ever at their disposal to pose these questions. There are certain rules, for sure, as master designer Peter Mendelsund—who has a design in this round up—has told us before. But designers can still thank Amazon and other e-outlets for this newfound liberation: because book covers often appear next to titles and the author name, designers are less beholden to promoting any kind of information hierarchy. To wit, if you scan the Times’s 12 picks for dust jackets, you’ll see that art, in the form of lavish illustrations, sometimes trumps legibility. Consider the excellent GIF cover for César Aira’s The Musical Brain. Designed by Rodrigo Corral and Zak Tebbal, it’s a killer merging of two technologies—one ancient, and one new. Go Back to Top.

Fjord is one such design firm. The company, which consulting firm Accenture bought in 2013, puts out an annual trends report to capture, in broad strokes, the topics designers should “expect to tackle in the coming year.” You’ll probably recognize some trends. The rise of voice recognition technology, virtual reality as an emerging medium, and the uptick in health data are developments that we’ve all talked a lot about this year. But embedded in the report are some burgeoning applications of good design that we’ve talked about a bit less. They’re worth mulling over. Take the “atomization of apps,” or the end of the standalone app. Omnipresent services are happening already—Fjord uses the example of Spotify, which exists as much on your laptop as it does in your Uber—but are likely to seep into other parts of our lives. From the paper: “Visa is researching the commerce-connected car that pays for groceries, takeaways and fuel—literally payments (and collection) on wheels.” There’s the rise in employee experience, or “EX”, design. “It was the fastest growing category of work at Fjord in 2015 across many industries, from banking to telecom to pharma,” says the report. When it comes to workplace tools like T&E reports or timesheets, even some progressive companies are woefully behind. To lure better talent from younger generations, businesses might want to pay attention to this decidedly unsexy category. There’s also a section called “For the people” that looks at how governments are finally embracing design for social good. Some of this has to do with introducing in-house design standards, but the report highlights ways agencies can work with citizens. Consider the Mobile Justice app, made in tandem with the Black Lives Matter movement: “The app has a simple feature allowing smartphone owners to send video footage directly to the American Civil Liberties Union—all with the simple shake of a phone. The ACLU then systematically reviews it for potential legal action.” Read the full report here. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Product Design UX design Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

Richard Brian/Las Vegas Review-Journal Follow @vegasphotograph By NICOLE RAZ LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL Apple announced a security bounty program at the cybersecurity convention Black Hat in Las Vegas. “We’ve had great help from researchers like you improving iOS security all along,” Apple’s head of security, Ivan Krstić, told a crowd of cybersecurity and information technology professionals on Thursday. “It’s getting increasingly more difficult to find some of the most critical gaps in security vulnerabilities, so the apple security bounty program is going to reward researchers who actually share critical vulnerabilities with Apple.” Apple will pay between $25,000 and $200,000 for that information, depending on the type of security gap discovered. The company will also provide public recognition, unless asked otherwise. The announcement of the bug bounty program was greeted by a roar of applause from attendees at Mandalay Bay. The announcement came after Krstić gave a presentation on Apple’s data protection mechanisms, laying out in highly technical detail how the coming iOS 10 will be safer than previous iOS security. “There were very few surprises,” said a Romanian information security professional, who did not want his name or the name of his company to be recorded — like most at Black Hat. A question and answer session after the presentation was more of a charade, as Krstić was highly evasive. In reponse to an audience question about the most persistent security challenges at Apple, Krstić responded tongue and cheek with, “Tough audience questions, thank you,” and moved on to the next question. An attendee from California, who works for a mobile security company, said he was satisfied with the presenation. “He’s given the most internal information that’s ever come out of Apple, so I’ll give it to him.” Contact Nicole Raz at nraz@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-4512.

At one time, it was thought that Apple might be building a TV set. That emerged from a Steve Jobs quote in Walter Isaacson’s authorized biography of him,” Gene Steinberg writes for The Tech Night Owl. “Jobs announced the discovery of the greatest TV interface ever, and that surely freaked the industry.” “There were reports over the years suggesting that Apple had sampled TV prototypes, but eventually abandoned the project because they couldn’t devise a viable marketing plan,” Steinberg writes. “But Tim Cook continued to repeat the claim that Apple was deeply interested in the living room, so how would that present itself? One possibility was to build a subscription TV service to provide an alternative to cord cutters.” “Supposedly Apple tried to cut deals with the networks, without success,” Steinberg writes. “Well the new wrinkle is that Apple might just offer up the fourth-generation Apple TV as a partial replacement for TV Guide. So instead of using a DVR, you’d use the apps provided by TV networks for Apple’s streamer, and rely on that interface to provide smart TV listings, driven by Siri. You’d still need to cut a deal with the cable/satellite services or the dedicated streaming services, but it would all appear within Apple’s unique interface. In other words, Apple might become a TiVo alternative.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Fits and starts.

Not to make a DVR but to license the guide and to hold DVR IP. With streaming the DVR is going to die. However with that said TiVo has a well rooted interface and user following.

I don’t have to switch inputs now to get HBO GO, Netflix or Hulu – it’s right there on the same menu as my recorded programs – with interfaces that look and perform very much like the AppleTV versions. JWSC Sunday, August 7, 2016 - 11:56 am · Reply It is UNFORGIVABLE that in 2016 consumers still have to deal with four remotes (TV, cable/satellite, DVD/BluRay, and AppleTV) to navigate the different inputs/channels. The non-AppleTV remotes are complex beasts. I consider myself technically literate but even I have trouble working with some of the functions of these monstrosities. It’s stupidity unbound. The engineers and product VPs responsible for releasing such horrible interfaces should have been kicked out on their rear ends years go. If the senior leadership of the cable, satellite and electronics companies had spent as much time trying to simplify their interfaces and work to develop a common standard as they have spent trying to do everything in their collective power to block Apple from entering the market, they would not have to be worrying about Apple in the first place. The leadership of these companies are made up of short sighted buffoons who are only interested in enriching themselves as opposed to making a better experience for the customers who have made them right. So undeserving! JWSC Sunday, August 7, 2016 - 11:58 am · Reply … made them rich.

We rank all 16 Angry Birds games The 12 best Android TV games to play with a gamepad Five to Try: Her Story commands attention, and Google launches VR Expeditions Video Google Daydream View unboxing: A first look at Google's VR headset If your plans for the weekend revolve around a couch, the TV, and as much Olympics coverage as your eyes can handle, then you’re in luck: the official Rio 2016 app is here to help guide your days ahead. And the rest of the apps can also be enjoyed amidst that comfy cocoon of air-conditioned bliss… or anywhere else, really.  Mobius: Final Fantasy is Square Enix’s latest attempt to transform the role-playing epic into a free-to-play grind, while Google’s Verne: The Himalayas turns Google Maps into an educational journey. Also new this week is the non-beta release of Apple Music, along with the thrilling space escapes of All is Lost. Fire up the Play Store and grab a few new apps, no matter what your weekend plans are. Rio 2016 Rio 2016 is the official Olympics resource app, complete with adorable mascot in tow. A handful of soccer matches and archery events are already in the books, but tonight’s lavish opening ceremony marks the official start of the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics. And if you plan on following the massive, international competition over the next couple weeks, you’ll probably want an app plastered on your home screen. Well, here’s Rio 2016. The official app, which is backed by Samsung but not limited to its devices, has all the Olympics info you need, including results, news, medal counts, and information on each sport, the players, and venues. It’s a pretty straightforward app, really, but it’ll get you all the info you need pretty easily—and if you’re down in Rio de Janeiro to scope out the action for yourself, the app has local info to enhance your stay. Mobius: Final Fantasy Mobius looks really nice at a glance, although everything’s pretty fuzzy up close. Mobius is quite seriously the third different Final Fantasy game to hit the Play Store over the last few weeks, and they’re all totally distinct. Final Fantasy VII is a premium port of a PlayStation classic, Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius is a new game inspired by the 16-bit era, and now Mobius: Final Fantasy is a combat-centric, free-to-play game that serves up the series spirit in a different form. You’ll find turn-based combat, fantasy spells, and even the familiar job system, although here the game simply routes you from battle to battle as you amass a deck of item and magic cards. Mobius doesn’t really play like a classic Final Fantasy, but it has the look of the more modern entries (and the convoluted storytelling), plus there are enough throwback references to appease the die-hards. We’ll see if that’s enough to hook longtime fans. Verne: The Himalayas Google’s digital mountain range is yours to explore in Verne: The Himalayas. It’s super cool to see some of the ways that Google has used its immense mapping power to deliver experiences for people who don’t need to leave the home. Treks are one result, showcasing amazing places around the world, and now Verne: The Himalayas is another way that Google is leveraging its Maps platform to spotlight somewhere amazing. Here, Verne takes the form of a kid-friendly app that lets you freely explore the 3D mountain range using a couple of digital control sticks. As you scale the cliffs, you’ll encounter narration bubbles and have the opportunity to soar on a hang-glider, for example, or sled down a hill. It’s just a breezy and fun way to learn about a new place, and the cartoonish yeti character and easy controls make it a good pick for the family. Apple Music Apple Music added videos and an equalizer—and ditched the beta branding. Nine months after first hitting the Play Store, Apple has finally decided to pull the beta tag off of Apple Music and call it a full release. The subscription service, which might seem a bit out of place on an Android phone, matches up well to Spotify on a lot of key features, save for maybe the biggest: it doesn’t have a free, ad-supported membership option. Still, there’s a 90-day free trial available to new subscribers. If you haven’t given it a look since the initial beta beginning, Apple Music has since added the missing music videos and now has equalizer settings, to boot. You’ll find millions of songs, of course, including an increasingly sizable stack of exclusives and the Beats 1 live radio station. Apple Music is about to get a major overhaul in iOS 10, but it’s unclear whether that will extend to Android as well. In the meantime, however, anyone scared off by Apple Music’s beta tag needn’t stay away now. All is Lost Can you get everyone out safely through these intense obstacle courses? All is Lost ($1) may not have the most upbeat title around, but it’s pretty entertaining all the same. This side-scrolling runner hails from the makers of Block Fortress and Heroes & Castles, and finds you in charge of guiding a series of crew members out of a doomed spaceship. Doing so requires an array of jumps, slides, and swipes to interact with the environment, and you’ll need to be speedy and precise to get everyone out. That’s not an easy task, of course, as the combinations of moves can throw you off, and you only have so many attempts for each crew member before they’re lost forever. All is Lost puts a clever twist on the usual format for these games, and while it may not have a ton of bells and whistles, the core experience is plenty fun.

But the news left some experts wondering why Apple was so late to the party. So-called “bug bounty” programs are now standard among most tech giants. They can help keep consumers safe by encouraging independent researchers to help companies fix security flaws. When a researcher finds a legitimate problem, rewards can range all the way up to the six figures. But Apple historically had a different approach — offering a tipline where people could report security problems, but not handing out any reward other than putting the researcher’s name on a thank you page on its website. “It was kind of an insult,” said Matthew Green, a computer science professor at Johns Hopkins University who has previously told Apple about security problems in its products and didn’t know why it took them so long to launch a bounty program. “Maybe after San Bernardino they felt there was some pressure to acknowledge that it wasn’t enough to give people a pat on the back — even if they can’t pay enough to compete with the free market,” he said. Apple’s lack of a bug bounty program drew criticism earlier this year when the FBI paid an unknown entity more than $1 million for help breaking into an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters. Without a bug bounty program, some argued, the only way researchers could make money from finding bugs in Apple’s products was selling them off to the highest bidder — in this case, the FBI. But now, Apple has a chance “to compete for the type of exploits available and control how they’ll be used,” said Jeff Pollard, principal analyst focused on IT security at Forrester Research. Apple’s new rewards program will launch in September, but won’t be open to anyone. Instead, it will be invite-only — at least in the beginning. But researchers who approach the company with a major problem also will be invited to join. Most programs are open to all researchers. The program will only reward researchers for finding a few categories of problems at launch. The biggest payouts will be for bugs affecting software built into components that help Apple’s devices start-up securely: Researchers who find one of those could get up to $200,000. That makes Apple’s bug bounty program one of the most lucrative out there. Google’s program, which launched in 2010, upped its largest bounty — for breaking the security of its Chromebooks — to $100,000 this March. Microsoft’s largest per bug payout is also $100,000. Apple’s potential big rewards may be aimed at convincing researchers to turn to the company when they find a problem, rather than the open market where vulnerabilities might be bought up for use in criminal or state-sponsored hacks. But even with Apple’s hefty new payouts, other places may still pay a better premium for ways to hack into the company’s products. Last year, Zerodium, a company that deals in buying zero-day vulnerabilities from researchers and selling them to large corporations and government agencies, said it paid $1 million to researchers who were able to remotely hack into the latest version of Apple’s mobile operating system, iOS. The company doesn’t offer the same massive payouts for problems in other products. “No software other than iOS really deserves such a high bug bounty,” Zerodium founder Chaouki Bekrar told The Post last year, citing Apple’s strong security built into its products. That internal focus on security may be one reason Apple held out against an official bug bounty program so long while, even as other sectors like the automotive industry, airlines and the Department of Defense started to get in on the game. The rise of Apple Pay may be another factor that pushed the company to be more aggressive about getting help from the larger security community, according to Green. “They really need to know that system is secure” because there’s actual money at risk, he said. “I think a lot of researchers would rather hand vulnerabilities over to Apple than to someone who is going to use it to steal people’s payment information.” Filed under: Apple Print Email Gmail Related Windows Users Should Uninstall Apple’s QuickTime Now Apple Holds Event to Introduce New Products Walgreens Links Its Rewards Program With Apple Pay Speculation About New Apple Products Kicks Into Overdrive Apple Releases iOS 8.1.3 to Fix Bugs Subscribe to the Hamodia print edition More in Technology Another Failure in Search for Treatment to Slow Alzheimer’s INVESTIGATIVE REPORT: How Kellogg Worked With ‘Independent Experts’ to Tout Cereal Study: Dementia Rates Decline Sharply Among Senior Citizens Best Weather Satellite Ever Built Rockets Into Space Rocket Blasts Off for Int’l Space Station OP-ED Parties Don’t Matter.

Something that’s more muddy is what Apple will be offering in the box for new iPhone customers. There have been several rumors of Apple doing Lightning-enabled EarPods, but at the same time there have also been rumors of Apple developing Bluetooth-enabled ones as well. According to a report from Forbes, Apple has been working on an in-house custom designed Bluetooth chip for several years. The in-house chip focuses on power efficiency and could enable Bluetooth headphones to have much longer battery life. The report mentions that Apple’s incentive to do so stems from its acquisition of Passif Semiconductor back in 2013. Ideally, Apple would aim for the ‘all-day’ battery life you get with the Apple Watch, only needing to charge nightly. Apparently, due to “performance snags,” Apple delayed releasing their own wireless headphones which the report claims would’ve been released last year. While the report mentions development from last year, it doesn’t mention anything about more recent development. Which, leads us to believe that Apple may not be shipping it with the iPhone 7.

We’re expecting Apple to supply Lightning-enabled EarPods with the iPhone 7. With any photos or videos before Apple officially announces the device, it’s impossible to know if these are the real deal. While it’s pretty easy to create mockups for phones and cases, it’s much more difficult to create fake earphones. The video shows us that the pair they have does work and the sound is being driven from the iPhone’s Lighting port. Of course, these look very similar to Apple’s current 3.5mm EarPods, aside from the connector. While it’s not confirmed that Apple will be shipping Lightning EarPods, it is most likely the case. Supplying any sort of wireless earphones would be too costly. Similarly, providing a 3.5mm-to-Lightning adapter would be impractical as Apple’s goal is to get customers to move away from the standard.

EmojiMom By Samantha Lefave Aug 05, 2016 Apple may have announced they were adding more inclusive emojis to the iOS 10 update, but a third-party emoji app has decided to step in and help. Because even though the Apple upgrade includes a female runner and a dad with two kids, it still lacks decent representation for preggo ladies. Sure, it's great that you can now text nothing but an ice cream or burger emoji to the hubs so he can swing by the grocery store on the way home from work, but what about when you're experiencing morning sickness, your nipples are burning, or you just want a freaking glass of wine? Advertisement - Continue Reading Below That's why EmojiMom launched their keyboard of 250+ motherhood- and pregnancy-related emojis at the end of July (not to mention August is the most common birth month, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, so good timing). Yes, you'll definitely find the standard smiling mom-with-baby emoji (along with the crying hysterically one). But you'll also find a "How-the-eff-are-you-sleeping" emoji and a woman with leaking breasts who DGAF, because that's what new mommas actually text about. "We really hoped this could be something that allowed moms to own more of the conversation about motherhood," co-founder Sarah Robinson told Refinery29. "The good, bad, and ugly stuff about what happens to your body, about how you feel about your newborn (sometimes, frankly, not that good), about the things you go through postpartum that no one tells you about." But the app also includes some potentially controversial emojis in the hope that these conversations will become less stigmatized and women can be open with one another. A prime example? An antidepressant emoji, which represents the fact that one in seven mothers will experience postpartum depression, according to the American Psychological Association. Another one: A pumping-is-the-worst emoji, hinting at both the struggles moms can experience with breastfeeding and the trouble women go through when in need of a private place to pump. In other words, bravo, EmojiMom.

Apple still hasn’t confirmed that this fall’s iPhone will ditch the familiar 3.5mm headphone jack in favor of audio over Lightning, but as we get closer to the release it’s seeming more and more likely. The video comes courtesy of Mobile Fun’s YouTube channel. It shows the headphones connected to an iPhone 6s with the inline remote controlling music playback. It’s possible the demonstration is faked and they used clever camera positioning to use Apple’s current 3.5mm jack earbuds to simulate the Lightning connection, but that seems like a lot of effort to fake an earbud demonstration. Video shows Apple’s Lightning connector earbuds in action Assuming the video is legit and show Apple’s new earbuds, it’s likely this is what we’ll get in the box when the new iPhone models ship this fall. Some reports suggest Apple will include 3.5mm connector earbuds and a Lightning adapter with the new iPhone. That’s possible, but doesn’t fit with Apple’s track record of dumping a technology and offering adapters as an accessory purchase. In this case, that accessory would be the 3.5mm to Lightning adapter. Reports have been saying for months that the new iPhone, speculatively dubbed the iPhone 7, will look nearly identical to the iPhone 6s. The new model will reportedly do away with the traditional audio jack, reposition the antenna lines, get better cameras and faster processors, and will offer more storage. Apple is planning to release iOS 10 sometime in September, which coincides with the traditional iPhone launch window. Based on current leaks and speculation, Apple will likely announce the new iPhone models in the first week of September. Assuming Apple really does kill off the 3.5mm headphone jack, get ready for lots of complaining for the loss of a technology that’s more than 50 years old. The jack first went into use in 1964, but gained widespread popularity in 1979 with the launch of Sony’s Walkman portable cassette player. Apple talks about giving us new technologies we didn’t know we couldn’t live without. It sounds like this time they’re taking away a technology we didn’t realize we could live without—and an adapter cable for those of us who really can’t leave the 3.5mm headphone jack behind yet. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit Tags: earbuds, iPhone 7, Lightning One Comment Add a comment Lee Dronick August 5, 2016 It sounds like this time they’re taking away a technology we didn’t realize we could live without And giving us one that we have been living just fine without. The 50 year old technology is still more than what most people neen, vinyl loving audiophiles not withstanding. The smart move would be to include both ports, but to include Lightning earbuds and let the users see just how good they may be.

New Apple TV plans emerge, EPG for digital shows and films Pocket-lint 05-08-2016 pocket-lint.com © Pocket-lint After Apple was said to have ditched plans for its own television broadcast service at the end of last year, there have been few rumours about its TV expansion plans. And the Apple TV set-top-box is still waiting for something to ignite its potential, beyond a few games, apps and voice control. There are a few improvements for the device coming, which were detailed at WWDC 2016. It will get additional app support, including Sling TV in the States, and a Live Tune In mode that more easily switches between different livestreaming channels. In addition, Single Sign-on will automatically authenticate you in all pay TV apps you subscribe to, as long as they support the function. But these are tweaks rather than a groundbreaking new feature. That, says Recode, will be rectified soon. Apple TV review: Packed with potential Industry sources, it claims, have revealed that Apple is looking to add a digital TV guide, similar to the one used by Microsoft for its OneGuide Xbox One software. It will list specific content on multiple supported video streaming services. You will get, for example, an EPG like on your television, but with Netflix programming listed as a channel. Then HBO, etc. You can then click on the show and it will start instantly, without you having to search for it in an individual app. According to Recode, Apple is in discussions with services about providing the metadata for their shows and films. No timeline has been mentioned as to when this might happen, but it would certainly add something new to the latest Apple TV box.

Apple is the last major tech company to offer such a scheme. Despite its late entrance, it has been praised by security experts for accepting external help. Bug bounty programs enable security researchers and volunteer hackers to use their skills for good. They incentivise people to find bugs in a company's products, offering cash rewards in return for detailed reports on vulnerabilities and exploits. These bugs could otherwise have catastrophic consequences if discovered first by malicious hackers. The launch of Apple's program has been long anticipated by people who already spend time finding weaknesses in its software. Companies including Google and Facebook have been running their own schemes for years. When Microsoft debuted its own program in 2013, it was criticised by some for arriving late. Three years further on, Apple's announcement is long overdue. The company said it is entering the game now because it is finding it increasingly harder to find bugs on its own. It is now open to receiving all the help it can get to find bugs in software like iOS, particularly as it still hasn't ascertained how the FBI cracked the iPhone's encryption mechanisms earlier this year. Apple is starting small with the program, based on advice that other companies have given it. Initially, only a small selection of security researchers who have found vulnerabilities in the past will be able to contribute. This limitation will ensure Apple can keep a handle on the early reports and ensure the system runs smoothly. Later on, it will widen the scheme and allow anyone to participate. Bounties will be awarded based on the severity of the vulnerability and the number of Apple customers likely to be affected by a successful exploit. Only bugs affecting iOS devices and iCloud online storage will be eligible for a reward to begin with. The highest bounties will be awarded to people who successfully bypass Apple's Secure Boot firmware on iOS. This mechanism prevents the operating system from loading if malicious software is detected. Avoiding this system would allow an attacker to inject malware into the heart of the OS, giving them unrestricted access to a user's files. Demonstrations of exploits that achieve this will be awarded the full bounty of up to $200,000, the largest award for a single bug offered by any current bounty scheme. The next tier is for exploits that retrieve sensitive user information from the iPhone's Secure Enclave, receiving up to $100,000. Attacks that allow the execution of malicious code with system privileges will be awarded up to $50,000. Those that access user data while operating in a supposedly secure sandbox will be eligible for a bounty of up to $25,000. Finally, unauthorised access to iCloud user data stored on Apple's servers will receive up to $50,000. To obtain a pay-out, participating researchers will need to provide Apple with a functioning proof-of-concept exploit that is compatible with the latest released version of iOS. Attacks against an iPhone's hardware, such as a Secure Enclave vulnerability, must be based on the latest models of the device currently shipping to customers. While the program is not without its limitations, it does represent a big step forward for Apple. The company has always accepted proof-of-concept attacks from researchers and given individuals credit in its security update release notes. For the first time, it is now actively encouraging people to find flaws in its products, falling into line with the rest of the industry, dropping its complacency in its reputation for strong security. The scheme will go live in the fall, allowing Apple to strengthen the security of its devices through active community involvement. As an added incentive to researchers, the company is even offering to double pay-outs if a participant donates their bounty to charity, potentially leading to $400,000 being awarded for a single bug.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Leaked video shows off the iPhone 7’s Lightning EarPods from every angle Chris Smith BGR NewsAugust 5, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share A few days ago, Samsung made fun of Apple for its rumored decision to remove the standard 3.5mm headphone jack from the upcoming iPhone by pointing out that its new Galaxy Note 7 comes with a regular headphone connector. While Apple is yet to confirm the move, it’s widely expected to ditch the 3.5mm port on the upcoming handset. Ditching the headphone jack is well known, but we're still unsure how Apple plans to fix the 3.5mm-sized problem it's creating. One way of handling it would be to bundle the iPhone 7 with Lightning EarPods, and a new video gives us our first glimpse at what those might look like. DON’T MISS: The only bad cell company is Sprint The Lightning EarPods have been spotted in pictures in the past, and they looked like what you’d expect from Apple. Of course, such products could easily be counterfeited in China by companies looking to make money on this particular iPhone 7 rumor. YouTube channel MobileFunTV got its hands on what seem to be Lightning EarPods, which appear to have the same overall design that you’d expect from a pair of EarPods. The only difference between the ones available in stores and found in iPhone boxes and this unofficial pair is the connector. As you’ll see in the video below, the Lightning EarPods do work as expected. You just plug them in, and they deliver the audio experience you expect. However, there are no other details about this product at this time. Assuming they’re the real thing, and they certainly look the part, we’ll see them in iPhone 7 boxes this fall. But if that’s the case, does that mean Apple will sell its rumored Bluetooth headphones as standalone products? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3pZcMCwxvo Trending right now: Ultimate Pokemon Go cheat lets you walk anywhere in the game without moving an inch The world’s largest torrent search site has shut down The only bad cell company is Sprint See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next A laser pointer from the stands helped the Oakland Raiders beat the Texans BGR News iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech Donald Trump’s advisors are lying to him Quartz T-Mobile has some of the best Black Friday deals we’ve seen BGR News Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo News Network

Know Your Mobile 05/08/2016 Michael Grothaus © knowyourmobile.com Samsung Galaxy Note 7 vs. iPhone 7 Plus: Can Apple Take Down Samsung's Phablet? No you didn’t jump six weeks into the future–and we haven’t lost the plot. But you did read that headline right. In this article we’re going to look at how the newly announced Samsung Galaxy Note 7 compares to this year’s upcoming iPhone 7 Plus: two phones that will be the behemoths, both physically and metaphorically, of the smartphone market. Why? Just for kicks, mainly. But also because though the official specs for the iPhone 7 Plus won’t be released until next month, rumors have been steady, so we have a pretty good idea of what it will be like. But please do keep in mind that this VS is just hypothetical right now based on the best rumors of the iPhone 7 Plus that are available. Obviously we can’t predict the future, so it’s possible Apple could add or subtract to/from the features of the iPhone 7 Plus. So without further ado, let's gaze into our crystal ball to see how the current Galaxy Note 7 will compare with this year’s rumored iPhone 7 Plus, starting with the specs: Samsung Galaxy Note 7 vs Rumored iPhone 7 Plus: Major Specs Samsung Galaxy Note 7Display: 5.7in, 2560x1440 pixel QHD, 518 ppi, Corning Gorilla Glass 5Storage: 64GB + expansion via MicrosSD for another 256GBCPU: Samsung Exynos Octa 8890 (64-bit); Quad-Core 2.3GHz Exynos M1 "Mongoose" + Quad-Core 1.6GHz ARM Cortex-A53RAM: 4GBFront Camera: 5MPRear Camera: 12MP with OISOther: S-Pen Capacitive Stylus, IP68 Water And Dust Proofing, Fingerprint Scanner, Iris Scanner Likely iPhone 7 PlusDisplay: 5.5in with a QHD display of 2560 x 1440 resolution, Corning Gorilla Glass 5Storage: 32, 128, and 256GBCPU: A10 processorRAM: 3GBFront Camera: 5MP with wide angle lensRear Camera: Dual lens 12MP, OISOther: Smart Connector, Waterproof, Fingerprint Scanner, 3D Touch As far as specs go you can expect the iPhone 7 Plus to see a new A10 processor and M10 motion-coprocessor. They’ll no doubt be an improvement over the A9/M9 found in the current iPhone 6s Plus, but by how much, who knows? If you go by averages, you can expect about a 20% speed bump from the processor. How that compares to the blazing fast processors found in the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is yet to be seen. It’s likely that the iPhone 7 Plus will boast 3GB of RAM, though Apple doesn’t like making RAM upgrades every year. However, because of the lack of major design changes expected to the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple’s going to have to add some pretty good internal changes to get people to upgrade. 3GB of RAM could do the trick. Still, if Apple does bump the RAM up to 3GB, it will still be 25% less than the 4GB found in the Galaxy Note 7. As for storage options, with the iPhone 7 Plus we finally expect Apple to drop the 16GB entry level option for a 32GB entry level model. But what’s really interesting is the iPhone 7 could feature up to 256GB of storage space. If Apple keeps with its current 3-tier storage offerings, that means the iPhone 7 could come in 32, 128, and 256GB models. The Note 7 only comes with a standard 64GB storage built in, but it does offer a MicroSD card slot that not takes up to 256GB of storage. If you’re the person who likes to expand their storage at will, the Note 7 is the winner here. Samsung Galaxy Note 7 vs Rumored iPhone 7 Plus: Other features Perhaps one of the biggest “other” features of the iPhone 7 Plus could be that it may gain a new port: the Smart Connector. Currently this Smart Connector is found on the iPad Pro like and allows smart accessories like keyboards to be attached. It’s possible Apple may be planning a mini-keyboard accessory for the iPhone 7 Plus. This Smart Connector would set it apart from the Note 7 for power users. However, the Note 7 offers something the iPhone 7 Plus won’t: iris scaring for secure biometric login. Both phones feature fingerprint readers and will feature waterproofing. Samsung Galaxy Note 7 vs Rumored iPhone 7 Plus: Displays The iPhone 7 Plus is expected to come in 5.5in with a QHD display of 2560 x 1440 resolution and a Corning Gorilla Glass 5 screen. Note that that is almost the exact same as the Note 7. The difference here between the displays is two thing: the Note 7 is 0.2in larger at 5.7in and the iPhone 7 Plus will have a 3D Touch display. Samsung Galaxy Note 7 vs Rumored iPhone 7 Plus: Cameras The iPhone 7 Plus is expected to retain its current 5MP front camera and 12MP rear camera, which matches the cameras on the Note 7. The rear camera of each device will also support optical image stabilization. All same so far, right? Well hold tight because the iPhone 7 Plus is expected to get one major camera upgrade the Note 7 doesn’t have: a dual lens rear camera. This would mean there would be TWO 12MP cameras on the back of the iPhone which will take insanely detailed pics. Samsung Galaxy Note 7 vs Rumored iPhone 7 Plus: Verdict From a spec standpoint, the Note 7 wins when it comes to internals, with 4GB of RAM and expandable storage. However, in the camera department, the iPhone 7 Plus will clearly win with its dual lens camera. So which should you buy? Only you can decide that, but specs aside, the most likely one you will choose will be determined by if you prefer iOS or Android.

Speaking at the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas, Ivan Krstic, Apple’s head of security engineering and architecture, outlined the new security program, which launches in September. Citing “the increasing difficulty to find its most critical security issues,” Krstic says the added help from the white-hat hacking community is important to find flaws as Apple’s iOS security mechanisms are getting strong with the release of iOS 10. “We have had great help from the researcher community in improving iOS security,” Krstic said at the event. “We want to reward the researchers who find a flaw and come to us.” Initially, Apple will be inviting a few dozen select researchers to participate, but Krstic says the company would reward and welcome any hacker into the program who brings the company a found-vulnerability. Bug-bounty payments include: $25,000 for finding access from a sandboxed process to user data outside of that sandbox; $50,000 for unauthorized access to iCloud account data on Apple Servers or execution of arbitrary code with kernel privileges; $100,000 for extraction of confidential material protected by the Secure Enclave Processor; and $200,000 for vulnerabilities found in the secure boot firmware. In April, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation reportedly paid nearly $1 million to hackers to find vulnerabilities and extract information from the iPhone of a terrorist based in San Bernardino, California. Apple reportedly requested knowledge of that vulnerability, found in all iOS 9 phones, from the FBI. In combination with the bug bounty program, Apple also released an update to its current software, iOS 9.3.4, aimed at blocking the latest Pangu jailbreak access. The bulk of Krstic’s talk at Black Hat, an event at which Apple rarely presents, was dedicated to outlining the technical details of three distinct new security mechanisms in the forthcoming iOS 10 release for its products, including its new iCloud Keychain. The new cryptographic designs and architecture aim to make it easier and more secure to synchronize data between Apple devices, without potentially exposing information to Apple or any outside party, and also allowing for the recovery of data in case of loss. Krstic also outlined the hardening of the company’s JIT (Just In Time) programming, where Apple will essentially take the JIT in memory and create two virtual mappings, one that is writable and one executable. The writable memory will be randomly located, making it more difficult for the computing device to be hacked and have code rewritten. Ivan Krstic, head of security, Apple (Photo Credit: Richard C.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, Aug 06, 2016 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Apple to begin offering bug bounties SAFETY FIRST:Nearly every Silicon Valley company has been rewarding hackers for turning over bugs, an incentive to keep flaws from being exploited by third parties NY Times News Service, LAS VEGAS Apple Inc, which has been criticized in recent years for failing to pay outside hackers who report bugs in its products, on Thursday said that it would begin offering a bug bounty to technologists who alert the company to flaws. At the Black Hat hacking conference, Apple announced a list of vulnerabilities that would command big bounties, including US$25,000 for ways around Apple’s digital compartments and into its customers’ data, US$50,000 for bugs that give hackers a way into iCloud data and US$200,000 to turn over critical vulnerabilities in Apple’s firmware — the software that lies closest to the bare metal of the machine. The firm said that if hackers donated their rewards to charity, it would match their donation. “We want to reward the people, and frankly the creativity it takes to find bugs in these categories,” said Ivan Krstic, Apple’s head of security engineering and architecture. Over the past six years, nearly every company in Silicon Valley has been rewarding hackers who turn over bugs — a term for flaws that can make a product vulnerable to intrusion — in their systems, with cash. The hope is that the money will be an incentive to keep those flaws out of the hands of organized groups or spy agencies willing to pay big money to learn about them. However, Apple had stayed away from the practice. Instead, it had credited anyone who turned over bugs by putting their names on its Web site — a far cry from the tens of thousands of dollars, and in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars, companies like Google and Facebook Inc were willing to pay. The lack of an Apple bug bounty program made headlines this year when the US FBI announced that it had paid hackers more than US$1 million for a back door into Apple’s iPhone. The annual Black Hat conference, now in its 19th year, is a gathering place for all sorts of experts on computer security, including hackers, tech industry executives and government officials. Dan Kaminsky, a respected security researcher, said in a keynote speech that the industry was falling far short of expectations. “We made promises in technology, and people are starting not to believe them,” Kaminsky told the audience. “Everybody looks busy, but the house still burns.” He argued for a cybersecurity equivalent of the US’ National Institutes of Health or a Manhattan Project to fund research.

Friday, August 5, 2016 · 11:46 am · 52 Comments “According to those who track such things, actual Apple Pay usage on a per user basis has fallen, despite a few hundred million Apple devices which can use the system, and adoption by retailers seems to have slowed as well,” Dave Farrington writes for NoodleMac. “What’s going on? Why isn’t Apple Pay being used more by those who have it installed, setup, tried it, and like it?” “We’re still in the early days of Apple Pay and anyone who expected massive overnight adoption does not understand much about technology, systems, or human beings. It took years for the iPhone and iPod to become hit products,” Farrington writes. “People are creatures of habit so getting us to change our daily procedures and methods remains a challenge not only for Apple, but for retailers.” “Apple has the wherewithal– financial and customer base- to provide an incentive for customers to use Apple Play more frequently, and definitely needs an incentive to get retailers to adopt Apple Pay to help avoid the problem with ‘chicken and egg’ syndrome,” Farrington writes. “Points? Rebates? Credit for iTunes? Whatever Apple comes up with, whether in concert with credit cards and banks, or retailers, needs to be designed to help me decide to use Apple Pay more frequently. Credit card banks do this all the time with mileage and rebates. They are incentives to use a specific car a specific way. Apple Pay needs the same thing.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Imagine at the special media event to introduce the next-gen iPhone next month, Apple CEO Tim Cook says something like this: And, of course, the new iPhone works with Apple Pay and, starting today, for every $100 you spend using Apple Pay, you get $1 off at Apple retail and online stores. So, spend $100 on groceries using Apple Pay, you get $1. Spend $300 on a plane ticket using the Delta app, you get $3. Use Apple Pay in your ExxonMobil Speedpass+ app to buy your gas. It all adds up! By the end of the year, you’ll likely have quite a discount on your next iPad, Mac, or iPhone! Would you use Apple Pay more if Tim Cook said something like that? We know we certainly would. As we wrote nearly one year ago to the day: Apple, give us a reason to use Apple Pay beyond looking like tech dorks in front of the line at the register. What’s the incentive to use Apple Pay? There is none besides looking like a flaming nerd. As if Apple doesn’t have any money. That, inexplicably, is how they approach Apple Pay. Hello, Tim? Eddy? Talk to some people who actually go to stores and shop for things, please. Incentivize its use! Give Apple Pay users a percentage of every dollar spent via Apple Pay to spend at Apple Stores. Something. Anything! Get people used to using it first. Sheesh. It’s really not that difficult. It really isn’t. And, BTW: That was written before Apple Watch made the process so seamless that nobody in line (or the cashier, half the time) even notices how or that we paid, but we still think Apple should take some of tiny portion of their cash mountain and put it to good use incentivizing (and training) their customers to use Apple Pay.

Apple needs to do more education of retailers. argelius123 Friday, August 5, 2016 - 11:59 am · Reply Took the words out of my mouth. I love using ApplePay, but Trader Joe’s is about the only place I frequent that accepts it. Paul Friday, August 5, 2016 - 12:19 pm · Reply Here in Canada we got it about a year later than the US because of our stupid banks. Now it is everywhere!!!! I don’t even ASK if they use Apple pay. All I say is, “TAP please”. Then just tap it with my watch or phone. Now I have harder time finding some one who does NOT accept it than someone who does. The US must be even better….right? mossman Friday, August 5, 2016 - 2:34 pm · Reply Restaurants even in Canada still typically don’t allow tap, or if they do I don’t know it’s an option because the tap option comes up long after I or the server have already inserted my chip card into the machine. I have no idea why the tip option only seems to come up *after* checking that a card is in, since you still need to enter the PIN *after* entering the tip. Maybe it’s just how the servers are trained and we don’t actually need to insert the card first. ottawamark Friday, August 5, 2016 - 3:16 pm · Reply Almost every place I go takes tapping in Canada so I have my phone out right away too. Oddly Canada has long been ahead of US when it comes to debit payments. I remember 15 years I was shocked how few places in US even had them yet. pete2015pete Friday, August 5, 2016 - 10:35 pm · Reply Same in SIngapore – now just integrate loyalty cards! Me In LA Friday, August 5, 2016 - 12:19 pm · Reply Exactly! Most of them have tape over the d@mn “chip” readers too. Blithering idiots run these places. Apple Pay is great. foretravelblog Friday, August 5, 2016 - 12:39 pm · Reply I use it when I can, which is not that often. Most of my regular retailers don’t accept. And for some loony reason, they need me to sign my signature too??? breeze Friday, August 5, 2016 - 7:42 pm · Reply Also the places that do accept it, like supermarkets car washes and many retailers, insist on making you sign the printout.. They say their vendors make them do that and they don’t unnderstand it because they are just following instructions… Many retailers get their NFC terminals from vending terminal machine companies, who apparently require vendors to get signatures, which negates the entire convenience of Apple Pay. Apple needs to get on this stupid phenomenon immediately. 💥💥💥 mxnt41 Friday, August 5, 2016 - 11:52 am · Reply Honestly what does everybody expect? Apple is never going to be making fortunes from it other than the pure volume might add up to something. Ultimately people aren’t likely to be spending any more or less than they were before, we weren’t not spending money because credit cards were complicated or anything. Sparkles Friday, August 5, 2016 - 12:09 pm · Reply “Apple is never going to be making fortunes from it other than the pure volume might add up to something.” That’s what people first thought about the App Store. Me In LA Friday, August 5, 2016 - 12:21 pm · Reply Yup, only $5oB last time I read – to dev’s! mxnt41 Friday, August 5, 2016 - 2:55 pm · Reply They’re not making 30% on each transaction though are they? They never will make such margins. It’s going to be fractions of a percent. That might all add up, but it’s not going to be a high margin money earner. I’m a fan of Apple Pay, but it’s just another service to make the Apple ecosystem more attractive. If it pays for itself that’s a success. CPS Friday, August 5, 2016 - 11:54 am · Reply I’ve found very few places where the employees both know Apple Pay is accepted AND how it actually works. It shouldn’t be up to informed customers to train a store’s employees how their payment system works and that is where the bottleneck is. Apple would be wise to work with retailers to better train their staffs, provide MUCH better signage and all around awareness for Apple Pay. I don’t need cash back or other incentives, I just want Apple Pay to be ubiquitous for it to become my main source of payment. Me In LA Friday, August 5, 2016 - 12:22 pm · Reply It’s what you get for $9/hr help. Not bad people, but I guess nobody is going to go the extra mile at that rate… kevinh Friday, August 5, 2016 - 11:54 am · Reply We need Apple pay on the web. I buy groceries with Apple Pay. I buy expensive items on the web (Amazon) and can’t use Apple Pay. bbock Saturday, August 6, 2016 - 4:26 am · Reply That’s coming this fall. Friend of Apple Pay Friday, August 5, 2016 - 11:57 am · Reply I think people are missing the biggest thing “wrong” with Apple Pay. It is not lack of ease of use, it is not looking like a nerd, it is simply that Apple Pay is not accepted everywhere the vast majority of people shop. I shop for groceries at Publix, no Apple Pay. I shop a lot at Target, no Apple Pay. I shop a lot at Costco, no Apple Pay. I begrudgingly go to Walmart when it is most convenient for me, no Apple Pay (and yes Walmart Pay is a turd). The places I do shop where Apple Pay is accepted, I only use it. For example, I go to Walgreens for my pharmacy needs and have not used a credit or debit card there since they began using Apple Pay. I don’t even take my wallet in there. So when it becomes more widely accepted at the most common places I shop, I will use it exclusively! Jeff Saturday, August 6, 2016 - 10:32 am · Reply Costco in Canada takes Apple Pay in the store but not at the Gas Pump, even though they take tap at the pump. I use Apple Pay almost all the time and I try to use it all the time. My biggest issue is when I do use it I still have to take out my wallet to get my loyalty club (IE Air Miles) points this could be fixed. Bryan Blumberg Friday, August 5, 2016 - 12:00 pm · Reply I USE ApplePay wherever it is accepted: Trader Joes, Albertson’s Super Market, Super King Super Market and Staples. However, I still CANNOT use it at Costco or the other large Super Market in my area, Vons. emmayche Friday, August 5, 2016 - 1:36 pm · Reply Vons and Albertsons are owned by the same company, btw, yet one accepts ApplePay and one does not. Weird. JWW Friday, August 5, 2016 - 12:10 pm · Reply Change like this takes time. Just because the technology works doesn’t mean people and businesses are going to move to adopt it immediately. The whole system has to change and that takes a long time. (Look up Cultural Lag Theory) Now, having said that, I would like to note that the fingerprint recognition system on my iPhone SE doesn’t work. It works for about a day or two after I set it and then it stops recognizing my prints a few days later. I put in both thumb prints and both index fingers and after about two days it stops recognizing them. I’ve repeated the process of entering new prints three or four times. The phone is in a clean environment and my fingers are always clean and grease free. I’ve given up on this, hoping that it will work on my next iPhone. My wife’s 6s just started having the same problem after having worked flawlessly for her for about three or four months. It’s little things like this that slow down the adoption of new ways of paying for things. Do I really want to try Apple Pay at my local McDonalds and end up looking like a goofball who doesn’t know how his phone works when it’s nearly as easy just using my debt card, and a whole lot less likely to invite the stares and derision of the people standing behind you in line? I’m going to wait for my next iPhone before giving Apple Pay a real go. Same with Siri. I want both technologies and think they are cool, but I’m going to hold off using them on a regular basis for another 6-12 months. emmayche Friday, August 5, 2016 - 1:38 pm · Reply The fingerprint problem sounds like a warranty issue. Have you brought your iPhones into an Apple Store to be checked out? keithrt49 Friday, August 5, 2016 - 12:12 pm · Reply People don’t use it because it’s improperly implemented in most places that claim to accept it. It’s supposed to be “beep” and go, but many businesses use it merely as a card reader and still require a signature or a PIN number entry. The only business I’ve encountered that implements Apple Pay the way Apple intended it is McDonalds. foretravelblog Friday, August 5, 2016 - 12:42 pm · Reply Exactly. I can use it at Rite Aid, but only at the front registers, not at the pharmacy, and after the beep I still need to sign my signature. Why? Phillip Butler Friday, August 5, 2016 - 2:23 pm · Reply Advanced auto parts uses it correctly lambrettamike Friday, August 5, 2016 - 12:16 pm · Reply Purely a US centric issue; nothing has changed in the US for many decades when it comes to payment infrastructure, which is still woefully behind the rest of the developed world. Pay is going great elsewhere, where retailers have point of sale contactless terminals for many years and Pay just happens along with other contactless cards. The BIG DIFFERENCE is that Pay offers much better security with Touch ID!! ramiuseng Friday, August 5, 2016 - 12:22 pm · Reply My issue is that I always have to enter some kind of code or such for Apple Pay to work on my phone. That pisses me off to no end. The idea is that authentication should be discrete so nobody can jot down what I am typing. Phillip Butler Friday, August 5, 2016 - 2:25 pm · Reply Why don’t you have your thumbprint activated? pbiphoto Friday, August 5, 2016 - 12:22 pm · Reply Re MDN take: You guys may insist on getting paid to use a more secure payment method that swiping a card. I don’t care whether or not Apple starts giving users incentives for using Apple Pay. I want to see incentives for RETAILERS TO ACCEPT Apple Pay! For any category of store, if one accepts Apple Pay it gets ALL my business in that category. But there are no big box or home building stores that accept Apple Pay, so I can’t use it more when I need to shop for things they sell. For me, the only way to get me to use Apple Pay more is to make more retailers accept it, because I use nothing but Apple Pay at any place which accepts it. Come on Apple, apply some pain to stores which refuse to accept Apple Pay. If a store such as Costco refuses to accept Apple Pay, they shouldn’t be allowed to profit from selling Apple products! Or give a discount for a defined period of time to any chain which starts accepting Apple Pay.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Andrea Peterson August 5 Follow @kansasalps Researchers who find major flaws in Apple products could now get a major payday from the company. (Gabrielle Lurie/AFP/Getty Images) Apple will finally start paying cash rewards to researchers who find security problems in their products, the company announced at the BlackHat cybersecurity conference in Las Vegas on Thursday. But the news left some experts wondering why Apple was so late to the party. So-called bug bounty programs are standard among most tech giants. They can help consumers by encouraging independent researchers to help companies fix security flaws. When a researcher finds a legitimate problem, rewards can range all the way up to the six figures. But Apple historically had a different approach — offering a tip line where people could report security problems but not handing out any reward other than putting the researcher's name on a thank you page on its website. [Facebook pays 10-year-old Finnish genius $10,000 for exposing flaw in Instagram] "It was kind of an insult," said Matthew Green, a computer science professor at Johns Hopkins University who has alerted Apple about security problems in its products and didn't know why it took them so long to launch a bounty program. "Maybe after San Bernardino they felt there was some pressure to acknowledge that it wasn't enough to give people a pat on the back, even if they can't pay enough to compete with the free market," he said. Earlier this year, Apple faced criticism over its lack of a bug bounty program when the FBI paid an unknown entity more than $1 million for help breaking into an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino, Calif., shooters. Without a bug bounty program, some argued, the only way researchers could make money from finding bugs in Apple products was by selling them off to the highest bidder — in this case, the FBI. But Apple now has a chance "to compete for the type of exploits available and control how they'll be used," said Jeff Pollard, principal analyst focused on IT security at Forrester Research. [Fiat Chrysler will pay you $1,500 if you can do this one thing to its cars] Apple's new rewards program will launch in September, but it won't be open to anyone. It will be invite-only — at least in the beginning. Researchers who approach the company with a major problem also will be invited to join. The program will only reward researchers for finding a few categories of problems. The biggest payouts will be for bugs affecting software built into components that help Apple's devices start up securely. Researchers who find one of those could get up to $200,000. That makes Apple's bug bounty program one of the most lucrative out there. Google's similar program, which launched in 2010, upped its largest bounty — for breaking the security of its Chromebooks — to $100,000 in  March. Microsoft's largest per bug payout is also $100,000. Apple's big rewards may persuade researchers to turn to the company when they find a problem, rather than sell the information on the open market — where vulnerabilities might be used for criminal or state-sponsored hacks. But even with Apple's hefty new payouts, other places may still pay a better premium for ways to hack into the company's products. Last year, Zerodium, a company that deals in buying zero-day vulnerabilities from researchers and selling them to large corporations and government agencies, said it paid $1 million to researchers who were able to remotely hack into the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS. The company doesn't offer the same massive payouts for problems in other products. "No software other than iOS really deserves such a high bug bounty," Zerodium founder Chaouki Bekrar told The Washington Post last year, citing Apple's strong security built into its products. Apple's longstanding reputation for focusing tight security may be one reason the company held out against an official bug bounty program so long, even as other sectors like the automotive industry, airlines and the Department of Defense started to get in on the game. But the rise of Apple Pay may be another factor, along with San Bernardino, that pushed the company to be more aggressive about getting help from the larger security community, JHU's Green said. "They really need to know that system is secure" because there's actual money at risk, Green said. "I think a lot of researchers would rather hand vulnerabilities over to Apple than to someone who is going to use it to steal people's payment information." business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

Are these the official Apple iPhone 7 Lightning earphones? by Jon Mundy 05 August 2016 0 shares Read Comments We may have just witnessed the most convincing piece of evidence yet that Apple intends to drop support for the old 3.5mm headphone jack. Rumour is rife that the iPhone 7 is set to ditch the traditional 3.5mm headphone jack in favour of wireless and Lightning-based alternatives. It was looking extremely likely before, but a fresh piece of evidence seems to seal it. Related: Best headphones 2016 Online mobile phone seller MobileFun dropped us a line to draw attention to this little video. The retailer has gotten its hands on what it believes to be the official Apple Lightning Earphones that will ship with the iPhone 7. As you can see see, they look much like the standard Apple EarPods that have shipped with new iPhones since 2012 - except for one notable difference. Instead of a 3.5mm connector, you get one of Apple's proprietary Lightning connectors. The benefits of this have been much discussed, but in a nutshell, they mean you'll be able to get true lossless digital sound, and things like noise cancellation will be possible on the device rather than offloading it to the headphones themselves. The video also shows how an early example of a third party iPhone 7 case, with the shape and size of the Lightning port cut-out, appears to confirm that these earphones are the real deal. iPhone 7 - Everything we know What do you think about Apple's plans to ditch the 3.5mm jack?

However, the link shown takes you to Apple’s support website, where more information about the nature of the update is revealed. (Screenshot) The reference to ‘Team Pangu’ is a big giveaway. This is the name of the China-based team of jailbreakers who found a flaw in iOS 9 that enabled them to open up the software – something Apple is not a fan of. By naming Pangu in their support information on the update, Apple gave insight into why the update was being pushed out, as well as taking a swipe at the group at the same time. (Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP) Providing there are no more major bugs, this is likely to be the last update before the launch of iOS 10 in September, with a brand new iPhone expected to follow in the same month.

And readers report the same text appearing in Polish and Hungarian. Czech language support for Siri has been spotted in the latest macOS Sierra beta, hinting Apple may be planning on adding additional languages to the virtual assistant in the near future. Czech language blog muj-ipad.cz posted the above and below images of Siri speaking Czech as shared by developers using the latest beta release of macOS. Apple released macOS 10.12 Sierra beta 4 for developers earlier this week as well as public beta 3 for other testers a day later. Back in January of 2015, text strings spotted in an iOS 8 release hinted Czech, Slovak, and Polish language support were in development for Siri, all three of which have yet to make an official appearance. Apple currently keeps a full list of countries where Siri is supported on its website for iOS 9. In macOS Sierra, Apple lists support for the following languages with various localized dialect options available for many: Arabic, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, and Turkish. Sierra brings Siri to the Mac for the first time as a standout feature of the release and Apple is also launching a new Siri SDK to let third-party developers tap into the voice assistant alongside iOS 10. We previously took a look at the new Siri features in Sierra in our video hands-on with the beta, and we also showed you how to enable hands-free ‘Hey Siri’ commands. Apple is expected to release macOS Sierra to all users this fall, likely sometime in September to accompany iOS 10 and new iPhones.  Images via Jan Pilar Guides macOS Sierra View THe Guide Siri View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

These bounties are common with large tech companies, but Apple has held out. An attendee looks at a monitor during the 2016 Black Hat cyber-security conference in Las Vegas. Apple is enlisting programmers in developing better security for its products.  (DAVID BECKER / REUTERS)   By Elizabeth WeiseUSA Today Fri., Aug. 5, 2016 LAS VEGAS—Apple announced its first-ever bug-bounty program Thursday; the company is offering computer security researchers up to $200,000 for each software bug they find that makes Apple products less secure. The offer was presented at Black Hat, a large computer security conference, where the audience burst into applause when Ivan Krstic, head of Apple Security Engineering and Architecture, flashed a slide with the announcement on the screen. So-called bug bounties are common with large tech companies, but Apple has been one of the rare companies that doesn’t offer them. The announcement comes just four months after Apple engaged in a very public and acrimonious struggle with the FBI over the agency’s demand that it aid the company in its attempts to get into the iPhone 5 used by San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook. The FBI case was withdrawn Mar. 28 when the agency announced it had paid an outsider $1 million to gain access to the phone. Article Continued Below Krstic would not comment on whether there is a link behind Apple finally offering a bug bounty and the FBI case. “I’m an engineer. I’m happy to answer technical questions about what I’ve covered today,” he said to laughter from the nearly-full ballroom where the presentation was held. The bounty program will begin Sept. 1 and offers payments of $50,000 to $200,000 depending on the severity of the bug discovered. “The feedback we’ve been hearing pretty consistently for some time now is the difficulty of finding these vulnerabilities has been going up and up,” Krstic said. “The difficulty of finding these now is (such) that we want to reward the people who spend the time and effort and frankly, (the) creativity, finding these vulnerabilities.” Read more about: Apple The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

The maker of iPhones and iPads unveiled the plan, which includes some of the biggest bounties offered to date,  at the Black Hat cyber security conference in Las Vegas. The program will initially be limited to about two dozen researchers who Apple will invite to help identify hard-to-uncover security bugs in five specific categories. The maker of iPhones and iPads unveiled the plan, which includes some of the biggest bounties offered to date, at the Black Hat cyber security conference in Las Vegas. Those researchers have been chosen from the group of experts who have previously helped Apple identify bugs, but have not been compensated for that work, the company said. The most lucrative category, which offers rewards of up to $200,000, is for bugs in Apple's 'secure boot' firmware for preventing unauthorized programs from launching when an iOS device is powered up.

Those companies said that if they were to do it again, they would start by inviting a small list of researchers to join, then gradually open it up over time, according to Apple. Security analyst Rich Mogull said that limiting participation would save Apple from dealing with a deluge of 'low-value' bug reports. 'Fully open programs can definitely take a lot of resources to manage,' he said. Apple declined to say which firms provided advice. Apple said it decided to limit the scope of the program at the advice of other companies that have previously launched bounty programs. Such rewards are currently offered by dozens of firms, including AT&T Inc, Facebook Inc, Google, Microsoft Corp, Tesla Motors Inc and Yahoo Inc . Microsoft, which has handed out $1.5 million in rewards to security researchers since it launched its program three years ago, also offers rewards for identifying very specific types of bugs. Its two biggest payouts have been for $100,000 each. Not all bounty programs are as focused as the ones from Apple and Microsoft. Facebook, for example, has an open program that offers rewards for a wide-range of vulnerabilities. It has paid out more than $4 million over the past five years, with last year's average payment at $1,780. In March, Facebook paid $10,000 to a 10-year-old boy in Finland who found a way to delete user comments from Instagram accounts.

'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart. The end of wonky wifi: Google's OnHub It's incredibly simple to set up, and we found it tripled the speed of our home wifi connection - but at $199 is expensive..

By Véronique Hyland Share Facebook iconShare Twitter iconTweet Google Plus iconShare Email iconEmail Comment iconComment Print icon Print Alexander Wang; Nicolas Ghesquière; Alber ElbazPhoto: Getty Images, BFA For once, fashion is getting involved in technology in a way that doesn’t involve a neon-plastic wearable device. The Business of Fashion reports today that several prominent fashion designers — Alexander Wang, Nicolas Ghesquière, Alber Elbaz, Calvin Klein, and Dries Van Noten — have signed an amicus, or “friend of the court,” brief in Apple’s ongoing case against Samsung. They, along with a roster of designers in other fields — like creative director Fabien Baron and architect Sir Norman Foster — have gotten involved because of the intellectual-property issues raised by the lawsuit. The contretemps began in 2012, when a judge ruled that Samsung’s phone design looked too close to the iPhone for comfort. Samsung appealed, and four years later, the battle is headed to the Supreme Court in October — which might explain why all these big names are coming to Apple’s defense. (According to BoF, “Neither Apple nor any other corporation has funded the brief”; however, some of the amici note in the brief that they’ve consulted for the companies involved. Wang, for example, has worked on projects with both Apple and Samsung.) Given that Wang, Ghesquière, & Co. are knocked off so regularly, they have an interest in enforcing design-patent law. And fashion design, in particular, is a notoriously challenging field in which to prove intellectual-property violations. What happens this fall, between Apple v. Samsung and in the upcoming Supreme Court case about design infringement of cheerleader uniforms, could change a lot about the way design knockoffs are legally viewed. In other words, there’s more riding on this than just the design of a phone.

The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission today approved Apple to begin selling excess energy generated from its solar farms in Nevada, Arizona, and California. Federal energy regulators on Thursday approved Apple’s application to start selling solar power at market rates… The tech company owns generation capacity of 20 megawatts in Nevada, 50 megawatts in Arizona and 130 megawatts in California. The latter output – enough to power tens of thousands of homes – will come from Apple’s $850 million partnership with sun-farm firm First Solar, at the California Flats solar project in southeast Monterey County. However, Apple is still awaiting approval on selling excess energy from its new Campus 2 in Cupertino. Planned to become the company’s headquarters next year, the 176-acre campus will be run on 100% renewable energy.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     See What Is New In IOS Beta 4 Posted: Aug 5 2016, 7:56am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, Updated: Aug 8 2016, 9:24pm CDT, in News | Apple     Apple recently released a new update for its iOS 10 beta. The iOS 10 beta 4 has seen some minor tweaks and has gained a lot of popularity with developers and the common public alike. Here is a quick look at all the changes. Don't Miss: Sam's Club Black Friday 2016 Deals Haptic Feedback for Manual Lock Has Been Removed Introduced with the iOS 10 beta 3, the hepatic feedback which is used when an iPhone or iPad was manually locked by pressing the power button has been turned off. It has been removed from the iOS 10 beta 4 for the time being. Although it is possible that it might make its way back in time for the final release this September but at this moment we had to say goodbye to the feature albeit reluctantly. 100 New Emojis Apple who has always been a big fan of emoji’s has introduced 100 new emoji with this new beta release which include new emoji for diversity as well as gender equality. New Keyboard Sound   There is a new keyboard sound which we hope sticks around. Faster Folder Animations   The whole iOS feels a lot faster thanks to folders which open and close al lot more quickly. Control Center Splash Page A new splash page graces the Control Centre now. Wallpapers Wallpapers shouldn’t be at the top of Apple’s priority at the moment but a few iOS wallpapers have been discarded and an old wallpaper from iOS 8 days has made a comeback. Date Widget We don’t have to worry about opening up the colander app to check on what day it is as the date widget has returned to its rightful place within the Notification Centre/Lock screen widget area as first released in beta 1 for iOS 10. Minor UI Tweaks Changes have been made to the Control Centre icon for the Home app in addition to using colored pencils instead of the color grid within Accessibility > Color Filters.    There have been no major changes and in our opinion Apple should spend its time fixing bugs within the iOS 10 instead of adding and removing features.

Close share panel Image copyright Associated Press Image caption In 2015 Apple chief executive Tim Cook said the "time for action is now" on climate change Electronics giant Apple has been granted permission to sell energy generated at its $850m (£645m) solar farm in California. Last year, the tech firm acquired a 2,900-acre power facility in Monterey County, giving it 130 megawatts of solar energy capacity. Now it has the go-ahead to sell that energy into wholesale markets. Apple said renewable energy generated at the site could power 60,000 California homes. "This is not the first time that Apple has invested in substantial quantities of renewable power and solar in particular, but it is a particularly large investment," said Dr Niall Mac Dowell, a lecturer in energy and environmental technology at Imperial College London. "While other forms of renewable power, such as wind, are in general cheaper than solar, the fact that the cost of solar power is decreasing rapidly is also well-known and investments such as this one may help to accelerate this trend, which is also positive." However this sort of power supply still requires backup, Dr Mac Dowell added. "The caveat remains that both solar and wind power are intermittent sources of energy, and one cannot rely on them entirely. "Thus, exactly as Apple is doing, some form of backup power is required. In the energy system as it currently stands, this back-up is largely provided by fossil fuel combustion in thermal power plants." 'A positive step' On Thursday, energy officials in Washington DC said Apple could sell its power at market-based rates. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also noted that Apple owns a similar 20-megawatt facility in Nevada, as well as a 50-megawatt facility in Arizona. Last year, Apple said the Monterey County site could supply enough electricity to power all its stores, offices, headquarters and a data centre. James Court, the head of policy at the Renewable Energy Association, described Apple's investment as "a hugely positive step". He told the BBC: "A decent-sized gas power station can produce between 200 and 400 megawatts, so Apple's capacity is sizeable." Apple's $850m investment in the Monterey County facility was announced last year as part of the corporation's bid to reduce its carbon footprint. Other major tech firms have investments in renewable energy. In June last year, Google purchased 236 megawatts of energy capacity from two wind farms in Sweden and Norway. Then in February, Microsoft announced it was experimenting with underwater data centres to reduce the energy consumed when cooling the facility. Mr Court expects energy self-sufficiency will become more commonplace across businesses in the future. "One of the growth areas in the UK is going to be companies self-supplying though solar power. I think we're seeing a rise of self-supplying already," he said. The US owns 11% of the global solar power market, according to industry body SolarPower Europe. That's about three times as much as the UK's share (4%), and not too far off from the leading country China (19%). Correction: A quotation that suggested the UK gets 0% of its energy from solar power, which appeared in the first version of this story, has been removed.

Today, MobileFun posted a video of a working pair of Lightning EarPods, and the overall look of the accessory appears more in line with Apple's design than any of the previous leaks. As is expected, the headphone part of the new EarPods is structured the same as the EarPods currently being sold by Apple, with a clean, white design, right and left markers on each earpiece, and in-line volume and play/pause controls. Interestingly, the in-line controls are placed farther down on the EarPods, directly below the right/left split in the cable design. If real, this would mark a design change from the current generation, which places the volume rocker along the right cable, above the bifurcation in the cord. The most notable part is, of course, the long-rumored addition of the Lightning plug onto the EarPods, adapted to take advantage of the removal of the 3.5 mm headphone jack from the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The plug on the Lightning-enabled EarPods appears slightly bigger than Apple's traditional Lightning adapters thanks to the inclusion of a digital-to-analog converter needed for music playback and not just straightforward charging. In the video, the EarPods are proven to be completely functional through the playing of a few songs as well as using the in-line controls to play, pause, and skip some tracks. MobileFun concluded to its viewers, "as you can see, these are fully working, they aren't just a mock-up of what you might receive," believing that the working headphones will be what Apple sells alongside the new generation of iPhone in September. Multiple solutions for the removal of the 3.5 mm headphone jack have sprouted up over the past few weeks, with one of the most prevailing alternatives centering around a Lightning to 3.5 mm dongle that the company could potentially bundle into the box of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus to cushion the transition for customers. More recently, it was reported that Apple could be working on completely wireless "AirPods" as an option for iPhone users, allowing simultaneous iPhone charging and headphone music playback, which is one of the most commonly occurring grievances surrounding the loss of the 3.5 mm headphone jack. Previous Coverage: Lightning Headphones: Are They Better or Just an Inconvenience? Related Roundup: iPhone 7 Tag: EarPods [ 899 comments ] Top Rated Comments (View all) yesjam 16 weeks ago I've been firmly on the fence about everything we've heard about the iPhone 7. As a musician, I place a fairly high priority on being unencumbered in listening to material on my phone. It is looking like it's increasingly likely that the use of the lightning port for headphones will not be mated to a method of charging by some other non-lightning means. That's simply infuriating to me. And - get this - it's actually a deal breaker. I know, so many talk the talk about abandoning the iPhone, but I am willing to walk the walk. I will wait until the iPhone 7's official announcement before finalizing my decision, but since my contract's expiring this fall, I'm fully anticipating purchasing a Nexus device instead of a new iPhone. Further, the 6P is $0 from my phone provider; I'll save a couple of hundred bucks in the process. In no way does the inconvenience of migrating some of my iCloud information to Google's cloud suite outweigh the inconvenience of not having the 3.5mm headphone jack on my phone. Shame on you, Apple! While you may think the elimination of the 3.5mm jack is innovation or progress, I only see a reversion to the pre-smartphone era of awful proprietary earbuds bundled with flip phones. Except you could charge and listen simultaneously with those. Rating: 76 Votes calzon65 16 weeks ago Bad idea to remove the ubiquitous 3.5mm audio jack that works on laptops, desktops, automobiles, music players, mobile phones, even the in-seat audio connections on airlines. Millions of people have spent good money on high quality headphones and earbuds that use the 3.5mm standard to be left out in the cold. There have been almost a half dozen articles posted over the past few weeks that talk about the rumor of Apple removing the 3.5mm jack. If you look at those articles, the numbers of posts are astounding, more than most other articles, and the vast majority of reader responses are from people angry about the potential removal of the 3.5mm jack. We are not talking about simply upgrading from floppy disks to CDs, from CDs to USB sticks, etc. I know people love to compare removing the 3.5mm jack to eliminating the floppy or CD drives. We are talking about the total elimination of one of the most reliable and useful audio standards that virtually all manufactures embrace. Apple will take this proven and reliable open standard and give us their proprietary standard, and I'm confident no other equipment manufacture will ever embrace Lightning (No I'm not talking about headset manufactures, I'm talking about other desktop, laptop, tablet, phone, automobile, and aircraft manufactures). So Apple does not move us forward, they lock us into a standard they control/own and move us away from the mainstream into a segregated solution that is not even available on their own computer line ... which uses the 3.5mm audio jack. I think Apple's cult like mantra of making their phones thinner and thinner will go too far with the elimination of the 3.5mm jack. Rating: 75 Votes Krizoitz 16 weeks ago If Apple really does ditch the standard audio jack its going to go down as the biggest mistake the company made since the round puck mouse. There is literally no upside to this. I don't need my phone to be one more mm thinner. I need it to have a better battery. Its small enough as is (actually the screens are too big, 4.5" would have been better than 4.7"). *sigh* Rating: 51 Votes magicschoolbus 16 weeks ago So cool! Now i can't charge my phone and listen to headphones at the same time! What a fantastic innovation! Rating: 25 Votes jdillings 16 weeks ago So, is it even possible to charge while listening to music or watching video? Sure it is.....after you buy a $129 hub from Apple to solve the problem they created. Rating: 23 Votes KingOfStuff 16 weeks ago pretty sure you can have lossless audio from any headphone jack... Rating: 22 Votes usersince86 16 weeks ago Apple user since 1986. May move to other lines in 2016. It's been a good 30 year run with you, Apple. If it ends, it's only because of poor decisions likes this. Rating: 22 Votes ThisBougieLife 16 weeks ago pretty sure you can have lossless audio from any headphone jack... Yes, you can. The most expensive audiophile headphones still have 3.5 mm jacks (or bigger), not to mention the MBP's jack has optical out. Who has lossless audio on an iPhone anyway? My lossless audio takes up over 300 GB of space. And what person who uses earbuds as their primary listening device cares about lossless audio? Rating: 22 Votes yesjam 16 weeks ago There are plenty of reasons why this may not be the best idea, but because everyone else is still using 3.5 is not one of them. USB probably wouldn't even exist on our computers now if it weren't for Apple pushing it on us. I think the infuriating thing isn't that Apple is eliminating the headphone jack in itself, it's that the alternative is in no way an advancement on the current standard technology. While it would be total B.S. to say that the introduction of USB C is illegitimate since everyone uses USB 2.0, for example, I have yet to see ANY advantage to eliminating the phone's headphone jack. That's why it's so maddening.

That's the situation thousands of Tesla Motors Inc. (Nasdaq: TSLA) and SolarCity Corp. (Nasdaq: SCTY) investors find themselves in today. Most have no idea what to do next, which is why I want to use the situation as a teaching moment. This isn't the first time two Wall Street titans have been at odds, and it won't be the last time you'll see it as an investor. Don't Miss: Research shows that this number is the key to beating the markets by 10, 20, even 40 to 1. No wonder it's one of Wall Street's best-kept secrets… My goal is to show you how to read between the headlines and identify the winner early on. That way you'll know how to place your money for maximum profits. It comes down to this. No One Ever "Talks Their Own Book" for Somebody Else's Benefit Millions of investors follow legendary traders like billionaire activist Carl Icahn into and out of stocks like Apple, Xerox, and Netflix, believing that doing so is a surefire way to make millions. So why is it that they're not the ones getting rich? Very few investors understand a nasty practice called "talking your own book." If you're just joining us, that's a derogatory term to describe when an insider, an activist investor, or a hedge fund manager makes a statement of opinion on a stock that's a good buy or a solid sell, typically without the express caveat that he or she stands to profit from the public reaction that inevitably follows. For example, activist Carl Icahn bought into Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) at a time when share prices were trading around $463 ($66 split-adjusted), then promptly made a very public case for it being worth $625 a share ($89 split-adjusted). Millions of investors watching the news bought in hook, line, and sinker. Not surprisingly, Apple shares took off 5.8% in a single day and Icahn's holdings jumped a stunning $104.4 million. Or consider Netflix Inc. (Nasdaq: NFLX). On Oct. 31, 2012, Icahn revealed he had a 10% stake in the company… and the stock surged 14% in a single day. He picked up $5.5 million in shares through either options or direct acquisitions, then did the rounds talking up the company's virtues and laughed all the way to the bank as shares soared when individual investors piled in, too. In the old days, you couldn't do this… at least not so directly. Instead you'd make the rounds and try to convince fellow traders or "hedgies" to join your trade based on the merits of your analysis. Or you'd hit up the sell-side analysts – meaning those facing the investing public – for a favorable report. But now, thanks to changes in securities laws and the JOBS Act, specifically, hedge funds can advertise their services to a much broader section of the investing public and issue "research" reports that, not surprisingly, play to supposedly independent thinking, then talk about them in the mainstream media. Illegal, you say… manipulation? Not according to the law. Manipulation is untruthfully talking up your book with the expectation of profit. Simply talking up your research and your opinion involves the truth… more or less. Enter Jim Chanos. Join the conversation.

Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website  −  one  =  6 Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter An Apple stock price prediction of $200 might seem high compared to the analyst consensus of $121.95, but not to Money Morning Chief Investment Strategist Keith Fitz-Gerald. "I think the whiners are out in left field," Fitz-Gerald said on the FOX Business program "Varney & Co." in a July 27 appearance. "They say Apple's got too much cash, Apple doesn't understand its products. I think Apple understands exactly what it's doing and they know exactly where they're going." Fitz-Gerald's Apple stock price prediction puts AAPL at $200 within the next few years, a call he first made in April of last year. Given what the Apple stock price has been doing over the past year, that forecast may seem far-fetched. Even with a post-earnings pop of 7%, Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) shares are flat in 2016 and down about 20% since closing at $132.07 on July 20 of last year. Apple's Q3 earnings, which it reported July 26, beat expectations even though profits were down 27% year over year as a result of slumping iPhone sales. Investors also took heart in Apple's raised guidance for the current quarter as well as a strong showing in the company's services revenue – up 19% from the same quarter a year ago. Services include Apple Pay, the iTunes Store, Apple Music, and iCloud. The marked growth in services is why Fitz-Gerald has such a bullish AAPL stock price prediction. It's a trend he sees as a key Apple strength going forward. What Everyone Gets Wrong About AAPL Stock "Services are where it's at. You've got a billion-something devices out there. That's the point," Fitz-Gerald told program host Stuart Varney. "Everybody thinks about Apple as a device company. It hasn't been a device company for five years…. It's all about what's going to take the ecosphere forward. Apple is going to be an enabler. It's no longer going to be the end game as it was under [late Apple CEO Steve] Jobs." Don't Miss: The Internet of Things revolution will create a $6 trillion market – and these five stocks are the best way to grab a piece of those gains for yourself. It's a compelling case for AAPL stock. For much of the past year Wall Street has done a lot of hand-wringing over flattening iPhone sales and the lack of a new blockbuster Apple device to drive growth. But that obsession with hardware drew attention away from Apple's services growth story. The services segment is already Apple's second-biggest revenue generator. And it has tons of room to grow.

Author: Andy Greenberg. Andy Greenberg Security Date of Publication: 08.05.16. 08.05.16 Time of Publication: 10:47 am. 10:47 am Fake Boarding Pass App Gets Hacker Into Fancy Airline Lounges As the head of Poland’s Computer Emergency Response Team, Przemek Jaroszewski flies 50 to 80 times a year, and so has become something of a connoisseur of airlines’ premium status lounges. (He’s a particular fan of the Turkish Airlines lounge in Istanbul, complete with a cinema, putting green, Turkish bakery and free massages.) So when his gold status was mistakenly rejected last year by an automated boarding pass reader at a lounge in his home airport in Warsaw, he applied his hacker skills to make sure he’d never be locked out of an airline lounge again. The result, which Jaroszewski plans to present Sunday at the Defcon security conference in Las Vegas, is a simple program that he’s now used dozens of times to enter airline lounges all over Europe. It’s an Android app that generates fake QR codes to spoof a boarding pass on his phone’s screen for any name, flight number, destination and class. And based on his experiments with the spoofed QR codes, almost none of the airline lounges he’s tested actually check those details against the airline’s ticketing database—only that the flight number included in the QR code exists. And that security flaw, he says, allows him or anyone else capable of generating a simple QR code to both access exclusive airport lounges and buy things at duty free shops that require proof of international travel, all without even buying a ticket. Boarding pass hacker Przemek Jaroszewski.Andy Greenberg Fake boarding passes are hardly a new hacker trick. Cryptographer Bruce Schneier wrote about the technique to make them back in 2003 and privacy activist Chris Soghoian was investigated by the FBI for creating a website that automatically generated the fake passes. But Jaroszewski’s Defcon talk is intended to point out that even now, a decade later, the boarding pass security issue persists, and in some ways is easier than ever to exploit thanks to airports’ use of automated QR-code readers. “Literally, it takes 10 seconds to create a boarding pass” on a smartphone, says Jaroszewski. “And it doesn’t even have to look legit because you’re not in contact with any humans.” In the video below, Jaroszewski shows how he enters fake credentials into his app—his go-to pseudonym is Bartholomew Simpson—generates a QR code for a boarding pass with them, and uses it to bypass a QR-code-checking gate and enter the Turkish Airlines Istanbul lounge. Jaroszewski admits he hasn’t tested the trick outside of Europe, and he’s not sure how often it would work in American airports, which may sometimes use improved boarding pass authentication systems at lounges. He’s also never used the trick to attempt to fly under a false name, a more serious stunt he says would likely be foiled by more stringent checks at the departure gate. Jaroszewski’s trick doesn’t represent much of a real security risk, either. Anyone who uses it would still have to go through physical security, including metal detectors or millimeter wave scanners, so it would probably not work to enter an airport without a real boarding pass. Its real utility lies simply in accessing elite areas within an airport, not in attacking one or getting onto a plane. WIRED reached out to both the TSA and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) for comment, and both said any such boarding pass security flaw would be the airlines’ issue. “A forged BCBP will not entitle the person carrying it with any right to travel, nor will it create any confusion with an airline’s system where the official information is stored,” cautioned the IATA. A spokeperson for the airline industry group Airlines for America wrote to WIRED in a statement that “airlines are constantly looking at new and emerging technologies designed to enhance the customer experience, while ensuring well-defined security measures and best practices are in place.” In the European airports where Jaroszewski has tried his technique, he says he’s never even used his fake QR codes to access a lounge he didn’t already have the right to access, or to buy duty free goods when he wasn’t traveling internationally; he warns those two actions would likely be illegal. Even so, he’s successfully tested his fake QR codes repeatedly with only a few failures. And he admits he once even used his program to create a QR code for a friend who didn’t share his elite airline status when they had a 7-hour layover in Istanbul, so that both of them could hang out in Turkish Airlines’ swanky lounge. “I just said, I’ll send you the QR code,” Jaroszewski says carefully. “If you want to use it, you use it.” Jaroszewski isn’t publicly releasing his boarding pass QR code spoofing software. He says he’d rather avoid the FBI raid and investigation that followed Chris Soghoian’s release of a similar tool 10 years ago. But he argues it would be “very easy” for motivated hackers to recreate the app, which he says consisted of about 500 lines of javascript. For a hacker willing to do a little coding—and illegal trespassing—it may offer a chance to score a small, subversive win against the global frequent-flying elite. Go Back to Top.

On Friday, though, a hacker known as Plore presented strategies for identifying a safe custom-selected keycode and then using it to unlock the safe normally, without any damage or indication that the code has been compromised. At Defcon, researchers regularly give talks about picking and hacking locks, and there’s even a whole “lock picking village” where people can learn basic skills or share sophisticated techniques. But there are always new locks to investigate and what makes Plore’s techniques interesting is what they lack: any physical or even algorithmic sabotage. Plore used side-channel attacks to pull it off. These are ways of exploiting physical indicators from a cryptographic system to get around its protections. Here, all Plore had to do was monitor power consumption in the case of one safe, and the amount of time operations took in other, and voila, he was able to figure out the keycodes for locks that are designated by independent third-party testing company Underwriter’s Laboratory as Type 1 High Security. These aren’t the most robust locks on the market by any means, but they are known to be pretty secure. Safes with these locks are the kind of thing you might have in your house. In practice, Plore was able to defeat the security of two different safe locks made by Sargent and Greenleaf, each of which uses a six-digit code. “I chose Sargent and Greenleaf locks due to their popularity. They are the lock manufacturer of choice on Liberty brand gun safes, among others, and safes featuring those locks are widely available at major stores,” Plore told WIRED. Plore said he didn’t have time before Defcon to try his attacks on other lock brands, but he added, “I would not be particularly surprised if techniques similar to those I described would apply to other electronic safe locks, other electronic locks in general (e.g., door locks), or other devices that protect secrets (e.g., phones).” For the Sargent and Greenleaf 6120, a lock developed in the 1990s and still sold today, Plore noticed that when he entered any incorrect keycode he could deduce the correct code by simply monitoring the current being consumed by the lock. More stories Imploding Barrels and Other Highlights From Hackfest DefCon DefCon 20 Badges, the Big Reveal: A Secret Society, Crypto Challenges and Easter Eggs Clever Tool Shields Your Car From Hacks by Watching Its Internal Clocks “What you do here is place the resistor in series with the battery and the lock, and by monitoring voltage across that resistor we can learn how much current the lock is drawing at any particular time. And from that we learn something about the state of the lock,” Plore explained. As the lock’s memory checked the input against its stored number sequence, the current on the data line would fluctuate depending on whether the bits storing each number in the code were a 0 or a 1. This essentially spelled out the correct key code until Plore had all of its digits in sequence and could just enter them to unlock the safe. Bafflingly easy. For the second demonstration, he experimented with a newer lock, the Sargent and Greenleaf Titan PivotBolt. This model has a more secure electronics configuration so Plore couldn’t simply monitor power consumption to discover the correct keycode. He was able to use another side-channel approach, though, a timing attack, to open the lock. Plore observed that as the system checked a user code input against its stored values there was a 28 microsecond delay in current consumption rise when a digit was correct. The more correct digits, the more delayed the rise was. This meant that Plore could efficiently figure out the safe’s keycode by monitoring current over time while trying one through 10 for each digit in the keycode, starting the inputs over with more and more correct digits as he pinpointed them. Plore did have to find a way around the safe’s “penalty lockout feature” that shuts everything down for 10 minutes after five incorrect input attempts, but ultimately he was able to get the whole attack down to 15 minutes, versus the 3.8 years it would take to try every combination and brute force the lock. “Burglars aren’t going to bother with this. They’re going to use a crowbar or a hydraulic jack from your garage or if they’re really fancy they’ll use a torch,” Plore said. “I think the more interesting thing here is [these attacks] have applicability to other systems. We see other systems that have these sorts of lockout mechanisms.” Plore said that he has been trying to contact Sargent and Greenleaf about the vulnerabilities since February. WIRED reached out to the company for comment but hadn’t heard back by publication time. Even though no one would expect this type of affordable, consumer-grade lock to be totally infallible, Plore’s research is important because it highlights how effective side-channel attacks can be. They allow a bad actor to get in without leaving a trace. And this adds an extra layer of gravity, because not only do these attacks compromise the contents of the safe, they could also go undetected for long periods of time. Go Back to Top.

The company is late to the growing trend of this type of initiative, which offers rewards to researchers who discover and submit security vulnerabilities for companies to preemptively patch. But Ivan Krstic, Apple’s head of security engineering and architecture, announced at Black Hat on Thursday that the company will launch an incentive structure in September. And in fact, by offering up to $200,000 for some discoveries, it seems to be the highest corporate bounty ever. Pressure for Apple to do this has been mounting for months. In the fallout from its battle with the FBI, for example, Apple took flack from some in the security community. They speculated that the FBI had only ultimately been able to find a third party to exploit iPhone security because Apple had no incentive in place to encourage researchers to share that information directly with Apple. Apple got the message. “We’ve had great help from researchers like you in improving iOS security all along,” Krstic told the crowd at Black hat. “Feedback that we’ve heard pretty consistently both from my team at Apple and also from researchers directly is that it’s getting increasingly more difficult to find some of those most critical types of security vulnerabilities. So the Apple Security Bounty Program is going to reward researchers who actually share critical vulnerabilities with Apple.” More Stories Bug Bounty Guru Katie Moussouris Will Help Hackers and Companies Play Nice Microsoft Launches $100K Bug Bounty Program The Romanian Teen Hacker Who Hunts Bugs to Resist the Dark Side At the high end, the program will pay out up to $200,000 for vulnerabilities found in Apple’s secure boot firmware components—the fundamental first protection that keeps your devices safe. To get this much, researchers would have to find vulnerabilities in the “secure boot” mode of the software that coordinates all functions. A malicious hacker exploiting such a vulnerability could cause real harm,hence the large number. To put that figure in perspective, Microsoft offers an $100,000 reward for Windows 10 vulnerabilities, and companies like Facebook and Twitter pay out large total sums, but these are comprised of many smaller rewards given out over time. These programs are an alternative to the large rewards hackers can get from government agencies or in the third-party market for zero-day exploits. “We go to tremendous lengths when it comes to engineering these security systems that provide trust in how we protect user data,” Krstic said. “We’re fortunate that we’ve earned trust from our customers, but we realize that that’s something we have to keep earning.” In addition to the top reward, Apple says it will pay up to $100,000 for extraction of confidential material protected by the Secure Enclave Processor, up to $50,000 for executions of arbitrary code with kernel privileges, up to $50,000 for access to iCloud account data on Apple servers (ahem, celebrity photo leak), and up to $25,000 for access from a sandboxed process to user data outside of that sandbox. This is good news for consumer security, but it’s late. When Microsoft launched its bug bounty program in 2013, it was given a hard time for waiting so long. Apple is launching now because it has no other choice. Still, if you’re going to be late, at least go big. And Apple is. Go Back to Top.

Microsoft has been trying to wean people off of the 15-year-old operating system for years now, but the cost of upgrading legacy enterprise software and simple lack of awareness keeps XP in important places where it definitely shouldn’t be, like airports and voting booths. Since Microsoft stopped supporting XP two years ago, it doesn’t get security updates anymore, putting computers still running it at serious risk. Some organizations, like the US Navy, have been so desperate to buy time that they’ve actually paid Microsoft to keep supporting their XP machines for a little bit longer. But if you’re not paying you’re not protected. And by some estimates, XP is still the third most popular operating system by market share. Not good. Go Back to Top.

And under what circumstances? And which laws give the government and law enforcement those rights? Eh, it’s not currently very clear, as was recently proven by the Apple/FBI battle over unlocking one of the San Bernardino shooters’ iPhones and the death of secure email service Lavabit after its founder refused to produce its Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) private keys for an FBI probe. That confusion is troubling but can also be a good thing for companies who receive requests that they do not want to comply with, for whatever reason. “If you’re ever asked to do something like this, you have a lot of strong legal arguments to say no,” said Jennifer Granick, the Director of Civil Liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society in a Black Hat talk on Thursday. Granick and her Stanford colleague Riana Pfefferkorn, a Cryptography Fellow, ran down relevant laws and what’s currently known about their parameters and limits. They suggested that companies should plan ahead and assume that law enforcement agencies will eventually send them some kind of technical request—if they haven’t already. And preparation starts with how products are designed. “No one is obligated to build in decryption capabilities,” Granick noted, meaning that it is much harder for law enforcement to compel a company to decrypt data that it doesn’t have any type of privileged access to. “You need to be thinking through these design decisions,” Pfefferkorn added. “You can’t be compelled to hand over data that you don’t collect.” Very true. Finally toward the end of the talk, Granick said, “End-to-end encryption is legal. Period.” The crowd broke into spontaneous applause. Go Back to Top.

This is a presidential candidate, after all, whose idea of securing classified emails was to keep them on a server in her basement, and when asked if she’d “wiped” that computer, responded “with a cloth or something?” But in an election year when her opponent is Donald Trump—and a group of very active Russian cyberspies whom Trump has publicly encouraged—Clinton has scored a surprising first: a hacker fundraiser. On Wednesday night, at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas, Clinton backers held a political event that was unprecedented for one of the biggest hacker gatherings in the world, inviting attendees to an evening of drinks at Vegas’ Mandalay Bay hotel and casino with a minimum donation of $100 to the Clinton campaign. Though Clinton herself didn’t attend, several dozen people packed into the small Mexican restaurant where the fundraiser was held anyway, many giving the maximum legal donation of $2,700, according to the fundraiser’s organizer, former Obama administration official Jake Braun. And from Braun’s opening remarks, he used the Russian breach of the Democratic National Committee revealed last month and Trump’s recent invitation for those Russian hackers to leak Hillary Clinton’s emails as a rallying cry for Clinton, and a point against a candidate with a dangerous ignorance of cybersecurity issues. “The Russians have hacked the elections in Georgia and Kygyrzstan and the Ukraine. Who’s to say they’re not going to do it here? I mean, my god, they already have,” Braun, a political consultant, Obama campaign staffer, and former White House liaison to the Department of Homeland Security, told the small crowd. “We all know this. We need to make sure the world knows this, and that Donald Trump and his affiliates know it’s not OK to tell the Russians they can come and hack our democracy.” Among the attendees in the political event’s audience were Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos and Chris Wysopal, the founder of security firm Veracode and a member of the legendary hacker collective the L0pht. Later, Jeff “The Dark Tangent” Moss, founder of both the Black Hat conference and the much larger hacker conference Defcon, made his own remarks in support of Clinton at the start of the two hour event. “I swore an oath to uphold the Constitution, and what’s happening is really fucking scary,” Moss told the small crowd, referring to a position he’s held since 2009 on the advisory council of the Department of Homeland Security. Moss acknowledged that holding a political event at Black Hat had generated controversy among the gathering’s typically nonpartisan crowd. He said he’d received a flood of emails, about one in four of which attacked him for politicizing the conference—despite Black Hat’s official insistence that the private fundraiser was held independently from the conference itself. “One friend asked me, ‘If Trump held an event, would you speak at that?’ If the Republicans had a cybersecurity policy, I’d seriously consider it,” Moss added, describing himself as an independent. “But they don’t have a policy. They don’t have a platform. And they don’t have anything organized.” More stories Meet Moxie Marlinspike, the Anarchist Bringing Encryption to All of Us The Future of Encryption Is in These Politicians’ Hands Dear Donald Trump: This Is Why Nuclear Weapons Are Bad It wasn’t only former democratic officials who spoke up at the event; so did Jason Healey, a former cybersecurity advisor to George W. Bush’s White House. “I’m a technocrat. I care about seeing the right things get done,” Healey said. “But in this election, you can’t sit back and say anymore that whoever the president’s going to be, I’ll serve them. It’s time to get involved in the campaign.” In any other election, it’s difficult to imagine even a small group of Black Hat’s attendees coming together to so vehemently support any political candidate or party. And Clinton’s campaign statements haven’t always ingratiated her to the hacker world: She’s denied that NSA leaker Edward Snowden was a whistleblower and said she believes he should return to the US to face legal charges. And she’s called for a “Manhattan Project” to create an encryption technique that would allow law enforcement access to Americans’ communications, placing herself in opposition to most encryption experts who see any such crypto backdoor as a critical flaw in data protections. But Trump has made a series of statements that have been far more frightening and appalling for many in the cybersecurity and national security communities. Last month he repeated to the New York Times his threat not to help protect members of the NATO treaty from invasion from foreign powers like Russia. MSNBC reports he’s repeatedly asked advisors why the U.S. shouldn’t use its nuclear arsenal. After Russian hackers were revealed to have breached the Democratic National Committee last month, Trump’s glib request to the hackers to leak Clinton’s deleted emails from her time as Secretary of State earned him another level of disdain from cybersecurity experts. And Braun, the organizer of Clinton’s Black Hat fundraiser, says he saw an opportunity to refocus his efforts to assemble support from the cybersecurity community around that remark. “Donald Trump and Russia are my best fundraising tools ever,” Braun told WIRED.

The flagship location boasts 40-foot-tall doors opening onto the square and comprises five departments, or what Apple prefers to call "features." It's launching a new bug bounty program Apple will shell out thousands of dollars to researchers who discover and report critical bugs in its software, the company announced Thursday. Hackers participating in the bug bounty program, which launches in September, could earn up to $200,000 depending on the type of vulnerability they find. Apple unveiled the program during the Black Hat cybersecurity conference in Las Vegas, according to The Wall Street Journal. Coders wishing to take part will need an invitation from Apple. The Cupertino, Calif. company is seeking only researchers who have previously disclosed security issues to the company. That said, Apple does plan to expand the program, and it won’t turn away new researchers with useful information. Bug bounty programs are common among large technology companies, who pay so-called “white hat” hackers to find and report software vulnerabilities that could have been exploited by malicious actors. Google, Facebook, and Uber all have bug bounty initiatives of their own that can result in a hefty amount of cash for researchers. Google announced earlier this year that it had paid out $6 million in rewards to security researchers since 2010. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

"There will be 1.4 billion Android phones produced in 2016 alone, so there needs to be a way to stand apart from the pack," said Sculley when the Obi MV1 was launched earlier this year. As such, Obi Worldphone promises a "luxury, design-led approach" to the entry-level smartphone market -- bringing a touch of 'designed in San Francisco' glamour to handsets that are often rendered in "inferior materials, cheap plastic cookie-cutter designs and lacking any redeeming qualities beyond spec and price," as the company notes. So how does the Obi MV1 stack up against the company's lofty goals? The 5-inch dual-SIM Obi MV1 has an unusual industrial design and runs the Lightspeed UI on Cyanogen OS (12.1.1). Image: Obi Worldphone The hardware The MV1 certainly stands out: the screen has the rounded edges you might see on an iPhone, but this is perched on top of a solid rectangular frame that juts out above the top of the screen, creating quite an odd effect. The company describes this as its "signature elevated screen", but to me it looks as if two different phones have become stuck together in some bizarre industrial accident. Top ZDNET Reviews Dell Latitude 11 5000 7.9 Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9.3 Amazon Echo 9.0 Google Pixel XL Phone 8.0 Despite the odd looks, the MV1 (the name is a nod to Mountain View -- each of the company's handsets are named after a Californian city) has a no-nonsense solid polycarbonate body with a steel frame underneath, giving it a serious feel: at 149g it feels sturdy in the hand and reminiscent of the Lumia range. In a world of anonymous black slabs, especially in low-end smartphone market, Obi should be applauded for coming up with something that looks a little bit different -- even if in this case different also means a bit strange. Despite its eccentricity, I rapidly warmed to the MV1. The 5-inch display has a resolution of 720 by 1,280 pixels (294ppi), is protected by Gorilla Glass 3, and is good -- although you'll likely need to turn up the default brightness a bit. The cameras -- 8MP rear-facing and 2MP front-facing -- are adequate but entirely unremarkable, and also somewhat slow to respond. The software It's not just the hardware design that separates the MV1 from the mainstream. It comes loaded with its own 'Obi Lifespeed' user interface, which you'll encounter as soon as you thumb the power stud: a swirling pink-and-orange ring appears on-screen, surrounding a button comprising throbbing concentric circles. Move this button towards one of the icons on the ring and you can access phone, camera or homescreen direct from the lockscreen. This sounds weird, but it's really quite useful and the oddity of the design makes you feel like you're handling some weird alien artefact -- which is no bad thing. The MV1 runs Cyanogen OS (12.1.1), which is built on top of Android 5.1.1 (Lollipop). That means it will still run Android apps and games, but Cyanogen gives you more flexibility in terms of the look and feel: you can buy 'themes' that give you a different boot animations, icons and lock screens, for example. Cyanogen also gives you some nice additional features like 'PIN scramble', which randomly mixes up the numbers on the virtual keypad so that someone can't guess your PIN just by seeing where you're tapping on the screen, while Truecaller allows you to block incoming spam calls. None of these are must-haves, but they're certainly handy little additions. And compared to the average bloatware-filled Android handset, Cyanogen gives the MV1 a pleasantly clean homescreen. Some of the forthcoming updates for Cyanogen in the form of 'mods' that allow deeper integration of third-party apps into the operating system could make it even more interesting. Performance Unlike the Wileyfox Spark (another nicely designed Cyanogen powered budget handset we reviewed recently), the MV1 performed well despite its low price. It scored 337 on single-core and 1,154 on multi-core when tested with Geekbench 3; in terms of real world usage, there was a bit of a pause when opening apps, but casual gaming was fine -- something like Temple Run 2 performed without stutter, although complex 3D gaming might be a step too far for the 1.3GHz Qualcomm MSM8909 Snapdragon 212/Adreno 304 SoC with 2GB of RAM. Conclusions Obi Worldphone has the right idea: just because a smartphone is affordable that doesn't mean it should be ugly or badly designed. If you can ignore -- or even find a way to love -- the MV1's slightly out-there look, you'll find a solid and well thought-out package that indicates there's life beyond boring black slabs. And Cyanogen again shows that it's an elegant alternative to stock Android. Considering the price, performance is good, too.

Friday, August 5, 2016 · 10:10 am · 10 Comments MobileFunTV reports, “In today’s video we’ll be taking a close up look at these WORKING iPhone 7 earphones that feature the lightning connector instead of the traditional 3.5mm Aux connection.” Apple has long been rumored to be dumping the 3.5mm headphone jack for Lightning. If not at launch, then relatively soon after, we expect Lightning headphones to be able do more than just reproduce sound. For one example, see Apple’s U.S. Patent No. 8,655,004: “Sports monitoring system for headphones, earbuds and/or headsets.” Apple’s patent abstract: A monitoring system that can be placed proximate to the head or ear of a user is disclosed. According to one embodiment, the monitoring system can be used with headphones, earbuds or headsets. The monitoring system can, for example, be used to monitor user activity, such as during exercise or sporting activities. The positioning of the monitoring system can also facilitate sensing of other user characteristics (e.g., biometric data), such as temperature, perspiration and heart rate. The monitoring system can also be used to control a an electronic device. In one embodiment, the monitoring system facilitates user control of the electronic device using head gestures. More info here. From your ear to your wrist in the blink of an eye™. Of course, if you’d prefer no wires at all, you can do as we’ve been doing for years now while exercising and just go Bluetooth. We’ve been using wireless Jaybirds (currently the Jaybird X2 Sport Wireless Bluetooth Headphones (around $115)). They’re easy to charge, easy to pair, light and comfortable, and work perfectly with our Apple Watches and iPhones. MacDailyNews Take: Why is the Lightning connector so big? Apple’s current cables have smaller Lighting connectors than seen in this video. If there are extra electronics required for audio or whatever, wouldn’t it make more design sense to move them into the volume controller, not put them at the end of the cable making for a bigger connector? Unless this is part of Jony’s new “I don’t give a shit anymore” design ethic*, we’re hoping this is just a third-party knockoff attempt, not a real Apple product. As we’re happily equipped with wireless Bluetooth headphones already, we’ll be leaving these in the box regardless, but, for those who’ll want to use Apple’s Lightning EarPods, hopefully Apple will offer a more svelte solution than this. *for two recent examples, see the ugly iPhone Smart Battery Case and the awfully-designed Apple TV Siri Remote.

I’ve never been able wear Apple headphones for more than a few seconds without them falling out or being incredibly uncomfortable. I bought a cheap pair of Anker SoundBuds Sport IE 20 and they’re great. The sound is more than acceptable for when I’m on the tube, they’re relatively light in the ears, the cable is flexible whilst also not tangling, the controls are good, and the magnets for turning them on and off work great and the battery life seems decent. I’ll stick with them. I’d almost rather have the option of a slight discount and do without Apple’s offering. Apple’s accessories have never really been any good. You just have to look at their mice over the years. Macinfo Friday, August 5, 2016 - 10:37 am · Reply So were reduced to whining about the size of the lightning connector?

The rush to judgement is getting old, lets actually see what comes out in about 5-6 weeks.. Journo Friday, August 5, 2016 - 11:13 am · Reply The size of that connector will be crucial. There will be much faux outrage over dropping the headphone jack. Anything that makes it look “worse” than it was before will be overtly criticized. MDN knows what they’re talking about. gallowaycreations Friday, August 5, 2016 - 11:52 am · Reply It’s not “faux” outrage. It will be actual outrage. You’ve heard it for months already at the suggestion they might drop the port. So far I’ve seen no suggested reason that is good enough justification. And I doubt we’ll actually get one; more likely it will be along the lines of Phil Schiller saying, “And we’ve removed that ugly 3.5mm jack for headphones. You’re welcome.” Because that is how Apple rolls lately. Walter Friday, August 5, 2016 - 12:39 pm · Reply “…we expect Lightning headphones to be able do more than just reproduce sound.” You think? I’m personally hoping for camera controls build into the connector. Features like zoom and exposure are difficult on the touch screen as it often causes abrupt changes and unwanted motion in the recording. Here’s to hope and change. WetFX Friday, August 5, 2016 - 3:24 pm · Reply I do like your idea of putting more camera features in the headphones, especially for video. I have had iPhones for years and jut recently discovered the headphones can act as a remote. Although I did feel kinda stupid when I use the volume button on my phone. There is a solution to trying to adjust the zoom and exposure when taking a shot: fix it in post. The digital zoom will be no better before or after a shot. Only a mechanical zoom can be better. The lighting also. You actually have more control after. Of course instant gratification takes to long /s. Paul Friday, August 5, 2016 - 12:55 pm · Reply For those people who don’t understand the difference between an analog audio port (like a 3.5mm minijack) and a digital one (USB, Lightning, Firewire), allow me to explain the fundamentals. All speakers and headphones are analog. If your source music files are digital (MP3, AAC, ALAC, FLAC, OGG, AIFF, MP4, …), then somewhere a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) is necessary. The signal to the speaker must then be amplified as well. It really doesn’t matter much where along the line the DAC and amp are packaged, there are pros and cons to wherever you place the components. So let’s say today you decide the DAC & amp inside your iPhone is not good enough, you want ultimate sound. Go ahead and use the Lightning port with a pair of excellent audiophile headphones from Grado or wherever (the best headphones have an analog connection). You can to this today, just break out $300 for this handy little unit: http://www.apogeedigital.com/products/one-dac Okay, wait a minute, you decide that’s a little too clumsy. Maybe supreme audio quality isn’t so important and we just want a cheap DAC + amp integrated into a big set of headphones. You can do that too. Philips makes a big set of cans (DAC and amp on your ears) with a wired Lightning connection for only $200. http://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/apple/best-lightning-headphones-for-iphone-ipad-audeze-philips-3641595/ Oh, but you prefer wireless? Now by definition you’re adding two more battery-powered components — wireless transmitter and receiver — and so you have a big dongle on the phone and an even heavier headset for equivalent quality to a wired unit. Prices start at about $400 for junky sound, and go up from there. But what if you want lightweight in-ear models? As far as I know, there are no Lightning earbuds. Wireless models with crappy sound start at about $200. Don’t forget that all this stuff eats batteries faster than if it’s all integrated as efficiently as possible on the iPhone chipset. So what’s the selling point of removing the analog port from the next iPhone? NONE. If you want to use lightning audio equipment now, go ahead, nobody’s stopping you. The fact that almost nobody prefers Lightning headphones for their daily lives is pretty clear evidence that Apple’s forcing the issue would be a grave mistake. Predrag Friday, August 5, 2016 - 4:34 pm · Reply Steve Jobs hated ports with passion. He despised and never missed a chance to ridicule them in his keynotes. He was always the driving force behind the elimination efforts throughout the past, and history is rich with examples (ADB, SCSI, analogue modem, PC card, ExpressCard, Ethernet, audio input, analogue video in / out, FireWire 400, FireWire 800, ADC, DVI, Mini-DVI…. And I’m sure I still missed a few). The Jobs legacy continues, and is evident on Macs, especially the MacBook model (no ports at all — just power/USB-C). So, if the iPhone loses the 3.5mm port, that will be because of the trend set by Jobs decades ago. If the port’s function can be performed by another, already existing, and more versatile port, the inferior one is eventually got to go. No amount of rational explanations and justifications for the existence of that ‘inferior’ port can save it if the original Jobs logic is consistently applied. John Gee Friday, August 5, 2016 - 9:39 pm · Reply Oh, hasn’t iPhone Smart Battery Case had its baby yet? bbock Saturday, August 6, 2016 - 4:14 am · Reply I’d think that if they had to include a digital to analog converter, that it’s probably in the plug, which is why it’s bigger. This assumes this is real. The existing Lightning connector has a simpler chip in it to enable the data transfer.

If Apple succeeds, the wireless earbuds will fix a problem that has plagued Bluetooth headphones: limited battery life. The source couldn’t confirm when the product will launch.” “The low-power Bluetooth chip comes from technology developed by Passif Semiconductor, a startup Apple purchased in 2013,” Tilley reports. “But the project has hit performance snags.” “Apple originally planned to launch the Bluetooth gadget in 2015, but Bluetooth performance issues stalled the release, the source told Forbes,” Tilley reports. “The expected iPhone 7 will likely not have a headphone jack, making the iPhone thinner (by one millimeter) as well as improve its water resistance. This would require headphones to connect wirelessly through Bluetooth or Apple’s proprietary Lighting port.” “Apple’s biggest smartphone rival, Samsung, recently announced its own Bluetooth earbuds called the Gear IconX. Samsung claims only 90 minutes minutes of battery life while streaming music from a phone,” Tilley reports. “The earbuds can also do a lot more than just play music: it captures the user’s heart rate with an optical sensor and tracks steps with an accelerometer.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Wonder if Samsung’s Gear IconX earbuds infringe upon Apple’s U.S. Patent No. 8,655,004: “Sports monitoring system for headphones, earbuds and/or headsets.” Apple’s patent abstract: A monitoring system that can be placed proximate to the head or ear of a user is disclosed. According to one embodiment, the monitoring system can be used with headphones, earbuds or headsets. The monitoring system can, for example, be used to monitor user activity, such as during exercise or sporting activities. The positioning of the monitoring system can also facilitate sensing of other user characteristics (e.g., biometric data), such as temperature, perspiration and heart rate. The monitoring system can also be used to control a an electronic device. In one embodiment, the monitoring system facilitates user control of the electronic device using head gestures.

I assume what tyleremke is asking for is two receivers connected to the one transmitter i.e. two sets of headphones connected to one player. Probably possible but would sap battery life and as much as anything would need careful thought as to how you would set it up. Kate Friday, August 5, 2016 - 10:37 am · Reply The biggest problem is batteries and charging. I’m already sick of managing the power on all my other devices.

That lag makes wireless headphones useless for using GarageBand, Traktor DJ, iMaschine, and a multitude of other related apps where timing has to be precise between the display / touch and what you hear. To be fair, I’m not sure if this deficiency is Bluetooth or how apps interface with iOS’s audio subsystem. All I can say is that it doesn’t happen with wired audio output. Yes, it happens with BT v2,v3,v4, or v4.1 headphones from an iPad Air & iPhone 6s+. I haven’t tried any headphone that have BT 4.2. mossman Friday, August 5, 2016 - 2:30 pm · Reply Latency will be a problem with any a) wireless technology, and b) compressed data stream. Bluetooth audio is both. Derek Currie Saturday, August 6, 2016 - 1:27 am · Reply √ √ SJBMusic Friday, August 5, 2016 - 5:21 pm · Reply The issue is with someone thinking that apps where lag might be an issue can be done reliably over any sort of wireless digital technology. I can only imagine a DJ thinking they might be able to do such – not anyone serious about music creation and editing. I mean no offense to the DJs of the world; I just don’t see anyone in those other categories having real expectations of this being usable. I would love to be proven wrong someday soon, but I don’t expect it. Not soon. Not reliably. stableos Sunday, August 7, 2016 - 10:50 pm · Reply I agree with you – when you are doing serious music production you use wired headphones, studio monitors, or a sound system for live. However if you are inspired or have an epiphany while out and about and all you have is bluetooth headphones – FAIL. The happens to me all the time and I either carry only wired headphones or both bluetooth and wired. It would be nice to be wireless for those creative moments but the lag is so bad you can’t really use it. GreatGooey thingy Friday, August 5, 2016 - 4:31 pm · Reply Just another BS Apple scheme that shows a lack of regard for the needs of its users.

Other than the MacBook — which, at the time of writing was updated 108 days ago — every Mac feels older than dirt, and has a ‘don’t buy’ rating. Apple’s top-end, aimed-at-the-pros Mac Pro is nearing 1,000 days since an upgrade, and it’s been over 650 days since the Mac Mini saw an upgrade.” “OK, so what’s going on here?” Kingsley-Hughes writes. “Apple works for Apple. Everything the company does has its roots in either saving money or bringing more money in… It would be trivial for Apple to update its Macs, especially if we’re just focusing on say the CPU, GPU, and RAM… Changing things like the shell is a different matter, and involves more engineering and testing, but for a company with the resources that Apple has, even this isn’t a huge deal… The only reason Apple is slow to update Macs is because it chooses to be slow to update them.” “Mac sales have been hovering around the four to six million mark for the past 12 quarters. Apple is clearly happy with sales being at this level, and clearly believes that constantly tinkering with the Mac lineup wouldn’t move the needle significantly. Another factor to bear in mind is that the longer Apple can go between upgrades, the more profits it makes on a Mac thanks to ever-decreasing component prices,” Kingsley-Hughes writes. “I get it that if you’re someone who likes to buy new hardware every year or so that this lack of new Macs is frustrating, but this doesn’t seem to be how Apple operates any more. If you don’t like this, then maybe you’d be better switching to the Windows ecosystem, where OEMs release new hardware on a regular basis.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Let’s enjoy a couple of Tim Cook quotes, shall we? Companies that get confused, that think their goal is revenue or stock price or something; you have to focus on the things that lead to those. — Tim Cook Apple has a culture of excellence that is, I think, so unique and so special. I’m not going to witness or permit the change of it. — Tim Cook Does ignoring millions of customers in order to greedily milk old Macs for profit in any way fit with either of those two quotes?

You can upgrade the processor, hard drive and memory. Have at it. disposableidentity Friday, August 5, 2016 - 11:16 am · Reply The pro hardware should be modular, user-accessible & upgradable. It should also be refreshed by Apple every single year (if they would just get the form-factor right, they could use it for ten or more years with only processor, memory and storage upgrades — just like they use to do!). For all of the other Mac models, I don’t think a longer update cycle is a problem. An iMac or MacBook lasts 5 years or more. If Apple would update the specs every two years doesn’t seem like a problem to me. It’s the specs of the phones, watches & iPads that should be churning on an annual cycle. Bo Friday, August 5, 2016 - 3:29 pm · Reply Amen again. Pro hardware designers must THINK DIFFERENT. Bo Friday, August 5, 2016 - 3:45 pm · Reply Pro users use Macs HARD. Requirements change and we upgrade hardware for dozens of reasons. As it is, we only get to upgrade keyboards, mice and externally plugged in devices. Give me a MacMini sized set of stackable units so I can pick what I need when I need it for extra functionality. DavGreg Friday, August 5, 2016 - 11:20 am · Reply Apple should get busy on Mac Hardware engineering- not styling- engineering or license the OS to a trusted partner who can build something decent. The day I can buy a user expandable tower with industry standard cards and memory, I will order/buy it. I have a real Mac Pro tower that is in need of replacement. yojimbo007 Friday, August 5, 2016 - 4:53 pm · Reply Ditto! Mike Friday, August 5, 2016 - 11:32 am · Reply MDN, I’m not impressed with Cook’s incessant cheerleading. Actions matter. Either he doesn’t get it or he doesn’t care. Both are grounds to remove him. Apple continues to ignore the Mac at its own peril. There is much more at stake than quarterly Mac sales. When a company can’t maintain its heritage flagship products, it loses trust. M Friday, August 5, 2016 - 11:47 am · Reply Just when Apple has everyone’s attention ..even enterprise…they decide to ignore the Mac… It is frustrating to witness. When they dumbed down the Mini to the point where the previous model was a better buy..I thought that was an anomaly… It doesn’t look like it was, unfortunately. Algernon Blue Friday, August 5, 2016 - 1:21 pm · Reply I was lucky enough to get one of those last 4-core Mac minis. I use it of a server in my house… Maybe they are building an Apple TV Server running iOS… Who knows.. But the current Mac product line has me dumbfounded !!! macnificentseven48 Friday, August 5, 2016 - 11:57 am · Reply I’m not even going to try to guess why Apple is willing to play second-fiddle to every other tech company on the planet when they can afford to do much better in terms of product upgrades. I’m not saying they absolutely have to but how much could it really cost a company sitting on $200 billion in cash to at least match or exceed competitor products. I think Apple is just being lazy. I don’t know what all of their R&D money is producing for end users. Maybe it has to do with quantities where Apple can’t get enough cutting-edge components or something. Only Apple will ever know why they do the things the way they do. I’d like at least an explanation as a shareholder but I know I’ll never get one. I can understand iMacs not being the most powerful desktops but why Apple can’t build the supreme Mac Pro to absolutely destroy the competition is something I can’t fathom at all. How hard could it be for Apple to use the latest technology if smaller and less wealthier companies can manage it? DJ Friday, August 5, 2016 - 12:14 pm · Reply Erm, if Apple does not offer significant upgrades, then people like me simply use the old kit happily enough – and Apple loses from the refresh and cashflow. My 13 inch MBP is more than 4 years old, and just keeps running. I’m just about to spring for a new iPad tho’, as the Pro and Pencil together make a must-have package. gespensen Friday, August 5, 2016 - 12:20 pm · Reply I sure hope the new MBP’s come with SSD. If so, there is a solid sale here. Upgraded my 17″ MBP and it add add new life. I’ll never go back to spindle drives again. jfblagden Monday, August 8, 2016 - 8:36 am · Reply The only issue with going all-SSD is the cost. If you want to bring hundreds of gigabytes or even terabytes of videos, music and photos, you’ll probably need a hard drive. Hard drives might be slow, but they’re great for mass storage because they have a much lower price-per-gigabyte. My ideal MacBook Pro would have a 512 gigabyte Solid State Drive, a 2 TB hard drive, upgradeable RAM, and an Ethernet port. Bo Friday, August 5, 2016 - 12:26 pm · Reply It used to be that Apple just delivered … that was it. Wha happened? Brutal Truth Friday, August 5, 2016 - 6:41 pm · Reply Steve died and left a Compaq operations guy in charge. trondude Friday, August 5, 2016 - 12:44 pm · Reply Apple seems more focused on phones and pads. Just look at the latest ipad pro commercial for proof. Mike Friday, August 5, 2016 - 12:56 pm · Reply You mean the Apple Surface commercial? Pathetic. Kate Friday, August 5, 2016 - 1:08 pm · Reply There is no excuse for the Mac Pro being so old, but I do think the reason for MacBooks being so old is (hopefully) the first major design change we have seen in several years. They mentioned the MacRumors’ Buyer’s Guide… but they should also check out the MacBook Pro rumor page and see the conceptual work of what rumors are saying could potentially be the next MacBook. If those are true, then Apple did us a favor by not updating for a while, because anyone who has a computer that’s “good enough” for now is going to wait for these new models, and only people who really actually need a new machine are going to get one of the older ones that are for sale. I just wish Apple were more transparent about the whole thing. They should have announced it early like they did with the Mac Pro years ago when it was last updated. MacUser Friday, August 5, 2016 - 1:39 pm · Reply I don’t think it’s OK for Apple to just strive to be “good enough”. It’s also definitely not okay for Apple to charge the prices it does for outdated hardware. If Apple is too cheap to update the MacBook chassis, then they can get busy improving internals, offering better colors, or dropping prices. Some of us would be elated if they just dusted off the old 17″ MacBook Pro chassis and installed current Core i7 chips and one or two swappable 2TB SSDs in it. Most every reputable manufacturer on the planet is transparent with customers and has a steady update cycle. Competitors also seem capable of offering a full product range that suits the many different needs of their users. There is no excuse why Apple can no longer deliver newer better Macs. Terry Duke Friday, August 5, 2016 - 3:20 pm · Reply If they were planning on switching to their own custom designed ARM chips with multi cores and graphics, that would certainly cause the delay Derek Currie Saturday, August 6, 2016 - 1:22 am · Reply No, they’re not. Jon Seliot Saturday, August 6, 2016 - 12:26 pm · Reply I’d say an iOS Mac is a given this fall. Given Tim’s operations expertise, it must irk him to no end to be at the mercy of Intel and other chip manufacturers. There is the potential with an A10, more cores and more ram that the new iOS laptop will be fast. However, that doesn’t do much to mitigate Apples greed and disdain for its Mac customers. All MDN did was highlight Tim Cook’s hypocrisy. 1 2 Next » Add Your Feedback Name (required) Email (required) Web cancel reply Notify me of new comments via email. Notify me of new posts via email.
