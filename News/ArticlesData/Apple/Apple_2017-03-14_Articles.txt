Photo: AFP mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 10:00 AM, March 15, 2017 Updated: 11:25 AM, March 15, 2017 BEIJING — Household brands in China are bracing for the government’s version of public-service journalism — the annual programme on state-run TV that uses hidden cameras to highlight what the network calls companies’ unfair practices against consumers. China Central Television’s March 15 broadcast for World Consumer Rights Day has targeted some of the world’s biggest companies in the past, including Apple, McDonald’s and Volkswagen. The name-and-shame show not only attracts eyeballs, it also gets results — Apple’s Tim Cook apologised in 2013 and McDonald’s retrained some workers in 2012. Breakneck economic growth and rising incomes transformed China into an essential market with 1.4 billion people, and the government’s push for a consumption-driven economy fuelled an influx of foreign companies in the fast-food, retailing and automotive industries. This year, Korean companies such as Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor also have reason to worry that it’s their turn to be featured in the “3.15 Gala” programme. China retaliated against Korean businesses after the government in Seoul allowed the deployment of a US missile-defence system that China said threatens regional security. “Korea is on the political hot seat right now,” said Mr Shaun Rein, managing director of Shanghai-based China Market Research Group. “I think they would target Korean brands especially.” Chinese authorities, citing alleged safety violations, suspended operations of 55 stores owned by Lotte Group, the conglomerate that provided land for the system, and shut Lotte Shanghai Foods, a joint venture with Hershey. The government also curbed Chinese tourist travel to South Korea. South Korean cosmetics brands could be a major target given their popularity in China. Amorepacific Corp is among the top five sellers in the nation, according to Euromonitor International’s latest data. E-COMMERCE SCRUTINY Ensuring consumers are adequately informed about the authenticity of online purchases likely would be one focus of this year’s broadcast, said Ms Catherine Lim, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst in Singapore. Previous shows targeted homegrown powers Alibaba Group Holding and China Mobile. Alibaba has struggled to keep counterfeit products off its websites, and the US government labelled the company’s Taobao e-commerce platform a “notorious market” for fake goods last year. The China Consumers Association said its theme for 2017 is trust in e-commerce. Mr Jack Ma, chairman of Alibaba and China’s richest man, said this month he wants lawmakers to impose serious jail time on copycat manufacturers. Alibaba’s struggle with fakes and questionable products is part of a larger issue in China, where piracy is rampant and knock-offs of everything from DVDs to appliances flourish. “Chinese consumers are becoming more sophisticated now,” Ms Lim said. “They have higher expectations for the products that they receive and the entire service that goes in.” The highlight on consumer protections comes as the government plans to generate more growth through consumer spending, with the economy transitioning away from a reliance on heavy industry and exports. Chinese consumers are gaining in clout, with the average urban household income tripling in the past decade, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The country’s shoppers are expected to push online retail sales to as much as 14 trillion yuan (S$2.9 trillion) in 2021 from about 5 trillion yuan last year, according to market researcher Mintel Group. Some companies are trying to head off new criticism from CCTV’s programme, said Mr Mark Natkin, managing director of Beijing-based Marbridge Consulting. JD.com, Tencent Holdings, Baidu, Wal-Mart Stores, Procter & Gamble and Lenovo Group formed an alliance last month to fight against fake goods and internal corruption. Being targeted in the annual broadcast can lead to additional scrutiny, said Mr Natkin. “There are enough negative consequences that companies are willing to do things to pre-emptively avoid being in that spotlight,” he said.

I also want to share that I am going to be guiding another Urban water way the Milwaukee River and shore of Lake Michigan. I did seminars through out the show and got Great response about fishing the Chicago River.       Many people said they wished someone was doing that on the Milwaukee River so I’ve made the decision to give it a try. Quite a few people said they fish from shore for smallies and salmon so I’m going to give it a shot.  On a Chicago note i was out for a half day early last week surface temps were about 49 to 54 look for warm water we caught fish Crappie and strippers seems to be the most aggressive just a couple small Bass Jig and twister tail with a waxie was the trick. I am trying to get out a couple times this week but the weather may change my plans.   I’m looking forward to a Great 2017 season I will try to post all I can about when where and how.

FOX RIVER: WESTERN SUBURBS No update. FOX RIVER: WISCONSIN No update. GREEN BAY/STURGEON BAY Lance LaVine at Howie’s Tackle in Sturgeon Bay sent this: Good morning Fellas…Here is what I have as far as the fishing is concerned There is still a little bit of ice fishing going on since we have had a blast of cold weather…though there are limited areas with walkable/safe ice, the die-hard anglers have been going out on it and having some pretty good success.  The Perch fishing was going extremely well, but now will come to a close as the season end on March 15th.  Both Little Sturgeon and Sawyer Harbor were the hot spots.  Along with the Perch, the Pike fishing has been going quite well as those fish follow the Perch into their spawning grounds.  And, if the ice can hold on, there will be good opportunities to ice a trophy Walleye in those same areas as those Walleyes will push shallow getting ready for their spawn.  Odd Ball jigs and Rapala jigs are just 2 of the main jigs to have in the box.  Tip those jigs with minnows and or minnow heads.  Again, the ice conditions can and will , change on a daily basis so use extreme caution before WALKING on the ice in whatever area you may want to fish! With the recent cold snap, some of the open water fishing opportunities came to a bit of a halt for the time being, but that can also change in a matter of a day or so.  Up until the recent freeze-up, boat fishermen and shore fishermen were enjoying some excellent Brown Trout action throughout the county.  Fishermen have been trolling the shallow water shorelines of Lake Michigan and catching nice numbers of Browns.  The best depths have been in waters less than 25 feet fishing with Mauler spoons, floating Rapalas and Thundersticks just to name a few.  There have also been some nice Browns getting caught trolling right in downtown Sturgeon Bay when the ice is NOT around.  Shore fishermen have also been having some really good success casting from the pier heads and docks in all of the public community spots.  Cleos, Krocodile’s and crank baits all taking their fair share of fish.  And as the ice completely goes away their will be lots of opportunities for Browns, Walleye and Pike throughout Sturgeon Bay and up and down the Peninsula on the Green Bay side. Thanks; Lance LaVine Howie’s Tackle 1309 Green Bay Rd Sturgeon Bay, WI 54235 Ph: 920-746-9916 The Wisconsin DNR report is usually posted Tuesdays and includes reports from both the bay and lake sides.

MINOCQUA: Kurt Justice of Kurt’s Island Sport Shop in Minocqua, Wis. sent this: If the weather forecasters are to be believed…(pause till laughter subsides), starting March 15th on through for the next two weeks, area high temps should run low 30’s to low 40’s with night time lows in the teens and 20’s – Great for syrup makers!  What this will do is extend our ice season through the month of March. The first couple weeks of March have seen temps so cold that we are seeing (and hearing) ice being made?  Ice thickness reports are now increasing, averages pushing up into the 18”+ range with highs of 21-22”. High winds (up to 59 mph) last week kept anglers off the ice.  Morning lows in the single digit to sub 0 temps didn’t attract a lot of anglers to head out.  Reports were generally poor with small windows of action. Yellow Perch:  Fair-Poor – Fish were finicky and best action coming from very small fish if at all.  Eventually, these fish will get shallower as the season progresses.  For deep water action, #2 Pimples, #35 Halis, Kastmasters and Chandelier jigs tipped with wigglers or red spikes in 18-28’, mud best bottom, but some sandgrass flats holding fish.  Shallow water perch (12’ and less) tend to be more aggressive.  Choose larger baits to try to discourage the tiny fish from bothering your baits.  #2 jigging Raps, Demon Tongues, Live Forage Spoons and Forage Minnows dressed up with two to three waxies or a minnow head as well as a larger crappie minnow to medium fat head work best. Bluegills:  Fair-Poor – Cold made gills finicky.  Tiny Tungsten jigs tipped with single spike, piece of small plastic with red, purple, maroon or black being best.  Catches were fewer with smaller fish. Crappies:  Poor – Bite has gotten tough. Small fish for the most part.  Hard to finesse with wind, when possible #10, #12 gold rockers and Lethal Cecils in pink, gold, silver and purple tipped with light colored plastics or Chena. Despite the dismal report, things should improve dramatically with upcoming warm up.  Ice thickness is good (dug up to 18” lows @ 14”, highs at 21”).  With cold nights and above freezing days, expect another 2 weeks of good ice fishing. Kurt Justice Kurt’s Island Sport Shop www.kurtsislandsports.com EAGLE RIVER: B+L, from reports from Colin Crawford of Colin Crawford Guide Service for the Eagle River Chamber of Commerce, sent this: Fishing Report Bluegills: These fish are being found in the weeds using small jigs tipped with waxies, spikes or tipped with plastic. Perch: You can find these on the deep weed edges and muddy bottoms feeding on minnows and bugs. Be sure to match the bait to the area you’re fishing for success. Crappie: We are finding a few up in the shallow weeds, but the majority are still in the deeper water. Reminder:  All ice fishing shelters must be removed from the ice daily and when not in use on inland waters north of Highway 64 by March 19 and Wisconsin-Michigan boundary waters by March 15.

The country's Federal Antimonopoly Service announced the decision in a press release today. The investigation revealed that from the start of official sales in Russia of the Apple iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, most resellers installed the same prices on them, recommended by Apple Rus, and supported them For about 3 months. At the same time, Apple Rus monitored retail prices for Apple iPhone smartphones installed by resellers in online stores and retail outlets, and, in case of setting "unsuitable" prices, the Russian subsidiary Apple sent emails to resellers with a request to change them. Also, compliance with recommended retail prices by resellers could be due to the provisions of contracts between Apple Rus and resellers, which could be terminated by Apple Rus at any time without explanation. Notably, Apple Russia actively cooperated with FAS during the case and took the necessary measures to eliminate violations of the law and pursued a policy of preventing such violations in the future. The Financial Times says Apple has three months to appeal. If it fails to reverse the ruling it could be fined up to 15% of sales.

After the excitement and mayhem of last week's Mobile World Congress, this week wasn’t quite as mad – but there’s still been no shortage of intriguing news and spicy developments across the tech world in recent days. But don’t worry if you think you might have missed something, for 7 Days is here to walk you through the week’s top tech news once more. Ask away - but don't expect the answer to be correct Our journey begins this week in the United States, where Google's Home speaker hub was found to be spewing bizarre conspiracy theories in response to various enquiries. The root of the problem is Google's 'Featured Snippets', which employs algorithms to try to provide a single, direct answer to any enquiry - but some of these responses have been drawn from the most unreliable of sources. Image via BBC News Over in the UK, Facebook has been severely criticized for its bizarre response to a BBC News investigation into the social network's failures to crack down on child pornography. Facebook reported the BBC to the police after journalists complied with the company's demand to present evidence of the illegal content being shared on its site. UK telecommunications giant BT has been ordered by industry regulator Ofcom to reduce its bills for customers who only use its landline phone services. The move is expected to make a big difference to low-income and elderly customers. WikiLeaks published a range of documents and files which it claimed to have sourced from a secure CIA network, revealing details of the intelligence agency's efforts to use technology to covertly monitor unsuspecting users around the world. The leaks revealed the CIA's use of remotely activating cameras and microphones on smartphones, listening in on smart TVs, and interception of communications on devices before they're sent over encrypted services. Google said that it had dealt with 'many' of the exploits detailed in the leaks, and Apple added that many of the exploits had been patched on its devices too. Chinese manufacturer ZTE admitted that it had violated US sanctions in selling hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of equipment to Iran and North Korea. The company agreed to pay fines totalling $1.19 billion, and its exports will remain under close international scrutiny for three years. Chinese search giant Baidu has built on Google's DeepMind Wavenet technology, and created a version of the algorithm that can be trained in a matter of hours and perform faster than real-time human speech. IBM has been working on improving its speech recognition technology, bringing its word error rate down to just 5.5%, overtaking Microsoft's recent rate of 5.9%. Elsewhere, IBM researchers published details of a remarkable achievement this week: the ability to store a bit of data on a single atom, compared with modern hard disk drives, which use around 100,000 atoms to store each bit. Image via Shutterstock IDC published its latest projections for the global smartphone market, forecasting an increase in shipments this year, with over 1.5 billion shipments per year expected by 2021. comScore's latest data for January 2017 show that Apple is the largest smartphone vendor in the US by a considerable margin, but Android remains the top smartphone platform in overall use. Apple quietly launched a new version of its three-year-old iPhone 6 for select carriers in Asian markets. The 'iPhone 6 (2017) 32GB' is intended to offer a more affordable option for those wishing to buy an Apple device, but who can't justify spending far larger amounts on the newest models. Elsewhere, a report claimed that Apple's tenth-anniversary iPhone, due later this year, won't be called the iPhone 7s or iPhone 8, but rather the 'iPhone Edition'. Microsoft finally launched Cortana for iOS in the UK on Friday, coinciding with the release of the app's 2.0 update, which introduces a new look similar to that introduced on Android several months ago. The Motorola brand was phased out last year in favor of new 'Moto by Lenovo' sub-branding. But it seems Lenovo has now had a change of heart, and is preparing to reintroduce the iconic Motorola name. UK retailer Carphone Warehouse said that interest in the new Nokia 3310 - a more modern interpretation of the much-loved classic phone - has been "astonishing". The 3310 is expected to launch in the UK alongside the 3, 5 and 6 smartphones in May. However, future Nokia handsets, developed by HMD Global, will not use the Carl Zeiss optics that were used in many of Nokia's excellent smartphone cameras. On Friday, two months after its announcement, HTC began shipping its new U Ultra flagship in the United States, priced at $749. And in India, Samsung launched the 2017 editions of its mid-range Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A7 handsets. Samsung has reportedly pushed back the retail launch of its still-unannounced Galaxy S8 flagship by a week. The device - which has been extensively leaked in recent weeks - will be officially unveiled on March 29. Google acknowledged complaints about microphone issues from some owners of its flagship Pixel and Pixel XL handsets. It's recommended warranty replacements - but some users have reported experiencing the same issues on replacement units. After TCL unveiled the high-end BlackBerry KEYone last week, another new BlackBerry-branded handset was unveiled on Thursday. The Aurora has a large 720p display, Snapdragon 425 processor, 4GB RAM, 32GB storage and 13MP rear camera. On Tuesday, Google published its latest monthly breakdown of Android version usage. Android 7.x Nougat has more than doubled in usage since last month - but it's still on only 2.8% of active devices, almost seven months after its release. The Nougat update continues to slowly make its way to more devices: Verizon brings Nougat to Galaxy S7 and S7 edge Galaxy S7 active on AT&T gets Android 7.0 update Nougat rolls out to Galaxy S6 and S6 edge, and expands to more markets in Europe Android 7.0 makes its way to Huawei P9 Plus in Europe LG will bring Nougat to G4 and V10 flagships - but not until second half of 2017 Google released its March security update for Android on Monday, along with new Pixel and Nexus factory and OTA images. Verizon wasted no time in bringing the new patches to the Pixel and Pixel XL, and BlackBerry was quick to bring the updates to its devices too. Google announced a range of new security improvements for its Cloud Platform this week, including Identity-Aware Proxy, Data Loss Prevention, a new Key Management System, and more. Google Drive picked up numerous features aimed at improving the service for business and enterprise customers too. Google pushed ahead with its plans to transition Hangouts into a business-focused platform, with two new services - Meet and Chat - designed for organizations. And after announcing Jamboard - a competitor to Microsoft's Surface Hub - in October, Google revealed that its 55-inch collaboration display will be priced at $4,999 when it launches in May. Unlike the 55-inch Surface Hub, which only has a 1080p display, the Jamboard will get 4K resolution at the same size. Google released a stable version of Android Studio 2.3, the latest version of its integrated development environment (IDE). The new build brings a ton of improvements and significant tweaks for Android software developers. But for many developers, the biggest news of the week was Microsoft's release of Visual Studio 2017, which it calls the "most productive" version of the developer tools in their 20-year history. The new edition brings a huge range of improvements and new features, which Microsoft says offer "unparalleled" support for "any dev, any app, and any platform". Microsoft also launched Visual Studio Preview, offering early access to new upcoming features in its IDE. And alongside those announcements, it also rolled out Visual Studio for Mac Preview 4, with all sorts of enhancements and bug fixes. Microsoft introduced a preview of 'Playable Ads' for developers too. The name is a bit of a misnomer, given the impressions that it immediately conjures up. Essentially, it uses an ad for an app to stream the app to a user's device for up to three minutes, allowing them to get a taste of its functionality and design before deciding whether or not to install it. Microsoft announced that it's shutting down its experimental social network, Socl, next week, five years after its launch. Officially, Socl remained a research product throughout its existence. Microsoft's 'chat-based workspace', Teams - which will compete against popular collaboration platform Slack - will officially launch on March 14. Qualcomm announced a new partnership with Microsoft to bring "next-generation cloud services" to its Centriq 2400 platform, the chip-maker's first server processor built on ARM architecture. The collaboration includes a new version of Windows Server optimized for ARM processors. However, Microsoft later clarified that Windows Server for ARM is for its own internal use only. Meanwhile, Microsoft's .NET Core is coming to the Raspberry Pi 3, and an official .NET 2.0 Core release, adapted to run on ARM devices, is coming later this year. Microsoft delivered its first firmware update for four months to the Surface Book, along with new Surface Pro 4 firmware too. And it should come as no surprise that, yet again, the company is offering discounts on both devices in the US, with $200 off many models. Curiously, Microsoft has dropped the entry-level Core m3 model of the Surface Pro 4 that includes the Surface Pen in the US, so if you want to buy that particular device, you'll have to purchase the Pen separately. In another unusual decision, Microsoft launched a new Surface Book model, priced at $2,999, with a Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM and 1TB storage, but no discrete GPU. If you're willing to pay that kind of money for such a high-performance device, wouldn't you just pay the extra $200 for the otherwise identical dGPU model? Microsoft's Surface Studio all-in-one PC, priced from $2,999, remains exclusively available in the US. But the company confirmed that it will go on sale in France in July - around nine months after it was first announced. By that time, the graphics card in the 'entry-level' Studio will be two and a half years old. HP announced a new range of all-in-ones and other desktop PCs aimed at business customers, including some rather stylish models. HP also teased a new, larger version of the notebook-style Lap Dock accessory for its Elite x3 Windows 10 Mobile flagship. At Mobile World Congress last week, it briefly showed a revised version of the handset itself too. Perhaps clearing inventory for the new model, Microsoft slashed 25% off the Elite x3 and Desk Dock bundle in the US, reducing its price to $599 in a deal lasting several weeks. Shazam became the latest high-profile brand to ditch its app on Microsoft's Windows phones and PCs. Microsoft confirmed that its upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update will be released for PCs first, coming to Mobile devices later. How much later remains to be seen, although the gap between PC and phone releases for last year's Anniversary Update was two weeks. Microsoft also rolled out Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview build 15051 to the Slow ring on Friday, along with build 15055 to PCs and phones in the Fast ring. You can see the fixes and known issues for PCs here, and those for Mobile here. Incidentally, build 15055 is also the first Windows 10 preview to be released that identifies its version number as 1703, replacing the Anniversary Update's 'Version 1607'. Microsoft's Sticky Notes app on Windows 10 picked up a few new features for Insiders in the Slow ring... ...who also got some nice additions (pun intended) to the OneNote UWP app. The Groove Music app on Windows 10 got some new features and some minor UX tweaks for Insiders as well. But the Movies & TV app got a much bigger overhaul, with a completely redesigned interface, and new features to enhance content discovery. Insiders got their first taste of the new 'Compact Overlay' feature in the Skype Preview app on Windows 10 this week. The Skype Preview app also made its debut on the Xbox One and Xbox One S for Insiders in the Alpha ring - but Compact Overlay isn't yet included on the consoles. The Alpha ring got updated to Xbox One Insider Preview build 15051, and while it was light on new features and fixes, there were plenty of known issues to be aware of. Months ahead of its launch, Microsoft's Project Scorpio - which it calls the "most powerful console ever" - made its debut in the Microsoft Store on Thursday. While Scorpio will include support for native 4K gaming, a report also claimed that the new console will bring big improvements to how games appear on 1080p TVs. Some new games launched on the Xbox One this week, including LEGO Worlds... ...Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3, which was released on the Xbox 360 five years ago... ...and a real blast from the past: The King of Fighters '94. However, after Xbox One and Windows 10 exclusive Scalebound was cancelled this year, another game has now reached the end of the road before it even launched. Ion was first revealed at E3 2015, but its developers confirmed that work on the game has now ended. In happier news, Gran Turismo Sport will begin its closed beta on March 17 for PlayStation 4 gamers. Sony released its 4.50 system update for the PlayStation 4 this week, bringing Boost Mode, Voice Chat for Remote Play, and more. Crowdfunding platform Indiegogo suspended fundraising efforts by the developers of the Spectrum ZX Vega+ computer, after shipping delays, and a failure by Retro Computers to adequately communicate with backers and keep them update on the ongoing wait. Game-streaming service Twitch launched its own social stream called Pulse this week, and also announced plans to release a new desktop app. Nintendo published a new video overview for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which will launch on its Switch console next month. Our odyssey across the tech world this week ends with a ton of news about the new Nintendo Switch - so feast your eyes on this: Switch becomes the fastest-selling console in Nintendo's history Nintendo hides a small message to fans inside the Switch Pro controller Joy-Con controllers can be used on Windows PCs and other devices Apps like Netflix and Hulu will come to the Switch... but you'll have to wait Nintendo tells Switch users that dead pixels are 'normal' Switch durability test Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a couple of extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. Nintendo has been touring North America giving gamers a chance to get some hands-on time with the Switch. If you won't be able to make it, Neowin's Timi Cantisano attended one of the events to show you what you're missing. Timi also published his review of the ZTE Blade V8 Pro, which was introduced at CES 2017. It offers great build quality, solid performance and strong battery life, along with some very keen pricing - but there are some significant downsides too... And finally, if you've been reluctant to buy a Windows phone, we're eager to hear why. Whether it's the app selection, the range of devices, the features in the OS, or some other reason, join in the discussion and share your thoughts with us! Stay tuned to Neowin in the days ahead for what’s sure to be another exciting week, filled with official news, lots of updates, and plenty of insights from around the world of technology.

Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Mar 14, 2017 at 8:49PM At long last, online radio streamer Pandora Media (NYSE:P) is finally ready to launch its on-demand offering, Pandora Premium. The new service, which was announced in December but is just now launching, will cost $10 and Pandora says it will "change the way you listen to music." Considering the fact that Pandora Premium largely replicates what other $10-per-month, on-demand music streaming services offer, that's unlikely. There are 40 million songs in the catalog, which is comparable to the two big heavyweights; Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Music also has 40 million songs while Spotify advertises 30 million. Pandora Premium will also include Pandora's flagship online radio service that creates stations based on personal preferences. This is a feature that Apple Music and Spotify also offer, although Pandora was the first mover. It's less clear which company has the best algorithm for this, or if users place much value on personalized radio relative to the on-demand aspect. Image source: Getty Images. Can Pandora Premium make a dent against Apple Music and Spotify? Hopping on the on-demand bandwagon At last count, Apple said in December it had 20 million paid subscribers. Earlier this month, Spotify said it had reached over 50 million subscribers, or about half of its total active user base of 100 million, which includes ad-supported users that use the service for free. The music-streaming industry has been rapidly shifting toward paid and on-demand; paid for the benefit of the industry's economics, and on-demand because consumers like to choose specific songs to listen to. Spotify may be the market leader in terms of paid subscribers, but Apple Music could be the industry's preferred service since the Mac maker only offers a paid option with no ad-supported tier. According to Pandora's most recent 10-K, it had approximately 4.4 million paid subscribers at the end of 2016, or just 5% of the company's total 81 million active users across all services. But at what cost? The pressure will now be on to grow Pandora Premium's subscriber base, since Pandora's cost structure is changing as a result. Specifically, Pandora is on the hook for unspecified minimum payments: In addition, to support the launch of these services we have entered into direct license agreements with the major record labels, which agreements entail substantial minimum guaranteed content acquisition cost payments by us. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop and launch Pandora Premium, or obtain and maintain the content license rights to enable the offering of Pandora Plus and Pandora Premium. Further, in a number of cases, our direct license agreements with record labels require that we launch an on-demand subscription offering, and the rates for content acquisition costs payable under certain of our direct license agreements with record labels are significantly affected by the number of subscribers we are able to attract and retain to our subscription services, including Pandora Premium.  It's notable that some of the licenses require Pandora to get into on-demand, more evidence that the industry would highly prefer that model. Throughout Pandora's history, it streamed content based upon statutory licenses created by the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995 and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 that typically apply to terrestrial radio stations, which earned the ire of much of the music industry. That's why it was such a big deal when Pandora inked direct licensing agreements with major record labels last September ahead of Pandora Premium's unveiling. Pandora said last month that it took just six months to ink these deals. It's good that Pandora is finally getting into the on-demand streaming market, since that's where consumers are gravitating, but it's also probably too little, too late.

We’ve seen plenty of leaks that all tell the same general story. But it’s only a story about the phone’s design, which means the iPhone’s most important feature remains a mystery. Sure, the handset will have a large edge-to-edge OLED screen complete with an embedded fingerprint sensor. It’ll sport an advanced 3D camera, and it’ll offer wireless charging. But what about the software? How will iOS 11 put all the changes that we keep hearing about to good use? One graphic designer has given this subject a lot of thought and came up with an amazing iPhone 8 concept that highlights the core software features that may be headed to the upcoming new Apple flagship phone. Don't Miss: Leaks reveal the 10 most exciting new features coming to Samsung’s Galaxy S8 Discovered by Apple Insider, Gabor Balogh’s iPhone 8 (or iPhone X) concept is a lot better than other similar creations, as the designer also explains his line of thinking. In a detailed detailed post, Balogh explains his choices for the concept iPhone 8 he created. The designer believes that Siri will play a major role in the upcoming iPhone. Other major technologies that Apple is betting big on — including face recognition, augmented reality, big data, and machine learning would — also be at the core of the operating system that powers Apple’s edge-to-edge iPhone. In Balogh’s view, lifting the iPhone would automatically turn on the rear camera, with the screen becoming translucent. Siri would be able to both hear the user and view the phone’s surroundings in order to provide smart, context-aware responses. The virtual Siri/home button would be found in the same place where the physical button currently resides, but the entire action area flanking it would be occupied by apps that Siri thinks you’d want to use next, depending on what you’re currently doing. AR would also play a major role in navigation apps, as it would superimpose directions right on top of the real world, making the chore of finding one’s way even easier. Similarly, AR features would also be built into other apps. Balogh also believes health will be a major focus in iOS 11, as the iPhone could be used to monitor real-time health data from friends and loved ones. While this feature could be cool, it would only work if those people would actually wear smart devices that monitor such data. Read More At the end of the day, this is just a great iPhone concept that doesn’t have anything to do with Apple’s actual iPhone 8 plans. However, Balogh is right in one regard: The size of the screen alone is just a small piece of the puzzle. “This design concept proved [to] me that edge-to-edge screens won’t happen just because of aesthetic purposes,” he explains. “[The design] can only come along with a revolutionary new feature from Apple, which fills up the whole screen with appropriate content. In this case, not the bigger display, but the new killer feature would sell the iPhone X.” We’ll just have to wait and see what killer features Apple packs inside iOS 11.

Head below for all the details. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Apple Music is hosting daily interviews and concerts at 612 W 4th Street, the location of the now-defunct La Zona Rosa club. In most instances, the interviews are being broadcast live on Beats 1, though the concerts appear to be limited to those in attendance. Last night, Apple hosted Spoon, as well as Marian Hill for a small concert. Hill’s song “Down” became a smash hit after it was featured in an AirPods commercial last month. Tonight, Apple is hosting hip-hop artist Vince Staples, while tomorrow night will see the performance of DJ duo The Chainsmokers. Finally, Apple Music will host three acts on the Thursday night: Austin Millz, Brittany Sky, and Southside. As for who gets to attend these shows, the official SXSW schedule indicates that only those with “SXSW Badges & Artist Wristbands” are able to get in the door, meaning it’s a pretty restricted event. Apple Music has, however, been documenting its week at SXSW on Twitter and Snapchat, sharing clips from interviews and performances that have already taken place. The company has also been sharing content on Twitter using the hashtag “#AppleMusicWest4th” with each tweet. .@vincestaples went big to close out night 2 at #AppleMusicWest4th in Austin! 🙌 pic.twitter.com/icBsz5kOt6 — Beats 1 (@Beats1) March 15, 2017 This year’s efforts are relatively small compared to the iTunes Festival that was held at SXSW in 2014. That event marked the first and only time the iTunes Festival (now known as the Apple Music Festival) had come to the United States. It featured performances by acts such as Coldplay, Imagine Dragons, Pitbull, and ZEDD. This year, Apple Music and Beats 1 head Zane Lowe is a keynote speaker at SXSW, taking the stage on Thursday at 11AM. Lowe will likely discuss the music industry as a whole, hopefully offering up some behind-the-scenes info on Apple Music and Beats 1.

From the iPhone 8 that everyone is talking about to new MacBooks, iPads, and Apple Watch 3 and major software updates. After covering this space for years, here are our 2017 Apple predictions. We saw the iPhone 7 and a new MacBook Pro arrive last year, but many users are still hoping for a 2017 Mac Mini, a new iPad mini and other new Apple products. Will 2017 be the year that Apple answers the calls to deliver these products as well as a new Mac Pro? Only time will tell, but Tim Cook recently reaffirmed Apple’s commitment to “Pro” users and there are a lot of Apple products that need an update. 2017 Apple Predictions Everything you can expect from Apple in 2017. This is a list of what we think we will see from Apple in 2017 across the product line. We’ll catch you up on the latest rumors for those devices and for fringe items set expectations on whether or not we will see an update this year. Apple is notoriously slow to update desktops like the Mac Mini, leaving users to swear, “This is the year!” as Spring approaches. The iPad upgrades are easier to predict but still aren’t as specific as the old reliable iPhone update that comes every fall just like Daylight Saving Time. Here’s what you can expect from Apple in 2017; iPhone 8 iPhone 7s & iPhone 7s Plus iOS 11 iPad Pro 2 iPad Air 3 iPad mini Apple Watch 3 macOS 10.13 2017 MacBook Pro 2017 MacBook 2017 Mac Mini 2017 Mac Pro We expect a Spring Apple event in March or April. We know about a developer event in June where we should see iOS 11 and macOS 10.13. After that, we expect one Apple fall event, and possibly a second depending on how everything shakes out this fall. iPhone 8   1 / 10 We expect the iPhone 8 from Apple this year. This is the flagship iPhone for 2017, and it may only come in one size.  Expect a huge 5.8-inch or 5.5-inch display in a phone that isn't much bigger than the iPhone 7. Apple will switch to OLED, like the screens on Samsung smartphones. Expect a new edge-to-edge display and to see Touch ID as part of a display with no physical home button.  Count on a completely new design, wireless charging and a faster processor to power what may be the most expensive iPhone yet.  We expect an iPhone 8 release date in the fall, shortly after an Apple event. iPhone 8 concept by Georgy Pashkov.     1 / 10 One Response 03/15/2017 Richard Spafford Reply No new iMac update expected?

You’d think that there aren’t many secrets to do with replacing glass screens and fixing iPhones that have gone for a swim in the toilet, but in Apple’s secret walled garden, everything is a trade secret. Motherboard‘s Jason Koebler has been reporting on the Apple Store’s repair system for a while now, and he finally got his hands on the holy grail: pictures of Apple’s secret repair machine, which allows Apple to replace the Touch ID sensor on repaired phones. That’s a big deal, because it’s the one component that third-party repair stores have been unable to crack so far. The calibration machine that all Apple Stores have holds the secrets to why. Don't Miss: Do you live in Boston or New Jersey? Pornhub will plow you for free As Koebler explained in an earlier post, the iPhone Calibration Machine is a general testbed that allows repaired iPhones to be calibrated to factory standards before being returned to customers. From the sounds of things, they go through a series of tests to calibrate the display, touchscreen, camera, and internal sensors: “It was a big clunky machine that honestly looked like someone built it in their backyard,” a former Apple Genius told me. “There were different ‘moulds’ that different iPhone models would go into before going in the machine, and it would take around 30 minutes … there was some weird liquid that needed to be placed in the machine that we would have to wear gloves with to fix it. Lots of gas type valves and whatnot. It literally looked like some backyard home job. Not very Apple-like at all.” But the important part, at least for third-party repair stores, is how the calibration machine allows a new Touch ID sensor to be installed. Koebler goes into detail about the pairing of the Touch ID sensor and Secure Enclave here, but the short version is that without the calibration machine, a new Touch ID sensor can’t be installed on an iPhone. That obviously makes it impossible to fix the home button on newer iPhones outside of an Apple store, but it also makes working on a broken screen incredibly fiddly. Head over to the Motherboard article to see the pictures of Apple’s hacked-together machine in action, and make sure to check out the previous coverage while you’re at it.

Speculation continues to point to a higher price for Apple's upcoming 10th-anniversary iPhone. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Mar 14, 2017 at 6:33PM In recent years, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has subtly increased the average prices of its new iPhones by introducing higher-priced models, larger storage tiers, and even a small price hike to the base version of the latest "Plus" iPhone. But despite Apple's higher pricing options for its new iPhones, the tech giant may be about to increase the price of the smartphone even more. Apple's upcoming 10th-anniversary flagship iPhone, "is expected to be the ultimate iPhone," Fast Company said in February. But this all-out redesign will come with a steep price tag "north of $1,000," Fast Company's Mark Sullivan reports, citing "a source with knowledge of Apple's plans." iPhone 7. Image source: Apple. Why the iPhone 8 could cost $1,000 or more Why would Apple charge $1,000 for an iPhone? Speculation about the upcoming device, which the ever-active Apple rumor-mill often refers to as iPhone 8 or iPhone X (a nod to the iPhone's 10th anniversary), suggests the new iPhone will include some significant new features. Rumors point to a possible OLED display covering the entire front side of the device, higher storage tiers, wireless charging, an upgraded battery, and a new type of 3D Touch sensor that works on a bezel-less display. With new features like these, Apple will likely increase the price of the model, enabling the company to maintain its fat profit margin, which has ranged between about 38% to 40% in recent years. Understanding iPhone pricing It's worth noting that a close look at the pricing of Apple's current iPhone lineup shows how $1,000 isn't far from where the company's highest-priced iPhones are today. For instance, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus cost $849 and $969, respectively, when customers upgrade to the highest storage tier of 256GB. It seems conservative to estimate, therefore, that a totally redesigned iPhone with an impressive list of significant new features, as well as higher storage options, would cost north of $1,000. iPhone SE. Image source: Apple. Further, Apple does sell cheaper iPhones alongside its latest and greatest flagship versions of its smartphone. So, customers wanting to buy a less expensive iPhone will continue to have options. Recently, Apple has explicitly demonstrated its interest in introducing lower-cost iPhones. The $399 iPhone SE, which was launched last March, reinvigorated Apple's lower-cost offering with new technology and a more powerful processor, helping Apple stay more relevant in emerging markets where lower smartphone prices are more important to consumers. Apple could easily continue strengthening its offering at lower prices even as it introduces more expensive models. Apple could do this a number of ways, including refreshing the iPhone SE with a newer version of the $400 device, introducing an iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus at the same price as the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and lowering the prices of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus as new iPhones take their place. So, yes: Apple's upcoming flagship, 10th-anniversary iPhone could easily cost $1,000 or more. However, this doesn't mean Apple will be shying away from its efforts to stay competitive at lower prices by refreshing cheaper models and lowering the price of models as they age.

By Tas Bindi | March 14, 2017 -- 23:08 GMT (16:08 PDT) | Topic: Tech Industry After a seven-month investigation, the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) has found Apple to be fixing the prices of certain iPhone models in Russia, which contravenes article 11, part 5 of the Federal Law on Protection of Competition [PDF]. The Russian antitrust regulator said on Tuesday that Apple's local subsidiary told 16 retailers to maintain the recommended prices of the iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, and iPhone 6s Plus. what's hot on zdnet Windows 10 tip: Master advanced window-snapping techniques How ethics migrate to the cloud Oracle CTO Ellison fixated on AWS, infrastructure as a service but why? AMD's Ryzen 5 threatens Intel's grip on the mainstream PC market The FAS found that Apple Russia monitored the retail prices of these iPhones, and in the event that the company felt the prices were "inappropriate", it would send emails to retailers with a request to change them. According to the regulator, non-compliance with Apple's pricing guidelines may have led to the termination of agreements between the iPhone maker and retailers. A provision in the contracts allows Apple to terminate agreements without an explanation to retailers, FAS stated. Andrei Tsarikovsky, the state secretary and deputy head of FAS Russia, said Apple cooperated with the FAS during its investigation, ended its price fixing practices, and has set up antitrust compliance and training protocols to ensure that it operates within the confines of Russia's antimonopoly legislation in the future. A penalty has not been set, although the Financial Times reported it could be as much as 15 percent of Apple's sales in Russia. The company has three months to appeal the decision once the full ruling is published later in March. In May last year, Google lost an antimonopoly appeal in Russia after the FAS found Google using its dominant Android position to force its own apps and services on users -- reducing competition. The search giant was fined $6.75 million for preinstalling apps on Android phones. In November, the FAS launched an investigation into whether Microsoft is abusing its dominance in the antivirus software market, upon receiving a complaint from Moscow-based internet security company Kaspersky Lab.

Twitter Facebook More iPad screen sizes unlikely to stop slump Analysts ponder rumors of additional tablet choices Gregg Keizer (Computerworld (US)) 15 March, 2017 01:44 - - - - print email Comments Apple would be smart to make good on speculation about new iPad screen sizes, a pair of analysts said today. "The tablet has evolved from a general-purpose device to more of a specialized device," argued Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research, when asked about long-circulating rumors of a coming expansion to the iPad line. "Certain sizes are better optimized for more specialized applications." Talk of additional iPads -- notably one with a 10.5-in. screen -- has circulated for months, kick started by Ming-Chi Kuo, a financial analyst with KGI Securities. More recently, however, rumors focused on a spring launch, perhaps this month, perhaps in May or June. Apple last changed the portfolio's pricing in September 2016, but except for the 9.7-in. iPad Pro introduced a year ago, the hardware has remained static since the fall of 2015. And during that stretch iPad unit sales continued to contract -- the slump has now lasted three years -- and tablet revenue continued to shrink in raw numbers and percentage of Apple's total. Apple sold 13.1 million iPads in the December 2016 quarter, down 19% from the same period the year prior. Meanwhile, iPad revenue of $5.5 billion was 22% lower than in the December quarter of 2015. CEO Tim Cook has not changed how he has described the iPad to Wall Street -- in January, Cook again said he was "very bullish" on the tablet -- nor laid out a strategy to return the line to growth. O'Donnell saw portfolio expansion as a simultaneous recognition of market reality and a way to increase sales. "To support more of these specialized usages means a wider variety of screen sizes," O'Donnell said. "That, for me, would be logical. And it would let Apple expand the number of price points as well." The original iPad Pro -- the 12.9-in. device unveiled in September 2015 -- was a good example of specialization, O'Donnell contended. "It did well by bringing up the ASP [average selling price], but it's not a mainstream product," he said. Ezra Gottheil, an analyst with Technology Business Research, echoed O'Donnell on the usefulness of more screen sizes. "It makes sense to give customers a wider range of choices," he said. Expanded options would be in keeping with the tablet market's maturation, Gottheil added. "That's part of the landscape for products we buy for practical and entertainment purposes both," he said. Even so, it's unlikely that Apple can reverse the iPad's course simply by multiplying screen sizes. "There's nothing in the universe that will make a zillion people buy [a tablet]," Gottheil said. Long replacement cycles -- getting longer by the year -- and for many original purchasers, no intention of ever buying another tablet, doom tablets to, at best, growth rates miniscule in comparison to those of five or six years ago. Last month, researcher IDC portrayed the overall tablet market as in a "spiraling decline," and said Apple's flagship was starting to "show signs of age." IDC forecast that tablet sales declines would continue through 2021. How will Apple tackle its iPad problem? Gottheil assumed it will hold to its core strategy of producing integrated hardware and software at a premium price. "That's a good, solid business," he pointed out with a nod to the $19 billion in revenue during 2016. "But is it ever going to explode again? No." In January, Cook used a company-standard line when answering a question about the iPad. "If I zoom out of the 90-day clock and look at it, we've got some exciting things coming on iPad," Cook pledged. To Apple's executives, there's always something around the corner, even if that corner is shrouded in mystery or further away than expected. O'Donnell was more matter-of-fact. "People have not felt the need to upgrade their iPads. But [more screen sizes] may stem the bleeding," he suggested.

CTO and cofounder Eyal Keren has penned an open letter to Apple asking the i-obsessed device maker to develop and deploy a "Live Update Service Certificate" as a way to sign JavaScript code so it can be pushed safely to iOS apps for instant content updates. Apple already reviews iOS apps destined for its App Store, to make sure they conform with its shifting and sometimes vague rules. In so doing, it manages mostly to limit the presence of malicious apps while also enforcing modest minimum standards for quality. The review process, however, can take anywhere from a few days to a week or more, which turns out to be inconvenient when app developers want to make immediate changes to their code. Code pushing (or hot patching) frameworks like Rollout and JSPatch emerged to give developers the ability to deploy code without Apple's involvement, an arrangement Apple until recently has tolerated. But over the past week, developers using Rollout and JSPatch in their apps have reported receiving warning notices from the company. While app modifications of this sort can be harmless – replacing interface elements with different designs, for example – they also have the potential to alter previously approved behavior through a technique known as method swizzling, which involves swapping one function for another. Apple's concern appears to be specific to Rollout and JSPatch because the two frameworks can "pass arbitrary parameters to dynamic methods." In theory, a developer could exploit this capability to call private APIs or to activate and deactivate a malicious function without detection. Other hot patching frameworks that haven't elicited a response from Apple, like Expo and CodePush, have more limited capabilities because they don't have the same access to native Objective-C or Swift methods. Keren, however, in a phone interview with The Register, said, "Rollout blocked private framework API calls a long time ago." He said he believes Apple's main concern has to do with the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack against the patching system, by which private information could be stolen. Keren added he wasn't aware of whether any such attack has occurred, but he acknowledges that Apple has a legitimate concern. Apple's desire to limit JavaScript injection may be reasonable, but the barrier it's putting into place is more of an obstacle to misuse than a guarantee of safety. Any app that communicates with a remote server can be coded to pass private information or perform other actions without Apple's knowledge or approval. Still, there are benefits to being able to update apps without seeking permission and waiting for a green light from Apple. Keren suggests Apple offer a service to legalize what has until now been a gray market activity. He would like to see Apple develop a means to issue Live Update Service Certificates, which would be similar to other Apple signing certificates. "Just as Apple signs .ipa files, which are pushed to the App Store and then downloaded to end user devices, we propose Apple begin to sign Javascript code, which is returned to the developer, who can then push it directly to live devices," Keren suggested in his post. "The Apple SDK would verify the signature authenticity and only execute verified code." The Register asked Apple to comment, but the company continued its habit of silence. Keren doesn't expect an immediate response from Apple. But pointing to the 50 million devices using Rollout and to the popularity of other frameworks that support pushing code changes through JavaScript, he said, "I think there's a need. Developers are struggling with the ability to continuously improve their apps." ® Tips and corrections 19 Comments More from The Register Apple accused of counter-revolutionary pricing in Russia Tovarishch Cook accused of sending retailers to gulag unless they follow price list 5 Comments Apple Watch exec Bob Mansfield 'gets into secret Apple car' Here in iCar, iCan only receive, iCan listen to you... 43 Comments Apple kills activation lock check, possible dirty stolen device hack Video Hardware hack steals serial numbers from legitimate users 9 Comments Apple, Amazon smash audiobook cabal after European pressure EU antitrust bod nods in approval as another market opens up 6 Comments USA!

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Security FBI’s Latest Battle with Silicon Valley – Google Gets Apple and Microsoft’s Support in Resisting a Court Order By Rafia Shaikh Mar 14, 2017 11Shares Share Tweet Submit After a Pennsylvania court ruled that Google has to hand over emails stored overseas in response to an FBI warrant, Apple and several other tech companies have come forward in Google’s support. While they may be rivals, there’s no bond like the tech-bond (cheesy, I admit) when it comes to law enforcement trying to get their own way and walk all over the tech industry. Following Apple’s battle with the FBI, it’s now Google’s turn to get some limelight. Related FBI Director: “There’s No Such Thing as Absolute Privacy in America” FBI brings tech giants together again Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Cisco have filed an amicus brief in support of Google’s decision to resist an FBI warrant demanding emails that are stored outside of the United States. Similar to last year’s Apple-FBI saga, tech companies worry that the decision would set a “troubling” precedent. “When a warrant seeks email content from a foreign data center, that invasion of privacy occurs outside the United States – in the place where the customers’ private communications are stored, and where they are accessed, and copied for the benefit of law enforcement, without the customer’s consent.” – Brief As we reported earlier the FBI had served a search warrant ordering Google to hand over overseas emails belonging to suspects in a criminal investigation. Google refused, arguing that a domestic search warrant could not apply to data stored in a foreign country. However, a Pennsylvania court disagreed, ordering Google to comply with the warrant. Google has appealed the ruling, and now several tech companies have filed a joint amicus brief in support of the search giant. Advertisement “Our sister nations clearly view US warrants directing service providers to access, copy, and transmit to the United States data stored on servers located within their territory as an extraterritorial act on the part of the US government.” – Brief The filing says that while the government isn’t necessarily doing anything wrong by asking for data stored overseas, it argues that the current law (the now-infamous Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986) doesn’t permit such an extension to the foreign territories and that it’s for Congress to decide whether SCA applies overseas, not the courts. Related FBI Must Spill the Beans on the Cost of Unlocking the San Bernardino iPhone – Court Filing Technology has changed dramatically since the SCA [Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2701 et seq., which Congress enacted as part of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986] became law. The Congress that drafted the SCA could barely have imagined the notion of storing emails halfway across the globe. That is why companies, commentators, and privacy advocates alike have long called for the SCA to be updated in light of the realities of 21st century technology. The question here, however, is the scope of the SCA as it now stands, not as Congress might eventually revise it. The brief argues that the SCA does not contain a “clear indication of an extraterritorial application,” which means courts cannot apply “statutes in ways that potentially risk ‘unintended clashes between our laws and those of other nations'”. It’s in the Silicon Valley’s interest to keep the US law enforcement from accessing customer data stored outside the US. It not only raises user privacy questions, but privacy advocates and the tech companies warn that following this precedent other countries – including those with a history of dissidents’ persecution – will also make similar requests to the American tech companies. “Equally troubling, it invites foreign nations to reciprocate by likewise demanding that local offices of U.S. technology companies turn over U.S. citizens’ private communications stored on U.S. soil. It also places technology companies that store customer data abroad in the untenable position of being compelled to risk violating foreign data privacy laws to comply with warrants issued by U.S. courts.” – Brief The decision would definitely set a dangerous precedent for any country to demand for user data. The amicus brief also referenced a similar case that was won by Microsoft earlier this year when it had refused to have over emails stored on servers in Ireland. Following the decision by the court, Google also cited this case and said that the “magistrate in this [Google’s] case departed from precedent”. “We plan to appeal the decision,” Google had said. “We will continue to push back on over-broad warrants.” – Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation: “There’s no such thing as absolute privacy in America” Share Tweet Submit <a href="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538336708&cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Related Courts in Contradiction: Microsoft Doesn’t Have to Comply, But Google Has to?

The Russian agency's deputy head, Andrey Tsarikovsky stated that "The company has adopted the necessary measures to eliminate violations of the law and is pursuing a policy to prevent similar violations in the future."   The Financial Times lastly noted that "Apple will have three months to challenge the decision in court after the full decision is published later this month, Mr Tsarikovsky added. Any fine under the anti-monopoly regulations could be as much as 15 per cent of Apple's Russian unit's sales, but would be decided in a few months."   While an Apple spokesperson stated that they worked closely with FAS during their investigation and are glad to put this matter behind them, the fact is that it's not over until the matter goes to court and the fine has been established.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Analysts at Citi increased their target price for AAPL from $140 to $160 based on iPhone 8 rumors, while Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities expects Apple’s new iPhone 8 to significantly impact the supply chain this year. Now, Morgan Stanley’s Kate Huberty is out with her thoughts on this year’s iPhone “super cycle,” explaining that she doesn’t think Wall Street realizes the full potential of iPhone 8… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Speaking to CNBC today, Huberty explained that she doesn’t believe this year’s “super cycle” is being fully appreciated. While analysts have been bullish, she doesn’t believe they’ve been bullish enough. Getting into specifics, Huberty explained that she predicts iPhone unit sales will rise by 20 percent in fiscal 2018, which is double what the rest of Wall Street is projecting at 10 percent. Huberty says that her “bull case” calls for 30 percent unit growth during fiscal 2018. The Morgan Stanley analyst also laid out some of her predictions for the iPhone 8, reiterating much of what we already know: “We do not think the super cycle is fully appreciated,” Huberty told CNBC PRO in an exclusive interview. “What we expect in September is a phone that has significant advancements in technology: OLED screens, 3-D sensors, wireless charging [and] likely some more advanced software in the area of artificial intelligence.” 20 percent unit growth year-over-year would be an incredibly impressive performance by Apple, but a few things could hinder such strong numbers. For one, supply shortages have been said to plague the iPhone 8 and could significantly impact sales during the first fiscal quarter of 2018, which begins on October 1st, 2017. It’s always good to take analyst predictions with a grain of salt, but multiple analysts have repeatedly been bullish on AAPL and the effects of the iPhone 8. AAPL was up last month due to strong earnings performance and beating analyst exceptions, while analysts have also repeatedly predicted an iPhone 8 super cycle and a continually increasing install base.

By Tony Lewis / Published 15th March 2017 GETTY Apple's Jade won the OLBG Mares' Hurdle on the first day at the Cheltenham Festival The brilliant Irish handler also scored with Labaik in the opener and Tiger Roll took the four-miler. Apple’s Jade, who was under the care of Willie Mullins last year, ended her former trainer’s monopoly in the OLBG Mares’ Hurdle when taking the prize for Elliott. Mullins, who has won the past eight runnings of the race, looked destined for more glory when his pair Vroum Vroum Mag and Limini set sail for home, but Apple’s Jade and Bryan Cooper mugged them on the line. Vroum Vroum Mag had to settle for second place with Limini, the 6-4 favourite, in third. “Today was her Gold Cup,” said Elliott. “We knew the ground would suit her and I put a tongue-tie on for the first time and it worked. “We kept our mouths shut after she was beaten by Limini at Punchestown because we knew she would come on a bit for that race. Cheltenham Festival 2017: The best pics from day one Tuesday, 14th March 2017 CHECK out the best pics from the first day of Cheltenham festival. 1 / 10 GETTY Cheltenham Festival: The best pics from day 1 “We knew the ground would suit her and I put a tongue-tie on for the first time and it worked” Gordon Elliott on Apple's Jade “You don’t want to get beat, but knowing she would improve we were fine. She’s tough as old boots.” Michael O’Leary, who famously moved Apple’s Jade from Mullins along with 59 other horses, said: “It’s a great training performance from Gordon. We all love Cheltenham. I have never had a winner on the Tuesday, so it is great to have the pressure off. “Now I know how Willie Mullins feels banging in the winners on the first day. Normally, I’m here sweating on the last day for a winner.” The way things went for Mullins yesterday – drawing a blank – it could be Mullins sweating for success on the last day. Jack Kennedy landed a Grade One race at the Festival yesterday – five weeks short of his 18th birthday. And the hugely talented young Irishman, having only his sixth ride at the meeting, beat the all-time great Ruby Walsh as he took the opening Sky Bet Supreme Novices’ Hurdle on 25-1 shocker Labaik. “It’s the best day of my life by a long chalk,” he beamed. “It’s a dream come true.” Elliott has always held Labaik in the highest regard despite his tendency to drop anchor at the start of his previous three races. “We haven’t got a horse to work with him in the yard,” he explained. “He’s a machine. We used the long whip to get him to start today. You can do it here but you can’t in Ireland. If he never jumps off again it doesn’t matter!” Labaik easily put the squeeze on Melon despite an untidy jump at the last flight. The Elliott bandwagon rolled on with a Tiger in the tank as he completed a stunning three-timer in the JT McNamara National Hunt Challenge Cup Chase. Tiger Roll, ridden by Elliott’s office assistant Lisa O’Neill, first hit the Festival headlines by winning the JCB Triumph Hurdle in 2014. He hit the front on the turn for home only to find Edwulf snapping at him over the last two fences. Just when it looked like he might be another winner for JP McManus, Edwulf broke down badly on the run-in, leaving Missed Approach and Haymount to fill the placings.

Read: FBI Director Comey On Encryption: 'There Is No Such Thing As Absolute Privacy In America' Apple’s addition of Zdziarski to the team comes after he said in 2014 that the company had created a security “backdoor” that could compromise private data. Zdziarski said authorities or individuals with malicious intent could access sensitive information in the same way an Apple “Genius” would. Zdziarski’s recent blog post added: “This decision marks the conclusion of what I feel has been a matter of conscience for me over time. Privacy is sacred; our digital lives can reveal so much about us – our interests, our deepest thoughts, and even who we love. I am thrilled to be working with such an exceptional group of people who share a passion to protect that.” Last year, Zdziarski strongly defended Apple in its fight against the FBI after the company refused to unlock an iPhone that belonged to one of the San Bernardino shooters. Zdziarski filed an amicus brief along with other security experts claiming if the court ruled in favor of the FBI and ordered Apple to create a forensic software for the government, it would put iPhones at risk in the future. Read: Email Security: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, File Amicus Brief Over Google Case “This spread increases the risk that the forensic software will escape Apple’s control either through theft, embezzlement, or order of another court, including a foreign government,” the amicus brief stated. “If that happens, the custom code could be used by criminals and governments to extract sensitive personal and business data from seized, lost, or stolen iPhones, or it could be reverse engineered, giving attackers a stepping stone on the path towards their goal of defeating Apple’s passcode security.” The FBI dropped the case against Apple and instead got Israeli firm Cellebrite to unlock the iPhone.

The feature works a lot like Apple’s Reading List feature in Safari — there’s a new “Read Later” icon that appears on the share sheet in Chrome, which saves articles locally on the device to read later, even without an internet connection. Articles saved to the Reading List are accessible through the menu on Chrome the same way one would navigate to Bookmarks or History. Unlike Apple’s Reading List or Pocket, however, locally saved articles are only saved to the specific device (Chrome for Mac doesn’t actually support the new Reading List at all). Additionally, unlike Apple’s own Reading List or Pocket, Google’s implementation saves the entire page, instead of a stripped-down text version. Still, it’s a nice addition to the app, that helps Google maintain feature parity with Apple’s own Safari browser on iOS. Google previously added a similar feature to Chrome for Android back in December, although it’s implemented a bit differently than the iOS version. The Android version allows users to download pages through an arrow icon in the menu, but treats saved pages like any other downloaded file, compared to the iOS version which more explicitly marks things as “read it later.” More From The Verge The Hawai’ian volcano that created a spectacular firehose of lava just collapsed Apple, Facebook, Google, and 94 others file opposition to Trump's immigration ban Google’s Super Bowl ad accidentally set off a lot of Google Homes Lady Gaga opened her Super Bowl performance with a protest anthem Trump is turning Elon Musk into a crony capitalist Why the sounds of eating make some people so angry Now Trending A US ally shot down a $200 drone with a $3 million Patriot missile This will be a bigger problem as more drones show up on the battlefield You can now watch these declassified nuclear test movies on YouTube They’re being digitized so they’re not lost forever When your child’s favorite YouTube celebrity is a secret racist March 16th, 2017 This Article has a component height of 9.

If you're looking for a great camera, we suggest that you either compromise a bit with an alternative mid-range smartphone or pay more for a true flagship. Buy now from OPPOMART OPPO may not have the same level of brand recognition in the West as Huawei or ZTE, but they’ve long dominated the Chinese market. That should come as no surprise too, given their track record of launching impressive smartphones like the R7, N3, and Find 7. Related Articles   Best unlocked Android phones (March 2017)2 weeks ago   Best cheap Android phones (February 2017)3 weeks ago It’s quite evident that OPPO is hoping to continue their successful trend with the comfortably mid-range OPPO R9s, a follow-up to last year’s R9. The question is, should you consider the OPPO R9s over similarly priced options like the ZTE Axon 7, the Honor 8, or the OnePlus 3T? Now is the time to take a closer look with our OPPO R9s review! Design It that really an Android? It looks a lot like an iPhone! During my time with the R9s, I was frequently asked questions along the lines of “It that really an Android? It looks a lot like an iPhone!” Perhaps I shouldn’t criticize the phone identification skills (or lack thereof) of others in this case. The R9s does look a lot like the iPhone, from its identically-shaped body to its unmistakably similar speaker grill. There’s also an iPhone-esque silver ring around the home button, and, yes, to truly take inspiration from Apple means to also include the notorious rear camera bump. Don’t fret too much, though, as that bump is only mildly annoying when tapping the top left part of the display on hard flat surfaces. Oddly enough, the antenna lines on this model are a notable departure from the preceding R9’s solid lines. OPPO’s intention here may have been to distance themselves from Apple. In any case, OPPO isn’t fooling anyone with their design tactics. In any case, OPPO isn't fooling anyone with their design tactics Joking aside, the R9s’ design is indeed quite nice despite its derivative nature. It’s remarkably thin and light at 6.6mm and 145g, both of which measures undercut comparable iPhone models. The R9s’ build quality is where this design truly shines. The all-metal body is well tried-and-tested to say the least, as it offers both a premium look and premium in-hand feel. This is becoming increasingly important for mid-range devices like the OPPO R9s, as consumers demand even more for their money. Thankfully, the small touches appear to have received the same high level of attention. The sides buttons are nice and tactile. The chamfers are clean. The home button doesn’t wiggle. Small details like these are sometimes overlooked but are perhaps just as important, so OPPO’s level of focus here is great to see. Since the R9s’ capacitive home button includes an embedded fingerprint reader, you can simply touch the button to unlock the phone or authorize certain apps or purchases. It seems that the R9s is using the same reader as the OnePlus 3T, given that both OPPO and OnePlus are owned by parent company BBK Electronics. See also: OnePlus 3T review January 31, 2017 The R9s' fingerprint reader is really fast Regardless, the R9s’ fingerprint reader is really fast while maintaining a high level of accuracy. This is one of the best experiences available to date, which is especially impressive when considering the R9s’ price. To the sides of the home button are two illuminated keys: multitask and back, respectively. The illumination could be a tad brighter, but certainly does the job in most situations. Although the layout is the opposite of the back-home-multitask standard layout, some prefer having the back button on the right side, including myself. Display Thankfully, excellent displays have become the norm for anything priced more than about $300. And, for the most part, the OPPO R9s’ display lives up to my expectations. This model’s screen is sized at 5.5-inches, although if you’re looking for something slightly larger, the 6.0-inch OPPO R9s Plus might be worth considering. The display size translates to an average handling experience, helped marginally by the remarkably small side bezels. Those bezels are quite stylish too, although it’s worth mentioning that the black border around the display does detract some of that beauty. Colors appear very punchy and oversaturated Since it is an AMOLED panel, colors appear very punchy and oversaturated. Many people prefer this look, however, as it makes everything look quite vibrant. There’s also a bundled “eye protection mode” accessible from either the quick toggles or the settings, which adjusts the color temperature to be warmer or more yellow. This thereby reduces the amount of blue light, which is said to be bad before bedtime. While I’m unaware of substantial research that concludes that this actually improves sleep, it certainly seems that it couldn’t hurt. The display’s brightness level range is about what I expected. It’s low enough for darker environments, and high enough for some outdoor environments. If it’s blue skies and sunny though, you might have some trouble reading the display. For reference, it’s brighter than the Axon 7’s display, but falls short of the OnePlus 3T’s display. Also read: ZTE Axon 7 review OPPO has implemented Corning Gorilla Glass 5, which provides protection against both scratches and drops. Sadly, I found the display to scratch surprisingly easily. See also: Corning Gorilla Glass labs tour: Shattering glass for perfection February 1, 2017 The display coating is dangerously close to being a deal-breaker I also noticed a very strange display coating on both of my review units, which makes the glass an absolute fingerprint magnet. This is the worst display for fingerprints that I’ve used in recent memory, as smudges linger even after cleaning. While this will surely annoy people to varying degrees, I personally find this to be dangerously close to being a deal-breaker. Performance With the R9s, OPPO has made a switch from the Mediatek Helio P10 to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625. Although I never had the chance to use the R9 specifically, I have used several smartphones with the Helio P10. Based on my experiences with both chips, I think this is a small but certainly welcomed upgrade. There’s also 4GB of RAM, so you should have no trouble with moderate to heavy multitasking. Day-to-day performance is good, but not great. During my time with R9s, I didn’t really take issue with its minor sluggishness, but I definitely understand that some may be looking for something a bit snappier. The Snapdragon 625 is a firmly mid-range chip, so it’s expectedly not as impressive as the high-end Snapdragon 820 and Snapdragon 821 in both day-to-day performance and benchmark scores. If you’re doing enough research to be reading this review, chances are that you’ll see this as a considerable drawback Since the ZTE Axon 7 and the OnePlus 3T ship with the 820 and 821, however, this puts the R9s behind of the pack in the performance category. It’s a somewhat minor difference, but if you’re doing enough research to be reading this review, chances are that you’ll see this as a considerable drawback. Hardware Good news for travelers or anyone wishing to use multiple phone numbers: similar to many options coming out of China, the OPPO R9s is an unlocked dual-SIM smartphone. If you don’t plan on taking advantage of this feature, you can instead use the extra slot for a microSD card, up to 256 GB. The R9s does include 64GB of storage out of the box though, so you may end up not having to worry about storage at all. GSM: 850/900/1800/1900MHz WCDMA: 850/900/1900/2100MHz TD-LTE: Band 38/39/40/41 FDD-LTE: Band 1/3/5/7/8/20/28 Unfortunately for many of our readers, the OPPO R9s has limited 4G LTE support. In the United States, for example, you’ll be stuck with 3G on both AT&T and T-Mobile (and their MVNOs), which is possibly this phone’s biggest drawback for Western users as the R9s’ primary competitors all include support for US 4G LTE. It is important to keep in mind, though, that this phone will work wherever it is officially sold. The United States sadly just isn’t one of those markets. The side-firing speaker on the OPPO R9s is reminiscent of the OnePlus 3T’s. The sound is about the same, but the audio quality does seem ever so slightly better here. It’s not nearly as good as the ZTE Axon 7’s dual stereo front-facing speaker setup, but it gets the job done. Fortunately, OPPO has included a 3.5mm headphone jack, so you won’t be needing to transition to that dongle life with this device. There’s also a neat equalizer included, dubbed Real HD sound. OPPO states that this feature was developed in cooperation with Dirac Research AB, “the world’s leading audio technology company.” There are several profiles to switch between based on the genre of music you’re playing, but it would be even cooler if it included and switched to a video profile automatically. Currently, you have to dig fairly deep into the settings to turn it off, so if you’re like me and you’re switching between Spotify and YouTube frequently, you might be tempted to just turn it off completely as it does not sound very well when listening to normal speaking voices. There's also a strange YouTube audio sync issue There’s also a strange YouTube audio sync issue, which affects both headphone and speaker output. It could be worse, but constantly having audio delayed by even a split second might just drive you crazy. Battery life I was a bit worried that the 3,010mAh non-removable battery wouldn’t be enough to power through a full day of use. However, it seems that OPPO has added effective battery life optimizations, as I was consistently able to get either one and a half days of usage with around four hours of screen-on time or one day of usage with around seven hours of screen-on time. Those are some pretty impressive numbers regardless of how you frame it. My testing was performed while connected to 3G networks Do keep in mind, however, that my testing was performed while connected to 3G networks, which is easier on the battery and therefore inflates these tests results. For what it’s worth, I also used the phone while connected to my college’s Wi-Fi network, which covers the entire campus very well with few “dead zones”, even outdoors. During these days, battery life was more or less the same, which is to say it was excellent. When you do need to charge the R9s, you can take advantage of OPPO’s proprietary VOOC Fast Charging, which OPPO claims charges the phone from 0 to 75 percent in just thirty minutes. That’s a really impressive charge rate, especially when you consider how well VOOC handles heat dissipation. Much of the heat generated stays in the wall adapter, rather than making its way to the phone’s internals. Although Qualcomm Quick Charge has the advantage of being way more ubiquitous, it’s hard to argue with VOOC’s features. See Also: Qualcomm Quick Charge vs OPPO VOOC vs MediaTek PumpExpress+ vs Motorola TurboPower vs the others February 4, 2016 Oh, MicroUSB, it seems like you just won’t go away; despite many smartphone manufacturers having already made the transition to the new reversible USB Type-C standard, OPPO is evidently still living in early 2015 with the R9s. I suppose you might find this nice if you don’t wish to purchase new charging cables, but if you’ve already made the transition or would like the features that USB Type-C has to offer, you’ll be out of luck here. What a bummer. Camera The phone's 'now, it's clear' tagline is a sort of a double entendre OPPO has focused much of their marketing on the R9s’ camera. The phone’s “now, it’s clear” tagline is a sort of a double entendre, implying that the R9s offers clear photos which makes it the clear choice. It’s arguably a bit cheesy, but what’s much more important is whether the claim holds water. The camera setup certainly looks pretty killer on paper. OPPO states that the R9s features a customized Sony IMX398 1/2.8 inch sensor, which is the second latest sensor from Sony at the time of writing. The IMX398 is actually making its debut with this phone, which is quite impressive for a mid-range smartphone. Anyway, this particular camera is a 16MP f/1.7 shooter. The pixel size is larger than average at 1.12µm, which translates to more light per pixel, which should help in low-light conditions. See also: Best Android smartphone cameras 2 weeks ago So, what’s the verdict? Well, our sample images reveal that the R9s is somewhere in between the OnePlus 3T and Google Pixel XL. It’s better than everything we’ve seen at around $400 thus far, but doesn’t quite beat out the best shooters. Most images shot in good lighting are quite impressive with natural-looking colors, balanced levels of saturation, and minimal noise and distortion. And, oh, are these images sharp! Combined with the sharp sensor and dual phase detection autofocus, it’s quite difficult to capture a blurry photo. The amount of detail that the R9s offers is spectacular, something which you can fully appreciate when viewing the images on a larger high resolution display. In this sense, OPPO’s marketing is well justified. Dynamic range is only about average though, and HDR doesn’t really help in getting balanced shots of extreme highlights and shadows. In addition, the true to life color nature inevitably means that some images exhibit muted colors. Within perspective, however, these are some pretty minor complaints. The camera holds up reasonably well in low-light conditions. Of course, the sensor has to deal with much less light, and as a consequence has to find a balance between sharpness and noise levels. That’s why many of our sample low-light images appear soft and slightly noisy, despite the fast aperture and larger pixel size. Perhaps optical image stabilization would have helped here by allowing for longer shutter speeds. Perhaps optical image stabilization would have helped here by allowing for longer shutter speeds Although the rear camera does support 4K video capture, I found the quality to be slightly below average. That’s a bit disappointing, so if you plan on doing more videography than photography, you may want to consider other options. The front-facing 16MP f/2.0 camera is capable of delivering some very nice selfies. The built-in Beauty mode is also surprisingly balanced. The skin softening is kept at a reasonable level, therefore producing semi-natural looking shots. Unsurprisingly, OPPO’s camera app takes a lot of inspiration from Apple’s. The interface makes it easy to quickly shoot images and the primary camera modes can be accessed directly from the main view. There are a few extra modes available too: Ultra HD, GIF, Expert Mode, Various Filters, and Double Exposure. The “expert mode” is a bit quirky though; you can’t toggle back to autofocus without exiting and then re-entering the mode, you can only increment shutter speeds by seconds, and you can’t adjust processing levels like contrast and saturation. Software OPPO’s desire to imitate Apple is heavily emphasized with their software. The R9s ships with ColorOS 3.0 over Android 6.0 Marshmallow, which provides a very iOS-like experience. In fact, any of the colors and design attributes are recognizably from iOS. OPPO’s software is also disappointing in the sense that it includes very few extra features and customizations compared to stock Android. It even strips some features like multi-user support and the ability to change different audio levels from a single menu. The overall experience is decently polished, but I noticed a number of minor issues during my time with the phone. For example, when do not disturb is enabled, the time at the center top of the screen is replaced with “do not disturb”. In order to see the time, you have to first swipe down for the quick toggles and then swipe right to see the notification panel. This decision was quite frankly idiotic This decision was quite frankly idiotic, as I’m more likely to want to see the time during nightly do not disturb hours than I am during the day. The software already adds a moon icon next to the battery icon when do not disturb is enabled, so I’m perplexed by the reasoning behind this. A few more minor complaints: you can’t see black text previews in notifications since the phone sets the color to dark gray instead of the default white, the settings icon appears “broken” near the bottom right, and putting the phone into developer mode can be a nightmare. You’re required to complete captcha each time you’d like to use it and you’ll be constantly reminded that it’s on with a flashing yellow banner at the top of the screen. The cumulative look is quite frankly confusing Thankfully, the phone doesn’t ship with any bloatware and only a standard set of system apps. Like the rest of the software, those apps are mediocre. My main gripe is the amount of design inconsistency between apps. It sometimes seems as if OPPO assigned each app to different teams and minimized communication between those teams. The cumulative look is quite frankly confusing and inevitably gives a strong impression of sloppy work. It’s not that I don’t like Android skins. I’ve praised both MIUI and FlyMe quite extensively in the past for offering commendably polished experiences. For Western users, those skins are already a difficult sell, so it’s hard to imagine why anyone would choose this over OnePlus’ stock-like OxygenOS. OPPO’s ColorOS just doesn’t have the same amount of polish that other Android skins have. Based on OPPO’s Android update history, we estimate the probability of the R9s receiving an Android 7.0 Nougat update to be moderately unlikely. Unfortunately, it looks like you’ll be stuck on the nearly one and a half year old Marshmallow for the lifetime of the phone.

Buy now from OPPOMART Conclusion The OPPO R9s has an excellent camera, offers impressive battery life, and features a nice display. However, the number of compromises here is staggering. Among derivative design and software, the R9s has sloppy software, offers below average performance, and has a bleak software support outlook. For Western users, the strange display coating, YouTube audio sync issue, and limited availability are even bigger issues to consider. While we greatly appreciate OPPO’s efforts to bring an excellent camera to this price point, we simply cannot recommend the R9s when options like the ZTE Axon 7, the Honor 8, and the OnePlus 3T are available at similar prices. If you’re looking for a great camera, we suggest that you either compromise a bit with one of these alternatives or pay more for a true flagship.

For obvious reasons, it’s also a device that few outside of Apple have ever seen before. After Motherboard put out a call for information, several former Apple Store employees replied, sharing details, as well as photos of the mysterious device. According to one former Genius, the title the company gives to its repair technicians, Apple started using this device following the launch of the iPhone 5s. It allows, among other things, Apple Store employees to ensure an iPhone repair has been completed properly before returning the device to a customer. The symbols on the left-hand side of the device reportedly allow an employee to calibrate an iPhone’s camera, while the “Flock Paper” above the symbols is used to ensure the screen is functioning properly. “It was a big clunky machine that honestly looked like someone built it in their backyard,” said the anonymous tipster to Motherboard‘s Jason Koebler.”There were different ‘moulds’ that different iPhone models would go into before going in the machine, and it would take around 30 minutes … there was some weird liquid that needed to be placed in the machine that we would have to wear gloves with to fix it. Lots of gas type valves and whatnot.” However, one of the most important repairs the device allows Apple’s repair technicians to complete is a pairing of a new TouchID sensor with an old iPhone. This is something that third-party repair shops, the kind that usually complete iPhone repairs for significantly less money than Apple, cannot do; one of the iPhone Calibration Machine’s features is a connection, via an iMac, to an internal Apple TouchID server. Motherboard details the economic consequences of this in a related article. Essentially, however, should Apple embed a fingerprint sensor inside of the next iPhone — and it’s looking likely that the company will —  it will become significantly more expensive for independent repair shops to replace a broken iPhone screen. In fact, as a result of the company’s current replacement policy and technological roadmap, consumers may be forced to go to Apple, and Apple only, should they need to fix their iPhone’s display moving forward. By way of comparison, this would be like car manufacturers forcing their customers to go to the car dealership anytime they need to do an oil change.

An oil change is maintenance, not a repair. It’s Me It was a poor analogy for that reason as well as the fact that no one is being forced. If your at repair requires a hoist then you take it to a garage with a hoist. If only your dealer invested in a hoist that’s where you’re going to have to bring it. Not because anyone forced you, but because that’s who invested in a hoist. LeMuffin That’s a terrible analogy. It’s more like you have to go to the dealer to replace a key, which is already the case. It’s Me Exactly. You’re not really being forced. It’s just too difficult a repair for others to perform. Those other store could potentially invest in the specialized machines required. Kenneth Rose But the thing is apple doesn’t allow the third party companies to get their hands on the machines, they want them, but apple won’t let them have them. It’s a propriety device they won’t let third parties use. It’s Me If they invested enough, they could probably circumvent anything proprietary. Apple is under no obligation to make anything proprietary available to others. levoila Well, you don’t have to go to the dealer to get a replacement car key, homedepot will be happy to make 1 for you LeMuffin I don’t know know what you drive but immobilizer chips have been mandatory in car keys for 10 years now. Only dealers can pair keys to cars now. Mr Dog Not on newer vehicles, unless they have found a way to hack them. ciderrules “By way of comparison, this would be like car manufacturers forcing their customers to go to the car dealership anytime they need to do an oil change.” Complete and utter BS. LeMuffin’s key analogy is close. A better one would be trying to replace the security module in your vehicle (Touch ID) that’s used to identify if you have the correct key (fingerprint) and then authorize the engine to start. And these modules are usually not available for purchase by anyone outside the dealer, and can’t be installed/coded by anyone other than a dealer. People always talk about Right to Repair or Magnusson Moss as if they’re a free-for-all that would allow anyone to repair anything in their devices. This simply isn’t true. The auto industry is the best example of this. Large numbers of common parts are available from aftermarket suppliers for pretty much any vehicle made. The exception to this are many electronic modules (which the aftermarket doesn’t want to invest the time or money into making their own versions) and security related items. The auto industry gets around this due to provisions in the Magnusson Moss Warranty Act which allow them to specify procedures for how repairs are to be made. This will be no different with Apple (or Samsung or any other electronic manufacturer). Since Touch ID is a security related item they won’t be forced to provide these parts or the equipment to install them to anyone outside of Apple stores. Batteries, speakers, microphones or switches (for example) would be the types of repairs where Apple could be forced to provide parts and tools for. TheTechSmith Making a consumer device look nice, weight little, etc. takes an incredible amount of R&D (i.e. labour and money). This is what you’d expect a device not meant for the consumer to look like. Why does it have to look nice or weigh little if a customer isn’t even supposed to see it? Saying it looks like it was built in someone’s back yard is a little harsh (I understand you were quoting someone else with that line). I’m sure if you were to walk into a Foxcon factory producing iPhone’s, this kind of design is what you’d see.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Magazine Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit Trump White House Sean Spicer’s Agony Will Never End—to His Boss’s Delight Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Trump White House Sean Spicer’s Agony Will Never End—to His Boss’s Delight Torn between a pugilistic, reality-rejecting boss and an increasingly incensed media, Sean Spicer continues to walk a tightrope. ″It’s a whole new world, and it’s a total culture shock,” says one person close to the press secretary. by Tina NguyenMarch 14, 2017 5:55 pm Email Facebook Twitter By Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images. One recent Saturday afternoon, Sean Spicer, the formerly amicable R.N.C. official who has since undergone a Kafkaesque metamorphosis into a bellicose, nihilistic, obfuscating press secretary for Donald Trump, was engaged in the quotidian act of buying some Apple products. Far from the gladiator pit of the James Brady Press Room, he was spotted in a Washington-area Apple store by Shree Chauhan, a former elementary school teacher who quickly reckoned that, since Spicer “doesn’t like the press,” she might as well ask him the questions that he often dodged from reporters on behalf of his boss. “Have you helped with the Russia stuff?” she asked, shoving an iPhone in his face. “Are you a criminal as well? Have you committed treason, too, just like the president?” Spicer stared at Chauhan, blinking in shock, his normally scowling, meaty jaw twitching wordlessly. “We have a great country,” he stuttered, hesitatingly, followed by a few “thank yous” and, at one point, he uttered, “Such a great country that allows you to be here.” Spicer then quickly gathered his white boxes into a snow-white bag and power-walked out of the door into the sunlight. Alas, he did not amble fast enough to escape the social-media maelstrom that resulted from Chauhan’s ambush Periscope livestream. Her video was played over 950,000 times. Thousands of viewers were astonished that Spicer, who often purports to be the more genial face of the Trump administration, said that Chauhan, an Indian-American, was allowed to live in America. It’s hard to watch the video without (1) cringing, and (2) recalling that Spicer, who seems to be growing accustomed to brawling with journalists daily, appears to have faded somewhat into the background. The Beltway insider press has taken notice, too. One recent headline from Politico referred to him as the “disappearing Sean Spicer,” observing that he has of late eased away from daily briefings in favor of off-camera press conferences and cozy one-on-one interviews in the safety of his West Wing office. It seemed as though Spicer, apoplectic, blustery, and increasingly pumpkin-like, was either being pulled back from the limelight because of his poor performance, or that his withdrawal was a deliberate strategy, designed to mess with the heads of a press corps that Trump has repeatedly attacked. VIDEO: Sean Spicer, the Voice of the White House One person close to Spicer insisted it was the latter. “Sean said at the beginning of the process that he wanted to shake up the way that the daily press briefings were done,” this person told me, citing Spicer’s idea to Skype in reporters from non-Beltway outlets, loop in not only local media outlets from far-flung states but also conservative publications such as Breitbart and LifeZette, which were once excluded from the White House. This strategy, of course, works best for an administration whose leader brandishes critical reports of his administration as “fake news” and could, hypothetically, wake up one morning and tweet out reality-bending claims that, for instance, Barack Obama had wiretapped his campaign headquarters. “I think that the White House is doing what’s best for them and not necessarily what’s best for the media,” this person told me. “That’s where the conflict really comes into play, and a lot of reporters really don’t like this approach. They want him to have an old-school consistency. It’s a whole new world and it’s a total culture shock.” This strategy, however, may simply be a short term fix, and one that is likely to compound the enduring agony of a press secretary once widely trusted by the media during a less tumultuous time in American politics. ”I don’t think it’s a strategy. I think it’s a coping mechanism,” a Spicer associate, who has known the press secretary for years, said to me. ”He’s ping-ponging between the demands of his boss and his natural inclination to be forthright with the media. That’s what that is. It’s a way to try to deal with the blowback and try to cope with it so that he can just get through the day.“ (A spokesperson for the White House did not return request for comment.) This person cited the White House communications team’s surprising reticence on the weekend in which Trump tweeted his jarring wiretapping claims. Trump, this person continued, does not employ the practice of alerting his team in advance to his most incendiary tweets, which constantly puts Spicer at risk of sitting on a grenade. Addressing the media in private, this person suggested, may be a way for Spicer to conceal from the public his own surprise and frustration. “Maybe it’s human for part of him to say, ‘Look, the only way I can deal with it is to not have cameras there, or to delay the press briefing, or to do a smaller gaggle,’” they said. Indeed, it took Spicer a full week before he gave on-the-record comments about the tweets, saying that Trump was only talking about generalized “surveillance” activities. Regardless of whether Spicer is enjoying his role as Trump’s Baghdad Bob, one thing remains clear: he, as well as his former boss, Reince Priebus, still wield considerable influence inside the White House. Everyone I spoke to said that Trump remains quite happy with Spicer’s performance, Saturday Night Live be damned. “So calls for his demise may be a little premature at this point,” Spicer’s associate told me. The source close to Spicer said that, much like Priebus, the press secretary enjoys a good working relationship with Steve Bannon, who as the premier ethno-nationalist, populist, outsider voice of his generation, is Trump’s Rasputin-like adviser. Admittedly, Spicer and Bannon are unlikely to turn their relationship into a vaudeville tour, but the source also said that Spicer, a consummate professional, was having no difficulties in this odd new relationship. One likely sign of Spicer’s standing is the recent hire of Michael Dubke as communications director. Dubke, a longtime veteran of the Washington communications scene, and the founder of the Alexandria-based Black Rock Group, has been close to Spicer for years and is widely seen as a new ally within the White House, a relationship that rubbed several longtime Trump loyalists the wrong way. Not only will Dubke’s presence allow Spicer, who previously also performed the job of communications director, to focus on his daily press briefings, but the very addition of a traditional Republican in a strategic post suggests that Spicer has some juice with a president who has repeatedly expressed his resentment for a party establishment that once rejected him. Despite his vexing behavior, this may be a good thing. For many, including those who have lampooned Spicer’s Gregor Samsa-like transformation, an empowered press secretary is a critical check on the Trump administration. Trump and Bannon, after all, appear to recognize the polling benefits within their base of turning the press into the enemy of the state. The Apple Store incident, however, demonstrated that Spicer’s public act may no longer be, itself, such an act. The video showed that even when out of character, Spicer knows how to attack a questioner in Trumpian phraseology. Trump clearly wants him to continue this performance art at all times. And like a method actor pushing his limits too far, this prospect surely strains Spicer’s formerly easy-going manner, testing how long he can remain in character. There is danger, too, in getting lost in the role. Spicer’s time on the Trump treadmill will inevitably run out. And spokespeople, unlike presidents, have future employers to think of. Convincing the president that his loyalty is unimpeachable while signaling to his former allies that he hasn’t drunk the kool aid may be the performance of a lifetime, but Spicer is surely hoping it won’t be his last.

Apple hires security researcher Jonathan Zdziarski Posted Mar 14, 2017 by Kate Conger (@kateconger) 0 SHARES Next Story LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman joins Microsoft’s board Jonathan Zdziarski has been a leading expert on Apple and iOS security and forensics for years — and now he’s taking his expertise inside the company. Zdziarski, who has written several books on iOS and was an outspoken supporter of Apple during its battle with the FBI last year, announced on his blog that he’s joining Apple’s Security Engineering and Architecture team to work on protecting user security and privacy. “This decision marks the conclusion of what I feel has been a matter of conscience for me over time. Privacy is sacred; our digital lives can reveal so much about us — our interests, our deepest thoughts, and even who we love. I am thrilled to be working with such an exceptional group of people who share a passion to protect that,” he wrote. Earlier in his career, Zdziarski worked on jailbreaking iPhones and, in 2014, he raised the issue of backdoors in Apple products. Apple said at the time that the functions Zdziarski identified were “diagnostic capabilities.” More recently, Zdziarski developed Little Flocker, a security application for macOS. Although Apple declined to comment on the hire, it makes sense for the company to bring one of the world’s foremost experts on its products in-house. Zdziarski also declined to comment on the move, but said in his post he’s “very excited to be working with a group of like minded individuals.” Featured Image: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Founded 1976 Overview Apple is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Is Apple moving up their iPad Launch Date to Keep Samsung's new Tablet Lineup in Check? | Main | Russia's Federal Anti-Monopoly Service Finds Apple Guilty of Price-Fixing » March 14, 2017 Samsung to introduce 3D Force Touch Virtual Home Button for the Galaxy S8 and win Orders from Apple for Similar Technology   According to a newly published report today we learn that Samsung's new flagship smartphone Galaxy S8 is expected to use new 3-D Force Touch technology similar to Apple's Force Touch for a new 'virtual home button' that will appear at the bottom of the display. Samsung's fingerprint-scanner will be relocated to the backside of the S8.   The report further noted that "industry sources" revealed today that "Samsung Display, the display-making unit of tech giant Samsung Electronics, is currently working on a pressure-sensitive touch display based on organic light-emitting diodes for Apple's upcoming iPhone 8." The Korea Herald believes this source lock, stock and barrel. It's not developing it for the future, but rather for the iPhone 8, end of discussion.   In addition they noted that "Ahead of the highly anticipated debut of the new iPhone -- the first OLED iPhone -- in September, Samsung Display, the sole OLED supplier, has been ramping up efforts to incorporate a 3D Touch sensor to the display screen."   Yet in the bigger picture, we have to remember that "Apple Suppliers GIS and TKP are Building New Capacity to Handle Apple's Next-Gen 3D OLED Touch Panels." I noted in last week's report that the new iPhone 8 would use AMOLED panels and the "matched 3D touch solution would be based on thin film instead of glass adapted to existing iPhones."   Our report also pointed out the huge investments that both GIS and TKP are making to keep Apple's business. I rather doubt that these two suppliers would have committed to new plants if Apple didn't likewise make a commitment to them. So in the end perhaps both stories likely have a piece of the Apple supply chain puzzle.   There's always some wiggle room in these reports because rumors and "industry sources" usually only get a part of the bigger story at any given time anyway. Apple's Tim Cook has always warned about jumping to conclusions based on the word of a single source because Apple shifts and adds sources on an ongoing basis for a myriad of reasons.

Zdziarski is known as NerveGas in the hacking community and provided expertise during Apple’s run-in with the FBI regarding the San Bernardino shooter’s phone. Furthermore, in 2014 he pointed out an important backdoor in iOS devices. He didn’t go into detail about what his role with Apple would entail, but he did say on his personal blog that his decision was motivated by his passion to protect online privacy. “I’m pleased to announce that I’ve accepted a position with Apple’s Security Engineering and Architecture team, and am very excited to be working with a group of like minded individuals so passionate about protecting the security and privacy of others. This decision marks the conclusion of what I feel has been a matter of conscience for me over time. Privacy is sacred; our digital lives can reveal so much about us – our interests, our deepest thoughts, and even who we love. I am thrilled to be working with such an exceptional group of people who share a passion to protect that,” wrote Zdziarski on his website.  It’s interesting to note that since making the announcement, Zdziarski has taken down his Twitter account.

If not, this just more Apple lip service.. Do Do but at least they’re giving the right lip service. The real Chug that Haterade Telling their customer and the general public how they have your security and privacy at heart yet they are pushing data to governments and other entities 24×7 behind the scenes.. reminds me of someone who says they are your best friend to your face and then constantly talks smack about you behind your back. Do Do Are you kidding? Source? I think if you’re going to assume, then assume companies that aren’t at least saying the right thing are co-operating with “governments” behind the scenes while publicly saying otherwise. The real Chug that Haterade Google “Lisa Jackson Podesta email” It’s Me Her emails are about providing data, when issued a legal warrant. And the data provided doesn’t cover encrypted data, like messages or access to devices. It is info about the user and their devices and meta data about communications. Big difference between providing details, under legal obligation, about where, when and who and providing access to secured information. If you were brought to court to testify in a friends case, because you are under oath, you might tell them where you friend was on a particular day, where they live, where they work, etc. You’d be obligated to do so if asked. But there would be a huge difference between that and you agreeing to wear a wire, tap his phones, bug his house and gain access to his PC to copy all his files for the police. Providing info you know about him is vastly different than accessing and violating his property. The real Chug that Haterade I’m not saying what Apple is doing is wrong… they SHOULD be complying with lawful requests for information that would help solve (or prevent) a crime… my frustration is that Apple continues to claim how they value their customers privacy, etc… yet they are giving out information behind the scenes….essentially talking out both sides of their mouth. Again, I have no problem with Apple sharing information when it comes to law enforcement…. they just need to be more transparent about it and stop making it seem like they have your privacy at heart when they are pretty much no different than any other tech company. It’s Me I think they’ve been pretty transparent. In terms of user privacy, they are locking down devices as much as possible and refusing to assist in unlocking on principle. But, any of their own information that is readily available (note: it is generally their own data about devices and user, not user data) they will comply with lawful orders. That’s neither secretive nor two faced. They provide only their own info that they have, and only when compelled, even if that data is about their users. They don’t provide access, when possible, to user’s data. It’s a difference between providing information about and providing access to information from. Giving them a user’s address (about) is different than giving then them a key to the house (access to). That’s very different than some other tech companies that don’t even blush when handing over your data. Not just data about you, but your data. The real Chug that Haterade You can spin it how you want but it seems like Apple is putting on this rosy front of “down with the FBI… your data is private and we respect that”… while they are sharing intonation with the US government out the back door… it may not be specific data from your phone like photos, etc but it is still data about you… It’s Me No spin. Sharing info about you is very different than sharing your data. Conflating those two is why some companies can get away with providing your data, because people don’t recognize the massive difference between what “data about” and “data of”. Zach Gilbert They’ve been pretty good for the most part with being transparent. They’ve set up a page where you can find all their reports here http://www.apple.com/ca/privacy/transparency-reports/ Dankey Why? Apple is the most secure of all cellular platforms.

These classified files were obtained from the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence, although they haven't yet been verified and a CIA official declined to comment on this incident. This isn't the first time that the U.S. government agencies were accused of crossing the line and undermining online security and civil liberties, as it's been only a year since the infamous FBI-Apple encryption dispute. It's like "1984" all over again. March 2017 According to these documents, the alleged exploits took place between 2013 and 2016, while at least 24 Android vulnerabilities were identified. Among them were hacking tools capable of turning Android and iPhone devices, smart TVs, and computers into "covert microphones". Chrome was targeted by the EggsMayhem attack, the Sulfur exploit caused Android to leak critical OS information, while the RoidRage bundle was used to obtain remote control over Android devices. At first, all the tech companies from Silicon Valley maintained their silence, but two days later, Google's Manager of Information Security, Heather Adkins, said that many of the vulnerabilities referred to in the report were fixed. However, security specialists say that those government intrusions on privacy, although undeniably severe and illegal, haven't been reported to affect versions of Android after 4.4. Google is currently busy analyzing their security issues, and working on implementing further protections. Apple also issued a statement saying that their users were protected as the latest iOS version contained security patches for the mentioned exploits. Security protocols of many chat apps such as Facebook's WhatsApp, Signal, or Weibo, were broken, too. All this obviously puts not only many individual users, but also numerous companies at risk, as their privacy can be easily violated and their trade secrets exposed. That's why it's wise to think about alternative methods of communication and constant security software testing. February 2016 On December 2, 2015, 14 people were killed, while 22 were injured in a terrorist attack at the Inland Regional Centre in San Bernardino, California. The perpetrators were subsequently killed in a shoot-out with the police. During the investigation, the FBI found an Apple iPhone 5C, issued to one of the terrorists by the San Bernardino County, as he was its employee. However, the phone had a password and couldn't be unlocked due to its advanced security features. The FBI asked Apple to help them and disable certain security features, which the company declined on the grounds of its policy of never undermining the security features of their products. This case sparked a heated debate regarding the importance of security and encryption both in court and among the general public. A poll conducted by the Pew Research Center on the sample of 1,022 adults showed that 51% of the U.S. citizens supported the FBI, while 38% agreed with Apple, although the company warned that creating a backdoor to the iPhone could pose a threat to the data security, as the government or hackers could potentially unlock any iPhone. Finally, the FBI used a tool purchased from a third party unlock the device and withdrew the request. This incident is still a controversial matter in the U.S. December 2013 In December 2013, it was revealed that the NSA and the UK's GCHQ entered the realm of online gaming and started collecting data from the likes of WoW and Second Life, as an attempt to track potential terrorists. The two intelligence agencies claimed, although their efforts weren't fruitful, that terrorists might be using MMORPG networks in order to stay under the radar thus making it easier for them to communicate, plan attacks, or even move money. This was revealed, together with many other NSA surveillance practices, by Edward Snowden. As a result, 8 tech giants, including Facebook, Google, and Microsoft penned an open letter to the Obama Administration requesting reforms of government surveillance practices.

If retailers tried to discount an iPhone, Apple would send a formal request to restore the dictated price, and in failing to respond, would result in a termination of contract. Apple has reportedly been doing this for quite some time, from the iPhone 5 through to the iPhone 6s. Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service, responsible for the investigation, says it has not found signs of Apple coordinating the prices of the iPhone 7 or 7 Plus handset. The official regulators also stated that Apple cooperated fully with the investigation and has now ended its price fixing scheme. Whilst Apple has three months to appeal the court ruling, it could face a financial penalty of 15% of its Russian sales if it doesn't succeed. This isn't the first time Russia has brought an antitrust lawsuit against a major technology company: Google previously faced fines of $6.75 million for its anti-competitive business strategy. Russia has also recently made censorship demands towards Apple, requesting it to remove LinkedIn from the App Store.

Vegan. Think. Eat. Thrive.™ News Food Planet Travel Buzz Celebrate Pi Day—Vegan Style By Tanya Flink | March 14, 2017 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter If theres one thing weve retained from eighth grade geometry, its Pi Day. In mathematics, pi is the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter and a constant with a decimal representation that never ends. And as you might remember, many middle school teachers help their students learn about pi by holding contests to see who can memorize the most digits of the ongoing numbers. Thankfully for our taste buds, on March 14 (aka, 3.14), only the first three numerals matter, as today is National Pi Day. And what better way to celebrate than with sweet and savory pies? Similar to pi, the vegan possibilities for this beloved foodie holiday are endless, which is why we’re bringing you a few tips so you can get your pi(e) fix. Enjoy!   Make Pi(e), not war This year, Pi Day falls on a Tuesday, but if you aren’t stuck in the office, get in the kitchen, and make some pie. There are hundreds of terrific vegan recipes online and in cookbooks. Here are three of our favorites.   1. Oh, Ladycakes Apple Caramel Crumb Pie Apple season has come and gone, but this pie from blog Oh, Ladycakes is too good not to make year-round. A massive dome of sugary goodness bursting with caramel-laden apples piled high with crumb toppings, this pie does not disappoint.   2. Oh, Ladycakes Cherry Crumb Pie There’s a reason why blogger Ashlae Warner popularized the #pieitforward movement (and that reason is she makes amazing vegan pies), which is why we’re including two of her recipes on this list. Another favorite of ours is Warner’s cherry crumb pie, an equally gooey, flaky, and delicious as the Apple Caramel Crumb above. Sure, it’s not quite cherry season, but it’s close enough for us. Our advice: purchase your cherries at a local farmers’ market, and have fun pitting those fruit!   3. Isa Chandra Moskowitz’s Maple Pecan Pie Simple, delicious, and insanely decadent, this Maple Pecan Pie from vegan cookbook author Isa Chandra Moskowitz is an ideal recipe for those who don’t have all day to devote to making pie, as the assembly takes less than an hour. In fact, the hardest part about making this pie is waiting for it to cool. Sometimes, it’s just too hard to resist picking off one or two piping hot maple pecans from the golden brown topping. If you do (and we won’t tell), don’t worry, because the pie is packed with them!   Buy pie Pie making is a labor of love, and not all of us have the time to whip up a tasty vegan delicacy. Thankfully, there are a variety of store-bought options for those whose pastry skills are limited to thaw, bake, and serve. In the freezer section, look for Wholly Wholesome pies, as his brand is distributed nationwide, and all of their fruit pies (apple, cherry, and blueberry) are vegan. Furthermore, many of Marie Callender’s frozen fruit pies are also accidentally vegan, including the Dutch Apple, Cherry Crunch, Razzleberry, Lattice Apple, and Lattice Peach. One of the many wonderful aspects about fruit pie is that they are often accidentally vegan, so if frozen pastry doesn’t sound appealing, check the ingredients of the pre-made pies—you might be pleasantly surprised to find a cruelty-free dessert. Finally, if you’re fortunate enough to live near a Whole Foods Market, forgo the freezer section, and head straight for the bakery department, where a fresh vegan pie awaits (unless, of course, everyone beat you to it). You can’t miss these thanks to the large, bright “vegan” label on the packaging.   Pi Day discounts There’s nothing like a fictitious food-related holiday to score great discounts, which might explain why small businesses, franchises, and nationwide corporations love to attract more customers by providing an economic and holiday-themed incentive. Check with your local bakery to see if they plan to offer a Pi Day discount. Social media is the most effective way to find this information, so be sure to follow those Facebook and Instagram accounts for pop-up Pi Day deals. Nationwide, both Blaze Pizza and Pieology are offering any pizza for $3.14, while Whole Foods is offering a $3.14 discount on any full-sized bakery pie and large take-and-bake pizzas. If you live in a pizza town (we’re looking at you, Chicago and New York), you’re bound to find similar deals at your favorite restaurants.   Tanya Flink is an Orange County-based vegan, foodie, and certified Master Personal Trainer who thinks Pi Day should be a national holiday.

We tend to see them come up from time to time and the kind of money that they often fetch is truly mind-boggling. A rare Apple-1 computer in proper working condition is set to be auctioned off in May. It’s estimated to fetch over $320,000 at the auction. The lucky person who has pockets deep enough to buy this will truly be getting a piece of history. Not only will they own one of the first computers that Apple ever made, they will also receive the manual and notes of phone calls with Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, the co-founders of Apple. The auction is being conducted by Team Breker, a German auction house, which mentions that the original owner of this computer is now selling it. The original owner is an unnamed computer engineer from Berkeley, California. This rare Apple-1 computer has been described as the “best-preserved example of an Apple-1 computer to have appeared on the market.” The Telegraph reports that it’s in full working condition and it may be one of the eight remaining working units left in the world today. The person who buys it will receive the Apple-1’s original manual, the primary logo, circuit diagrams as well as a receipt from the motherboard and cassette interface. A letter from Apple customer care is included which advises that the customer shouldn’t upgrade to the Apple-II. The auction is going to take place in Cologne, Germany on May 20th. This rare computer is estimated to fetch between $190,000 – $320,000. Previous auctions have seen Apple-1 computers be auctioned for as much as $671,000 but that was an extremely rare unit given that it was signed by Steve Wozniak. The Henry Ford organization paid the most amount of money at an auction for an Apple-1 in late 2014, it holds the record for being the most expensive Apple-1 ever auctioned at an eye-watering $905,000.

Video calling on Signal was in beta on Android last month. The feature is now released for Android and iOS devices, offering end-to-end encrypted video calls by default. The added feature also improves voice calls on Signal, Open Whisper Systems said. Read: Email Security: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, File Amicus Brief Over Google Case The software firm said it used CallKit, an “iOS 10 feature that brings apps like Signal to the same level as the native iOS calling experience.” The iOS and Signal integration could be of concern for some who believe the Apple system isn’t safe, since the recent calls list is synced to iCloud if the user enables it on Signal. With CallKit, users can answer calls on Signal directly from the lock screen, however the contact name is not revealed. Instead the lock screen displays the call coming from “Signal User.” When looking at recent calls on iOS, the incoming or outgoing calls appear as “Signal User.” Signal app adds video calling feature on iOS and Android.

How To Make Video Calls With Signal App The video calling on Signal resembles iOS’ FaceTime app and it’s simple to use. Here’s how to start video calls: If you haven’t downloaded or updated the app, do that first. Look for the contact you want to video call and open the message box. Go to the upper right hand corner and tap the phone icon. Clicking on the icon automatically starts a voice call, but since you want to video call your contact just tap the video camera icon on the right button of the screen. Once the video call starts you’ll be able to see your contact on the entire screen and you’ll be able to see yourself in a small box on the upper right hand, just like FaceTime.

The Mares’ Hurdle was the obvious place on Tuesday’s card where the paths of Mullins, O’Leary and some of the horses who moved to a new home as a result of their dispute over training fees seemed certain to cross. Apple’s Jade was an outstanding juvenile for Mullins last season, when her victories included a 41-lengths success in a Grade One race at Aintree. Jockey Club reins in alcohol consumption at Cheltenham festival Read more In terms of both numbers and the betting she faced a stern task against the twin powers of Vroum Vroum Mag, last year’s winner of the same race, and Limini, another Festival winner last year, who had beaten Apple’s Jade on her previous start. Limini set off as the 6-4 favourite with Vroum Vroum Mag at 11-4 and Apple’s Jade the outsider of the big three at 7-2, but when the tapes went up, it was Bryan Cooper, on Apple’s Jade, who took the initiative and settled his partner close to a steady pace. Ruby Walsh, on Limini, and Paul Townend, aboard Vroum Vroum Mag, were two or three lengths further back, and while both closed up powerfully in the home straight, Apple’s Jade found a final surge after the last to carry her to a one-and-a-half length success. “She’s a real battler,” Cooper said. “She outbattled Vroum Vroum Mag at Fairyhouse [earlier in the season] and I was confident she would do it today. She winged the last and it’s a great job done.” Elliott was one of the main beneficiaries of O’Leary’s decision to quit the Mullins stable and he will saddle Outlander, another horse who moved home in the autumn, in Friday’s Gold Cup. “This was her Gold Cup,” he said of Apple’s Jade. “We kept our mouths shut after [her defeat at] Punchestown because we knew she would come on a good bit from it.” O’Leary, who also owns the penultimate race winner, the 16-1 shot Tiger Roll, paid tribute to Elliott’s role in overturning Apple’s Jade’s form with Limini but could not resist an oblique reference to the winner’s former trainer. “It’s a great training performance by Gordon,” O’Leary said. “He gave her a run a couple of weeks ago and he felt she’d come on for it. She was down coming to the last but she battles. “We all love Cheltenham. The amphitheatre is incredible and the racing is very tough. I have never had a winner on the Tuesday, so it is great to have the pressure off. Now I know how Willie Mullins feels, banging in the winners on the first day. Normally, I’m here sweating on the last day.” Meanwhile, the contender did what was required here on Tuesday, as Altior, an odds-on chance for months, sauntered home by six lengths in the Arkle Trophy. Now it is up to Douvan, in the Champion Chase on Wednesday, to make the match and set the date for what promises to be one of the great head-to-heads at next year’s Festival. Buveur D'Air wins Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham Festival Read more It will be worth the wait if all goes well with Altior and Douvan in the meantime, a race that will not simply be a clash between two of the best two‑mile chasers of recent seasons, but also between Nicky Henderson and Willie Mullins, the most successful trainers in Festival history. The first price to appear here was 3-1 against Altior but either horse could set off as favourite if both make it to post a year from now. Altior’s performance was not as spectacular as that of Sprinter Sacre, the last great two-miler to pass through Henderson’s hands, in the same race in 2012, but there was a similar sense of inevitability about the outcome from the earliest stages. A faint peck at the sixth was as close as he came to a mistake and the seven-year-old is unbeaten in all 10 of his starts over hurdles and fences. Douvan’s unblemished record since joining Willie Mullins is more impressive still and stands at 13 wins before Wednesday’s start at Cheltenham. It seems the only way either horse’s winning streak will end is at the hands of the other. “Altior is a hugely talented horse,” Henderson said. “He has been pretty perfect all year. His jumping was accurate and he’s got such scope that at times it was getting exuberant. I’m not sure if he will run again this season, there’s no reason why he shouldn’t and Sandown might be the race for him [on 29 April].” Altior’s connection could probably seek out an early meeting with Douvan at Punchestown a few days earlier but Henderson did not seem inclined to give the idea serious consideration. “His life is still in front of him,” Henderson said. “It is only his first season over fences and hopefully Douvan will do his job and then we can all meet up next year. There is so much to look forward to.” Nico de Boinville, Altior’s jockey, missed his first three races this season after breaking his arm in a fall at Cheltenham in November but was able to enjoy an easy Grade One success on only his second ride at the track since. “You try to keep as cool as you can but you are aware of the expectation for a wonderful horse,” De Boinville said. “It took me a while to get him into gear but once he did he took off up the hill. My horse travels and jumps and wherever you put him, he’s a great horse to ride. Once he gets into gear, he’s hard to stop, it’s just getting him into gear. Then he takes off.” Altior and De Boinville fought off the challenge from Min, a warm favourite from the Willie Mullins stable, in the Supreme Novice Hurdle last year and the Irish trainer again had to settle for second place on Tuesday as the 25-1 outsider Labaik, ridden by Jack Kennedy, beat Melon, the 3-1 joint‑favourite, by two-and-a-quarter lengths. Labaik had refused to race on two of his previous starts and decided to join his most recent outing before Tuesday only after giving his opponents a huge head start. He was beaten more than 100 lengths as a result. It was fortunate Kennedy did not give up, because a third straight refusal would have had Labaik banned from racing altogether. “We’ve never made a secret about how good we thought the horse was,” Gordon Elliott, Labaik’s trainer, said. “But I wanted to send him to Naas on Sunday rather than face the embarrassment of coming here and having him not jump off. “I haven’t a horse to work with him in the yard, he’s a machine of a horse. If he never jumps off again, it doesn’t matter.” Elliott finished the day with a treble and he is the 8-11 favourite with Bet365 to finish the week as the leading trainer. Henderson is a 9-4 chance while Mullins, who drew a blank on the opening card, is out to 3-1 third‑favourite having started Tuesday afternoon as an odds-on chance.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint SAN JOSE, Calif. – That shiny new iPhone may say "assembled in China" on the back, but its origins are scattered around the world: wafers from Taiwan, modem chips and batteries from South Korea, displays from Japan, components from Europe and raw materials from Africa, Asia, Europe and the U.S. Now that complicated supply chain may put Apple — the world's most valuable company — in the bull's-eye as President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans consider sweeping import tariffs or a comprehensive border tax on incoming products, components and raw materials. But while Apple has been singled out by Trump before, the administration's actions would affect a who's who of Silicon Valley's big-name tech companies — which could see sales, revenue and access to global talent take a hit from new fees and the trade wars that could follow. "It's a real mess," said Marcus Noland, executive vice president at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington, D.C., think tank that supports free trade. Only two months into the Trump administration, it's difficult to discern how an import tariff or border tax might take shape, but the president has said he wants to punish U.S. companies that make goods overseas to sell back home. Imposing new costs on imports would encourage domestic manufacturing and create jobs, Trump has argued. While campaigning, Trump mentioned a 45 percent import tariff on goods from China and 35 percent on imports from Mexico. More recent reports suggested the Trump transition team was looking at a 10 percent fee. House Republicans, meanwhile, have proposed a 20 percent "border adjustment tax" covering all imports from all countries. Paul Sakuma - Associated Press file In this Friday, March 9, 2012 photo, Hewlett Packard CEO and President Meg Whitman speaks at a conference on the Stanford University campus in Palo Alto, Calif. The list of firms with the most to lose from an aggressive new tariff or tax regime includes the valley's biggest names: Google, Tesla, Oracle, HP, Cisco, Intel, Seagate, Western Digital, Nvidia, Marvell Semiconductor and more. Consumers also will inevitably see increased costs from import tariffs or a tax passed on to them, according to experts. "You and I are going to pay for it," said Georgia Tech professor John Vande Vate. However, others believe imposing higher import costs would deliver significant benefits. Northwestern University law Prof. Steven Calabresi said the proposed 20 percent border adjustment tax would "encourage Americans to buy American products" and "promote good jobs here in the United States" while raising $1 trillion over 10 years. "It is smart to discourage a little bit of the buying of foreign goods if you can then cut income taxes and get people back into the workplace or get them to work harder," he wrote this month in an opinion article for the Hill. Still, tariffs or a tax would also hit countries like China that export to the U.S., potentially leading to trade wars with nations whose markets and raw materials are critical to tech companies. "If we decide to impose tariffs or high barriers to trade on our trading partners we should expect reciprocal trade barriers, which of course is not good for our industries, it's not good for prices, and the whole thing spirals downward," said Renee Bowen, a Stanford University Graduate School of Business professor who studies international trade. Generally, when tariffs drive prices up, sales go down, said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a tech-focused think tank. The tech industry has long depended on a complex global network of suppliers, workers and materials. Apple, for example, noted in its most recent quarterly report that its manufacturing is concentrated among a small number of suppliers in Asia. "Everything that is in our products comes from overseas," Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman told CNBC in February. "That supply chain has taken 30 years to set up. So when all those components come in and are taxed, it's not going to be good. This does not create jobs. It actually lowers the number of jobs for many, many companies." HP makes printers and PCs in China, while Cisco, Seagate and Western Digital manufacture products there and in Thailand, said analyst Handel Jones of International Business Strategies in Los Gatos, Calif. Google's new Pixel phones are made by HTC in Taiwan, where Nvidia and Marvell Semiconductor buy chips that power products sold in the U.S. The Home virtual-assistance device by Google is made in China, and the company relies on Taiwanese firm Quanta to supply the servers that make it a cloud-services titan. Facebook also buys servers from Quanta, according to analysis firm Moor Insights & Strategy. Intel has fabrication and assembly plants in China, and assembly facilities in Malaysia and Vietnam. Even a software-and-services company like Oracle is vulnerable to tariff-related retaliation, because it has invested heavily in providing IT services in China, where its clients include state-owned enterprises. The Chinese government, on top of potentially responding tit for tat to tariffs or taxes, could bar state-owned companies from doing business with U.S. firms, said the Peterson Institute's Noland. Companies that make some products in the U.S. won't escape, either. They too would be vulnerable to an all encompassing import levy, such as the proposed border adjustment tax, because they use materials or parts from other countries. Conflict between the U.S. and China over trade could spread to other areas, potentially affecting American firms' access to Chinese talent, Noland said. "A trade war that started with products," Noland said, "could spill into things like visas and immigration issues, which would disadvantage the entire high tech sector."

The only thing I can think of for the 10.5″ size iPad, that is suppose to target businesses and education, is that it is easier to carry around. For example, imagine someone walking around doing inventory and holding an iPad. Yes, the 12.9″ iPad Pro is the easiest to work on with all its extra space, but not to hold. Whereas the 9.7″ iPad is just a little too small for all day work tasks, but great for viewing content. If I remember correctly, the 9.7″ iPad size was specifically chosen for content consumption. So I think the 10.5″ iPad is like a Goldilocks iPad, easier to carry in one hand and walk around, while possibly using the Apple Pencil in the other hand, and a little more suited to doing tasks instead of content consumption. I have the 12.9″ iPad Pro, along with the keyboard and Apple Pencil, which I really enjoy. I was using an app to make an inventory of my home, which had me wandering from room to room with my iPad. What I noticed rather quickly is that as soon as I went into a room I was looking for a ledge of some kind to put the iPad down on. It just was not practical to hold in one hand and then use the other to input information. The only other thing I can think of, considering how often Tim Cook has mentioned augmented reality, is maybe there is some kind of augmented reality reason for the 10.5″ size. I don’t know much about augmented reality so I cannot speculate beyond that. March 15, 2017 at 1:07 EDT AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Known as NerveGas in the jailbreaking community, Mr. Zdziarski is the author of several books about iPhone forensics and how to secure iOS apps. In light of recent events like the CIA Vault 7 leak, this move may improve Apple’s standing within security and privacy circles. Jonathan Zdziarski – a.k.a. NerveGas (source: Zdiarski’s Blog) iOS Security Consulting Jonathan shared the news on his personal blog, saying: I’m pleased to announce that I’ve accepted a position with Apple’s Security Engineering and Architecture team, and am very excited to be working with a group of like minded individuals so passionate about protecting the security and privacy of others. This decision marks the conclusion of what I feel has been a matter of conscience for me over time. Privacy is sacred; our digital lives can reveal so much about us – our interests, our deepest thoughts, and even who we love. I am thrilled to be working with such an exceptional group of people who share a passion to protect that. Jonathan was a vocal critic of the FBI back when the agency fought Apple over iPhone security. He discovered security flaws in popular iOS apps and even accused Apple of putting a backdoor into iOS. Nevertheless, he is passionate about iOS privacy, and in my opinion Apple made a good move hiring him.

Business Apps | 13 Mar 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (14) How to Set Up and Use Airline Boarding Passes in Wallet by Adam C. Engst When Tonya and I first started taking airline flights back in the early 1990s, I found it almost overwhelmingly stressful. It stemmed from the fact that flying was so expensive for us, but I also dreaded the byzantine process of buying tickets, checking in repeatedly, and dealing with security. So much seemed to hinge on not losing tickets, boarding passes, or identification cards. We never made any mistakes, though, and in retrospect, misplacing a ticket or boarding pass likely wouldn’t have been a big deal. (The first time I flew to Canada, pre 9/11, I forgot my passport but was still allowed through customs with a stern talking-to. Who knows what would happen today!) I still don’t enjoy airline travel, but I’ve done it enough that it no longer stresses me out to the same extent, even as dealing with invasive and unpleasant security requirements has gotten far worse. Plus, thanks to the Internet and the iPhone, the logistics have become vastly simpler. Being able to buy tickets, check in, and print boarding passes online was the first step, and the next major improvement came when Apple released the Passbook app, since renamed Wallet. I’ve been using Passbook/Wallet as long as has been possible — it took smaller airports like Ithaca a while to get the necessary scanners — but as much as I liked eliminating the need for paper, there were many problems early on. Getting passes into Passbook was difficult, due to horrible airline apps, and bringing up the passes quickly and reliably was also hard. Even during our trip to MacTech Conference in Los Angeles in November 2016, when I was using an iPhone 7 running iOS 10, I had problems. I eventually realized the Raise to Wake option kept swapping the boarding pass for the lock screen every time I lowered my iPhone while waiting in line to board. But on my most recent trip, to Austin for the ASMC Summit for independent Apple resellers, everything just worked. The United app knew about my itinerary once I was logged in, and the Delta app figured it out once I entered the ticket number. Both notified me when I could check in, and made it easy to do that and add my boarding passes to Wallet. iOS 10 and Wallet were smart enough to display a constant notification on the lock screen during the time I needed it, a single swipe brought up the boarding pass, and it stayed on screen while I waited in line, regardless of Raise to Wake. I’m sure many of you are nodding your heads in agreement, or wondering why I’m telling you all this. I’m no frequent flyer, so I’m sure that these improvements have been obvious to road warriors for a while. But I wanted to document how to do all this because I saw a lot of people still relying on paper boarding passes on that last trip. The experience of relying on an iPhone is so good, and so much better than dealing with paper, that if you’ve avoided it so far, I urge you to give it a try next time. But feel free to print a paper boarding pass as a backup until you’re comfortable with using your iPhone instead! Get the Airline App -- The first step is perhaps the hardest. It’s not that finding or downloading airline apps is difficult or expensive — they’re all free, and you can download them from the App Store like any other app. Here are links for the main U.S. airlines: Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, and Virgin America. In my experience, the tricky part, particularly for those of us who have been traveling for many years, is logging in. I strongly recommend taking some time well before your next flight to set up the airline apps you might use. Do them all at once, since it can be a fussy, annoying process if you have old accounts, or if airline mergers have confused matters. It’s far easier to figure out your login information — usually some combination of frequent flyer number, email address, or username, plus a password or PIN — via the airline Web sites while working calmly on a Mac at home. You may need to ask for new passwords in some cases, and regardless, I’d encourage you to change your password to a 20-character random password and store it in a password manager like 1Password or LastPass. You have to assume that airline Web sites are under attack all the time, given the value of the information they store, and I imagine that identity theft surrounding airline travel could cause a world of hurt. So set strong passwords and make sure to use a password manager that you can access on your iPhone too. Check In and Add Boarding Passes -- Once you’re logged in to the airline app, it should be relatively obvious how you can check in for your flight, which you can usually do 24 hours beforehand. If you booked the flight through the same airline, the app might even know about your itinerary already. If not, you may have to enter a confirmation number or ticket number — I had to do that when using the Delta app to check in for the return leg of my last trip, which had originated on United. At the end of the check-in process, the apps I’ve used have provided a relatively clear Add to Wallet link or button. Tap it, and when it hands you off to Wallet, make sure everything looks correct in the boarding pass and then tap the Add link in the upper-right corner. You may or may not need to do this for each boarding pass; check to see what’s in Wallet after the first one. Now you’re ready for when you go to the airport. Call Up a Boarding Pass -- As you’re waiting in the security line, you’ll want to get your iPhone ready to display the boarding pass to the first security checker. Since Wallet knows your flight times, it starts displaying a notification on the iPhone’s lock screen some hours before. That notification appears every time you wake the iPhone, and you can swipe it to the right to display the boarding pass. Those with an iPhone 6, 6s, or 7 can also 3D Touch it and then tap a Show Pass button, but that’s a bit clumsier than the swipe. The boarding pass will stay on screen even beyond the time set in Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Lock, but as you approach the head of the line, check to make sure you haven’t inadvertently pressed the Sleep/Wake button on your iPhone. If you have an Apple Watch, you can instead bring up the Wallet app there — you might want to tap the Keep in Dock button to make it easier to get to for your return flight. The watch’s Wallet app shows the same passes that are in Wallet on the iPhone, and tapping the boarding pass shows you the same information, although you have to scroll down (or rotate the digital crown) to get to the QR code required for the scanner. While the Wallet app is up on the Apple Watch, the screen doesn’t turn off, so you don’t have to struggle with it when you get to the desk. Although I can’t imagine a scenario where this makes sense, you can prevent a boarding pass from appearing on your lock screen. Swipe right on its notification, tap the i button in the lower-right corner, and in the next screen, disable Suggest on Lock Screen. You can turn off automatic updates here too, but again, I can’t think of when it would be useful to have a boarding pass not update automatically. One final note. Since many flights have multiple legs, each with a separate boarding pass, note that Wallet seems to try to keep them together. If you see multiple dots at the bottom of a screen showing a boarding pass, try swiping left and right to move between them. The same applies if you’re traveling with a family and you have boarding passes for multiple people in your iPhone. Speaking of which, if you and your traveling companions all have iPhones and airline accounts, it’s usually possible for each person to manage their own boarding passes. But if not, you can check in for multiple travelers and add all their boarding passes to your iPhone, though that will require some swiping back and forth whenever you need to present them. Delete Passes -- Back in the day, you sometimes wanted to hold on to boarding passes to prove that you’d flown the miles for a frequent flyer program. In today’s world, unless you’re a tech writer who wants to keep a few boarding passes around to document how Wallet works, there’s little reason to retain them. To delete an expired boarding pass, open Wallet, tap the boarding pass, tap the i button in the lower-right corner, and then tap the Remove Pass option. Anything Else? -- It was difficult to document how all this works since I had to do it live, while juggling luggage and making sure I ended up on the right flight and in the right seat. There’s no way to simulate different scenarios or test something again. So, if I’ve missed something in this description of using boarding passes in Wallet, please let me know in the comments. Finally, what if you lose or break your iPhone, with all your travel documents on it, during your trip? If that happened to me while en route, I’d go to the nearest airline desk to see if they could print me a new boarding pass. And if it happened in the middle of my trip, which seems more likely, I’d try to get to the airport early for my departure, so there would be extra time to check in for the flight and get a printed boarding pass. If you have ever experienced such an iPhone disaster, leaving you without a boarding pass or information about your itinerary, tell us in the comments how you worked around the problem.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment David Lutchko  2017-03-13 16:34 I was a road warrior and agree that using Apple wallet can be great. That said, ALWAYS carry a paper copy of your itinerary with you. You never when your phone starts misbehaving, or runs out of power (evening flights), etc. Sometimes, though, I found it hard lugging a carry-on with one hand, toting a small computer backpack, and then juggling the phone with my non-dominant hand to show the flight attendant my seat assignment--it almost fell between the jetway and the plane (would have landed on the tarmac!). That would not have been good. Another consideration, if traveling internationally I may be tempted to backup my phone using iTunes and restore it to factory settings just to prevent a possible Customs and Immigration privacy invasion, not so much because I'm paranoid but more out of principle. Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-03-13 23:17 Good point. In fact the NBC Nightly News had a story tonight (13 Mar 17) on the CBP demanding the phones and passwords of US Citizens at both land and air entry points. Reply Paul Albert  2017-03-13 20:56 I mean really all that trouble. Just print it out, fold it up and put in your wallet. Sometimes all this tech stuff just gets in the way of life. Flying is already stressful-why deal with this. Another headache. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-14 11:35 I always found the paper boarding passes much more stressful. You have to remember to print them out, put them in a location where you won't forget (and my wallet isn't nearly big enough to hold an 8.5x11 sheet of paper), and then constantly be sorting through them to get the right one for the right leg of the trip. Plus, you have to take them out and put them back repeatedly as you go through security and (sometimes) check in, and if you have any other papers with you, it's easy for them to get mixed up together. And of course, paper boarding passes don't update with new gate or time information. The iPhone is always in my right front pocket or in my hand, and the Apple Watch is always on my wrist. Now that Wallet works well, I find it a much better solution. But hey, if you like the paper, there's nothing stopping you from using it. Reply tonyblunt  2017-03-13 23:11 I used the iPhone for a few years and the process has got much simpler. Now I use the watch, less juggling things but some airlines have code readers that you cannot get your wrist under, hopefully they will upgrade soon. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-14 11:37 Yes, the scanners do have to be the right orientation for the watch. I didn't have trouble with that on this trip, but on some previous one, it was clear that I wouldn't be able to use the watch and I had to revert back to the iPhone. Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-03-13 23:21 Adam, since the CBP is now demanding access to the phones of returning US Citizens, you might as well get the app "Mobile Passport" so you can just give them your phone immediately before 3 of their goons tackle you. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-14 11:40 Oh, don't get me started... The EFF has a page on privacy at the boarder, and I need to write more about it. http://www.eff.org/wp/digital-privacy-us-border-2017 Reply Tonya not the TidBits Tonya  2017-03-14 01:29 When my husband and I travel together, we always put both of our boarding passes on both phones to provide a backup in case one phone goes on the fritz during the boarding process. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-14 11:37 That's smart! Reply Tonya Engst   2017-03-14 14:14 That is a very cute username! :-) Reply Tonya not the TidBits Tonya  2017-03-16 18:16 I kinda thought so, too ;-) Reply zaccone  2017-03-14 09:25 I often book flights on Southwest for my wife, son, and me. When I do that, I get one itinerary number and Southwest won't let me put the boarding passes on my phone. To fix this, I need to call Southwest and ask them to give each family member a separate itinerary number. They are willing to do this and it fixes the problem. I could probably accomplish the same thing by booking each of the flights separately, but I'm always afraid I won't get the same fare for each flight if I do that. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-14 11:39 Interesting! I know I've put boarding passes for multiple people on my iPhone with the United app, but since I've lived in the Northwest and the Northeast, I've never flown Southwest. :-) Reply To leave a comment, click Add a Comment and then enter the text, your name, and your email address (which won't be displayed).

Most women will notice it immediately and, as soon as they do, they’ll start making assumptions. How do you ensure they’ll make the ones you want them to make? Read on and choose wisely. Retro Digital Watch: The first digital watch that was considered cutting edge in the late ’80s/early ’90s looks antiquated compared to today’s smart watches, but that’s the whole point for anyone who wants to wear this one. What it Says: “love Stranger Things and get overwhelmed easily. I’m probably gonna ghost you.” Reserved for: Hipsters. Apple Watch: A smaller version of the phone you have constantly affixed to your hand, but hey, you can get your text messages on your wrist! What it Says: “I spend all of my money on gadgets I don’t need or understand. At some point in our relationship, you’ll find yourself standing in line with me at an Apple store at 4 a.m. waiting to buy a new release.” Reserved for: Apple geeks and tech nerds. Slim, Low-Profile Dress Watch: The opposite of a Chronograph Dive Watch, the dress watch is simple, typically has a plain face, and will look just as good with jeans as it does with a tuxedo. What it Says: “I have a 401K, a five year plan and an innate ability to handle your mother when she’s being difficult.” Reserved for: Marriage material. Jewel-Encrusted Watch: A watch with a face the size of a hubcap and encrusted with jewels (whether they’re real or fake is up for debate)—it’s flashy and ridiculous, just like its owner. What it Says: “Our weekend nights will be spent up in da club, and our weekend mornings will be spent recovering from said up-in-da-club shenanigans. I order bottle service when I really can’t afford it.” Reserved for: Rap stars, wannabe gangstas or former Jersey Shore cast members. Very, Very Expensive Watch: A Rolex, Omega, Breitling, Blancpain—any watch with these names on the face says one thing and one thing only: “I’m very, very expensive.” What it Says: “I’ll be picking up the check, but get used to being ignored at dinner while I’m answering—just one more!—work email.” Reserved for: Men who either have an impressive disposable income or a dead grandfather with good taste. No Watch: A bare wrist is rarely a good sign on a man unless he’s in a pool or helping someone deliver a baby. What it Says: “I’ll be at least 15 minutes late for everything and make you feel bad for being annoyed about it.” Reserved for: Immature dudes who think their phone is a fine substitute for a watch and who probably won’t ever buy you jewelry.

Andrew Cunningham - Mar 14, 2017 8:05 pm UTC Enlarge Andrew Cunningham reader comments 109 Share this story A seven-month investigation by Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service has found that Apple's Russian arm illegally fixed prices for certain iPhone models, according to a report from the Financial Times. The FAS found that Apple told 16 retailers to "hold the prices" of these iPhones and that Apple would contact the retailers in the event that the company found their prices "inappropriate." Apple may have terminated agreements with retailers unwilling to meet those pricing guidelines. The full report is posted in Russian here; affected phones include the iPhone 5S and 5C, the 6 and 6 Plus, and the 6S and 6S Plus. The prices were fixed for a period of roughly three months. A penalty has not been set, though the report indicates that it could be as much as 15 percent of Apple's sales in Russia. The company will have three months to challenge the decision once the full ruling is published later in the month. The investigation and the ruling only apply to Apple's Russian subsidiary, and the FAS dropped a similar investigation against Apple Inc. and other international subsidiaries "due to lack of evidence." We've asked Apple for comment and will update this story if the company replies. An Apple spokesperson speaking to the Times said that Apple has "worked closely with FAS during their investigation" and is "glad to put this matter behind us." FAS Deputy Head Andrey Tsarikovsky also said that Apple has made changes to comply with Russian laws and has implemented policies to prevent future violations. Apple positions itself as a luxury brand, and one of the ways it has maintained that brand has been to avoid budget gadgets in favor of premium products and premium price tags. Retailers who sell iPhones for significantly less than Apple's own MSRP could undercut those efforts, which could explain why Apple tried to dictate prices to these retailers in the first place.

RELATED LINKS Full result  It was a great escape that brought to mind that extraordinary Planet Earth scene in which the wily iguana somehow evades the clutches of an army of voracious racer snakes. Cooper had given Apple's Jade her head going out on the final circuit and dictated the fractions from there. However, the Willie Mullins duo seemingly had a number on Apple's Jade's back as they turned in. When Vroum Vroum Mag led over the last, third might have been the best many would have expected of Apple's Jade. She would ultimately prove even more elusive than that dogged iguana, causing in-running carnage that even David Attenborough might struggle to do justice to as she wriggled her way free of the Closutton duo en route to a brave triumph that crystallised the subplot that has coloured the entire season. Having been one of the 60 Gigginstown horses that Michael O'Leary removed from Mullins in the autumn, there was a sting about this particular defeat for the man whose bid to retain the festival's trainers' crown for a fifth successive year has got off to a standing start. Bryan Cooper celebrates Apple's Jade's Grade 1 success    PICTURE: Getty Images   Incredibly, this was the first time since 2008 that Mullins has drawn an opening-day blank, and, with the man who is also threatening to end his stranglehold on the domestic title having earlier foiled him in the Supreme Novices', there is little doubt that Apple's Jade's trainer Gordon Elliott is an itch Mullins is struggling to scratch right now. Moreover, this was the tenth time the mares' race has been run; Mullins had won the previous eight, so he is being hit where he might be expected to be strongest. "She was tough," Elliott said of Apple's Jade. "We knew the ground was going to suit her; that was a big help. Today was her Gold Cup. I put a tonguestrap on her for the first time and thankfully it worked out."  Of that recent Punchestown defeat to Limini, Elliott said: "Bryan knows her well and we kept our mouths shut after Punchestown. We knew she was going to come on a good bit for it and we didn't read too much into it. I always want to win, but we knew she was going to improve and this was the plan." Apple's Jade, who will likely head for Punchestown next, was winning for a fourth time at the highest level. It took a brave performance to see off two other high-class mares in what was an absorbing spectacle. "They are three stunning mares," O'Leary said of the trio. "You couldn't fault any of them, and Apple's Jade was a good winner." Apple's Jade (left) puts in a good leap on her way to success   PICTURE: John Grossick (racingpost.com/photos)   Mullins, as has been his style throughout the season, magnanimously congratulated O'Leary and his brother Eddie. "My two ran crackers," he said subsequently. "It's a horserace and it was a good one at that. I thought my two ran their races and jumped very well - there were no excuses." Having already suffered a collapsed lung and liver laceration, a broken arm and a cracked pelvis during a harrowing run this season, Cooper was also relieved to have got off the mark for the week early. "I've been lucky to have a few winners since I came back last month and this is a bonus," he said. "I thought I'd outstay Vroum Vroum Mag, but I was waiting for Ruby to come and pounce [on Limini]. I knew he'd have more speed, but we outstayed them in the end. She is as tough as nails."   TOP STORIES Stayers' Hurdle: Mullins bandwagon rolls on with Canyon 3:35pm 16 Mar 2017 Three things to take from day three of the festival 6:05pm 16 Mar 2017 Kim Muir: Domesday Book strikes for Andrews 5:42pm 16 Mar 2017 Dawn Run: Ricci joins Mullins party with Let's Dance 4:57pm 16 Mar 2017 Stable Plate: Road To Respect flies home for Meade 4:18pm 16 Mar 2017 Ryanair: Un De Sceaux runs rivals ragged from front 2:58pm 16 Mar 2017 Pertemps: Percy delivers in style despite handicap rise 2:17pm 16 Mar 2017 JLT: Yorkhill opens floodgates for Walsh and Mullins 1:36pm 16 Mar 2017 Douvan set for MRI scan after Champion Chase flop 11:56am 16 Mar 2017 Well-regarded Death Duty faces 14 in Albert Bartlett 11:35am 16 Mar 2017 Show All Current Stories LATEST STORIES Three things to take from day three of the festival 6:05pm 16 Mar 2017 Kim Muir: Domesday Book strikes for Andrews 5:42pm 16 Mar 2017 Dawn Run: Ricci joins Mullins party with Let's Dance 4:57pm 16 Mar 2017 Stable Plate: Road To Respect flies home for Meade 4:18pm 16 Mar 2017 Stayers' Hurdle: Mullins bandwagon rolls on with Canyon 3:35pm 16 Mar 2017 Ryanair: Un De Sceaux runs rivals ragged from front 2:58pm 16 Mar 2017 Pertemps: Percy delivers in style despite handicap rise 2:17pm 16 Mar 2017 JLT: Yorkhill opens floodgates for Walsh and Mullins 1:36pm 16 Mar 2017 Douvan set for MRI scan after Champion Chase flop 11:56am 16 Mar 2017 Well-regarded Death Duty faces 14 in Albert Bartlett 11:35am 16 Mar 2017 Show All Current Stories CHELTENHAM FESTIVAL Stayers' Hurdle: Mullins bandwagon rolls on with Canyon 3:35pm 16 Mar 2017 Three things to take from day three of the festival 6:05pm 16 Mar 2017 Kim Muir: Domesday Book strikes for Andrews 5:42pm 16 Mar 2017 Dawn Run: Ricci joins Mullins party with Let's Dance 4:57pm 16 Mar 2017 Stable Plate: Road To Respect flies home for Meade 4:18pm 16 Mar 2017 Ryanair: Un De Sceaux runs rivals ragged from front 2:58pm 16 Mar 2017 Pertemps: Percy delivers in style despite handicap rise 2:17pm 16 Mar 2017 JLT: Yorkhill opens floodgates for Walsh and Mullins 1:36pm 16 Mar 2017 Douvan set for MRI scan after Champion Chase flop 11:56am 16 Mar 2017 Well-regarded Death Duty faces 14 in Albert Bartlett 11:35am 16 Mar 2017 Show All Current Stories INTERNATIONAL USA: Magical Mastery victory marred by injury 9:38am 12 Mar 2017 RACING BUSINESS Long search over as Bowcock gets William Hill job 9:37am 12 Mar 2017 GOING AND NON-RUNNERS Friday: 12:19am 17 Mar 17 Saturday: 12:19am 17 Mar 17 Sunday: 12:19am 17 Mar 17 Monday: 12:19am 17 Mar 17 Tuesday: 12:19am 17 Mar 17 Wednesday: 12:19am 17 Mar 17 Thursday: 12:19am 17 Mar 17 Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Download our iPhone app Download our iPad app Download our Android app « Back to your search results Use this instead of your browser's back button « Back to your search results Use this instead of your browser's back button COPYRIGHT © 2017 Centurycomm Limited or its licensors, all rights reserved Search Sport news  TOP STORIES Pearson early favourite for Boro vacancy City 8-1 to win Champions League with Pep Fabulous Foxes 37-1 to conquer Europe Kante 1-5 to claim player of the year honours Chelsea 2-1 for FA Cup after drawing Spurs Read Full News Service Search News Archive Greyhound news  TOP STORIES Diablo can turn up the heat for Golden glory Golden Sprint showdown on RPGTV this evening Friday tipping: Bags bankers by RP tipsters More injury woe for Classic hero Scolari Litter of nine for Oaks queen Forest Twilight Read Full News Service Search News Archive MORE FROM RACING POST Visit the Mobile Site Download our iPad app Download our apps Follow us on Twitter B2B services More MORE FROM RACING POSTCheck out our Facebook page ABOUT US Age policy Terms and conditions Privacy policy Advertise with us Cookie policy HELP Contact us Ibas GamCare Gambleaware Gamblers Anonymous USEFUL LINKS British Horseracing Authority Horse Racing Ireland Injured Jockeys Fund Irish Injured Jockeys France Galop More USEFUL LINKSRacing WelfareRacehorse Owners AssociationRewards4RacingNational Trainers FederationAmateur Jockeys AssociationProfessional Jockeys Association COPYRIGHT © 2017 CENTURYCOMM LIMITED OR ITS LICENSORS, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED This website uses cookies to give you the best and most relevant experience.

Or Maisie and Sophie. And we're at SXSW. and we're about to do Carpool Karaoke for Apple Music!" And a message on the show's account said: "STARKpool Karaoke? Lane of Thrones?@SophieT and @Maisie_Williams from @GameOfThrones are shooting a #CarpoolKaraoke for @applemusic! (sic)." Last year Apple bought the rights to a TV series based on the popular segment of James Corden's 'Late Late Show'. Eddie Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet software and services, said: "We love music, and 'Carpool Karaoke' celebrates it in a fun and unique way that is a hit with audiences of all ages. It's a perfect fit for Apple Music — bringing subscribers exclusive access to their favorite artists and celebrities who come along for the ride." 'Late Late Show' producer Ben Winston said: "We couldn't be more excited to be partnering with Apple Music on this exciting new series of 'Carpool Karaoke'. The joy of 'Carpool' is both the intimacy it creates, while seeing the love our passengers have for music. Where better to showcase that than with Apple Music." And CBS' Scott Koondel added: "We're delighted to bring one of the biggest viral hits, 'Carpool Karaoke,' to Apple Music, where our new series will be available on this phenomenally popular subscription service." >> More Entertainment News  © 2017 Bang Showbiz, NZCity  Other Entertainment News  17 Mar: Ben Affleck has completed a stint in rehab for alcohol addiction  17 Mar: Anne Hathaway doesn't think Hollywood is a "place of equality"  17 Mar: Chance The Rapper wants to move back in with his parents  17 Mar: Jamie Lee Curtis adopted a dog to combat her lonely feelings  17 Mar: Angelina Jolie was "feeling butterflies" ahead of her lecture at London's School of Economics  17 Mar: Anne Hathaway's marriage has "changed" her  16 Mar: Khloe Kardashian held a gold-themed birthday party for Tristan Thompson  Top Stories RUGBY Hall returns home to tackle the Blues More...

As noted by The Telegraph, German auctioneer Team Breker will soon make a functioning Apple-1 available, estimating the machine will go for around $320,000. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Team Breker calls this Apple-1 the “best-preserved example of an Apple-1 computer to appear on the market.” The auction includes the Apple-1 itself, original operation documents, circuit diagrams, and purported notes of telephone calls between Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in 1977. “The lot also comes with the original documents from the computer’s first and only owner, including the receipt for the motherboard and cassette interface dated 30/11/1967 [and] an original letter from Apple Customer Service refusing an upgrade to Apple-II.  The original Apple-1 manual included still shows the primary logo. The founders chose Isaac Newton as a symbol in recognition of the binary system he was credited with inventing in the 18th century.” This Apple-1 is said to be in full working order. There are believed to be just eight working units in existence today, making this an ultra-rare piece of memorabilia for whoever gets their hands on it. The computer is also being sold by its original owner, an engineer from Berkeley, California. The Apple-1 will go up for auction on May 20th in Cologne, Germany. Team Breker currently expects the machine to go for “more than £250,000,” which is around $320,000 USD. Based on previous sales, auctions, if someone got their hands on this machine for $320,000, it’d be an absolute steal. While there are very few out in the wild, we see Apple-1 units go up for auction on a semi-regular basis, but every time it’s a pretty notable event due to their historical and monetary value. Last year, a rare Apple-1 “Celebration” model fetched $815,000 in auction. In 2014, a working Apple-1 was auctioned for $365,000, while the year prior a model signed by Wozniak went for $671,000. Another units as auctioned in 2015 and was expected to sell for over half a million dollars. Everything included in this auction can be seen in the image above.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) Share Written by Mike Murphy March 14, 2017 For those still mourning the loss of the MacBook Air, Apple’s recent advertising push, which tries to convince the world that the iPad Pro is a full replacement for a computer, has likely not been well-received. Over 2015 and 2016, Apple refreshed its laptop line, introducing a 12-inch MacBook, and upgraded MacBook Pros, seemingly leaving the Air, which has not even seen a hardware refresh in two years, for dead. It’s not clear whether the Air will be revived, but Apple is currently pushing users to either shell out at least $1,300 for a new MacBook, or $600 for the base-model iPad Pro (which really jumps to $850 when you add in its keyboard cover and stylus) for its latest hardware. Although the iPad and MacBook lines are still kept separate on the company’s website, it refers to the iPad Pro as “Super. Computer.” in advertising on its homepage. There has been no similar push for its new Mac laptops. Apple’s recent marketing campaign for the iPad Pro revolves around answering “real problems” from computer users: It highlights real tweets with complaints people have had about their computers, and responds that an iPad Pro would not have similar problems. It sets the iPad Pro up as Apple’s most approachable, and useful, computer for the average person—people who just want to print a single piece of paper, who don’t want to lug heavy laptops to class, or who want to declutter their lives. Whether an iPad Pro can really handle the same everyday tasks as easily as a laptop is debatable, but it’s where Apple seems to think the future of the iPad lies. Revenue from the iPad has been trending downward, and what was once Apple’s second-largest revenue segment, pulling in over $11 billion in a single quarter in 2013, is now trailing behind the iPhone, Apple’s services business, and even the Mac. Given that the iPhone has been getting larger in recent years (and there are rumors that there will be an even bigger 5.8 inch-screen phone this year), it’s likely that fewer people will be inclined to carry a smaller iPad with them as well. The iPad Pro, with its stylus, keyboard, and more powerful processor, is more differentiated from iPhones than other iPad models, so it makes sense that Apple would try to push it as a second device to customers. And it’s likely that we’ll hear more about its future in the coming weeks. Apple often has a product launch event in March or April, and reports suggest that one is coming at the end of this month. Much like the rumors of there being three iPhones released this year, Apple is reportedly planning to release three new iPad Pro models—in the existing 9.7 and 12-inch sizes, and a new 10.5-inch size, according to MacRumors—all with slimmer profiles than the existing models. There’s scant additional information out there, although there are rumors that Apple will also take this time to announce an updated iPhone SE—its smaller iPhone, based on the design of the iPhone 5. Apple declined to comment on its launch plans. Typically, Apple sends out invites to the media roughly 10-12 days before an event, meaning that even if invites went out today, the event would likely not be before March 24. Or Apple could upend its playbook, call a snap press event, and send everyone into a tizzy as they rush to cover whatever new devices the company show offs. Or there could be no event. This year is expected to be a bumper year for the company, which is celebrating the tenth anniversary of the iPhone, and it’s entirely possible that it won’t stick to the usual script it’s followed in recent years. But regardless of what sleek new aluminum products Apple releases this year, it seems increasingly likely that the future of casual computing, at least as far as Apple is concerned, looks a lot more like a tablet with a keyboard attached, than a traditional laptop. And Apple isn’t alone—Microsoft has been running with its Surface tablets longer than Apple has had the iPad Pro, and Samsung recently announced the Galaxy Tab S3—both of which have similar keyboard-and-stylus add-ons. For Apple users who actually use laptops as intended—as computers that can sit on your lap—it seems the only options in the future will be machines that cost over $1,000. At least they come in some nice metallic shades, though.

The upcoming Apple flagship may also introduce enhanced Siri capabilities that may or may not benefit from built-in augmented reality support. Designer Gábor Balogh has created some gorgeous mockups imagining an augmented reality Siri on an edge-to-edge iPhone. The idea for the concept was born after Balogh studied recent Apple acquisitions concerning face and emotion recognition, connecting the real world with digital content, plus big data and machine learning. “Any of them separately would create a better iOS, but what if they were merged into one big something? Let say, into Siri?,” he pondered. “If the rumors are true, more powerful hardware is on the way which supports augmented reality smoothly in 4K resolution. Do you get the idea?” iPhone 8 is thought to introduce a function area that would occupy the space currently reserved for the bottom chin where the Home button and the Touch ID sensor are currently found. As a next-generation Home button and a redesigned fingerprint sensor are expected to be embedded directly into iPhone 8’s display, the phone’s bottom chin could be ditched altogether to make way for the aforesaid function area. Balogh doesn’t think the function area should adopt Touch Bar-like functionality. That’s why he’s betting on a persistent button in the function area that would act as a shortcut to an enhanced Siri feature with augmented reality support. He explained: The real world is not hidden by the device anymore. If raised, the environment is visible in the background of the home screen in a semi-transparent way, indicating that you can unveil it by pressing the digital Home button. Same way as now, but Siri would be present in augmented reality. That would make sense were it not for the rumor-mill, which predicted that the Cupertino firm would build augmented reality technology into the stock Camera and Maps apps. Regardless, Siri would see the world around you through iPhone’s lenses, recognize objects, know where you are, what your activity is and what you probably need in any given moment. The icons next to a Siri button in the function area at the bottom represent Siri-suggested widgets relevant to a given situation. You’d ask a question such as “What’s that tower?” and get a handy Maps card. Keep on with the conversation and ask a follow-up question like “Guide me there” and Siri brings up an augmented reality directions feature. “It is a lot easier to follow the directions and the digital path if it is projected on the environment,” he writes. Another cool capability he’s envisioned would let Siri tap into not just your own Health data but use the power of iCloud to understand health stats of your loved ones, too. In that case, you could ask Siri something along the lines of “How is Sandra?” And just like that, up pops Sandra’s health card with stats like heart rates and other data. “Obviously, sharing those data is synced among iCloud Family, so those who have older iPhones could also enjoy this experience,” he said. Needless to say, we’re very excited about iPhone 8’s augmented reality features. iPhone 7, at left, and Balogh’s iPhone 8 concept, at right. Its edge-to-edge screen, based on the superior active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) technology, should be great for iOS 11’s presumed Dark Mode, with a function area at the bottom potentially replacing Home/Touch ID button and containing shortcuts to common features that could change from one app to another.

RELATED LINKS Full result  It was a great escape that brought to mind that extraordinary Planet Earth scene in which the wily iguana somehow evades the clutches of an army of voracious racer snakes. Cooper had given Apple's Jade her head going out on the final circuit and dictated the fractions from there. However, the Willie Mullins duo seemingly had a number on Apple's Jade's back as they turned in. When Vroum Vroum Mag led over the last, third might have been the best many would have expected of Apple's Jade. She would ultimately prove even more elusive than that dogged iguana, causing in-running carnage that even David Attenborough might struggle to do justice to as she wriggled her way free of the Closutton duo en route to a brave triumph that crystallised the subplot that has coloured the entire season. Having been one of the 60 Gigginstown horses that Michael O'Leary removed from Mullins in the autumn, there was a sting about this particular defeat for the man whose bid to retain the festival's trainers' crown for a fifth successive year has got off to a standing start. Bryan Cooper celebrates Apple's Jade's Grade 1 success    PICTURE: Getty Images   Incredibly, this was the first time since 2008 that Mullins has drawn an opening-day blank, and, with the man who is also threatening to end his stranglehold on the domestic title having earlier foiled him in the Supreme Novices', there is little doubt that Apple's Jade's trainer Gordon Elliott is an itch Mullins is struggling to scratch right now. Moreover, this was the tenth time the mares' race has been run; Mullins had won the previous eight, so he is being hit where he might be expected to be strongest. "She was tough," Elliott said of Apple's Jade. "We knew the ground was going to suit her; that was a big help. Today was her Gold Cup. I put a tonguestrap on her for the first time and thankfully it worked out."  Of that recent Punchestown defeat to Limini, Elliott said: "Bryan knows her well and we kept our mouths shut after Punchestown. We knew she was going to come on a good bit for it and we didn't read too much into it. I always want to win, but we knew she was going to improve and this was the plan." Apple's Jade, who will likely head for Punchestown next, was winning for a fourth time at the highest level. It took a brave performance to see off two other high-class mares in what was an absorbing spectacle. "They are three stunning mares," O'Leary said of the trio. "You couldn't fault any of them, and Apple's Jade was a good winner." Apple's Jade (left) puts in a good leap on her way to success   PICTURE: John Grossick (racingpost.com/photos)   Mullins, as has been his style throughout the season, magnanimously congratulated O'Leary and his brother Eddie. "My two ran crackers," he said subsequently. "It's a horserace and it was a good one at that. I thought my two ran their races and jumped very well - there were no excuses." Having already suffered a collapsed lung and liver laceration, a broken arm and a cracked pelvis during a harrowing run this season, Cooper was also relieved to have got off the mark for the week early. "I've been lucky to have a few winners since I came back last month and this is a bonus," he said. "I thought I'd outstay Vroum Vroum Mag, but I was waiting for Ruby to come and pounce [on Limini]. I knew he'd have more speed, but we outstayed them in the end. She is as tough as nails."   TOP STORIES Stayers' Hurdle: Mullins bandwagon rolls on with Canyon 3:35pm 16 Mar 2017 Three things to take from day three of the festival 6:05pm 16 Mar 2017 Kim Muir: Domesday Book strikes for Andrews 5:42pm 16 Mar 2017 Dawn Run: Ricci joins Mullins party with Let's Dance 4:57pm 16 Mar 2017 Stable Plate: Road To Respect flies home for Meade 4:18pm 16 Mar 2017 Ryanair: Un De Sceaux runs rivals ragged from front 2:58pm 16 Mar 2017 Pertemps: Percy delivers in style despite handicap rise 2:17pm 16 Mar 2017 JLT: Yorkhill opens floodgates for Walsh and Mullins 1:36pm 16 Mar 2017 Douvan set for MRI scan after Champion Chase flop 11:56am 16 Mar 2017 Well-regarded Death Duty faces 14 in Albert Bartlett 11:35am 16 Mar 2017 Show All Current Stories LATEST STORIES Three things to take from day three of the festival 6:05pm 16 Mar 2017 Kim Muir: Domesday Book strikes for Andrews 5:42pm 16 Mar 2017 Dawn Run: Ricci joins Mullins party with Let's Dance 4:57pm 16 Mar 2017 Stable Plate: Road To Respect flies home for Meade 4:18pm 16 Mar 2017 Stayers' Hurdle: Mullins bandwagon rolls on with Canyon 3:35pm 16 Mar 2017 Ryanair: Un De Sceaux runs rivals ragged from front 2:58pm 16 Mar 2017 Pertemps: Percy delivers in style despite handicap rise 2:17pm 16 Mar 2017 JLT: Yorkhill opens floodgates for Walsh and Mullins 1:36pm 16 Mar 2017 Douvan set for MRI scan after Champion Chase flop 11:56am 16 Mar 2017 Well-regarded Death Duty faces 14 in Albert Bartlett 11:35am 16 Mar 2017 Show All Current Stories CHELTENHAM FESTIVAL Stayers' Hurdle: Mullins bandwagon rolls on with Canyon 3:35pm 16 Mar 2017 Three things to take from day three of the festival 6:05pm 16 Mar 2017 Kim Muir: Domesday Book strikes for Andrews 5:42pm 16 Mar 2017 Dawn Run: Ricci joins Mullins party with Let's Dance 4:57pm 16 Mar 2017 Stable Plate: Road To Respect flies home for Meade 4:18pm 16 Mar 2017 Ryanair: Un De Sceaux runs rivals ragged from front 2:58pm 16 Mar 2017 Pertemps: Percy delivers in style despite handicap rise 2:17pm 16 Mar 2017 JLT: Yorkhill opens floodgates for Walsh and Mullins 1:36pm 16 Mar 2017 Douvan set for MRI scan after Champion Chase flop 11:56am 16 Mar 2017 Well-regarded Death Duty faces 14 in Albert Bartlett 11:35am 16 Mar 2017 Show All Current Stories INTERNATIONAL USA: Magical Mastery victory marred by injury 9:38am 12 Mar 2017 RACING BUSINESS Long search over as Bowcock gets William Hill job 9:37am 12 Mar 2017 GOING AND NON-RUNNERS Friday: 12:19am 17 Mar 17 Saturday: 12:19am 17 Mar 17 Sunday: 12:19am 17 Mar 17 Monday: 12:19am 17 Mar 17 Tuesday: 12:19am 17 Mar 17 Wednesday: 12:19am 17 Mar 17 Thursday: 12:19am 17 Mar 17 Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Download our iPhone app Download our iPad app Download our Android app « Back to your search results Use this instead of your browser's back button « Back to your search results Use this instead of your browser's back button COPYRIGHT © 2017 Centurycomm Limited or its licensors, all rights reserved Search Sport news  TOP STORIES Pearson early favourite for Boro vacancy City 8-1 to win Champions League with Pep Fabulous Foxes 37-1 to conquer Europe Kante 1-5 to claim player of the year honours Chelsea 2-1 for FA Cup after drawing Spurs Read Full News Service Search News Archive Greyhound news  TOP STORIES Diablo can turn up the heat for Golden glory Golden Sprint showdown on RPGTV this evening Friday tipping: Bags bankers by RP tipsters More injury woe for Classic hero Scolari Litter of nine for Oaks queen Forest Twilight Read Full News Service Search News Archive MORE FROM RACING POST Visit the Mobile Site Download our iPad app Download our apps Follow us on Twitter B2B services More MORE FROM RACING POSTCheck out our Facebook page ABOUT US Age policy Terms and conditions Privacy policy Advertise with us Cookie policy HELP Contact us Ibas GamCare Gambleaware Gamblers Anonymous USEFUL LINKS British Horseracing Authority Horse Racing Ireland Injured Jockeys Fund Irish Injured Jockeys France Galop More USEFUL LINKSRacing WelfareRacehorse Owners AssociationRewards4RacingNational Trainers FederationAmateur Jockeys AssociationProfessional Jockeys Association COPYRIGHT © 2017 CENTURYCOMM LIMITED OR ITS LICENSORS, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED This website uses cookies to give you the best and most relevant experience.

Nelson02/24/2016 If you’ve been having problems with your iPad Pro, it might be because of a bug with Apple’s Smart Keyboard. Fortunately, there’s already a fix! Here’s how to update your Apple Smart Keyboard. Most mobile keyboards – heck, most keyboards in general – are pretty self-contained. You connect them, you press a button, a letter appears on the screen. If there’s a bug, you’ll probably have to take it back to the store. Unlike many mobile keyboards, Apple’s Smart Keyboard is a little more complicated; the keyboard and the iPad Pro talk to each other more than a tablet might with a standard Bluetooth keyboard. Why would you want to update the Apple Smart Keyboard? As a result, there’s a bigger chance for a bug to cause mayhem, but there’s also a better chance it can be easily fixed. Remember the Apple Smart Connector? Those three little dots on the side, where your Smart Keyboard connects? They also allow data to flow from the iPad to the keyboard, which means they can be used to update the software that lives on the keyboard. Why would you want or need to update that software? It’s less about introducing new features and more about fixing bugs (and in the future, ensuring the keyboard remains compatible with newer iPad Pros). Recently, some iPad Pro users have been complaining about the iPad Pro waking up periodically, even when it’s not being used. I’ve noticed this issue on my own iPad, and wondered what was causing it. Apparently, if you leave the iPad Pro in the Apple Smart Keyboard when you aren’t using it (and why wouldn’t you – it’s a good protector and a reasonably good stand), then an issue with the keyboard can cause your iPad Pro to keep waking up and turning on the screen. After a while, this can make your iPad drain its battery faster than it otherwise should. How to update your Apple Smart Keyboard Fortunately, updating the software on your keyboard is really very simple: it should work simply by taking it off and putting it back on. First, make sure your iPad is turned on and connected to the internet. Next, completely remove it from your iPad Pro – specifically, make sure the connection between the keyboard and the iPad’s Smart Connector is broken. Finally, wait five or ten seconds and re-connect the keyboard. If an update is available, you’ll see a notification appear in the middle of your screen, informing you that an update for the keyboard is ready to install. Tap the button and you’ll see the notification change to a screen showing the percentage until completion; it shouldn’t take more than ten or fifteen seconds to complete. When finished updating, the pop-up simply disappears. Unlike with iOS releases or point version updates, there are no software settings to check, so you’ll never know if there’s a keyboard update available. If you have some trouble with the above instructions, you are certain there’s an update available, try removing the Apple Smart Keyboard from your iPad Pro, turn your iPad Pro off completely (hold down the power button until the shutdown screen appears and slide your finger to turn it off), then turn it back on. Once you’re on the screen with all of your icons, and the iPad has reconnected to the internet, reconnect your keyboard cover and see if the pop-up appears. 4 Responses 02/25/2016 Jenniferjdanforth Reply 22yes wao..!m­­­­­­­­­y b­­­­­­­­­e­­­­­­­­­s­­­­­­­­­t f­­­­­­­­­r­­­­­­­­­i­­­­­­­­­e­­­­­­­­­n­­­­­­­­­d’s h­­­­­­­­­a­­­­­­­­­l­­­­­­­­­f-s­­­­­­­­­i­­­­­­­­­s­­­­­­­­­t­­­­­­­­­e­­­­­­­­­r m­­­­­­­­­a­­­­­­­­­k­­­­­­­­­e­­­­­­­­­s $87 /h­­­­­­­­­r o­­­­­­­­­n t­­­­­­­­­h­­­­­­­­­e l­­­­­­­­­a­­­­­­­­­p­­­­­­­­­t­­­­­­­­­o­­­­­­­­­p .

Of the 175 sold, only 50 to 60 or so remain in existence, including just eight functioning ones, making the iconic machine a rare collector's item worth significantly more than its original $666.66 price. On May 20, German auctioneer Breker told MacRumors it will be auctioning off one of those eight functioning Apple-1 computers, complete with the original manual and documentation, the receipt for the motherboard and cassette recorder, and even a record of telephone conversations with Steve Jobs and Wozniak. Based on previous Apple-1 auctions over the years, this latest machine is likely to fetch several hundreds of thousands of dollars. Breker said it auctioned an Apple-1 in comparable original and working condition for $671,400 in May 2013, while a functioning Apple-1 sold for $374,500 at a Sotheby's action in New York in June 2012. More recently, a functioning Apple-1 sold for a record $905,000 at a Bonhams auction in New York in October 2014, while another working machine went for $365,000 at a Christie's auction in New York two months later. CharityBuzz auctioned a unique "Celebration" model for $815,000 last year. The Apple-1 was a motherboard kit only and is pictured here with the rare original "NTI" sign. Apple never offered an external housing for the computer, and the peripheral equipment, such as the power supply, keyboard, monitor, and cassette recorder, had to be obtained personally by the owner.

But it's not surprising that connects directly to the old motherboard, the same way it connected to the new one. I was going to buy an Apple 1 kit but it didn't come with a keyboard and I had no idea how to retrofit one. So I bought a SOL-20 kit instead. Oops. I did some research and it appears the "pre-NTI" boards were an earlier production run, they switched to NTI as the manufacturer of their printed circuit boards at some point. I put together a picture showing the NTI board on top, and the pre-NTI on the bottom. I believe these boards are basically the same color of green but the bottom pic is overexposed due to use of a flash. You can see the NTI logo inside a diamond centered under the Apple Computer 1 label. That logo is actually etched in the board, it's the same metal as the circuit traces. It's common practice for manufacturers to add their logo on the PCB like this. If you watch the video, this Apple 1 does not have the NTI logo etched in the board, so I have no idea what they meant when they claim it includes the "rare NTI sign." I think they meant just the opposite, that it is rare because it does not have the NTI sign. Rating: 6 Votes HJM.NL 2 days ago at 11:42 am Soon all of Apple's computers are rare and up for auction.

 Apple hired the guy who helped it fight the FBI's order to hack the San Bernardino shooter's iPhone Alex Heath Mar. 14, 2017, 3:01 PM 6,523 facebook linkedin twitter email print Jonathan Zdziarski. Jonathan Zdziarski Apple has hired Jonathan Zdziarski, a veteran security researcher who helped the company fight the FBI's request to hack an iPhone used by a shooter from the 2015 San Bernardino attack. Zdziarski announced on Tuesday that he had accepted a position within Apple's security engineering and architecture team. "This decision marks the conclusion of what I feel has been a matter of conscience for me over time," he wrote on his personal blog. "Privacy is sacred; our digital lives can reveal so much about us – our interests, our deepest thoughts, and even who we love. I am thrilled to be working with such an exceptional group of people who share a passion to protect that." A vocal expert in the security research community, Zdziarski first made headlines in 2014 for alleging that Apple had created a "backdoor" into its software that could be used to get private information. When the FBI tried to force Apple to break the encryption on an iPhone owned by a shooter involved in the San Bernardino attack, Zdziarski helped file an amicus brief in support of Apple. Now that Zdziarski has joined secretive Apple as an employee, he'll likely maintain a much lower public profile. His Twitter account has already been shut down.

This Is Apple’s Mysterious ‘iPhone Calibration Machine’ This bizarre machine could allow Apple to prevent you from fixing your iPhone screen. Last week, I put a bounty on photos of Apple's "iPhone Calibration Machine," a device in the back of every Apple store that allows the company to monopolize certain types of iPhone screen replacements and could be immensely important if the company ever decides to integrate its fingerprint sensor into the screen of the phone. An anonymous tipster who used to work at the Apple Store snapped a photo of the machine and sent it to me. Here it is: And here's the outside of the machine (photo taken by a separate tipster): As described by a third source, Apple started using these soon after the release of the iPhone 5S. "It was a big clunky machine that honestly looked like someone built it in their backyard," a former Apple Genius told me. "There were different 'moulds' that different iPhone models would go into before going in the machine, and it would take around 30 minutes … there was some weird liquid that needed to be placed in the machine that we would have to wear gloves with to fix it. Lots of gas type valves and whatnot. It literally looked like some backyard home job. Not very Apple-like at all." Read more: The Next iPhone Could Put 15,000 Independent Repair Shops Out of Business The shapes you see on the left are for calibrating the phone's camera, and "flock paper" and "gray card" are for calibrating the colors on the phone's screen. Apple did not respond to a request for comment for more information. It's not surprising that Apple has proprietary technology to test iPhone repairs before they're given back to customers, but the most important thing the machine does is allow a new Touch ID button to be paired with an old device. The machine is hooked up to an iMac, which connects the phone to an internal Apple server and allows the sensor to be recalibrated. This is something that no independent repair shop can do, and so it has allowed Apple to remain the only company that can fix broken screens without physically swapping old Touch ID buttons from the old screen (much more on that here).   Listen to Radio Motherboard's episode about the right to repair.  "It would be great if a machine like that were available to independent repair shops," Justin Carroll, CEO of Fruit Fixed, an independent smartphone repair shop in Richmond, Virginia told me. "If we're testing a battery or swapping a screen it would make our lives a lot easier. At the very least, it'd help if Apple open-sourced its diagnostic modes to other people." "Imagine if every car we bought, every time you wanted to change the oil you had to take it to the dealer," he added. "It's just not realistic, and it monopolizes aspects of their business that are rarely good for their consumers."

Apple is expected to release a third iPad Pro size  Credit: Apple Telegraph Reporters 14 March 2017 • 6:48pm Apple is set to hold a Spring event in the coming weeks that could involve the launch of a new iPad, larger iPhone SE and a red iPhone 7.  Here's everything we know about the event so far.  When will Apple hold its Spring Event? Apple is expected to hold the event within the next month. It is not clear exactly when the event will be, with some rumours suggesting it could be as early as March 20, but it is likely to be in early April.  Some reports have indicated the event will be held at Apple Park, its new campus, which is set to open next month. In the past the company has confirmed the date of its event 10 to 12 days beforehand.  Apples new spaceship HQ What will be announced?  New iPad Pro The biggest release at the Spring Event this year is expected to be a range of new iPads, with the most significant being a 10.5-inch iPad Pro. Joining the roster of 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch iPads, the middle sized device could have an all-new design with an edge-to-edge display and no home button. Tim Cook recently said: "We've got some exciting things coming on iPad and I'm optimistic about where things are headed." The 10.5-inch iPad Pro could have an edge-to-edge display and no home button, according to rumours Credit: Macotakara The tech giant could release a further three iPads, including a refresh the two Pro models released last year and a new 7.9-inch iPad to replace the Mini. The refreshed 9.7-inch iPad Pro could be a lower-end version of the one unveiled in September, while the 12.9-inch iPad Pro could gain a 12MP camera and true tone display.  Larger iPhone SE Having revealed the iPhone SE at its Spring Event in 2016, Apple could use its anniversary to introduce a larger model. The company is rumoured to have been working on a 128GB version of the device, which was released as a low-end iPhone.  About | iPhone SE New colour for the iPhone 7 Building on its Product Red campaign, a range of red products for which Apple makes a contribution to the Global Fund for HIV and AIDS programmes from every purchase, the company is rumoured to be working on a red iPhone 7.  OMG RUMORED RED IPHONE 7.

Gadgets 0 0 0 March 14, 2017 iPad Pro 2 Release Date: Four New iPads Coming Next Week? Louise Elliot News of the iPad Pro 2’s release date is much-awaited as it has been over a year since Apple launched its predecessor in September 2015. Industry observers are looking forward to the new iteration of a powerful device, and according to reports, they may not have to wait longer. The iPad Pro 2 could be revealed as soon as next week A MacRumors report cited “reputable” supply chain analysts, who asked to be unnamed, Apple is gearing up to release new products this month. The target date is reportedly between March 20 to March 24, which is only a week from now [Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] Why the Cupertino-based company hasn’t sent out invites yet is unknown. Apple usually invites the press weeks ahead of an event, where they officially reveal what they have been cooking up. According to speculations, the tech giant might do away without an official event this time, but that’s highly unlikely. There are only two plausible scenarios in this case; one of which is that Apple will send an invite soon for an event only a week away or the sources were wrong, and the spring event might actually be held later in March or in April instead as what the original rumors have suggested. As to what the company will reveal, the sources did not say. However, according to popular rumors, the iPad Pro 2 with the other refreshed iPad models will kickstart Apple’s 2017 lineup. At least three new models are expected to be unveiled. Four new iPad models being tested in the wild [Image by Eric Risberg/AP Images] Fueling these rumors are the recent reports of new iPads having been spotted in the wild. TechCrunch states that iPad models are being tested in and out of Cupertino. Citing the mobile marketing firm Fiksu, the report says that four different versions are being tested, but that does not necessarily mean that four will come out to the public. Fiksu got its data through its tracking and attribution SDK, which is used by numerous apps. As the iPad models were tested, they were naturally installed with apps that use the company’s SDK. The four devices are also installed with iOS 10.3 beta and some of them with the next-gen iOS 11. All these are suggesting that Apple is indeed planning to unveil the iPad Pro 2 and other iPad models sooner than later. What iPad models can we expect? Previous rumors and speculations, mainly from the mostly reliable KGI Securities Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, pointed out that there could be three new iPad Pro models this year. Two are the next iterations of the current iPad Pro models with 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch displays. The other is said to have a 10.5-inch display, which is new if true. [Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] However, with Fiksu’s report, it can be speculated that four could be introduced soon. The fourth one could be a 7.9-inch iPad Pro, which will be the successor to the iPad Mini 4. The latest model was revealed alongside the original iPad Pro, so a new one with Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard support is due. While all these are rumors for now, the iPad Pro 2 and its cousins are expected to sport a sleeker design and the new True Tone display from the current 9.7-inch iPad. Talks of the removal of the home button are also widespread, but it is only believed to be implemented on the 10.5-inch variant. As March 20 to March 24 are only days away, fans are advised to watch out for Apple’s plans next week. If reports are true, four new iPad models, which potentially includes the iPad Pro 2 and iPad Mini 5, could be introduced soon. If not, well, the other rumored dates are only weeks away.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search What Does It Mean When Apple “Sherlocks” an App? Perhaps you’ve read that F.lux, which reduces eye strain and helps you sleep, is being “Sherlocked” later this month. What does that mean? In short, “Sherlocked” means that macOS will soon offer features that make installing the popular third-party tool F.lux unnecessary. When macOS 10.11.4—the latest update for Sierra—comes out, the “Displays” panel in System Preferences will offer the Night Shift feature that debuted on iPhones last year. For lifelong Apple fans, this term barely needs explanation, but recent converts might feel confused. So, let’s take a look at where the term “Sherlocked” comes from. RELATED ARTICLES The Best New Features in macOS Sierra (and How to Use Them) How to Enable Night Shift On Your iPhone for Easy Nighttime Reading Where Does the Term “Sherlocked” Come From? RELATED ARTICLE Learn How to Use OS X’s Spotlight Search Like a Champ Before Spotlight—Apple’s built-in search feature—there was a different built-in search feature named Sherlock, after the fictional detective. Sherlock was part of Mac OS 8 and 9, and allowed users to search for files and contacts. When Mac OS X came around, Sherlock was extended to incorporate some basic web functionality—including translation. The idea of offering information from the Internet in a native Mac search interface intrigued developer Dan Wood, who founded a company called Karelia and built a tool named Watson. This $30 application was intended to be a companion to Sherlock (get it?) and supported way more internet functionality than Sherlock. Users of Watson could browse Yahoo’s famous directory with expandable menus, look up movie schedules, calculate  exchange rates, and a lot more. Watson became very popular, and stayed that way right until Apple released Mac OS X 10.2 with Sherlock 3. In that release, Apple added just about everything Watson could do to Sherlock’s own interface. After incorporating all these features, people no longer had much reason to buy Watson. Sherlock could do it all. A narrative took hold, and in the future “Sherlocked” became a word used any time Apple put out a new feature that made a third-party app no longer relevant. In a blog post, Wood said Steve Jobs told him Apple can and will do this to developers on the platform. Here’s Wood paraphrasing a phone call from Jobs himself: “You know those handcars, the little machines that people stand on and pump to move along on the train tracks? That’s Karelia. Apple is the steam train that owns the tracks.” You could argue that the popular narrative here isn’t completely accurate. Apple blogger John Gruber stated that Sherlock’s web integrations were planned at Apple before Watson debuted, and that Apple offered Wood a job working on Sherlock two different times. But these facts couldn’t stand in the way of a good story, and the term “Sherlocked” stuck. Does “Sherlocking” Happen a Lot? The term “Sherlocked” stuck around because it’s useful: there isn’t really another word to describe an app being replaced by an OS feature. And every few years Apple really does add features replacing projects put out by third parties, including such favorites as: Konfabulator. An app that offered interactive desktop widgets, Konfabulator was made irrelevant by Apple’s Dashboard. iPodderX. An early podcast manager for Mac OS X, iPodderX was made irrelevant by podcast support in iTunes. Sandvox. An application for building websites in a native Mac environment, Sandvox lost a lot of momentum when Apple released iWeb. Coincidentally, Sandvox is from Karelia—the developers behind Watson—so they’ve been Sherlocked twice. Growl. An open source notification system for Mac OS X used by hundreds of Mac apps, Growl was made irrelevant by Apple’s native notification system. We’re sure readers can think of other examples. F.lux is just the latest victim. And Mac users will continue seeing the term “Sherlocked” thrown around whenever Apple adds new features to the operating system previously offered by third party applications. You could also argue that Microsoft was Sherlocking before Apple made it cool, killing off Netscape Navigator with a little app called Internet Explorer. At this point, the word “Sherlocked” hasn’t really crossed over into Windows-land. But who knows what the future holds? Photo credit: Christian Reimer JOIN THE DISCUSSION (9 REPLIES) Got Feedback?

Several new iPad models have been spotted being tested in Cupertino and nearby locations, according to mobile marketing firm Fiksu – potentially confirming earlier rumors of a planned iPad refresh arriving this spring. According to reports, a leaked investor note from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo indicated that Apple is expected to update its 12.9-inch iPad Pro model, as well as introduce a new 10-inch or 10.5-inch model with a narrower bezel along with a budget-friendly 9.7-inch option. According to Kuo, the two larger models will sport an A10X chip – a version of A10 chip found in the iPhone 7 – while the low-cost device will use the A9 chip found in the iPhone 6S. The A10X will be manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., and the A9 by Samsung, he also said. Not mentioned in his note is the Apple iPad mini. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 140.69 +0.23 +0.16% Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd TSM ▲ 32.41 +0.50 +1.57% Samsung Electronics Co Ltd SSNLF = 1,500.00 0.00 0.00% Fiksu’s raw data is showing four different iPad models, but that doesn’t necessarily mean four new devices will arrive. The company says it saw the same number of devices tested before the release of the last two iPad Pros, which means we could potentially see anywhere from two to four new iPads soon hitting the market, it estimates. The data comes from Fiksu’s tracking and attribution SDK, which is used by thousands of mobile apps today. As part of Apple’s testing process, it installs a variety of apps – from popular ones to the more obscure – which ends up inevitably ends up including some apps that has Fiksu’s tracking in them. Each type of iOS device has a different model name, explains Fiksu. These are generally sequential, the firm says. About a month ahead  of the most recent iPad Pro launches, it saw internal model names “6,3/6,4” and “6,7/6,8” being tested around Cupertino. This time around, it’s seeing “7,1” “7,2,” “7,3,” and “7,4.” There are only a handful of these devices appearing in its logs, Fiksu found. (See chart below) Device | Count iPad 7,3 | 5 iPad 7,4 | 10 iPad 7,2 | 11 iPad 7,1 | 17 All the usage is from the greater San Francisco Bay area, including Cupertino and nearby locations. The usage was also spread across a range of generally popular apps, like games, music, real estate and weather applications. Another indication that these could be the new iPads is the fact that they’re all running a mix of the latest beta of iOS (iOS 10.3) and the unreleased version iOS 11. The launch of new iPads is important to Apple given the current year-over-year decline in iPad sales. As Recode noted in January, iPad sold 13.3 million in iPads, according to its recent quarterly earnings report, generating $5.5 billion in revenue. That represented around a 19 percent drop in units sold, and a 22 percent drop in revenue from the year prior. As Fiksu explains, part of the problem is that people don’t upgrade their iPads as often as they upgrade their iPhones. In fact, the first four full-size iPad generations and the original iPad mini – all of which launched between 2010 and 2012 – still account for over 45 percent of iPad usage, its trackers show. With the release of new models, Apple could encourage users to abandon their old devices for those with newer technology or new features. Kuo’s earlier note about the devices suggested that the budget model could move more units – potentially between 50 and 60 percent of sales, he said. Of course, until Apple makes a formal announcement, nothing is for certain.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Mazda Confirms Android Auto And Apple CarPlay Support By Adnan Farooqui on 03/14/2017 11:18 PDT A lot of car manufacturers are now embracing the infotainment systems developed by Apple and Google. These systems are extensions of their mobile operating systems in the car and have been well received by users. Mazda joins the growing list of car manufacturers as it has now confirmed that its cars will get support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. However, despite the fact that it has confirmed Android Auto and Apple CarPlay support for its vehicles, Mazda hasn’t really confirmed precisely which existing sedan and SUV models will get this and when the support is due to arrive. Mazda made the confirmation alongside the launch of its redesigned 2017 CX-5 but again, it stopped short of confirming which vehicle will be the first to come with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay support on board. Jacob Brown, a spokesperson for the company, did mention that both infotainment systems “should be retroactively upgradeable onto all Mazda Connect systems with a potentially minimal hardware addition needed.” This is a good omen for those who own a relatively new Mazda car. Its cars are powered by the Mazda Connect system which came out back in 2014. The company has been working with both Apple and Google to interface their systems with the Mazda Connect infotainment system. Filed in General. Read more about Android Auto and mazda.

Apple usually holds a March event to announce new products. The clock is ticking. By Alex Eule March 14, 2017 12:55 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Rumors are swirling--and questions mounting--about the timing of Apple's next iPad. Photo: Pixabay By this time in March, Apple has usually sent out invites to a big product reveal. This year, the rumor mill is in full swing, but the invites have gone missing. More from Barron’s Next Blizzard 2017: Shake Shack in the Eye of the Storm Nike’s Comeback is in Sight When to Buy Airline Tickets to Get The Cheapest Fare On Monday, MacRumors, a popular site for Apple news speculation, reported that Apple is likely to announce new products sometime next week, speculation that comes from what the site calls “reputable supply chain analysts.” Apple is incredibly secretive, but these analysts sometimes get a sneak peak of the company’s plans by seeing production changes for key parts that go inside iPhones and iPads. Then Tuesday, DigiTimes, another Apple watcher, reported that Apple was ready to reveal a new 10.5-inch iPad at an early-April event. Apple’s current Pro models have 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch screens. Apple has held March events four times in the last six years, MacRumors notes, and the company usually sends out invites 11 to 12 days before any announcement,. That still leaves time for a late-March event, but it doesn’t line up with the rumors for an announcement next week. It’s also possible Apple could roll out the latest products without a big event. Perhaps, this iPad refresh is not quite big enough to justify its own event. Apple’s iPad sales have slipped in recent years though the company has new hopes for its latest line of advanced tablets. The company recently rolled out new ads for its iPad Pro line, hoping to bring PC users into the iPad family. One 15-second spot touts Microsoft Word on the iPad. “Now you have Microsoft Word on your iPad Pro, and it works with Apple Pencil.” “Word?” “Word.” “Word.” Big Picture: Apple has struggled to expand the market for its iPad tablet. The latest wave of devices will likely make a bigger push at attracting unhappy PC users.

Pandora has built a massive fanbase with Pandora Radio, and the company clearly hopes that that brand awareness will help Pandora Premium succeed despite arriving very late to the party. Pandora has, for almost 20 years now, been offering internet users a personalized radio station they influence by giving songs a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down This Smart Trick Keeps Your Pandora Stations Fresh This Smart Trick Keeps Your Pandora Stations Fresh Pandora is a great music service, but sometimes your stations get a little stale.

That’s 80 million people Pandora now hopes it can persuade to pay for Pandora Premium. What Is Pandora Premium? Pandora Premium is an on-demand music streaming service in the same vein as Spotify and Apple Music. For the same $9.99-per-month price that seems to be standard across the industry, you’ll be able to play any one of 40 million songs as and when you want. Pandora Premium builds playlists based on one or two songs of your choice, using The Music Genome Project that powers Pandora Radio. Every song you have ever given a thumbs-up will be waiting for you. And you can download songs, stations, and playlists to listen to offline. In the press release announcing Pandora Premium, Tim Westergren, founder and CEO of Pandora, said: “Every day tens of millions of people trust us to choose the exact right songs for them. That’s why they spend more time with Pandora than any other music service.” “With Premium, we’re leveraging our immense trove of data and everything we’ve learned about personalization to offer a listening experience that sets a new standard for what a music service should be.” Pandora Premium is available now on Android, iOS, and Chromecast, with Pandora promising to add support for other platforms in the future. Existing Pandora Plus subscribers will get six months of Premium at no extra cost, while everyone else can sign up for an invite at pandora.com/premium.

That's exactly the feeling that Oculus head of content Jason Rubin and his team at the virtual reality firm must be encountering. Why? Because, as we all know, Facebook is a platform, and if the end-state within VR for Facebook is to become a fully functional social VR world, content generation won't be a primary goal anymore. "I don't think that's cynical," Rubin tells me at last month's Game Developers Conference. "In fact, I would say that, assuming there was a healthy ecosystem and developers were making money and enjoying what they're doing and continuing to pump back content into the system that Facebook would potentially say, 'Jason, thank you. You're done. Now that the ecosystem is set up, let independent developers, let small developers, large developers, publishers like EA, that's their business, let them do it.' "[Content generation] may not be a business that long-term Facebook wants to be in. Facebook wants VR to work, Facebook wants VR to be huge. And absolutely Facebook's long-term drive in that is to make a more social world to connect people," he continues. How many years away a fully functioning VR world is, one that transforms Facebook at its core, is anybody's guess. For the here and now, however, games are critical to drawing attention to VR technology as a whole. "Facebook's not a media company. So there may be a day where Facebook says we're going to head towards our core competency" "Everyone believes eventually there will be large groupings of people interacting in real time in VR together and we're all in various ways pushing towards that... There is motion in that direction but the user base needs to grow to get to the point where it becomes a pastime for people," Rubin says. "We understand right now my job is incredibly important. It brings these titles to fruition. And how long between where we are today and where we can say, 'Great ecosystem, you're working on your own', kind of like iOS - Apple doesn't fund a lot of titles because it is a self-sufficient ecosystem - I don't know how long it's going to take to get there... Facebook's not a media company. So there may be a day where Facebook says we're going to head towards our core competency." He adds, "That's why I don't have internal teams. I have exactly one group of three people besides Story Studios because that didn't exist outside. I have one group of three people that are working on what ended up being Dead and Buried and needed Gunfire, an external team, to do the heavy lifting on that title because we just didn't have the bandwidth to make it as fully fleshed as we can. That's why we're going to third parties; to get them educated, to set them up to succeed on their own, we want the development community to be the ones driving what happens in the future." Even if Oculus is one day dismantled, it will have done its job in making sure games thrive in VR. "Games will always be important. Facebook itself would be perfectly happy if those games organically came to the platform in the same way that games are the number one dollar revenue source for Apple. But Apple doesn't spend money getting games made for iOS because it's a standalone ecosystem," Rubin says. In the meantime, Oculus is confident that the Rift installed base will be growing significantly. My GDC interview took place just a couple days before the company slashed prices on its headset and Touch controllers. Perhaps if I had listened more carefully I would have picked up on the hints Rubin was dropping. "Putting content aside for a moment, which we believe is the most important driver of getting consumers to get into VR, the question is what else is extremely important, and based on our Best Buy demos and other demos - we've done hundreds of thousands of them - what they tell us is they want the price to change, they want the price to be reduced," notes Rubin. "We have absolutely full confidence that we're going to sell a lot of units just like [Sony has with PSVR] as we approach that price" "They're extremely excited by the potential of the VR system we show them today. They're not saying, 'Yeah I'm interested in this if it had...' They are very happy with what we offer but they would like that offering to be at a lower price. PC prices have come down, which is great but over the long run our price needs to come down as well. Adding features is not something there's a very high demand on. And if those features add price I think we're moving in the opposite direction," he says before talking about the competition. "For example, we really believed in on-device headphones. We thought it's clunky, it's too many wires. Yes, you could have your favorite pair of headphones and we totally get that and you can do that with Rift if you want to take them off, but we wanted to give people the opportunity to have on-ear headphones. We fit that into our current pricing. It wasn't in Vive's current pricing. And they've just announced that that's an extra hundred dollars to get that extra functionality - that to us is moving in the wrong direction, because you're saying for what we believe is the right headset you have to pay not $799 but $899 to get into VR. "Adding other features, higher resolution screens, cordlessness - these are all things that are inevitable to VR but if they drive up the price today our research has shown us that this is exactly the opposite of what the consumer wants. The consumer wants this VR at a better price. And in the long run, of course all those [other] things happen. In the immediate future, price is the most important thing." Sony's PlayStation VR headset, which sells for $399 ($499 for the Move bundle), is proof that price really does make a difference, Rubin believes. Sony said it almost surprised itself with the fact that nearly one million units had been sold. "I think it's more than there's a lot of PS4s out there - I think they reacted to that price point... And we have absolutely full confidence that we're going to sell a lot of units just like they have as we approach that price... I'm really happy Sony sold that many units; it's good for VR," Rubin says. Psychological thriller Wilson's Heart As more and more people buy Rifts they're going to be looking for solid games to justify their investment. While some developers scrambled to get titles out on time for Oculus' consumer launch or shortly thereafter - with only a year of time using dev kits - Rubin is emboldened by the fact that developers have real experience in the VR trenches and have learned what to do and not to do. "Some of the titles you're now starting to see are actually second generation or more titles - so for example, if you look at From Other Suns, that title is being done by Gunfire. They did Hero Bound for Gear VR and they then did Chronos, one of our best selling titles on Rift. Then on the back-end they did most of the heavy lifting for Dead and Buried, which is our number one title by time spent on Rift. And now they're launching their kind of 'this is what VR should be' game, which is very different from the types of titles people race to get out at or around the launches of our platform," Rubin says. "Developers are simply getting better at what they do. It's inevitable that we get Skyrim, GTA, Call of Duty scale games" "So I think with over 100 Touch titles alone in our PC store, 1000 titles in the Oculus ecosystem, we do have good software... What it takes to get to great software is time, experimentation, experience and budget. So we're focusing now on expanding the size of our user base, which means more sales, which means developers can spend more money. And also developers are simply getting better at what they do. It's inevitable that we get Skyrim, GTA, Call of Duty scale games. But those games take a long time to make. And they also are generally sequels of titles, which are sequels of titles and they've built up a knowledge of what they should be making. It's going to take a little while for us to get there but we are headed in the right direction and I think this generation of software and the Wilson's Hearts and Lone Echos and other stuff we have coming out are absolutely big quantum leaps towards that full ecosystem." As a developer, if Oculus is funding your project, the financial concern is lifted. Facebook has already pumped $250 million into the ecosystem and has pledged another $250 million - in fact, Rubin notes that it'll be "at least that much." But surviving without funding from Oculus requires careful planning at this stage in the VR market. "There are developers we are working with who are all-in on VR that have really good business models. They've worked out how long it's going to take for the user base to grow, what they believe they're going to spend, what they believe they're going to make and they've done a good job of planning for the growth of VR," Rubin explains. "There are other developers that are saying mobile's not a great place to be. 'Mobile's a place where I can't cut into the market. King and Supercell, they own the top of the chart, I can't make any money here, I'm too small to go console, uhhh... VR!' and they jump into the market without much of a thought. And really more than jumping into VR they are abandoning other things that aren't working for them. And some of those developers who haven't really thought it through or don't have the ability to think it through, they will have a little bit of a hard time," Rubin warns. Quidditch in space? That's one way to describe Lone Echo "But I do believe if you have a way to get involved in VR this is the next gold rush for developers. And I believe that developers understand that because there was a GDC survey that went around recently that was talking about who was working on what and [a good number] were planning to bring out titles for VR... Developers get it - it's just a question of not jumping in too quickly. Any business change has that risk." As head of content, Rubin spends much of his time looking at non-gaming experiences too. While we're all laser-focused on games, many people, especially on mobile VR, are concentrating on other VR experiences. "My team already spends about 50% of its time when it looks at mobile on experiences - non-games... In the long run, we absolutely believe that VR is far beyond games - experiences and other entertainment come first but then general social usage and other things like utilities outside [games] becomes big," Rubin affirms. "We're absolutely going to work on discoverability and search and we have a lot of ideas. Facebook is a company that's really good at getting people the things that they want in front of them" "It's a big part of our business going forward. Virtual basketball games, going to the theater, and I would also add we are currently changing the way movies are made," he adds. "There was just an article about using VR to make the next Star Wars, but I know a lot of directors - and they've called me because I know them from living in LA - who are actively predetermining shots for scenes by modeling the sets in VR. Then they are walking around or moving around to see what things look like and say, 'Ok I want to use this shot but you see that pillar that we were going to build? That's got to move and we have to change this...' So VR is literally changing the way we make movies right now in Hollywood but it's also going to change on the output side and people will absolutely be focused on VR filmmaking as we move forward." As my 35 minutes with Rubin neared an end, I asked Rubin about something critical to many developers livelihoods: discoverability. I'd agree with Rubin that 2017's crop of titles is noticeably better than 2016's, but if the games get buried in the store, that won't help the market. "We're attacking that from two ends. The first thing we're doing is curating. The long tail of stuff that people download and they go, 'Oh that was terrible', we're trying to not have that in our store. And that's not the case on everybody's store - our store is far more concise to the high end of the quality spectrum than other stores and we think that makes it easier for the consumer," he notes. "Over the long run, we're absolutely going to work on discoverability and search and we have a lot of ideas. Facebook is a company that's really good at getting people the things that they want in front of them. So we will absolutely be working on making discoverability better and addressing the problem you're talking about, but right now our strategy has been not letting bad things into the store because that starts the process of happy consumers. And then surfacing from the good stuff what a specific consumer wants is step two and we're absolutely looking to do that in the future," Rubin adds, perhaps hinting at a suggestion algorithm akin to what Amazon or Netflix utilize. For Oculus, Rubin says quality is stressed even in its less important storefront sections. "We have a high bar for our Early Access [section of the store] and we vet the teams with human beings as opposed to just letting them get in the store by either paying or just having it in there, and we trust that the developers are going to finish the products they're working on... We cut that tail of Early Access and The Gallery a lot higher than some other stores out there. So even when you go in The Gallery or you go in Early Access you're more likely to find something good." Sign up for The VR & AR newsletter and get the best of GamesIndustry.biz in your inbox.

Presently, all inputs for manufacture of mobile handsets, except chargers, batteries and headphones, are exempted from BCD and CVD. Since Apple does not intend to source its components locally, it had asked for removal of all forms of duties pre and post GST on completely knocked down and semi-knocked down units of its iPhones that will be assembled in India. The official explained that the government had introduced phased manufacturing program for mobile handsets to increase domestic value addition. Under, PMP headphones, chargers and batteries are subject to CVD of 12.5% on import since Budget 2016-17 and the domestic manufacturers of these products are extended differential excise duty dispensation “by virtue of which all their imports are exempted from BCD and CVD and excise duty of 2% is levied on domestically manufactured headphones, chargers and batteries.” “MeitY had proposed that this be extended to five more sub assemblies of mobile handsets in the budget 2017-18. However, the proposal was not agreed to by the Department of Revenue in Budget 2017-18,” the official said, adding that Apple’s request entailed the removal of all forms of existing and future duty for all components, including the three that were subject to CVD for the next 15 years. On Apple’s request for exempting all capital goods for manufacture of mobile handset from BCD and CVD, the Ministry pointed out that as part of its Budget 2017-18 recommendations, it had recommended that all capital goods for manufacture of mobile handsets be exempted from BCD and CVD. However, the request was not agreed to by the Department of Revenue in the Budget 2017-18. In a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Apple CEO Tim Cook in May 2016, there was an agreement to work together for manufacture for iPhones in India, the official said, adding that a list of requests in this regard was received in the PMO via a letter dated October 10, 2016, which was forwarded to the authorities concerned, including MeitY, Department of Revenue, Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, by the DIPP for appropriate action. To examine the issues raised by Apple, the DIPP Secretary had also convened a meeting with all ministries concerned on January 25, 2017 along with Apple representatives. “Apple is planning entry in two phases. They plan to start a manufacturing line in spring 2017 which would help them build a deeper understanding of manufacturing in India as well as operating environment in India. After, the successful completion of Phase 1 and agreement on the requirements, they would plan an expansion of their manufacturing capacity to potentially fulfil domestic demand and seek to expand to export market,” the official said.

It’s a very fun spot that has Apple fans talking, but the ad is of particular importance because it reminds iPhone users that there were tons of new iMessage features added in iOS. As the mobile messaging war heats up, Apple played catch-up in 2016 by adding a number of nifty features to its Messages app that have been around for a while in rival messaging apps. The goal, of course, is to keep iPhone users in Apple’s stock app rather than having them use third-party options instead, such as Snapchat, WhatsApp and LINE. The problem is that many iPhone owners seem to have completely forgotten about most or even all of the new iMessage features Apple introduced in iOS 10 this past September. In this post, we’ll quickly run through them all to give you a refresher and make sure you’re getting the most out of iMessage. Don't Miss: Behold: This is the iPhone 8 of your dreams Reactions Facebook’s “Like” feature first popularized the concept of reactions more than a decade ago. In a nutshell, reactions let you reply to a message without the need to actually reply. In Apple’s Messages app on the iPhone or iPad, reactions really couldn’t be easier to use. Simply tap and hold on an iMessage someone sends you in the Messages app, and you’ll see six different reaction options pop up in a bubble above the message. Bubble effects Apple’s Messages app gives you four different “bubble effects” to choose from when sending text, images or emojis through iMessage. Here’s how it works: Type out your message or insert your photo Instead of tapping the send button, 3D Touch it (or long-press on older iPhone models) Choose your desired bubble effect — choices include Slam, Loud, Gentle and Invisible Ink A preview of each effect will be shown when you select it A preview of each effect will be shown when you select it Now tap the relocated send button to send your message with the chosen effect Screen effects Like bubble effects, “screen effects” are fun new animations that accompany your messages. In this case, however, they’re full-screen effects instead of just localized animations. Type out your message or insert your photo Instead of tapping the send button, 3D Touch it (or long-press on older iPhone models) Tap the “Screen” tab at the top of the screen Swipe to the left and right until you get to the desired screen effect A preview of each effect will be shown as you swipe to it A preview of each effect will be shown as you swipe to it Now tap the send button to send your message with the chosen effect Handwriting On any message screen, turn your phone to landscape and tap the button in the bottom-right corner. This will open up a big empty pad where you can draw or hand-write messages to your recipients. Digital Touch Tap the arrow to the left of the text box and select the little icon that looks like two fingers on a heart. From there you can draw a picture or send all sorts of different effects. Stickers, gifs and more Tap the same arrow and then select the App Store icon to open up a whole wide world of content, from gifs to sticker packs and even to special plug-ins and iMessage-only apps. You can swipe from side to side to cycle through sticker packs and plug-ins you already have installed, or you can tap the four dots in the bottom-left corner to rearrange your pages and to access the iMessage App Store, where you’ll be able to download all sorts of fun third-party content. Note that when using stickers, you can tap one to send it as a new message or you can tap and hold a sticker and drag it anywhere you want in the message window. You can also use pinch gestures to enlarge or shrink a sticker as you drag it.

At the time, Apple denied any involvement and said that “retailers set their own prices” for the products. Now, Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service, however, has found Apple guilty of price-fixing in the country… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case As noted by The Financial Times, Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service found that Apple had illegally ordered retailers to fix prices of the iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 models. Specifically, Apple apparently instructed 16 retailers in Russia to set the prices at a certain amount and if a retailer was found to be selling the iPhone at an “unsuitable” price, Apple would contact them and order them to change the price or risk having the sales agreement terminated. In a statement, the FAS had the following to say, translated: The investigation revealed that since the start of official sales in Russia of the Apple iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, most resellers installed the same prices on them as recommended by Apple Rus and supported them for about 3 months. At the same time, Apple Rus monitored retail prices for Apple iPhone smartphones installed by resellers in online stores and retail outlets, and, in caseof setting “unsuitable” prices, the Russian subsidiary Apple sent emails to resellers with a request to change them. Also, compliance with recommended retail prices by resellers could be due to the provisions of contracts between Apple Rus and resellers. Apple has yet to comment on the ruling, but FAS head Andrey Tsarikovsky explained that Apple has “actively cooperated” with the agency to resolve wrongdoings: “In the course of the proceedings the Russian subsidiary of Apple actively co-operated with the FAS,” said the agency’s deputy head, Andrey Tsarikovsky. “The company has adopted the necessary measures to eliminate violations of the law and is pursuing a policy to prevent similar violations in the future.” It’s unclear at this point what sort of punishment Apple could face for its price-fixing in Russia. The company has three months to file a challenge, but it’s unclear if it plans to do so at this point. The worst case scenario for Apple is that it will be fined 15 percent of its sales in Russia, but that won’t be decided for another few months.

But is it any good? Here’s the first part of our iPhone SE review Rating:  4 Typical Price:  £359.00 Pros:  Amazing Performance; Excellent Camera; Great Battery Life; Market-Leading Ecosystem; Portable Cons:  Design is looking a bit old these days; Display isn't great; Might be a bit pricy for some; 16GB model is pointless Verdict:  If you’re good with how much the iPhone SE costs, arguably its only unappealing trait, then you’re looking at a very attractive handset that is, for the time being, completely unparalleled in the mobile space. This is the best 4in smartphone on the planet now — bar none — hence the premium price tag. facebook twitter google+ UPDATE: New iPhone SE Model Rumoured To Be Landing Next Week Apple will apparently announce a new iPhone SE model next week at an event. The star of the show will apparently be Apple’s iPad; three new Pro models are expected – 9.7, 10.5 and 12.5. The iPhone SE update, while just a rumour at present, is believed to be a 128GB model. Reports suggest some of the internal components may also be updated, but nothing is confirmed yet. The most consistent rumour is that the new iPhone SE will feature 128GB of storage. This kind of makes sense given how popular the SE has been since launch; Apple’s just giving power users what they want. Personally, I’d love to see an updated handset. One that features a new CPU, more memory, an updated camera and perhaps even a refined design. Unfortunately, I do not see this happening. Still, we can but hope! ————————————————————————————————— iPhone SE Review: A Few Months Later… I was kind of ready to rip the iPhone SE to shreds when I tested it. The handset, which is based on an ancient design language, felt regressive and a little lazy, as if Apple just slapped some new gear inside and iPhone 5s and said, “Hey, you want a 4in phone, here ya go!” But there is more to this phone than that. It grew on me unlike any phone I have ever tested before. The most jarring thing of all was just how much I enjoyed using a small phone again. I figured it would feel way too small after years of large-screen Android phones, but in the end the exact opposite happened: the iPhone SE felt great and I loved using it – and how little space it took up in my pocket. The camera is great aboard this thing too. Ditto video. Battery life is very impressive as well for a phone of this size. I used this handset for months after I finished reviewing it and while this might seem off to many it really shouldn’t because this is a solid, reliable and perfectly capable phone. The only reason I stopped using it was because I got the Pixel XL. That was it. If I hadn’t been sent the Pixel XL, I’d still be using it. Basically, what I’m saying is this: if you’re after a 4in phone, get the iPhone SE – it’s great. Add to this the fact that you simply cannot buy decent 4in phones anymore and the case for the iPhone SE gets even rosier. I know Apple isn’t updating the iPhone SE in 2017; or, at least that’s the current word on the street. Why? I have no idea. I think Apple viewed the SE as a concession to those that missed the days of 4in iPhones. But as we move through 2017, 4in iPhones are now becoming a thing of the past – even for die-hard iPhone users. Most have now moved onto the larger, standard models of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7 and this trend will likely continue with the arrival of Apple’s trio of iPhone 8 handsets later this year. Still, after using the iPhone SE, I can definitely see scope for a reboot of this handset. Perhaps one made from plastic with equally good specs that’s a lot cheaper than current models? An iPhone aimed at younger users, basically. Something that is accessible, secure and offers great value for money. Read on for my full, original review of the iPhone SE below.  ------------------------------------------------------------ Apple’s iPhone has had a pretty uneventful 12 months. The last time the company really pushed the boat out was with its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Since then it’s all been rather dull and incremental, which is likely why iPhone sales declined for the first time ever in Q1 2016. Things will of course pick up later on this year with the release of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, although whether it will be enough to ensure Apple’s growth figures remain in the black remains to be seen. Multiple analysts seem to possess a religious belief that this year’s iPhone release will not be that impactful; that next year’s iPhone release — the iPhone 7s — will be the one that once again drives big sales figures. In between all of this, though, Apple has released another iPhone. One with a 4in display that is called the iPhone SE. As releases go, this is about as exciting as finding out you have a £10 tax rebate. It’s nice, sure, but it’s hardly going to set your world on fire. I mean, it looks like iPhones from a few years ago and lacks many of the flagship features found on Apple’s current iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.  So what is the deal with this phone? Is it any good? Does it work? Is there a niche for it? And what is it like switching from a phone like the LG G5 to a phone that looks as if it just fell through a rip in time and space? I will try and answer all of these questions in my review. But first let’s take a look at the overall design and display technology on show here. iPhone SE Review: Design As I said above: the iPhone SE looks exactly the same as iPhone’s did a few years ago. For all intents and purposes, this is the iPhone 5s lock, stock and barrel, just with new internals. Apple did add a new colour scheme into the mix — rose gold — but that’s literally about it with respect to overall design and finish. Now, some people might be cool with this, they might like the way the iPhone 5s looked, and it was a nice looking phone a few years ago, but I expected more, rightly or wrongly, from Apple in this context. I’m not saying the iPhone SE is a bad looking phone — because it isn’t. What I’m saying is that Apple could and should have done more with the design of the handset. Rehashing a three year old design and marketing it as new isn’t particularly innovative and, when you factor the financial resources Apple has at its disposal, well, it kind of comes across as a little cheap. I actually rather enjoyed using a 4in phone once I’d gotten used to it; I really liked being able to do everything with one hand and I love just how little space the iPhone SE takes up in my pocket. These are all good things and if you’re after a 4in phone experience the iPhone SE is decent — so long as you don’t mind people confusing your phone with a three year old handset. But this is the point, really, isn’t it? Imagine you’ve been using the iPhone 5s since it first came out and you’ve been holding out for Apple to release a smaller, more up to date 4in phone, as rumours suggested it would, and then, when it actually does, and you go for the update, it looks EXACTLY the same as your old phone. Where’s the excitement here? Where’s that Apple magic? Physically, nowhere. The iPhone SE is about as exciting to behold as a bowl of un-sweetened porridge. It doesn’t even have the most up to date TouchID or Apple’s 3D Touch display technology. Physically, the only real change is to do with colour options — you can pick one up in Apple’s rose gold. But, hey, at least you won’t have to buy a new case for it! This is all I really have to say about the design of the iPhone SE; it’s an old iPhone with new internals. I like the size, actually. I’d forgotten what it was like to use a smaller phone after generations of phablet abuse. It was a refreshing surprise, to be sure, but I just wish Apple had done something to make the handset more appealing. As it stands the iPhone SE kind of feels a tad passive aggressive; like a begrudging concession to all those Apple alienated with its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s. And like all begrudging concessions, you get the impression that not much care and attention went into creating the iPhone SE. Just a lick of paint here and there and few internal switcharoos and, BOOM, you got yourself a NEW phone. iPhone SE Review: Display One area where Apple could have EASILY made a change is to the iPhone SE’s display. It could have bumped it to 1080p; this would have been painless and it would have greatly improved the handset, as well as give it a USP over the iPhone 6s. But Apple didn’t do this; no, it just stuck EXACTLY the same panel in as was used inside the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5s. And the iPhone SE’s display isn’t just the same resolution — it is the EXACT same technology from 2012, LCD-grade and digitiser et al. This means the panel is duller and nowhere near as crisp and detailed as, well, 99.9% of flagship-class phones now available (and the iPhone SE is NOT inexpensive!). Again, this just feels cheap. A lot of reviewers tend to make excuses for Apple, which I find odd. After all, we’re talking about the biggest tech brand in the world here; it’s not like the firm needs our help to sell phones. Had Apple upped the display technology to 1080p, or something equivalent, rather than going with a panel that is just about adequate I would gladly cut it more slack. But to essentially re-release the iPhone 5s with slightly undated internals and charge more than the cost of a decent Android flagship is, well, frankly obscene. It’s almost as if Apple thinks it is making phones for people inside a vacuum; people that don’t understand value for money. I know the iPhone SE is cheaper than “normal” iPhone flagships, but this isn’t really the point: nobody else could get away with this. They’d get crucified. If the phone cost like £150 it’d be OK, but it doesn’t — a new iPhone SE will set you back £359! That’s £110 more expensive than the OnePlus Two and that, my friends, is criminal. This phone should be priced in a similar manner to the Moto G or similar mid-range Android phones. Anything more than that is downright bonkers. iPhone SE Review: Part 2 – Specs & Hardware I appear to have angered quite a few people by suggesting that it isn’t cool for Apple to release a phone in 2016 that looks and uses the same display technology as a phone from 2012 and then charge £359 for it. But that’s fine. Opinions are great, and I like it when my opinions are challenged. It makes for a more rounded review, as readers will often consult the comments on an article for rebuttals to what’s been said by the author. So, guys, if you did take the time to comment, positively or negatively, thank you. Your thoughts are appreciated and we do read all comments. I admit, the first part of this review was pretty negative. But there is light at the end of the tunnel. I do actually quite like the iPhone SE and I did enjoy my time with it. But I will 100% stand by my opinion that this phone costs way too much given what’s actually going on with it and when you compare it to other, vastly superior and significantly cheaper Android handsets. For me, the iPhone SE leaves a lot to be desired in the design and looks department; even if I really, really wanted a 4in phone, I’d still be rather depressed this was the best Apple could do in 2016. But that’s just me. You’re free to feel differently, of course. Inside the iPhone SE things get a lot better, though. I guess this is where Apple believes you’re getting some value beyond its 4in display. The iPhone SE uses the same CPU and imaging technology as the iPhone 6s but in order to keep the price down Apple has included an older version of TouchID, and 3D Touch is not included on any of the SE models. But because it has the same A9 chipset as the iPhone 6s, things really do fly along at a pretty impressive speed. The iPhone SE outperforms the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s in Geekbench 3, which is pretty darn impressive.  In real terms, as in, when you use the handset in real-life, there is ZERO discrepancy between it and the more expensive iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. The iPhone SE simply flies, mauling whatever you throw in its path. Likely a combination of improvements in iOS 9.3 and the SE’s lower-resolution display, the A9 chipset inside it alongside the iPhone SE’s memory simply does not have to work as hard as it does inside the bigger iPhones and the net result is felt immediately. Yes, this phone looks like a throwback to yesterday but, boy, can it perform! This is one of the most pleasant things about using the SE, as well. You hold it and it feels weirdly small and non-threatening. Power it up, though, and it is a BEAST that is right up there with the best of them, including new Android phones. Now, this might sound like a 180º on what I was saying earlier when I said this was a mid-range phone by today’s standards. But it’s not. The iPhone SE might be powerful, but the cost of building it is very low ($160, according to IHS) — so low, in fact, that Apple could easily charge less and still make impressive margins. The display, for example, costs Apple over 50% less than it did five years ago at around $20 per unit. I guess this is where my disdain for the handset comes from: price. Apple is effectively charging top dollar for this handset when it costs the company very little to make. I’m not saying retail it at cost, that’d be stupid. But something like £299 (at most, ideally more like £259) would fit a lot more closely to what the iPhone SE is all about. It’d also be a great PR opportunity for the biggest technology company in the world to be seen as “giving something back” to all its loyal fans that have patronised it over the years. It’s not a bad phone; not by a long shot. But given the costs of making it and the fact it looks no different from the iPhone 5s, I’m sort of struggling to see why it costs so much. Had it been cheaper, I’d be raving about this device. Not only because of its smaller factor, but also because it is a really solid performer across the board. But if you’re not put off by the price, or by the fact it looks like a handset from 2012, then you’re very much in for a treat because the iPhone SE is an extremely solid performer and, based on historical precedent, it will likely stay this way for a good couple of years. Performance and efficiencies have never been a problem for Apple. And the iPhone SE, like the iPhone 5c before, is testament to that fact. Now if it could just sort out that pricing…. iPhone SE Review: Camera & Imaging Performance Apple’s iPhones need very little introduction in this department. For the best part of three years the iPhone has been one of the best point and shoot cameras in the business. Apple doesn’t rely on specs and MP count in this regard, either; rather it drills down on what truly makes a camera great and works there. The net result of this has been iPhone cameras with lower-graded megapixel sensors producing better shots than a good chunk of its Android rivals. This process started with the iPhone 5s, but really came into its own with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s. But if you’re coming to the iPhone SE from the iPhone 5 or iPhone 5s, well, you’re going to be in for a very pleasant treat, as this phone uses the same setup on the main camera as the iPhone 6s. It doesn’t have OIS like the Plus model, but neither does the iPhone 6s and that still produces amazing results in pretty much any situation or environment. There are more interesting setups out there, like, for instance, the LG G5’s wide-angle camera, which is apparently the same tech Apple will use in its forthcoming iPhone 7, but as a point and shoot camera that is easy to use and that produces great quality shots, the iPhone SE’s shooter is very hard to beat. I kind of wish Apple had updated the front-facing camera, still a paltry 1.2MP, but it didn’t — that’s just more cost-cutting for you, I guess. The iPhone SE features a 12MP sensor on the rear and it also benefits from the iPhone 6s’ dual-tone flash. Auto-focus, as it is on the iPhone 6s, is rapid and low-light performance is very decent. I really cannot fault this imaging setup in any way. Like the one that is available on the company’s current flagship handset it is a market-leader, both in terms of ease of use (the Camera app is great) and the actual results you can get from it. A lot of Android phones might have more raw specs in the imaging department, but it is rare when you use one that can match Apple’s way of doing things consistently. For the type of user this phone is aimed at, the quality of images you can capture, with very little effort at all, is breath-taking. I really cannot wait to see what Apple does with the iPhone 7’s camera setup. If rumours are to be believed, we could be looking at the next step in mobile imaging in just under three months time. iPhone SE Review: Battery Life I’m just going to say this right off the bat: battery life aboard this little phone is ASTOUNDING. I have never, ever, come across a phone with a battery cell this small that has anywhere near the performance of the iPhone SE; it is stunning and a testament to Apple’s degree of skill at optimising its software and hardware. Prior to testing I assumed it would be moderate to OK, compared to the iPhone 6 Plus I have been using for the past year. It isn’t — it is more than equal, managing a solid day-and-a-bit with serious, hardcore usage. To me, this was mind-blowing. How a phone this size, with such a small cell, can go head-to-head with significantly larger handsets is, once again, a marvel of the technical progression Apple has made in recent times with its SoC architecture and software. Real-world, this phone is exceptional. That’s a fact. In terms of actual benchmark testing, it’s also exceptional, as you can see in our video battery test below, whereby a video is played, on loop, with everything switched on until the phone dies. In this test the iPhone SE beat the iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6s and only missed out on the top spot, which is controlled by the Samsung Galaxy S7. This means that if you’re after a phone with exceptional battery life that isn’t the size of your head you’re left with one choice: Apple’s iPhone SE. iPhone SE Review: Verdict I gave the iPhone SE a bit of a hard time in this review. I said it costs way too much and was mean about the display and the phone not looking any different to iPhones from 2012. And I stand by this point: Apple could — and probably should — charge less for this phone based on its BOM and R&D costs. However, this doesn’t mean it is a bad phone. Because it AIN’T. Sure, you definitely want to avoid the 16GB model like the plague, and, yes, the 720p display is starting to show its age. But where this phone really comes into its own is performance, imaging and battery life. Plus you get all the rich trappings of Apple’s brilliant ecosystem, which, in many ways, cannot be equaled. I do not like the price of this phone, even more since the 16GB version is pointless, meaning you’re looking at £439 for the 32GB model, but you cannot argue with the quality that is present here. The iPhone SE is a solid, solid performer across the board. It does everything you want it to and performs like an absolute champ! I have no qualms recommending this handset to anyone that is looking for a smaller, but equally powerful handset in 2016. And if you’re good with cost, arguably this phone’s only unappealing trait, then you’re looking at a very attractive handset that is, for the time being, completely unparalleled in the mobile space. This is the best 4in smartphone on the planet now — bar none — hence the premium price tag.

The Ugreen Power Bank with Magnetic Charger not only features the portability that some Apple Watch owners are seeking, but it also features a built-in battery for wireless charging while away from a wall outlet. And here’s something that you don’t always see when it comes to third-party offerings — a built-in magnetic charging puck, meaning there’s no need to provide your own charger. Not only will such a setup save you money, but it also keeps you from having to finagle with inserting or mounting Apple’s own charger. Watch our brief hands-on video walkthrough inside for a rundown of the device’s features. The best wireless keyboard for the Mac? The Ugreen Power Bank comes with the a micro USB cable for recharging the unit’s built-in battery. The charger itself is covered in a black rubber material and features a metal power button along with four LEDs to indicating charging and discharging status. Pressing the power button will turn the unit on, and pressing the button a single time while the unit is powered-on will cause the LEDs to light up to display how much battery life remains. Specifications Lithium Battery Capacity 2200mAh Charge cutoff voltage 4.2V Micro USB input DC 5V/1500mA USB Output DC 5V/1000mA Magnetic charger DC 5V/1000mA Dimensions: 139mm-by-39.5mm-by-16mm Made for Apple Watch (MFi certified) Video walkthrough Subscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more hands-on videos A long press on the Power Bank’s power button will turn the device off. If the charger is not connected to charging equipment, it’s smart enough to go into standby mode after a period of inactivity. I found the Ugreen Power Bank to be very convenient, as not only did it allow me to charge my Apple Watch while away from home, but I could also leverage the 5W USB port to recharge my iPhone if needed. Granted, a 2200mAh battery isn’t capable of fully recharging my iPhone 7 Plus, but it’s a nice option to have for topping off the battery if nothing else. The feature that makes this Apple Watch accessory so attractive is its portability. I can easily stick it in my pocket or backpack and keep my Apple Watch charged with minimal effort. It’s unfortunate that the unit still uses micro USB, but I understand that it’s taking some time for manufacturers to fully move over to USB-C. Yep, it works with Nightstand mode At just shy of $60, the Ugreen Power Bank isn’t cheap, but the fact that it comes with a built-in magnetic charger, an item that normally costs around $30, eases the sting of the price. If you can live with the micro USB charging and you often find yourself devoid of Apple Watch battery life while on the go, then I recommend this product. Have you used any third-party Apple Watch charging solutions, or have you stuck with Apple’s own magnetic charging disc or charging dock?

As users, we expect all the thinness, lightness, and versatility that we’re used to from smartphones, but married to the always-on time display and two-day battery life of a mechanical watch. And we’re only willing to pay impulse-purchase prices. It’s a recipe for nightmare compromises, and the more attempts I see at solving the challenge, the more I come to appreciate the original pioneers like Samsung’s flawed but trailblazing Galaxy Gear and Apple’s original Watch. As things stand today, two years after its release, the Apple Watch still presents the best balance between looks, size, function, battery life, and price. One of the things that initially rankled me about the Apple Watch was that, with its display laying dormant most of the time, it wasn’t constantly showing the time and thus wasn’t really a watch in my eyes. But that’s the compromise Apple chose to accept, preserving the battery in exchange for a small delay in showing the time when I turn my wrist to look at the watch. Most of its Android rivals are now moving to an "ambient mode" that keeps two faintly drawn watch hands on the screen at all times, but it’s not as good or as pretty as having a real watch face. And it’s not friendly to the battery. Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 Tag Heuer seems to have magicked up the ideal device in the Connected Modular 45 watch, which has ambient mode, a reasonably thin case, and a decent 30-hour battery life — but it costs $1,600. So the Tag Heuer compromise is, unsurprisingly, price. Apple designs its way around the shortcomings of its devices better than its competitors Apple simply designed its way around the shortcomings of smartwatches better than everyone else. The company seems to have been conscious of the fact that, like a parked car, the watch will sit inactive most of the time, and so it needed to have an appearance that was appealing even without surfacing a time. Ideally, an appearance that made it look like a cohesive thing that didn’t have a screen at all. That’s part of why the Apple Watch looks the way it does: it’s a sculpted black monolith, whose darkness spills over the edges and either blends into a black metal frame or contrasts nicely with a lighter color. Returning to the car analogy, it reminds me of a fine auto with tinted windows, which is not a bad association to have. The Apple Watch is self-evidently a piece of technology, but its soft, pebbly shape is friendly and universal. Huawei Watch 2 Compare that with the new Tag Heuer watch, the recently launched Huawei Watch 2, or the earlier LG G Watch R, each of them exhibiting a big honking bezel with minute markings around the side. It’s logical to take design cues from existing watches, but by now we should all be fully aware of how different smartwatches are from traditional ones. The classic watch design is basically a frame, a focusing device intended to center your attention onto the watch’s dial — and when it has extra adornments, like minute markings, it’s to augment that dial’s display. But these are digital watches with a myriad of possible things they can display. What good are those minute markers when I'm hailing a taxi or completing an Android Pay transaction? Do they help or hinder the look of the watch if I happen to prefer a digital readout of the time? Smartwatch design should be informed by classical watches, but not ruled by them The approach of putting a physical frame designed for an unchanging, permanent display onto an endlessly variable, oftentimes dormant digital one is simply wrongheaded, in my judgment. And it’s these seemingly small design decisions that ultimately hamper Android Wear competitors to the Apple Watch. When Motorola was still into making watches, it built the gorgeous Moto 360, but gave it atrocious battery life and only a so-so screen with an infamous "flat tire" sliver at the bottom. Asus’ original ZenWatch might have come closest to matching the Apple Watch’s cohesive look, but it lacked Apple’s degree of refinement and polish. Samsung Gear S2 My favorite smartwatch to date is Samsung’s Gear S2, which has an ambient display, good battery life, a fair price, and a bezel that’s actually functional rather than merely decorative. But I don’t rate it as highly in design terms, because, well, Samsung didn’t exactly overextend itself in photocopying the generic outline of a watch. The Apple Watch, on the other hand, looks like a piece of techno jewelry; and because it doesn't try to disguise itself as a regular watch, I no longer feel offended about seeing it without a time on its face. Unfortunately, the trend now seems to be toward feature and connectivity bloat, as exhibited by Samsung’s much less magical Gear S3, Huawei’s universally disappointing Watch 2, and LG’s tragicomic enormity known as the Watch Sport. They all have cellular options, yes, but they achieve that by adding intolerable bulk and weight. Design considerations are still being paid lip service, but it seems like it’s an easier pitch to sell people on features rather than good looks and ergonomics. Tag Heuer might argue it’s found the right balance, however at more than $1,000, it has a steeper hill to climb in proving its value to customers who’d usually expect to be buying a timepiece that lasts for generations, not mere months. So, for the immediate future at least, the Apple Watch looks like the best designed smartwatch that any of us can get. For many of us, its greatest limitation is that it’s locked inside Apple’s walled garden, remaining a toy only iOS users can have. But that’s by design.

By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | March 14, 2017 -- 17:15 GMT (10:15 PDT) | Topic: iOS It's likely that Apple will release iOS 10.3 before the end of the month, which means you have some time to get your hardware ready for the upgrade. more iphone news iPhone 8 may not have the killer feature we've been hoping for The next iPhone won't switch to USB-C, but the cable might iPhones are much more unreliable than Android devices, claims report The iPhone decade: Apple's transition from Steve Jobs to Tim Cook The Cloud? Apple's iOS can't handle the Cloud Here's what you need to do to make sure things go smoothly for you. See also: Learn to become a Google Chrome power user Will you get iOS 10.3? First things first, will you get iOS 10.3? Here is a complete list of the devices that are supported by this release (basically, if you have iOS 10, you can get this upgrade): iPad 4th gen iPad Air iPad Air 2 iPad Pro (12.9- and 9.7-inch) iPad mini 2 iPad mini 3 iPad mini 4 iPod touch 6th iPhone 5 iPhone 5c iPhone 5s iPhone SE iPhone 6/6 Plus iPhone 6s/6s Plus iPhone 7/7 Plus To know what device you have, use this page to decipher the model number, which you can find on the back of the device or under Settings > General > About > Model. Is your device not in the list? Then you're out of luck. Back up your data Before you do anything major, such as upgrading your device, you need to make sure that you have a backup just in case things don't go smoothly. This is doubly so for iOS 10.3 because for the first time Apple is changing the iOS file system from the 30+ year old HFS+ for Apple File System. Apple File System is a huge improvement over HFS+, bringing with it features such as optimization for solid state storage, strong encryption, better file time stamping (down to the nanosecond), and many storage saving improvements. Apple plans to move macOS, iOS, tvOS, and even watchOS to Apple File System. But the two file systems are not compatible with each other, and once you upgrade to Apple File System, there's no way to convert back to HFS+ without blowing away all your data and reformatting the storage. What this means is that when iOS 10.3 is installed, every file stored on the device will be converted from the old format to the new format. And while we can expect that Apple will put a lot of effort into making this conversion process as smooth and painless as possible, upgrading a file system always opens up the possibility that something can go wrong. And if something does go wrong, data loss is a real possibility if the upgrade process has started converting files. Which is why you need a backup. You can either back up your data to iCloud (go to Settings > iCloud > Backup, then turn on iCloud Backup), or if you don't have enough space, you can take the old-school road and connect your iPhone or iPad to a PC to do the backup through iTunes.

SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 6 NEXT PREV Spring clean your device Chances are good that your iPhone or iPad has accumulated a lot of detritus over the months and years, so what better time to get rid of it than now. While iOS 10.3 doesn't need as much free space to install as earlier releases, getting rid of apps that you no longer use -- or perhaps have never used -- makes good sense. This is also a good time to find replacements for those aging apps that you've been using for years but that haven't seen an update in ages (usually because they've been abandoned by the developer). If you've been seeing some apps generate a message saying that it may slow down the device until the developer updates it to improve its compatibility then in iOS 10.3 that warning will be upgraded to suggest that the app "will not work with future versions of iOS," which means the end is nigh. Best iPhone or iPad apps (March 2017) SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 25 NEXT PREV Do I need to delete apps to make space for the upgrade? Not if you are on iOS 9 or above, because the operating system will clear space for you (even if that means deleting and redownloading apps). If you are on an earlier version, and you're cramped on space, then you might need to clear space by deleting apps (be careful -- because you will lose any associated data), deleting audio or video content (music, downloaded videos, audio books, etc), or moving data such as photos to the cloud (keep reading for more information). Update your apps If you've not updated your apps in a while, then this is a good time to do so, because a lot of the apps will have been updated to make them compatible with iOS 10 (although apps designed for iOS 9 seem to run well based on my testing). While it's likely that your device automatically updates apps in the background, it's not a bad idea to check just to make sure. Find the App Store app, then tap on it, and click Update (bottom-right of the screen). Once in there, you can kick off the update process. Put your photos in the cloud Another thing you can do is to upload your photos to the cloud. ZDNet's sister site CNET has an excellent rundown of some of the free services you can use for this. Know your passwords Following the upgrade, you'll need to enter your iCloud password in order to be able to reconnect to all your data and photos. If you don't have this close to hand -- remember, having it on the device you're upgrading isn't all that convenient -- then this might be a good time to do that. Also, if your iTunes backup is encrypted, then remember you'll need that password if something goes wrong! Pocket tools and gadgets "Every Day Carry"... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 13 NEXT PREV Is it better to upgrade or wipe a device and start from scratch? It's a lot less hassle to just upgrade a device because you get to keep all your apps and settings. However, devices that I have wiped and reloaded a new iOS onto, and then installed and re-setup all my apps and such, feel faster and seem to suffer from fewer problems (such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi issues). However, wiping and reloading the apps and data is pretty big hassle, and it's probably more work than most want to undertake. Should I wait a while before doing the upgrade? There will likely be an update or two to iOS 10.3 in the weeks following its release, so you might want to wait for the dust to settle and for any last-minute bugs to be squashed before making the leap, especially if you rely on your device. Also, if you use your device in a BYOD setting, make sure you get the OK from the IT department before upgrading, in case you're unable to access the network or data you need.

X Apple’s Jade pips Willie Mullins duo to take Mares’ Hurdle Bryan Cooper’s mount holds off market leaders Limini and Vroum Vroum Mag Tue, Mar 14, 2017, 16:55 Apple’s Jade and Bryan Cooper finished ahead of Limini (R) and Vroum Vroum Mag to take the Mares’ Hurdle. Photograph: Stefan Wermuth/Reuters         Apple’s Jade saw off former stable companions Vroum Vroum Mag and Limini in a pulsating climax to the OLBG Mares’ Hurdle at Cheltenham. Willie Mullins had saddled the last eight winners of the two-and-a-half-mile contest and fired a twin assault in his bid to extend his record, with Ruby Walsh preferring Limini to last year’s heroine Vroum Vroum Mag, the mount of Paul Townend. Having pipped Vroum Vroum Mag in the Hatton’s Grace at Fairyhouse in December before finding Limini too strong at Punchestown last month, former Closutton inmate Apple’s Jade appeared the biggest threat. And so it proved, as the Irish trio treated race goers to a barnstorming finish. Bryan Cooper was the most positive of the three riders, having positioned Gordon Elliott’s charge close to the pace before sending her to the front a mile from home. The Rich Ricci-owned pair of Vroum Vroum Mag and Limini closed in before the home turn, with Gigginstown House Stud’s Apple’s Jade sandwiched in between them as the three horses knuckled down for a tussle up the famous hill. For a moment it looked like Vroum Vroum Mag was going best, but Apple’s Jade dug deepest and was ultimately well on top as she passed the post a length and a half to the good, with Limini another nose away in third. Cooper said: “She’s all heart. We were confident coming here. “Gordon’s a genius and I’m very lucky to ride for him.” Elliott was completing a double, having earlier landed the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle with Labaik. “She was tough. We knew that the ground was going to suit her,” said Elliott. “Today was her Gold Cup. I put a tongue-strap on her for the first time today. Today was her day and thankfully it worked out. “We knew she would have come on a good bit for Punchestown and this was the plan. She is as tough as old boots. ADVERTISEMENT “She will stay three miles next year. I would imagine we will go to Punchestown.” Ricci was magnanimous in defeat, saying: “It was a great race. Apple’s Jade is a multi-winning Grade One winner. “I think she’s a very, very good mare and she wouldn’t be out of place in the Champion Hurdle. “I don’t think there are any excuses. “It was a great race, unfortunately we were on the losing end.” Mullins added: “They are running well but have been unlucky. “Both travelled good into the race and they had their chance. Both ran up to their form. I thought they each ran their race.”       Topics: Apple’s Jade Bryan Cooper Gordon Elliott Limini Vroum Vroum Mag Willie Mullins Read More Buveur D’Air thrashes field to take Champion Hurdle Tiger Roll gives Gordon Elliott an opening day hat-trick Altior made to work but eventually eases to Arkle victory Labaik and Jack Kennedy hold off Melon to take Supreme Willie Mullins to justify punters’ Cheltenham trust again Cheltenham Festival tips - Day One Scene set for big odds shock in uncertain Champion Hurdle New technology stacks odds more in bookies’ favour, say punters Champion Hurdle: Horse-by-horse guide Forty years since Champion Hurdle rated finest ever run Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Rugby Joe Schmidt not hiding as Big Brother looms large on horizon Racing Cheltenham: Mullins empire strikes back with stunning four-timer Sport Sonia O’Sullivan: Why can’t men and women just ride along?

Designed for the fourth-generation Apple TV, the sixth tvOS 10.2 beta can be obtained by connecting the Apple TV to a computer with a USB-C to USB-A cable, downloading and installing the software from a registered developer account via iTunes or Apple Configurator. Once a profile is installed, subsequent betas can be downloaded over the air. Given the tricky installation requirements, tvOS betas are limited to developers and will not be provided to the public. According to Apple's release notes, tvOS 10.2 introduces improved scrolling behavior, allowing tvOS users to scroll through large lists of information more quickly. A large swipe on the Siri remote automatically activates the new scrolling mode, and a swipe on the far right side of the remote allows users to navigate specific indexes. It's likely there are other small feature tweaks and bug fixes included in tvOS 10.2, even though additional changes have not been specifically outlined by Apple. We'll update this post should if any new content is found in the sixth tvOS 10.2 beta.

Despite being manufactured in 1976, The Apple-1, complete with original documents and even records of telephone calls with company founders Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, is expected to fetch up to £262,000 at auction. It is one of only eight working examples left in the world still showing the roots of the technology giant today. The Apple-1 was designed and built by hand by Wozniak in Silicon Valley. He began marketing it along with Steve Jobs through the electronics chain Byte Shop in 1976, after the retailer bought the first 50 units.

They originally went on sale for £545, (US $666.66) as Wozniak liked repeating numbers. Despite it being the first PC ever that was ready to use with monitor and keyboard access, it was actually delivered as just the motherboard. This meant users had to get hold of a power pack, keyboard, monitor, and cassette recorder of their own. This example comes complete with the necessary equipment to make it work, as well as proof of telephone correspondence with Wozniak and Jobs. It also contains the original card and the original early 6502 microprocessor in a rare white ceramic design. The card contains the software system Basic, which was only available for Apple-1 at the beginning of 1977.

A spokesperson said: “The Apple-1 is already a legendary highlight of the great, young history of the computer. “This Apple-1 has the very rare, original NTI sign. “According to the Apple-1 register, compiled by Mike Willegal, there are only 60 sets still in existence, and a mere eight in working order! “This model has the serial number 01-0073 and is logged as the fourteenth in the register.

The founders chose Isaac Newton as a symbol in recognition of the binary system he was credited with inventing in the 18th century.” Read More British woman discovers rare 1970s computer in garage used to power the US nuclear weapons system The computer being auctioned is believed to be one of just eight left in working order (Photo: Caters) Apple changed their logo in 1977 to the world- famous apple with a bite taken out of it. This was in response to the first advertising campaign run by their client, The Byte Shop, and allowed them to use the slogan: “Byte into an Apple.” The computer is being auctioned by Auction Team Breker in Cologne, Germany, on March 20.

However, if you are looking to replace macOS with Linux, you may want to delete this for some extra disk space 3 Free Apps to Analyze & Inspect Your Mac's Hard Disk Space 3 Free Apps to Analyze & Inspect Your Mac's Hard Disk Space Wondering where all of your Mac's storage has gone? These free apps will let you know. Read More . You also may want to restore it if you switch back to macOS. Here’s how to delete or restore your Mac’s recovery partition. The Basics of the Recovery Partition When booting up your Mac, you can hold down Command+ R to boot into the Recovery partition of your Mac. If your Mac has a problem, this is your place to access utilities, restore from Time Machine, or as a last resort: get a clean install of macOS. The main menu offers four options: Restore from Time Machine Backup How to Restore Data From Time Machine Backups How to Restore Data From Time Machine Backups It's really easy to set up Time Machine, the backup software that comes with every Mac — but how do you get your files back when things go wrong? Read More , Reinstall macOS, Get Help Online, and Disk Utility. These are self-explanatory, though to look online for help or reinstall macOS, you need to connect your Mac to the internet. There are additional utilities that aren’t listed but available in a menu item: Firmware Password Utility, Network Utility, and Terminal. If you are using a Mac made after 2010, you can also boot into a network-only Recovery Mode by holding Option + Command+ R to help if you are having an issue with your local disk booting. Deleting the Recovery Partition If you have a USB stick with the latest macOS installer How to Install Mac OS X Using A Removable USB Drive How to Install Mac OS X Using A Removable USB Drive Apple doesn't provide an official tool to create bootable copies of their operating system, but that doesn't mean it can't be done. Read More , and want to get around 650 MB of disk space on your Mac back, then you can delete the Recovery Partition. Even with a backup installer, you want to make sure that you back up all of your data with something like Carbon Copy Cloner, in case something goes wrong. We are all adults here, and if you are okay working without a safety net you do not need to have the USB Drive per se, but you have been warned. Note: How you proceed will depend on whether you’re using Core Storage or not, so be sure to pay attention to this next bit. Regardless of what you do, a functional backup is very important when you start messing with partitions as things can and do go wrong. 1. Core Storage and a Dirty Hack Apple introduced Core Storage as part of the Fusion Drive tech. As a part of the eventual move away from HFS+, Apple has begun to move partitions to Core Storage volumes during the upgrade process to macOS. I hosed my old 2011 Air twice messing around with the Core Storage partition and ended up having to restore from my Time Machine backup. You can find out if your system drive was converted to Core Storage by entering the following command into Terminal: diskutil list If you see that the command lists your system drive with the type AppleCoreStorage, it is not recommended to go forward. Even the power of Terminal does not deal with these partitions very well, and you can easily end up having to restore your Mac from a backup. There is a solution, but it is a relatively dirty hack. What you can do is create a clone of your drive externally using Carbon Copy Cloner Carbon Copy Cloner - A Free & Powerful Backup Utility (Mac) Carbon Copy Cloner - A Free & Powerful Backup Utility (Mac) Read More . If you do not already have it installed, download it here. After that, plug in your USB drive and open Disk Utility. Click on the USB drive and select Erase. Name the drive, and then set  the format to Mac OS Extended (Journaled) and set the scheme to GUID Partition Map. Once you format your disk correctly, open Carbon Copy Cloner. You should be prompted to create your first job, if you are not select New Task from the File menu. Select your Mac’s system drive as the source and your newly formatted system drive as the destination. You can select Done and kick off the copy. The wait may vary based on the size of your system, so you may want to make some coffee or tea while you wait. When it is complete, shut down your Mac and boot up holding the Option key to select your boot disk. Select your USB drive to boot from, and you should boot into your same system. Once you are back into macOS, open the Computer folder from Finder and make sure that you eject your Mac’s disk. Then open the Disk Utility. Repeat the steps to erase your system disk with the single partition. Then, reverse the Carbon Copy Cloner job to restore your drive. When Carbon Copy Cloner asks if you want to include a Recovery Partition, answer No. Now your Mac no longer has the Recovery Partition. 2. Terminal If your Mac still has an older style partition table, the easiest way to delete your recovery partition is to use Terminal These 6 Awesome Terminal Commands Will Boost Your MacBook These 6 Awesome Terminal Commands Will Boost Your MacBook You can only cram so much into graphical user interface before it becomes cluttered, so it should come as no big surprise that you can do some really cool things using the Mac Terminal. Read More , though your account needs to have admin rights for this to work. Find your Recovery partition using the command: diskutil list This command is the Terminal version of Disk Utility, and list gives you a list of all your disks and their partitions. You want to be careful here, as you do not want to delete the wrong partition unintentionally. Look for the partition, probably at the bottom of the list, Recovery HD. You will want to delete this and merge it into your main partition. To do so first delete the partition using the command: diskutil eraseVolume JHFS+ Blank disk0s3 This command deletes the Recovery partition and replaces it with blank space. Make sure that your Recovery HD partition is listed as disk0s3. If it is not, change the command to match your disk. There are now two partitions on the disk: our normal system disk and a new blank partition. For the next step, we need to combine the two, leaving our drive as a single partition. That is a simple command: diskUtil mergeParitions JHFS+ disk0s2 disk0s3 This command merges the two preserving all of the data on your system disk. Be sure to double check those volume labels against your own disks to avoid losing data. Even doing everything right when messing with partition tables, something can go awry. Be sure that you are not working without a backup. You can now list your partitions again and see that your disk is one partition for your system disk and an EFI boot partition. Now that you have your disk how you want it, the challenge becomes keeping it that way. Restoring Your Recovery Partition One of the easiest ways to have the Recovery partition restore itself is to update macOS. Unfortunately, that means that it might come back even when you do not want it. If you removed it altogether, this can be problematic. There isn’t an option when applying updates, so you need to repeat the steps to ensure that you are safe. If you switched to Linux and are using just the hardware Buying MacBooks For Penguins: Linux on Apple Hardware Buying MacBooks For Penguins: Linux on Apple Hardware You'd probably think that the free open source operating system Linux wouldn't mix too well with Apple's proprietary, controlling approach when it comes to hardware — but you'd be wrong. Read More , this became a lot easier. You can just delete or ignore macOS and go about your business. If you’re looking to restore it without having to donwload updates, you may want to repeat the Carbon Copy Cloner steps in the section on Core Storage partitions. Just where it says to select No, select Create Recovery Volume.

By Jason Cipriani | March 14, 2017 -- 16:17 GMT (09:17 PDT) | Topic: Apple Image: Apple As we near the middle of March, expectations and rumors continue to grow surrounding Apple's iPad lineup. As ZDNet's David Gewirtz notes, a spring Apple event is likely, though the exact timing is a mystery. Today's rumor comes from DigiTimes, which is reporting Apple has moved production of a 10.5-inch iPad from the May or June timeframe to March. Latest review Battle of the Android flagships: HTC 10, LG G5, and Samsung Galaxy S7 All three of these phones are outstanding and are priced lower than a comparable iPhone 6s or 6s Plus. Read More The report goes on to say the new iPad is expected to be announced at an event in "early April," using Apple's new headquarters. The event would presumably be held at Steve Jobs Theater. The rumor matches up with the already announced April opening for the spaceship-style campus, and what better way to show it than by hosting a special event? What's unknown right now is if the event will focus solely on the 10.5-inch iPad, or if refreshed 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models will also make an appearance. According to DigiTimes, the 10.5-inch tablet will target business and education users, two areas where the company will need to succeed if it wants to get back to growing tablet sales. Apple declined to comment. In recent days, TechCrunch reported four new iPad models showing up in web logs, while MacRumors is reporting its sources claim new iPads will be announced as soon as next week -- with or without a special event. In other words, at this point, it's anyone's guess as to what Apple is truly planning. One thing we do know, however, is that there's an awful lot of evidence to suggest new iPads are just around the corner.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple wins an iPhone Patent Supporting both an Alternative Touch ID Methodology and an Apple Pencil Charging Dock | Main | Samsung to introduce 3D Force Touch Virtual Home Button for the Galaxy S8 and win Orders from Apple for Similar Technology » March 14, 2017 Is Apple moving up their iPad Launch Date to Keep Samsung's new Tablet Lineup in Check?   This year Samsung passed on delivering their new Samsung S8 in Barcelona as in previous years mainly due to the official Note 7 disaster findings only being made public on February 22. Other reasons for delaying the S8 include wanting to launch the S8 with Bixby, its new digital assistant; and to introduce a new virtual home button that will use their home grown next-gen 3D force touch technology to get closer to Apple's current 3D touch.   To fill the gap for Samsung at the Mobile World Congress trade show, that is usually filled by a new smartphone, Samsung delivered new Tab S3 tablets, an all-new Windows 10 Galaxy Book hybrid tablet/notebook device along with a new stylus of their own along with new a stylus from STAEDTLER Noris which has been widely applauded by the tech world.   Samsung made it clear that it was doubling down on tablets for the enterprise with Windows and its Office Suite while doubling down on tablets for artists with more stylus options that includes one from Wacom. It would seem that Samsung wants to become a more serious competitor to Apple's iPad and iPad Pro line up.   Today we're learning through Apple's supply chain that production scheduling for the new iPads has been moved up. Is Apple reacting to Samsung's new lineup or is it because the Steve Jobs Theater will be opening in April as the Digitimes report is surmising?   While we'd all like to see the new Steve Jobs Theater open sooner rather than later, Apple's press release about Apple Park made it clear that the new theater would only open "later this year" – likely to introduce the anniversary iPhone.   Beyond where the event will be held, Digitimes reports today that "Apple has moved ahead the production for its planned new 10.5-inch iPad to March instead of an earlier timetable set for May-June." This is likely to translate to an iPad event in April.   The report further noted that "The 10.5-inch iPad will target education and business sectors, and together with an upgrade 12.9-inch iPad Pro, the two models will be Apple's mainstream products for the mid-tier to high-end tablet market in 2017.   Lastly, the report noted that the production schedule for the upgraded 12.9-inch iPad Pro still remains unclear. Digitimes sources estimate that volume production of the new 12.9-inch iPad Pro will come later in Q2.   In the end, is Apple reacting to Samsung's new tablet lineup by launching their new iPads earlier than expected or has the rumor mill simply gotten it wrong all along? I think it's the later, what say you?   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

(Photo: Apple)  Share  Comments Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email The iPad Pro was unveiled as a laptop replacement by Apple and has since come to represent the company's premium tablet product. It launched alongside the Apple Pencil stylus and the company followed it up with a smaller 9.7-inch version with a thinner design and better display. But that was a year ago in March 2016 and many Apple fans are anticipating a refresh to come sooner rather than later. New rumours have been circulating suggesting an upgraded iPad Pro is imminent. We've scoured the web to find out what the experts are saying. Read More Apple Spring event: New iPad Pro could be revealed as early as NEXT WEEK Could the new iPad Air and iPad mini be changing their name to the match the iPad Pro? (Photo: Getty) Latest News According to unnamed sources, the next iPad may be unveiled by the end of March 27 at a special event Apple is planning to hold. The highly secretive company doesn't publicise its events until the last second, but sources on its supply chain have been talking to Apple-focused site MacRumours . "Apple is expected to announce new products later this month, most likely between Monday, March 20 and Friday, March 24, according to reputable supply chain analysts we spoke to who wish to remain anonymous," the site reported. Release Date The new 9.7" iPad pro was announced in March this year Read More iPad Pro review: You won't touch your desktop for weeks on end There are two obvious windows where Apple could be announcing the iPad Pro 2 - either in March 2017, or potentially alongside a new iPhone later in the autumn. The 9.7-inch iPad Pro was released in March 2016. Apple has previously updated its tablet models annually, making around March 2017 a logical guess. Thankfully, Apple doesn't usually keep us waiting once it's made an announcement. Conceivably, a new version of the iPad Pro could be on UK shelves by the end of March or the beginning of April 2017. Price The iPad Pro is currently the only iPad that's compatible with Apple's Smart Keyboard (Photo: Getty Images) Read More iPhone 8's most highly-anticipated feature has been DUMPED by Apple, report claims As with the release date, Apple's pricing structure is fairly easy to guess because it usually stay the same. Going off the current 12.9-inch iPad Pro pricing, you'll be looking to spend: 32GB: £679 128GB: £799 256GB: £919 If you're after a 4G-compatible model it will push the price up to around: 128GB: £899 256GB: £1019 Currently in the iPad family, alongside the iPad Pro Daddy, you have the iPad Air 2 and two versions of the iPad mini. However there have been suggestions that Apple wants to bring all the various models under the one 'iPad Pro' banner. This means that we might end up with just the iPad Pro model, coming in each of Apple's three screen sizes: 12.9-inch, 9.7-inch and 7.9-inch. Specs The Apple Pencil allows users to sketch and annotate Read More New battery technology could give your iPhone the staying power of a Nokia 3310 The question of whether it can replace a laptop remains to be seen. Currently you can connect Apple's Smart keyboard to the iPad Pro, but still users say that it's not quite up to scratch as a complete substitute for your laptop. It certainly has competition in this area from Microsoft's Surface Pro , so upping the iPad's capabilities is something we're sure Apple will spend time working on. There's currently some spec discrepancies between the newer 9.7-inch version and the 12.9-inch, including the True Tone display and 4K video recording, so the 12.9-inch model will - at the very least - be upgraded to match. Apple is also rumoured to be making the switch from an LED panel to an OLED one, which would mean even more impressive colours. Apple site Macotakara suggests that Apple could even introduce a new screen size with the next version of the iPad Pro. It believes that a 10.9-inch version will be revealed alongside the standard 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch versions. It also believes that the bezel (the space around the screen) will be shrunk further down causing the home button to be removed. Apple took away the physical home button on the iPhone 7 so it's conceivable they could do something similar with the next iPad Pro. Apple Pencil Expect to see Rose Gold added to the line-up of colours (Photo: Apple) Read More Best iPad Pro apps to get your artistic juices flowing with the Apple Pencil stylus The Apple pencil, is one of the defining features of the iPad Pro, featuring pressure sensitivity and angle detection. Already, the precision and responsiveness of the stylus is hailed as one of the best on the tablet market, and no doubt Apple will be working hard to further its functinalities. No leaked images of an updated Apple Pencil have been released, but as rumours emerge we'll be sure to add them in here. Design This iPad Pro worth £499 could be yours Read More Samsung Galaxy Tab S3: Release date, price, specs and features of Samsung's new iPad rival From all the leaked photos that we've come across so far, the design of the iPad Pro 2 looks to be pretty similar. What will be interesting to see is whether Apple drops the headphone port on the new iPad as it did with the iPhone 7. As one of the defining feature of the Pro is its size and stylus, we think it would be safe to assume that Apple will continue with both. We also think the iPad Pro 2 will come in a "rose gold" option, which is now available in most of Apple's other products, including the iPhone and MacBook. Keep checking back here as more leaks will surface as it gets nearer to being released.

This was the bold target revealed by the company’s global commercial director Henri Salameh (pictured), who was speaking to Mobile News at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. According to analysts Canalys, the UK market in Q3 last year was dominated in terms of share by Apple (44.63 per cent) and Samsung (33.57 per cent), followed by Huawei (7.26 per cent), Sony (3.53 per cent) and Lenovo (2.84 per cent). At the heart of its drive is STK Care, a monitoring tool which allows owners of any of its smartphone to self-diagnose their device for any problems. For example, users can access a tool which lets them check if their touchscreen or speakers are working to their full potential. They are also able to access an online messaging centre built into the phone which puts them in live contact with a troubleshooting team in the UK. This team includes six employees among STK’s total base of 100. Launched in a beta stage last year, it had been made standard on all commercial STK devices at the start of 2017. Unique services Salameh claimed giving customers such control of these devices would help differentiate STK and achieve its goals. “It’s not enough having a device that’s affordable. You need a product with features that stand out. “STK Care can help us do that. Users have absolute control and can see any problems their devices have. That makes us unique because I don’t know of any other handset with similar features. “Our customers can simply avoid the hassle of having to take their phone to an operator or a third party repairer when there is a problem. This reduces the steps and will be at the heart of all our products. I’m confident having unique features like these can help us get into the top five in the UK in the next four years.” STK specialises in sub-£200 smartphones. It has four devices in its range: Hero, Galactic, Storm and Sync. It was formed in 1993 as accessories distributor Santok before moving into internal manufacturing six years later. It rebranded to STK last year. In the UK, it partnered with mobile industry consultancy Our Perspective to expand its sales reach in the region. It is currently in talks with a number of retailers and B2B distributors about stocking its devices. At last year’s MWC, Salameh told Mobile News that striking the right partnerships with UK distributors was key in growing STK’s presence. Most of its significant growth has been outside of the UK in some 150 markets, which include Mexico, the US and Spain. Last year saw the firm record revenues of £15 million in the UK, part of a global £50 million figure. Total worldwide shipments stood at 1.8 million, up from 1.6 million the previous year. New appointment STK has also appointed former Kazam vice president of sales Rakesh Odedra as its new UK and Europe head of device sales. Odedra joined STK at the start of December last year. He had been at fellow challenger manufacturer Kazam since September 2013. He was previously Lycamobile UK and Ireland sales director (June 2012 to June 2013) and Lebara Mobile head of sales (April 2011 to May 2012). Duties in the newly created role will see Odedra drive sales throughout the UK and Europe,whilst also leading the sales team.

Willie Mullins had saddled the last eight winners of the two-and-a-half-mile contest and fired a twin assault in his bid to extend his record, with Ruby Walsh preferring Limini to last year's heroine Vroum Vroum Mag, the mount of Paul Townend. Having pipped Vroum Vroum Mag in the Hatton's Grace at Fairyhouse in December before finding Limini too strong at Punchestown last month, former Closutton inmate Apple's Jade appeared the biggest threat. And so it proved, as the trio treated racegoers to a barnstorming finish. Bryan Cooper was the most positive of the three riders, having positioned Gordon Elliott's charge close to the pace before sending her to the front a mile from home. The Rich Ricci-owned pair of Vroum Vroum Mag and Limini closed in before the home turn, with Gigginstown House Stud's Apple's Jade sandwiched in between them as the three horses knuckled down for a tussle up the famous hill. For a moment it looked like Vroum Vroum Mag was going best, but Apple's Jade dug deepest and was ultimately well on top as she passed the post a length and a half to the good, with Limini another nose away in third. It's a double for Golden Elliot as Apple's Jade takes the OLBG Mares' Hurdle from the Ricci pair of Vroum Vroum Mag and Limini #TheFestival pic.twitter.com/3diKbF25Nr — Racing UK (@Racing_UK) March 14, 2017 Cooper said: "She's all heart. We were confident coming here. "Gordon's a genius and I'm very lucky to ride for him." Elliott said: "She was tough. We knew that the ground was going to suit her. "Today was her Gold Cup. I put a tongue-strap on her for the first time today. Today was her day and thankfully it worked out. "We knew she would have come on a good bit for Punchestown and this was the plan. She is as tough as old boots. "She will stay three miles next year. I would imagine we will go to Punchestown." Ricci was magnanimous in defeat, saying: "It was a great race. Apple's Jade is a multi-winning Grade One winner. "I think she's a very, very good mare and she wouldn't be out of place in the Champion Hurdle. "I don't think there are any excuses.” Mullins added: "They are running well but have been unlucky. "Both travelled good into the race and they had their chance. Both ran up to their form. I thought they each ran their race." 4.10 OLBG Mares' Hurdle (Grade 1) result 1 Apple's Jade 7-2 2 Vroum Vroum Mag 11-4 3 Limini 6-4F — RTÉ Racing (@RTEracing) March 14, 2017 Listen to all the action from Cheltenham live on RTÉ Radio from 1pm on Radio 1 Extra and LW, and on the Ray D'Arcy Show from 3pm.    View Comments More on sport Racing cheltenham Cheltenham Festival Read Next Labaik reigns Supreme in Cheltenham opener 14 Mar Most Read 1Recap: Cheltenham Festival - Day Three17:53 2Schmidt: Murray loss leaves 'hole' in Ireland team20:43 3Cheltenham Day Three: Top tips and betting advice12:31 4Recap: Manchester United v FC Rostov22:12 5Eddie Jones' predictions of no interest to Joe Schmidt20:42 Racing.

Just in past few months, Chinese brand Oppo grabbed the number three position pushing Huawei to fourth, while first and second position remains to Apple (USA) and Samsung (South Korea). Huawei has 170,000 strong workforce, 45 percent of which are in design and development division. But now, everybody in China’s Huawei Technologies Company Limited are nervous. They are afraid as the company are bracing for possible job cuts. Huawei, which rose rapidly to become the world’s third largest Smartphone sellers is aiming to narrow the gap with leaders Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics. But the company faces challenges after losing its top spot in China, the world’s biggest market, to new contender Oppo in 2016. Huawei Group founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei urged all employees to work hard, saying the company would otherwise ‘fall apart’. Now possibly the biggest blow to the existing market leaders of Smartphone are about to come from a Japanese brand. According information obtained by Weekly Blitz, the Japanese company has been in the business of electronic items for decades, and its brand is well known to almost everyone in the world. For past several months, the company is silently finalizing plans of launching its Smartphones by 2018. Products would be manufactured either in China or India, or both, while there are strong possibilities that the Smartphones may be simultaneously manufactured in China, India, Vietnam, Bangladesh, and an African country to ensure cheaper price and better compatibility. Sources said, the Japanese company is willing to compete in qualities with Apple and Samsung, while they are working  hard in offering the Smartphone to the customers at a ‘very reasonable and competitive price’. Once the company launches its newest item, it is expecting of grabbing a huge market share as their brand already is well known to billions of people in the world.

We may not have long to wait to find out  Share  Comments ByJeff Parsons 16:45, 14 MAR 2017 Technology iPad Mini (Photo: Getty)  Share  Comments Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email The iPad mini has been a firm favourite among tablet users for a few years now. The bag-friendly little tablet was last given an upgrade in September 2015. And experts are speculating on whether or not it will be brought into the 'iPad Pro' fold in 2017. As such, we could see the unveiling of an "iPad Pro mini" this year rather than the iPad mini 5. That could mean it comes with its own, smaller, version of the Apple Pencil stylus. Here's everything we know (or think we know) about the next mini iPad. Keep checking back as we'll update this page when we know more. Latest news Ipad Mini Read More Apple to launch THREE new iPads this year including new bezel-free model Supply chain sources seem to be suggesting we could see the next iPad mini unveiled in a matter of days. Apple doesn't publicise its events until the last second, but sources on its supply chain have been talking to Apple-focused site MacRumours . "Apple is expected to announce new products later this month, most likely between Monday, March 20 and Friday, March 24, according to reputable supply chain analysts we spoke to who wish to remain anonymous," the site reported. Unfortunately, the sources stopped short of revealing exactly which products are to be revealed. Release date (Photo: Getty) Read More Nintendo Switch to get VR headset? Leaked patent suggests face-hugging accessory is in development Apple almost certainly has a new version of the iPad mini ready to roll - even if production hasn't yet ramped up. According to Taiwan-based DigiTimes, which cites those ever-reliable unnamed "supply chain workers”, Apple started production in December 2016 for an early 2017 launch. Traditionally, Apple holds its first event of the year in March. Last year, Apple used an event in March to reveal the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. It holds true that the company may take the same approach in 2017 and that would square nicely with the latest rumours mentioned above. However, Apple usually launches its products swiftly after revealing them. Conceivably, the next iPad Mini could be available to buy by the middle of April. Price (Photo: Getty) Apple is expected to introduce a new iPad Mini at the current pricing and shift the iPad Mini 4 down the chain. That would mean it would launch at £379 for the 32GB model and £469 for the 128GB version. Of course, when Apple does put up its prices, it does so nice and quiet-like. So we can’t guarantee the same pricing, but it’s a good base estimate. You can also expect to add an extra £100 on top if you want to have 3G compatability. Design (Photo: Getty) According to Neurogadget , the new iPad mini will only be 5mm thick, meaning Apple will have shaved 1.1mm off the iPad mini 4. "This news has pleased some fans, but others are worried that a thinner body is not really the best idea, because the battery must be reduced in order to fit inside the carcass," writes the site. Meanwhile, other reports have suggested that Apple will trim the bezel around the edges of the tablet and introduce and OLED display for the first time. Broadly speaking, that means better colours because each pixel provides its own illumination rather than needing a backlight. What will be really interesting to see is whether Apple decides to echo the iPhone 7 and drop the headphone jack for the next iPad. There’s been no reports of it so far but we’ll update this piece if and when that changes. Specs Will Apple unveil a new iPad Air and iPad mini? Apple’s newest iPads will undoubtedly be the most powerful yet. Several Apple specialist sites are suggesting the iPad mini 5 will come with an upgraded A9 processor. That means it'll run faster and there will be better graphics for gaming. However, the camera is heavily rumoured to stay the same. That means, there's likely to be an 8MP camera on the back and a 1.2MP camera on the front. But then again, if you're using a tablet to take pictures you've got bigger problems. According to Cult of Mac, there's a chance of a smaller battery being fitted to the iPad mini 5. This isn't necessarily a bad thing as battery tech has improved to a point where a smaller battery is still as efficient as last year's larger ones.

A larger curved OLED display with so-called “function area” and embedded Home button implementation have been the focus of most, but a new concept today instead focuses on how iOS might improve in the process. More specifically, an augmented reality version of Siri… The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac The concept below from Gabor Balogh imagines a redesigned Siri that integrates AR features, something Apple is also reportedly developing, directly into the home screen experience. When a user raises the device, the background of the home screen becomes a live view into the real world behind, with Siri not only interacting with your device but also real-world objects that it sees in the camera/live view: The real world is not hidden by the device anymore. If raised, the environment is visible in the background of the home screen in a semi-transparent way, indicating that you can unveil it by pressing the digital Home button. Same way as now, but Siri would be present in augmented reality… Siri would now not only listen you, but would see the world. It would recognize objects, know where you are, what your activity is and what you probably need in that moment. The idea is that Siri would be an integrated part of the augmented reality experience for iPhone 8, acting as your assistant and allowing voice commands throughout the experience. In another example, the live view provides walking directions with assistance from Siri: In the process, the concept imagines a redesign for the Home button, which based on reports Apple is planning on embedding directly into the upcoming iPhone’s display. The concept builds off several recent reports that Apple is working on augmented reality features, possibly to be introduced in time for the next-generation iPhones this fall. A few reports have suggested Apple will introduce AR features through a new 3D depth-sensing camera, allowing for applications such as games and facial recognition, while others noted that Apple has teams of employees working on augmented reality features. While leaks for features planned for iOS 11 are light at this point, another recent concept video showed how Apple could implement rumored dark mode features as well as group FaceTime, iPhone split screen, and more.

Zdziarski announced today he accepted a position with Apple’s Security Engineering and Architecture team, but it’s unclear when he might be starting work at Apple. Zdziarski, who at times could be critical of Apple’s security efforts, says he’s joined the iPhone maker because he’s so passionate about protecting the security and privacy of others. “Privacy is sacred. Our digital lives can reveal so much about us—our interests, our deepest thoughts and even who we love. I am thrilled to be working with such an exceptional group of people who share a passion to protect that,” he wrote. Zdziarski used to regularly provide insightful commentary on a range of topics dealing with iCloud issues and data syncing policies. He’s never shied away from slamming Apple over iOS security flaws and vulnerabilities or providing technical explanations related to such topics as the diagnostic capabilities of iOS, user privacy and more. Known as “NerveGas” within the jailbreaking community, Zdziarski used to be part of the iPhone Dev Team and Chronic Dev Team. His Twitter account appears to have been disabled, likely due to his employment at Apple. We fully expect him to stop tweeting and commenting on Apple’s security efforts now that he’s officially part of the company’s Security Engineering and Architecture team.

Glad to see all his hard work paying off over the years with a job like this. I am ha ha ha…basically @apple admitted that their own engineers are shit at security and also the fact that they will never be able to stop jailbreaking of iOS. suck it up Tim Cook. Sebastien I think you are missing the point. Apple didn’t admit anything by hiring JZ. If anything, they admitted that they are so committed to security and privacy that they are willing to hire the best people in this area of expertise. This is a big win for Apple security-wise. Apple just can’t rely on its existing pool of employees. They have to look outside too. That’s how you grow. Thats how you make your teams stronger. Agneev Mukherjee Make that Jay-Z! I am Wow, really? I mean there are so many security researchers out there. Why hire someone who used to crack iOS? From history, we know VERY WELL, Apple doesn’t like people who highlight ANY problem with their products. Remember the lost iphone 4 issue? Steve Jobs famously said “i won’t let it slide” even after they had recovered the device. This guy has been openly critical of Apple. So to see Apple hire him is ofcourse admission that they can’t keep iOS secure without expertise of people they once considered “bad guys”. I will make sure you understand that statement. Apple doesn’t explicitly ever say that jailbreakers are bad guys but why do they void hardware warranty of iPhone if iOS is jailbroken? I mean you don’t need to be an expert to understand that NO software, for example, can stop the home button working or speaker from working and so on. But its clear, you do something they don’t like, they basically show you two fingers. If you really think it is not a failure on Apple’s part, why don’t they disclose their internal discussions about jailbreak community when the very same guy had contributed to jailbreak. Its only recently that they started recognising the work of jailbreakers as we see in the release notes of iOS fixes. That change seems to have happened after Cook came to power. But the arrogance that Jobs had instilled is not completely gone just yet. The real winner is us, the customers. While I personally prefer jailbroken iPhone, I do value security and privacy for the majority of the users. I can tell you this much though. The expression on the final decision maker of this recruitment would have been a grunt and not a smile. -P3rfact Agneev Mukherjee Todesco next! Nirvana uh….no not anytime soon Agneev Mukherjee What the heck are you doing, meddling with tech, shouldn’t you be meditating or something? Andrieux Querido I miss Jailbreak 🙁 Jeff Laing It will be interesting to see what happens to Little Flocker. If *that* becomes part of the OS, the game changes significantly for those who really want to keep their computers secure from prying eyes. If it remains a separate product, one would imagine there would be all sorts of conflicts-of-interest to be cleared. And if it disappears completely, I’ll be really annoyed.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines Daily Deals: $1,550 MacBook Pro w/ Touch Bar, $16 Speck iPhone case, and more Alexa comes to the iPhone Apple’s free app of the week: Bean’s Quest Next-generation Apple TV running tvOS 11 spotted in usage logs Seventh betas of iOS 10.3 and macOS Sierra 10.12.4 now available   The latest jailbreak news BiggieSmallcc makes the album artwork more more prominent in Control Center This tweak removes the background mask effect from Spotlight search results BorderIcon+ adds colorized borders to various parts of your Home screen NoSpot10 removes Spotlight search from your iPhone PulseHUD displays a pulse animation when changing your iPhone volume iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2017.

Samsung has secretly been showing off a radical 'Foldable Valley' phone and could unveil it later this year in a bid to deflect attention from Apple's iPhone 8. Apple is expected to unveil its 'iPhone Edition' in September - with the latest rumours saying Samsung could show off folding design a few days earlier at the IFA show in Berlin.  Scroll down for video  Samsung is expected to release a new handset that folds in two like a notebook as early as January next year. A screenshot from a conceptual video showing what the device may look like is pictured HOW WILL IT WORK?  Last year Samsung was awarded a patent for a radical design that allows a phones to fold in two. It could lead to a handset that can easily transform into a tablet - simply by unfolding it.    The document shows a narrow Samsung device with a screen that bends and folds like an old-school flip phone handset, with a large hinge.    Samsung’s unnamed smartphone was apparently showcased to a limited number of partners at MWC 2017, as the South Korean giant is trying to prevent leaks, according to BGR.  Korean site ETNews says the firm will begin widespread testing of prototyes later this year, and although Samsung could announce it as an Apple spoiler, the handset will not go on sale until next year. Earlier rumours claimed both Samsung and LG are planning to launch bendable phones later this year. Samsung's device, codenamed  'Foldable Valley' will turn into a 7inch tablet when unfolded, and is expected to launch in august, the report claims.  It also says LG will unveil a similar product, and believes it can sell 100,000 foldable devices in the fourth quarter.  Last year Samsung was awarded a patent for a radical design that allows a phones to fold in two. It could lead to a handset that can easily transform into a tablet - simply by unfolding it.    RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next World's first fluorescent frog that glows bright green is...

Share this article Share 283 shares The document shows a narrow Samsung device with a screen that bends and folds like an old-school flip phone handset, with a large hinge.  The device is described as something that can be 'folded or unfolded semi automatically.'  The patent also referred to both a 'flexible' and 'secondary' display, which is supposed to activate when you fold the device, according to International Business Times. According to previous claims from Korean news site ETNews, the product is known internally as a 'smartlet' and has a 7inch screen when unfolded, which becomes a 5inch device when folded. Samsung will apparently start mass producing the 'smartlet' this year for a 2017 release, and has spent three years developing the technology. Dubbed 'Foldable Valley', the device is expected to take advantage of bendy plastic screens being developed by Samsung's display division. The patent drawings reveal a folding design similar to a concept Samsung is known to be developing. In a call with investors in January, director of Samsung's Display division Lee Chang-hoon said 'Development of Foldable OLED is taking place according to our plan...We are planning on mass-production and release this product by discussing with out partners.'  The design can be folded and placed on a table, depending on how much of the screen is needed. The South Korean tech giant previously said it will launch foldable devices in 2016 and trusted rumour blog SamMobile reported earlier this year that anonymous sources claim the device is already being tested in China. The source, who claims to have in-depth knowledge of the device, said it is being developed under the codename Project Valley.  And they added that two versions of the phone are being tested - one with a Snapdragon 620 processor and another with a Snapdragon 820. When folded, the handset looks almost like a wallet. Elsewhere, the device is rumoured to have 3GB of RAM, a microSD card slot and a non-removable battery. Samsung told MailOnline it doesn't comment on rumour or speculation.   Samsung has been teasing bendable screens for years and at CES in 2013 revealed a flexible Oled screen called Youm. The firm said at the time it could make high-resolution screens on extremely thin plastic, instead of glass, so it could be bent without shattering. The patents have led to rumours that manufacturers could be taking inspiration from 'clamshell' design phones that were popular in the 1990s. Pictured is the Motorola StarTAC handset, which was first released in 1996 However, a notebook style phone would need to bend at a very sharp angle and would need to withstand considerable wear and tear, leading some commentators to suggest the rumour should be taken with a pinch of salt. LG is similarly developing incredibly bendy screens. In 2014, it showed off a working 18-inch Ultra HD screen that uses a special film instead of plastic as backing. Samsung is not the only firm working on highly flexible screens. In 2014, LG showed off a working 18-inch Ultra HD screen (pictured) that uses a special film instead of plastic as backing to allow screen to be rolled into a tight tube for transport. At the time, it said it could make its debut in 2017 This allowed the screen to be rolled into a tight tube for transport.  At the time, the company said it could make its debut in 2017. In May, it debuted a a concept ultra thin 'wallpaper TV' less than 1mm thick, and at four lbs (1.9kg) it is so light it can be attached to the wall using just magnets. At IFA, a demonstration showed an LG employee pulling the screen away from the wall and bending it, to prove it carries on working.

LIKE   TWEET   SHARE   PIN   SHARE   POST MAIL MORE Posted March 14, 2017 at 1:19pm by iClarified · 2951 views · Translate While many are predicting that Apple will hold a special event in late March to unveil new iPads, a new DigiTimes report suggests the company will hold off until April to hold an inaugural event at its new headquarters. Apple Park is home to the Steve Jobs theater. The 1,000-seat auditorium features a 20-foot-tall glass cylinder entrance, 165 feet in diameter, supporting a metallic carbon-fiber roof. It's situated atop a hill — one of the highest points within Apple Park — overlooking meadows and the main building. DigiTimes also walks back a prediction that the new 10.5-inch iPad Pro won't enter production until May-June. Apple has moved ahead the production for its planned new 10.5-inch iPad to March instead of an earlier timetable set for May-June and is expected to unveil the new iPad at a product event to be held in early April to mark the inauguration of Apple's new headquarters in California, according to Taiwan-based supply chain makers. Sales of the 10.5-inch iPad are estimated to reach one million units in March, and 1.2 million units/month from Q2. Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

By Gregg Keizer Senior Reporter, Computerworld | Mar 14, 2017 7:44 AM PT Credit: FirmBee More like this Apple’s March iPad Pro event – What to expect Mac ends sales slump with record revenue of $7.2B Apple's iPhone sets sales record, up 131% Video Mingis on Tech: Self-driving cars, wireless charging -- and Wi-Fi lightbulbs? Apple would be smart to make good on speculation about new iPad screen sizes, a pair of analysts said today. "The tablet has evolved from a general-purpose device to more of a specialized device," argued Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research, when asked about long-circulating rumors of a coming expansion to the iPad line. "Certain sizes are better optimized for more specialized applications." Talk of additional iPads -- notably one with a 10.5-in. screen -- has circulated for months, kick started by Ming-Chi Kuo, a financial analyst with KGI Securities. More recently, however, rumors focused on a spring launch, perhaps this month, perhaps in May or June. Apple last changed the portfolio's pricing in September 2016, but except for the 9.7-in. iPad Pro introduced a year ago, the hardware has remained static since the fall of 2015. And during that stretch iPad unit sales continued to contract -- the slump has now lasted three years -- and tablet revenue continued to shrink in raw numbers and percentage of Apple's total. Apple sold 13.1 million iPads in the December 2016 quarter, down 19% from the same period the year prior. Meanwhile, iPad revenue of $5.5 billion was 22% lower than in the December quarter of 2015. CEO Tim Cook has not changed how he has described the iPad to Wall Street -- in January, Cook again said he was "very bullish" on the tablet -- nor laid out a strategy to return the line to growth. O'Donnell saw portfolio expansion as a simultaneous recognition of market reality and a way to increase sales. "To support more of these specialized usages means a wider variety of screen sizes," O'Donnell said. "That, for me, would be logical. And it would let Apple expand the number of price points as well." The original iPad Pro -- the 12.9-in. device unveiled in September 2015 -- was a good example of specialization, O'Donnell contended. "It did well by bringing up the ASP [average selling price], but it's not a mainstream product," he said. Ezra Gottheil, an analyst with Technology Business Research, echoed O'Donnell on the usefulness of more screen sizes. "It makes sense to give customers a wider range of choices," he said. Expanded options would be in keeping with the tablet market's maturation, Gottheil added. "That's part of the landscape for products we buy for practical and entertainment purposes both," he said. Even so, it's unlikely that Apple can reverse the iPad's course simply by multiplying screen sizes. "There's nothing in the universe that will make a zillion people buy [a tablet]," Gottheil said. Long replacement cycles -- getting longer by the year -- and for many original purchasers, no intention of ever buying another tablet, doom tablets to, at best, growth rates miniscule in comparison to those of five or six years ago. Last month, researcher IDC portrayed the overall tablet market as in a "spiraling decline," and said Apple's flagship was starting to "show signs of age." IDC forecast that tablet sales declines would continue through 2021. How will Apple tackle its iPad problem? Gottheil assumed it will hold to its core strategy of producing integrated hardware and software at a premium price. "That's a good, solid business," he pointed out with a nod to the $19 billion in revenue during 2016. "But is it ever going to explode again? No." In January, Cook used a company-standard line when answering a question about the iPad. "If I zoom out of the 90-day clock and look at it, we've got some exciting things coming on iPad," Cook pledged. To Apple's executives, there's always something around the corner, even if that corner is shrouded in mystery or further away than expected. O'Donnell was more matter-of-fact. "People have not felt the need to upgrade their iPads. But [more screen sizes] may stem the bleeding," he suggested.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Wed, Mar 15, 2017 - Page 11　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Largan to pay workers NT$4.095bn in bonuses SHARP RIVALRY?A newspaper reported that a unit of Japan’s Sharp Corp is planning to expand production to supply camera lenses to Apple Inc for new iPhones Staff writer, with CNA Largan Precision Co (大立光), a smartphone camera lens supplier to Apple Inc, is to award its employees a large annual bonus on the back of the company’s strong bottom line. A board meeting approved a proposal to issue a total of NT$4.095 billion (US$132.2 million) in annual bonuses to 4,600 employees, meaning each would receive almost NT$900,000 on average. The decision makes Largan one of the most generous employers in the nation after it posted earnings per share (EPS) of NT$169.40 for last year, the highest of any listed company in Taiwan. Last month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (台積電), the world’s largest contract chipmaker, announced it would issue an average of NT$1.07 million in bonuses after posting the company’s highest-ever annual net profit of NT$334.25 billion and record-high sales of NT$947.94 billion for last year. Largan’s average employee bonus was less than the NT$950,000 last year, as its EPS for last year was less than the NT$180.08 in 2015, but the bonus remains among the highest nationwide at a time when Taiwan is experiencing long-term wage stagnation. Last year, Largan’s net income fell about 6 percent from a year earlier to NT$22.72 billion on slower global demand. The company is scheduled to issue employee bonuses in September. Due to the lower earnings for last year, Largan said compensation paid to its directors and supervisors would fall from NT$3.27 billion last year to NT$3.07 billion this year. Largan has benefited from its lead over competitors in high-end camera lens production, in particular dual camera lenses. As more international smartphone brands, including Apple and Chinese vendors, adopt dual camera lenses in their devices, the market widely expects Largan’s profits to improve this year. A US-based brokerage raised its target price on Largan shares from NT$5,000 to NT$5,700, the highest among foreign brokerages tracking the stock. On Monday, Largan closed up 3.2 percent at NT$4,650 to remain the most expensive stock on the local market. However, local media cited the Nikkei Shimbun as reporting yesterday that Largan is likely to be challenged by Japan’s Sharp Corp — in which Hon Hai Precision Industry Co (鴻海精密) owns a 66 percent stake — as the Japanese firm’s subsidiary Kantatsu Co is planning to expand smartphone camera lens production capacity in China. The report said that Kantatsu’s new production lines, which are to be based in Jiangsu Province, are scheduled to start operations next year with the aim of supplying smartphone camera lenses to Apple for new iPhones. Sharp has raised its stake in Kantatsu from 18 percent to 44 percent since mid-January. This story has been viewed 2103 times. Comments will be moderated.

This decision marks the conclusion of what I feel has been a matter of conscience for me over time. Privacy is sacred; our digital lives can reveal so much about us – our interests, our deepest thoughts, and even who we love. I am thrilled to be working with such an exceptional group of people who share a passion to protect that. You may recognize Zdziarski’s name from many iOS security-related stories over the years. Prior to the high-profile FBI security story, Zdziarski made headlines with claims that Apple had a backdoor into iOS, offering commentary and perspective with prominent security stories, and discovering security flaws in popular apps. Last summer when it was discovered that Apple left the iOS 10 kernel unencrytped, Zdziarski provided one possible theory for the decision. Zdziarski has been on our radar as far back as 2009 when his NES emulator made it through app review and onto the App Store. Now with Zdziarski officially at Apple, I would expect such antics (and helpful commentary) to disappear. His security expertise, however, should prove an asset for the company.

We're here to help. Tablets by Xiomara Blanco March 14, 2017 8:57 AM PDT @zeeohmara Tablet Buying Guide: What to look for when buying a tablet CNET's Xiomara Blanco, tells you what features and technologies matter most, and which don't. by Xiomara Blanco 2:18 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF There's a lot more to tablets than just the iPad. If you're looking to replace a PC with something simpler and more portable, or just want a grab-and-go device for email and movies, we've got answers to all your tablet questions. But if you just want a fast and easy answer, these are a few of our current top choices. The Apple iPad Pro 9.7 is our top choice. Sarah Tew/CNET Apple iPad Pro Apple's iconic iPad is the most popular tablet, and for good reason: it has stellar performance, the largest app store and a fantastic ecosystem that supports access to an incredible number of tools, games and music and video apps. The processor inside of the iPad Pro 9.7, our top choice, is one of the fastest mobile chips available. It's the best iPad model to get, though it also comes in a larger 12-inch model. If you want to save some cash, the older iPad Air 2 is still a worthy choice, too. The Google Pixel C is the best Android tablet. Josh Miller/CNET Google Pixel C If you prefer Android, the Google Pixel C is for you. It's a speedy 8.9-incher with top-notch graphics performance. Google's growing ecosystem is confidently catching up to Apple's, though it still lacks in tablet-optimized apps. It also has a solid magnetic keyboard accessory (sold separately) that connects so strongly, you can even hold it upside down and it won't detach. Microsoft unsurprisingly makes the best Windows 10 tablet. Sarah Tew/CNET Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Need something that's a bit more powerful? The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 is essentially a laptop inside of a tablet's body. It comes with a stylus, has the latest Intel processors, and its stylish, magnetic, removable keyboard cover-case (sold separately, sadly) protects it without adding too much bulk. Note that this model is from late 2015, so a new version is expected sometime in 2017. The best budget tablet is the Amazon Fire. James Martin/CNET Amazon Fire Looking for a great deal? You can pick up the 7-inch Amazon Fire for only $50 (£50; Amazon is not available in Australia, pricing converts to AU$65). It features easy access to Amazon's huge media library, but it doesn't offer much more that that. If you feel like an small upgrade, the Amazon Fire HD 8 starts at $120 (£90, converts to AU$157), and features a sharper, larger screen and faster performance. Check out the rest of our top tablets for more options. Before you start shopping though, here are our answers to the most common questions about tablets. Thinking about what you want to use a tablet for will help you buy one. Josh Miller/CNET 1. What's the best tablet? Ultimately, the best tablet is the one that fulfills your needs and fits your budget. To figure that out, you need to ask yourself what you plan on using it for. Are you looking to replace your PC, or do you simply want a device to watch movies on when traveling? Do you require constant internet access? What about HDMI for connecting it to your TV? Need a detachable keyboard, too? The specific needs you have for a tablet will help you determine which one's best for you. Expandable storage is an easy way to load all of your media to your tablet. Josh Miller/CNET One of the most important factors to everyone should consider is storage capacity. Whether it's movies, music, games or books, content is an integral part of the tablet experience. Having space to store that content is essential. Some tablets include storage expansion options like microSD cards, which can allow you to increase your storage capacity at a fraction of the cost of upgrading to a model with larger capacity, if one's available. Just because you can buy a cheap tablet doesn't mean that you should. James Martin/CNET 2. Why not just buy the cheapest one? Because you deserve better. Just kidding, kind of. As with cars, computers and everything else in life, you get what you pay for. The best tablet experience will run you at least $600-$800 (£550-£750, AU$850-AU$1,500) for just the entry-level tablet, or almost double that if you include a keyboard or more internal storage. Understandably, not everyone can afford (or wants to pay for) a top-of-the-line tablet. And why pay that much anyway, when you can get a perfectly fine basic tablet for $50? Look beyond the price; think about everything you're getting in terms of hardware and software. Nice features like a built-in stand and HD screen inflate a tablet's price. Josh Miller/CNET There's usually a good reason behind the price of each tablet. Amazon can offer its affordable Fire tablet because it has a bare-bones design, skimps on any extra features and has a very limited app store. And despite the fact that the iPad Pro has no native HDMI or storage expansion support, Apple can justify its lofty starting price thanks to its premium design, fast performance, incredible app support, refined interface and robust ecosystem. Depending on what you're looking to use your tablet for, you can splurge on a high-end stunner, choose a midrange model, or even settle for an affordable basic buy. Whether it's for work or casual use, there are plenty of configurations available to appease everyone. Typically, the nicer the screen, the higher the price. Josh Miller/CNET 3. What's the best brand? Choose your tablet manufacturer wisely. Computers aren't perfect, and tablets in particular can be even less perfect. If there are problems, you'll want to make sure you've chosen a vendor that will address said issues with frequent and effective patches. Also, if you'd rather avoid frustration, you might want to choose a manufacturer whose tablets aren't known for requiring frequent and effective patches. If you're planning to buy an Android tablet, choose a vendor that has a reputation for updating to the latest version of Android in a timely manner. Google tablets get the fastest updates, but Asus is usually quick on its feet; some other vendors, not so much. Small or large? Your choice. Sarah Tew/CNET 4. What size should I get? Do you need a tablet for your commute or just playing games on the couch? These questions can help determine what screen size will work better for you. 7 to 9 inches (small) Tablets with screen sizes measuring 6 to 8 inches diagonally across the screen are usually cheaper and typically underpowered compared with larger tablets. However, small tablets are much more portable, usually fit more easily into purses and small bags, and make much better e-reader alternatives. Unfortunately their popularity and availability have decreased thanks to the introduction of phablets, which can sometimes have screens as big as 7 inches. 8.9 inches and above (large) This is the category most tablets fall into. Large tablets for the most part have faster processors, and because of their larger screens, they provide a better viewing experience that isn't quite matched on smaller tablets. Games feel more interactive; movies and TV shows more immersive. Though I'd much rather read a book on a 7-inch tablet, for movies and games, a bigger screen is always better. Want cutting-edge screen quality? Check out the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3, the first HDR-ready tablet. Josh Miller/CNET Then there's the issue of screen quality. A tablet's screen is arguably its most important quality. The screen's resolution and panel type determine its viewing angles, sharpness, brightness, vibrancy and color accuracy. The highest-resolution of any tablet screen is 2,560x1,600 pixels and the higher the resolution, the sharper the images look on the screen. When choosing a tablet, make sure the panel is an in-plane switching (IPS) or plane-line switching (PLS) screen. Anything less and the difference in quality will be readily apparent. If screen quality is your priority, take a look at the tablets with the best screens. Many tablets run Google's Android operating system. Josh Miller/CNET 5. Which one's better: iOS, Android or Windows 10? Again, depending on your needs, one operating system might work better for you than others. Apple iOS Since its inception in the first iPhone, iOS has been the software powering Apple mobile devices. iOS thrives thanks to a deep media ecosystem that allows sharing across devices, a gargantuan app catalog, and its very simple, user-friendly interface. Apple iPads are the only tablets that run iOS and, if you already have an iPhone, you'll feel right at home with an iPad. Google Android While iOS tends to get first dibs on the latest apps, Android has definitely made strides of late with its media ecosystem. Movies, TV shows, magazines and games, in particular, have seen vast improvements in both quantity and quality of selections. Also, it's a more customizable OS than any other. A Windows 10 tablet can do anything a Windows 10 laptop can do. Josh Miller/CNET Microsoft Windows 10 Microsoft's latest operating system works great on traditional laptops and desktops, but also on tablets and hybrids. The latest Windows OS combines the best parts of old and new Windows features into a cohesive package, and its functionality focuses largely around taking advantage of a touchscreen. Unfortunately, the app store is severely lacking in variety and number of apps available in comparison to both iOS and Android, but because it's Windows, you can get software from just about anywhere. Amazon Fire OS Running only on Amazon Fire tablets, Fire OS runs on top on an Android base. Its custom interface sorts your content by category, and it has the deepest support for e-books of any tablet. Amazon Prime members benefit from free streaming or downloading of its vast video catalog, as well as access to its lending library of books. Don't expect nearly as many apps as Android and iOS have at their disposal, however. The Amazon App Store is highly curated and selection is limited, so you most likely won't find the latest hot games. The Fire HDX 8.9 tablet also has access to near-instant customer service via video chat, thanks to Amazon's Mayday feature, as well as item recognition software Firefly. Not all stylus are created equal -- or offered for free. Josh Miller/CNET 6. Do I need a stylus? All tablets are touchscreens and assume that you'll use your finger as your stylus. But if you want a one for drawing, writing, etc., there are a few models that are designed to work with one. Each is a little different, with varying types of stylus hardware and apps available. The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 and the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 are two of the best models that include one with purchase. The Apple iPad Pro offers the impressive Pencil stylus, but it's sold separately. 7. Where can I find the latest tablet reviews? What if I have more questions?

"The tablet has evolved from a general-purpose device to more of a specialized device," argued Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research, when asked about long-circulating rumors of a coming expansion to the iPad line. "Certain sizes are better optimized for more specialized applications." Talk of additional iPads -- notably one with a 10.5-in. screen -- has circulated for months, kick started by Ming-Chi Kuo, a financial analyst with KGI Securities. More recently, however, rumors focused on a spring launch, perhaps this month, perhaps in May or June. Apple last changed the portfolio's pricing in September 2016, but except for the 9.7-in. iPad Pro introduced a year ago, the hardware has remained static since the fall of 2015. And during that stretch iPad unit sales continued to contract -- the slump has now lasted three years -- and tablet revenue continued to shrink in raw numbers and percentage of Apple's total. Apple sold 13.1 million iPads in the December 2016 quarter, down 19% from the same period the year prior. Meanwhile, iPad revenue of $5.5 billion was 22% lower than in the December quarter of 2015. CEO Tim Cook has not changed how he has described the iPad to Wall Street -- in January, Cook again said he was "very bullish" on the tablet -- nor laid out a strategy to return the line to growth. O'Donnell saw portfolio expansion as a simultaneous recognition of market reality and a way to increase sales. "To support more of these specialized usages means a wider variety of screen sizes," O'Donnell said. "That, for me, would be logical. And it would let Apple expand the number of price points as well." The original iPad Pro -- the 12.9-in. device unveiled in September 2015 -- was a good example of specialization, O'Donnell contended. "It did well by bringing up the ASP [average selling price], but it's not a mainstream product," he said. Ezra Gottheil, an analyst with Technology Business Research, echoed O'Donnell on the usefulness of more screen sizes. "It makes sense to give customers a wider range of choices," he said. Expanded options would be in keeping with the tablet market's maturation, Gottheil added. "That's part of the landscape for products we buy for practical and entertainment purposes both," he said. Even so, it's unlikely that Apple can reverse the iPad's course simply by multiplying screen sizes. "There's nothing in the universe that will make a zillion people buy [a tablet]," Gottheil said. Long replacement cycles -- getting longer by the year -- and for many original purchasers, no intention of ever buying another tablet, doom tablets to, at best, growth rates miniscule in comparison to those of five or six years ago. Last month, researcher IDC portrayed the overall tablet market as in a "spiraling decline," and said Apple's flagship was starting to "show signs of age." IDC forecast that tablet sales declines would continue through 2021. How will Apple tackle its iPad problem? Gottheil assumed it will hold to its core strategy of producing integrated hardware and software at a premium price. "That's a good, solid business," he pointed out with a nod to the $19 billion in revenue during 2016. "But is it ever going to explode again? No." In January, Cook used a company-standard line when answering a question about the iPad. "If I zoom out of the 90-day clock and look at it, we've got some exciting things coming on iPad," Cook pledged. To Apple's executives, there's always something around the corner, even if that corner is shrouded in mystery or further away than expected. O'Donnell was more matter-of-fact. "People have not felt the need to upgrade their iPads. But [more screen sizes] may stem the bleeding," he suggested.

The highly secretive company doesn't publicise its events until the last second, but sources on its supply chain have been talking to Apple-focused site MacRumours . "Apple is expected to announce new products later this month, most likely between Monday, March 20 and Friday, March 24, according to reputable supply chain analysts we spoke to who wish to remain anonymous," the site reported. Unfortunately, the sources stopped short of revealing exactly which products are to be revealed. Previous rumours suggest a refreshed iPad Pro lineup and possibly a new iPhone SE are in the pipeline. Read More iPhone 8's most highly-anticipated feature has been DUMPED by Apple, report claims The iPhone SE (Photo: Getty) As yet, Apple hasn't sent out any official media invites or commented on the rumours. Typically the company lets industry reporters know about an event 11 or 12 days beforehand. For the last couple of years, Apple has planned events twice a year for launching products, once in March and another in September/October. It also has the Worldwide Developer's Conference in the summer, but this rarely involves new hardware. In 2015, the "Apple Special Event" took place in Cupertino on March 9th, while in 2016 it was hosted in Apple's own theatre "Town Hall" on March 21st. What will Apple announce?

The first model of the iPad Pro was released in September 2015 for prices ranging from £549.00 to an eye-watering £1,029.00. According to the rumours, Apple will be unfolding a new red colour option for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Alongside red iPhones and new iPad models, Apple may launch a new iPhone SE with upgraded storage. The new iPhone SE would feature a 128GB storage option, joining the existing 16GB and 64GB models on the Apple Store. Where will the event take place?

Instead, it's more likely to occur somewhere in central San Francisco. Fear not though, Apple usually livestreams its announcements. If any event were to happen, you'd be able to watch it live on any macOS or iOS device. poll loading Is Apple great? 0+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @MirrorTech Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On iOS iPad iPhone Apple Technology all Most Read Most Recent Emma WatsonEmma Watson photos HACKED: Personal pictures of Harry Potter actress have been stolen and shared on the dark web The Harry Potter actress has had personal photos from a swimsuit fitting stolen and posted on the dark web iPhone 8iPhone 8: Release date, price, rumours and news about Apple's 2017 iPhone Apple only just launched its iPhone 7 a few months ago, but many eyes are already turning to next year's model, the iPhone 8, which is expected to be Apple's biggest launch in years Electric carsJaguar tests its first ever all-electric car on London's roads Described as 'the future of motoring', Jaguar's I-PACE has been flexing its electrical muscles around the capital PornographyWomen watch porn on their mobile phones more often than men, study claims Nearly 80% of female traffic to porn sites comes from mobile devices SoldiersNaked photos of female US marines shared on secret Facebook group prompts NCIS investigation The US Marine Corps is investigating a secret Facebook group being used to circulate naked pictures of active female officers Google doodlesSt Patrick's Day 2017 Google doodle: Search giant celebrates St Paddy's with Skellig Michael animation Google's homepage has marked St Patrick's Day 2017 with an animated drawing of the World Heritage Site AppsApple Maps now shows satellite imagery of the 'Spaceship HQ' Apple Park campus Now you can see where your iPhone actually comes from Climate changeWhy beaches in Australia are glowing iridescent blue: The science behind the spectacular 'sea sparkle' phenomenon Beaches on the North West coast of Tasmania have been glowing blue, as if lit from below Electric carsJaguar tests its first ever all-electric car on London's roads Described as 'the future of motoring', Jaguar's I-PACE has been flexing its electrical muscles around the capital IVFFirst three-parent baby could be born in UK next year after licence approved for controversial procedure The aim of the treatment is to prevent women passing on defective genes in the mitochondria Most Read Most Recent Donald TrumpDonald Trump press secretary sensationally claims GCHQ may have colluded with Obama to spy during US election Sean Spicer claimed British spies were drafted in to avoid any “American fingerprints" on the alleged surveillance ParentingMum mortified after son's drawing of her 'big nunny' reveals an intimate secret to rest of family She showed it to her husband who "just laughed his head off" Star WarsStar Wars fan killed his wife after 'she smashed his toy collection' A STAR Wars fan was yesterday jailed for life after murdering his wife in an alleged revenge attack for smashing up his cherished toy collection.

A Storm is Coming: “App-pocalypse” To See Nearly 200,000 Apps Culled #AppleMusicWest4th Underway w/ Exclusive Live Performances + Interviews Apple Apple’s Next Event Pegged for Early April, New iPads Expected By Arron Hirst 14th Mar 17 3:13 pm Share Tweet The company will reportedly mark the grand opening of its multi-billion dollar Apple Park campus with a special media event, focused on introducing several new sizes to its flagship tablet line-up. Among those new additions is expected to be a 10.5-inch model, which -according to MacRumors – is likely to see its announcement within the next month, with DigiTimes citing that the new model may not hit shelves until either May or June. While the Taiwanese site claims that the firm is planning to host the event at Apple Park, however, this seems somewhat unlikely given that during its press release announcing the new campus back in February, Apple noted that its newly built auditorium – to be known as the Steve Jobs Theatre, may not be ready for primetime until “later this year.” As noted by Clover, this specific wording seems to suggest that the company may in fact not be planning to hold its Spring event at its new curved-glass HQ, instead perhaps holding back the special venue for its (usually, bigger) fall media pressers. If Apple’s event next month is happening, though, we should expect to see official invites go out to members of the press beginning next week … The introduction of this new 10.5-inch model is expected to be joined by a new version of the company’s 12.9-inch iPad, otherwise known as the iPad Pro. It is not yet clear if Apple’s rumoured event will give way to any other surprise announcements, although looking back at the company’s recent Spring-based media events suggests heavily that new iPads may not be all that Apple has in store … Continue Reading You may also like...

The media event will give us our first look at Apple’s rumored 10.5-inch iPad model, according to the latest rumors. Apple planning 10.5-inch iPad launch event for Apple Park campus in April Word of Apple’s plans comes via supply chain sources speaking with DigiTimes. They say Apple is targeting education and business markets with the 10.5-inch iPad, and will use the new model to celebrate the opening of the new corporate campus. Apple is expected to ship about a million units for the launch and ramp up to 1.2 million a month for the second quarter. An upgrade for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is expected, too, although supply chain sources aren’t sure yet when Apple is planning to increase production. Based on what they know now, that could come some time in May or June. Earlier reports said Apple would refresh the iPad lineup and introduce the 10.5-inch model in March. While Apple isn’t beholden to anyone for its product launch announcement schedules, March seemed premature to me with the new spaceship campus, officially named Apple Park, opening in April. Using the new campus, and its brand new 1,000 seat theater, will let Apple show off its latest iPad and just finished facilities at the same tie. The space was named the Steve Jobs theater in memory of the company co-founder. Apple Park opens in April and along with the Steve Jobs theater, includes space for 12,000 employees, an Apple Store, a public café, and an employee-only fitness center. Apple plans to transition workers into the new facility over the next six months. Apple hasn’t confirmed new iPads are coming, or when they’ll be announced. The timing, however, is perfect for an April announcement at Apple Park—especially if a totally new iPad model is being announced. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit More Email Print Tumblr Tags: Apple Park, iPad 10.5-inch, Steve Jobs Theater 3 Comments Add a comment Old UNIX Guy March 14, 2017 This is all speculation – not news. There may or may not be an event that may or may not introduce a new 10.5″ iPad (granted, probably will) that may or may not occur in either March or April and it may or may not be at Apple Park (and I’d bet against that one). March 14, 2017 at 3:09 EDT PM wab95 March 15, 2017 Jeff: I’m looking forward to this rollout. I use my 9.7″ iPad Pro as a main machine for much, and sometime most, of my daily productive work. On a recent trip, I left my iPad behind by accident, and marked by its absence just how frequently I use it. At the same time, my iPad Pro is only arriving at a year old. These new devices will need to bring something special in order for me to justify an upgrade, but I look forward to being persuaded. March 15, 2017 at 11:04 EDT AM Hammer March 15, 2017 If this is all they are “launching” at the event then I’m scheduling a huge yawn for that day.

Vision and Ecosystem Shine at Mobile World Congress 2017 March 14, 2017 by Uta Spinger March 14, 2017 by Uta Spinger 33 Outgrowing its original mobility roots, a larger-than-ever Mobile World Congress (MWC) puts on display the possibilities of a hyper-connected world for both digital businesses and consumers. The top trends of the year were digital transformation, the race towards a faster connected world with 5G and the promises and opportunities of the Internet of Things (IoT) across a variety of industries. As the premier showcase for the digital revolution, MWC attracted more than 108,000 attendees from all over the world.  Organizations from a variety of industries from automotive and financial services to smartphone manufacturers, content providers and  telecommunications operators showed what will be possible when connectivity speeds have jumped 100x or more to 5G by 2020. Faster, ubiquitous connectivity will not only be convenient for downloading an HD movie in a few  seconds – but will prove vital for driverless cars for example, when latency (aka, a “dropped call”) could be fatal. For Stephan Gatien, general manager of Telecommunications at SAP, the event was about demonstrating how we can work with our customers to help them transform and unlock value in that digital world that is moving fast to the cloud: “For SAP it is important to showcase our vision and what transformation means. We believe SAP can be the catalyst for new business models in the digital era, and with our showcases we want to highlight how we can help all industries transform and drive incremental business value.” Innovation will increasingly come from the SAP ecosystem Showcases of digital scenarios highlighted concrete projects that SAP is doing with customers and partners. “Innovation will increasingly come from our ecosystem,” says Gatien. “We need to enable our ecosystem to develop innovation on our platform, encourage new ideas within our customer and partner communities or in our startup program to enhance the SAP portfolio.” Partnership with Apple: First Apps Showcased at MWC To underscore the role of the SAP ecosystem, SAP and Apple showed a first set of iOS apps that have been jointly developed on SAP Cloud Platform. The approach is industry-oriented with apps for the professional services, retail, and utilities industries. Beyond these reference apps, the expectation is that the vast majority of future iOS apps on SAP Cloud Platform will be developed by SAP partners. With SAP Retail Clienteling for example, a sales person can gather customer information across channels, and suggest personalized products based on the customer profile. Detailed and real-time information about availability and pricing will help to improve customer satisfaction. The Project Companion App helps project managers to get an overview of the project’s key data and necessary actions. The Asset Manager App is a mobile solution for utilities or oil & gas companies managing work orders, notifications, condition monitoring, material consumption, time management and failure analysis to keep mission critical assets running while detecting problems before they occur. The partnership demonstrates how the combination of SAP and Apple can meaningfully impact the digital experience of all key stakeholders in a company (customers, employees, suppliers, partners). SAP offers SAP Cloud Platform software development kit (SDK) for iOS on which any iOS developer can build business applications with an Apple flavor. “To reinvent ourselves, we will grow in that platform space thanks to our ecosystem,” says Gatien. “The only way for us to make the platform strategy work is for people to adopt it and for that they need to see a value to build on it. The Apple partnership can be an important accelerator of this strategy.” It will give SAP access to hundreds of thousands of Apple developers, the benefit for Apple is to further establish themselves as an enterprise brand. Connected Cars: Optimize the Rental Car Experience with SAP Vehicles Network Another showcase is a cooperation with Hertz and Nokia demonstrating how innovations from our SAP Leonardo portfolio (such as SAP Vehicle network) can offer an intelligent experience and provide IoT friendly self-services for rental car users. When a Hertz customer downloads an app he will get additional services such as an overview of available parking spots at his destination that he can pre-book. The car directs the driver to the parking and allows the driver to open the gate to the reserved parking. The app also shows gas stations nearby. When the business trip is over, the user has all expenses – from lunch to the gas bill – already in the expense report. “With this prototype we are showing SAP’s IoT innovation capacity”, says Gatien. “But at the same time enabling integration of key processes such as travel management for business travelers with our Concur solution.” Connected Stadium and Fan Engagement SAP also helps sports clubs like Bayern Munich to better engage with fans, and to make the most of an event. “An event has a life-cycle,” says Gatien. “Global and local telco operators want to align with sports clubs, and propose services for fan engagement before, during and after a football match or a music concert.” Fans participating in a loyalty system could get additional information or services, such as pre-ordering tickets or merchandise. Or fans could register for the TwoGo car-sharing app, and share a ride with other fans, and earn loyalty points that can be redeemed on the club’s website. Wifi spots and sensors in the stadium will make the stadium connected, giving fans access to data, such as the expected waiting time at the food corner, so that fans will not miss the second half waiting for a sausage. In a connected stadium, the venue manager gets alerts due to traffic jam, when delays are expected for fans coming from one direction. Or the manager gets a notification if for example a turn-stile has a malfunction, and can send a technician and look at a heat-map that shows the visitor flow, and can order staff where needed. Smart Cities: Transportation Safety with Wearables “We are demonstrating how the combination of our know-how in different industries can position SAP as a provider of smart solutions for future cities in areas such as transportation and waste management, citizen security services or congestion prevention,” says Gatien. “To help cities become smart we have huge opportunities to co-innovate with Telco operators to help them go evolve beyond the connectivity for smart grids and wired buildings into new value added sensor friendly scenarios.” An example of a co-innovation with an SAP partner and operator is NTT in Japan. The telecom giant teamed up with SAP to help prevent accidents in public transportation. The company developed a fabric, a vest for bus drivers, embedded with sensors to monitor vital signs like heartbeat and nervous system responses. This analysis goes to SAP Cloud platform where it’s combined with data such as current traffic and weather conditions – and sensor-driven data like GPS signals, and information from on-board devices that estimate the vehicle’s condition. The predictive capabilities of SAP Cloud platform together with NTT’s IoT analytics will help bus companies identify potential danger before accidents occur.

Skip to content Apple News is a traffic and subscription driver for the Telegraph News Podcasts Pulse Events Careers Sections News Podcasts Pulse Events Careers Hot Topics The Platform Effect Marketing on Platforms Brands in Culture Modern Newsroom Agency Culture Video Anywhere Retail Revolution Categories Media Marketing BuzzFeed bets big on original shows for platforms Duopoly Video Anywhere Brands in Culture The Confessions Media Marketing The Platform Effect Apple News is a traffic and subscription driver for the Telegraph March 14, 2017 by Lucinda Southern For The Telegraph, Apple News has become the most effective third-party platform at driving readers to its own sites and app — where it can eventually turn them into subscribers. The Telegraph has made articles available on Apple News in some form since the news aggregation app launched in September 2015. The publisher introduced a new paywall model last November and saw unique monthly viewers grow 30 percent since last month, though The Telegraph doesn’t give out exact figures. Now on Apple News, as everywhere off-site, The Telegraph publishes 80 percent of its content — approximately 240 articles a day. The remaining 20 percent is for subscribers. Apple News drives readers to its app, where it can convert them to subscribers. “Apple News consumers are proving to be a rich part of the funnel driving into our owned and operated platforms,” said Robert Bridge, chief customer officer at The Telegraph Media Group. “And that’s the hope, right? That you extend your reach through these products, then you migrate the audience into your core products.” A key benefit of Apple News is that it pushes readers to The Telegraph’s app through ads. The Telegraph’s own app became free to download last October, but only since last week were app users able to subscribe to its premium content through the app. Bridge wouldn’t share how well the app has been in converting casual readers to subscribers, but early signs are encouraging, he said. Interestingly, the publisher said 65 percent of those who have been driven into The Telegraph app from Apple News are its most engaged app users, returning to the app more than five times in a month. They also index higher on other engagement metrics it measures, like dwell time and number of articles read. “The main growth has been driven by the iOS10 update and a combination of our new strategy,” said Bridge. Several publishers recorded traffic increases since the iOS10 update last year, partly because of the introduction of notifications. “In the modern age, people look to consume content through notifications. That doesn’t mean they will always open them and click through.” Digiday Content Marketing Summit August 14 - 16, 2017 Vail, Colorado Register Now Right now, there’s no fixed approach to notifications. The Telegraph is working out whether it should use different content for notifications on its own app versus Apple News. “It’s finding that balance between targeting and getting stuff out quickly,” said Bridge, who noted that Apple’s platform is easy to use, but the audience segmentation is more advanced in The Telegraph’s app. The number of notifications it sends in a day also depends on the news cycle. For now, readers cannot subscribe to The Telegraph’s premium product through third-party platforms, but that could change. “I’m committed to driving subscriptions to our premium content,” said Bridge, “I’m not against the concept of putting paid content in environments where we can monetize them.” Modern Newsroom The Financial Times: Readers who comment are 7 times more engaged March 16, 2017 by Lucinda Southern Media Innovation The Washington Post preps its augmented reality push March 16, 2017 by Lucia Moses The Programmatic Publisher More programmatic buyers are shunning Breitbart March 16, 2017 by Ross Benes Sponsored Marketing and IoT: With unlimited possibilities, where do you start?

In fact, I have a first-gen Apple Watch sitting on my shelf right now that I’ve not used for the past six months because I haven’t bothered to schedule an appointment at the Genius Bar. The folks over at MFC claim to have a limited solution to this problem: the iBus Data Cable — a small little dongle that attaches to the maintenance port nestled inside the band reservoir on the Apple Watch. Many Apple Watch users probably have no inkling that such a port exists, but the team at MFC have engineered a dongle to take advantage of the I/O provided by this port to facilitate watchOS restores. The best wireless keyboard for the Mac? What’s in the box? 1 x iBUS Data Cable adapter 1 x Two-in-one adapter pilot pin The iBUS comes with two parts — a pilot pin that slides into the lug port and connects to the maintenance pins on the Apple Watch, and the iBUS Data Cable adapter, which attaches to the pilot pin and features a Lighting cable on the opposite end for connecting to your Mac. But before you pull out your credit cards to order an iBUS, know that its scope is quite limited at this time. First and foremost, MFC claims that the iBUS only works with the Apple Watch Series 1, which means that my sad little first-gen will remain on the shelf for the foreseeable future. iBUS support Full Support Apple Watch Series 1 38mm & 42mm Support Apple Watch Series 1 restore and repair software Downgrade and upgrade firmware Support Apple Watch Glass Digitizer touch programming etc Working with macOS iTunes or paid MFC Dongle software The iBUS is also limited in that MFC doesn’t generally provide the necessary IPSW software files (there are a couple of firmware links that you’ll find in the comments on MFC’s website) used to restore an Apple Watch. If it were an iPhone or an iPad this wouldn’t be an issue, but since Apple only makes OTA files available for the Apple Watch, you’ll need to devise some method to acquire the full software files to restore your Apple Watch to the desired version. That, too, brings up another issue — Apple must be currently signing the software files in order for a restore to work with that particular file. As you can see, there are a lot of gotchas when it comes to using the iBUS, but if you have the right Apple Watch and a full software file that’s still being signed, restoring the Apple Watch seems fairly straightforward. You simply connect the iBUS to the maintenance port on the Apple Watch, and connect the USB cable from a Mac to the iBUS. From there it’s just a matter of opening iTunes and restoring the software like you would an iOS device. We’ve not yet been able to test the iBUS, but have reached out to MFC for a sample unit for future experimentation. If you’re interested, and are fully aware of the device’s limitations, you can visit MFC’s website to order an iBUS for $90. Or you can save that money and do like any normal person does when their Apple hardware has issues: just visit the Genius Bar.

Truthfully, the thought that the invalidation of a patent claim is not precedential is at a minimum a factual impossibility, and very likely a legal impossibility as well. Clearly, the final decision that one or more patent claims are invalid will be authority for cases dealing with attempts to enforce the now defunct claim(s). For the sake of simplicity, let’s work with an example. Let’s say that a not too hypothetical patent owner has had all the claims to the patent invalidated in some prior proceeding, whether in the district court or at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, and now the Federal Circuit has rubber stamped the previous decision with a one-word judgment: “Affirmed.” Let’s further say that this case was between the patent owner and a single opposing party – Google, for example. What happens if a patent owner who suffered that Rule 36 summary loss to Google at the Federal Circuit were to decide to sue another party – perhaps Apple – on the same claims that were invalidated in the above mentioned hypothetical Google proceeding? No doubt Apple’s attorneys would be rightfully indignant, and if the proceeding were in federal district court you could guarantee there would be sanctions, likely against both the patent owner and the attorneys representing the patent owner. Why? Because those claims have been lost (i.e., invalidated) in a prior proceeding, and it does not matter that Apple was not privy to that prior proceeding. The underlying property right has been lost, and whether the Federal Circuit wants to admit it or not that is binding precedent. Claim construction is a question of law, which in some limited sense may at times also have a factual component (i.e., when extrinsic evidence is consulted to construe the claim). See Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc. Questions of invalidity, however, are clearly questions of law. Thus, when claims are declared invalid it must necessarily be precedential. In other words, these invalidity determinations are conclusions of law that will absolutely be dispositive authority for cases dealing with attempts to enforce the now defunct claim(s). Even if there is no bright-line rule to demand it, we all know that if the patent owner were to sue another party on claims lost in a Rule 36 judgment sanctions would issue. Obviously, the outcome of a Rule 36 judgment that invalidates one or more patent claims is very precedential. Thus, it is wholly inappropriate for the Federal Circuit to use Rule 36 if one or more claims have been invalidated. Truthfully, it is also likely equally inappropriate for the Federal Circuit to designate an opinion as nonprecedential if one or more claims are invalidated. Interestingly, a decision upholding the validity of claims would have no precedential value, as ironic and idiotic as that is, because a challenger not in privy could still continue to challenge claims without estoppel ever applying. Title to patents never quiets, ownership is never real, patent owners need to prevail 100% of the time in every forum if they are to even retain the illusory hope of exclusive rights. On the other hand, challengers need to prevail once, and can do so without the Federal Circuit ever explaining why. To call this unfair and one-sided doesn’t even begin to capture the magnitude of just how shameful the system has become.

I had a first amendment case that got a Rule 36 but I still petitioned for cert, which is an insurmountable task given that there is no written appellate opinion. In essence, Rule 36 is a great way to deny justice. Jordan Bauman March 15, 2017 5:47 am I have to admit that this Rule 36 fad has blown my mind. I have had problems explaining to people the idiocy of it. Thank you Gene. Paul F. Morgan March 15, 2017 11:19 am Patent owners only getting one free lawsuit bite if the claims are held invalid in a final decision [whether unappealed, affirmed under Rule 36, or otherwise] is not new, it dates from the old Sup. Ct. decision in Blonder – Tongue Labs, Inc. v. University of Illinois Foundations, 402 US 313 (1971). Likewise, there has never been a “validity” decision binding on unrelated parties, rather they are “invalidity not proven by this defendant” decisions. [Otherwise, every company in America would be at the mercy of a defendant who did a poor prior art search or other defense presentation failure.] [But if a patent owner wins a trial against a competent defendant, that usually strongly encourages other defendants to settle.] BTW, the absence of any real Fed. Cir. appeal decision from a mere D.C. S.J., did not prevent the Sup. Ct. from taking and deciding KSR. Anon March 15, 2017 2:18 pm See the Federal Circuit’s recent nonprecedential opinion in Coffelt v. NVIDIA Corp. There, the Federal Circuit provided a mere two pages of text to justify its section 101 ruling. (http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/17-1119.Opinion.3-10-2017.1.PDF). I don’t think that the elimination of Rule 36 would appreciably add to the judges’ workload. step back March 15, 2017 9:37 pm Hey Anon @4 I too spotted that Coffelt (pro se) case of today. What surprised me is that the CAFC did not even bother to print the claim. One thing for sure is that this case is a poster child for not going it alone as a pro se. Five claims, only one independent, that’s it? Eric Berend March 16, 2017 8:23 am Thank you Peter and Gene, for elucidating yet another area, in which contradictory or nonsensically unfounded judicial decisions, call for clarification or rectification. As an inventor who also has some significant experience in real estate, I appreciate the apt analogy to the expectation of enjoyment of a quiet title; as is normally presumed by millions of homeowners and real property owners. I note with interest that; however much a patent may be Constitutionally defined as a right of exclusivity “for [a] limited time[s]”; said limited, exclusive right is supposed to be “…secure…”. In essence, how can a subjecting a right that is supposed to be mandated as being secure, to endless post-grant challenges, be Constitutionally valid? Where, as in no other area of U.S jurisprudence, collateral estoppel and res judicata does not apply; at least, not in the Article I bureaucratic manifestations now all-too-enthusastically practiced by the USPTO against patentees? It matters not, whether such treatment is couched in terms such as “public property” (e.g. Patlex; et al), “abstract idea” (Alice; Bilski; et al) or “inventive concept” (a judge-created non-statutory notion); the effect, is the same: to never enjoy the economically necessary and personally beneficial security of title, even if for but the limited time allotted to an inventor, for the purpose of protecting nascent industry and promoting commercial growth, arising from the technology upon which a patent is granted. I wish there would be an effective vehicle to convey this concept to the many ignorant, confused or deceived persons, carelessly convinced about so-called “patent trolls”, by the braying infringer-sycophant crowd. Eric Berend March 16, 2017 8:50 am @ 4. ‘Anon’: That is a good aspect to point out, given the judges’ special regard of their precious ‘judicial economy’ as being such an important reason for perfunctory decision making and explanation. Perhaps, it is not too much to ask; that an Appellate Judge or panel of same, actually explain a ruling; after the arduous legal journey invariably required to reach that point – what: 5+ years, two or more Court proceedings, some $300,000 to 3,000,000 in counsel fees – and the good Judges, cannot write even a mere couple of pages or so; if they are so inclined, to a mere minimal performance of their sworn duties?

Twitter More iPad screen sizes unlikely to stop slump Analysts ponder rumors of additional tablet choices Gregg Keizer (Computerworld (US)) 15 March, 2017 01:44 - - - - print email Comments Apple would be smart to make good on speculation about new iPad screen sizes, a pair of analysts said today. "The tablet has evolved from a general-purpose device to more of a specialized device," argued Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research, when asked about long-circulating rumors of a coming expansion to the iPad line. "Certain sizes are better optimized for more specialized applications." Talk of additional iPads -- notably one with a 10.5-in. screen -- has circulated for months, kick started by Ming-Chi Kuo, a financial analyst with KGI Securities. More recently, however, rumors focused on a spring launch, perhaps this month, perhaps in May or June. Apple last changed the portfolio's pricing in September 2016, but except for the 9.7-in. iPad Pro introduced a year ago, the hardware has remained static since the fall of 2015. And during that stretch iPad unit sales continued to contract -- the slump has now lasted three years -- and tablet revenue continued to shrink in raw numbers and percentage of Apple's total. Apple sold 13.1 million iPads in the December 2016 quarter, down 19% from the same period the year prior. Meanwhile, iPad revenue of $5.5 billion was 22% lower than in the December quarter of 2015. CEO Tim Cook has not changed how he has described the iPad to Wall Street -- in January, Cook again said he was "very bullish" on the tablet -- nor laid out a strategy to return the line to growth. O'Donnell saw portfolio expansion as a simultaneous recognition of market reality and a way to increase sales. "To support more of these specialized usages means a wider variety of screen sizes," O'Donnell said. "That, for me, would be logical. And it would let Apple expand the number of price points as well." The original iPad Pro -- the 12.9-in. device unveiled in September 2015 -- was a good example of specialization, O'Donnell contended. "It did well by bringing up the ASP [average selling price], but it's not a mainstream product," he said. Ezra Gottheil, an analyst with Technology Business Research, echoed O'Donnell on the usefulness of more screen sizes. "It makes sense to give customers a wider range of choices," he said. Expanded options would be in keeping with the tablet market's maturation, Gottheil added. "That's part of the landscape for products we buy for practical and entertainment purposes both," he said. Even so, it's unlikely that Apple can reverse the iPad's course simply by multiplying screen sizes. "There's nothing in the universe that will make a zillion people buy [a tablet]," Gottheil said. Long replacement cycles -- getting longer by the year -- and for many original purchasers, no intention of ever buying another tablet, doom tablets to, at best, growth rates miniscule in comparison to those of five or six years ago. Last month, researcher IDC portrayed the overall tablet market as in a "spiraling decline," and said Apple's flagship was starting to "show signs of age." IDC forecast that tablet sales declines would continue through 2021. How will Apple tackle its iPad problem? Gottheil assumed it will hold to its core strategy of producing integrated hardware and software at a premium price. "That's a good, solid business," he pointed out with a nod to the $19 billion in revenue during 2016. "But is it ever going to explode again? No." In January, Cook used a company-standard line when answering a question about the iPad. "If I zoom out of the 90-day clock and look at it, we've got some exciting things coming on iPad," Cook pledged. To Apple's executives, there's always something around the corner, even if that corner is shrouded in mystery or further away than expected. O'Donnell was more matter-of-fact. "People have not felt the need to upgrade their iPads. But [more screen sizes] may stem the bleeding," he suggested.

You might have noticed the company’s pay-at-table Presto touchscreen terminals at some restaurants already— its two big customers are Outback Steakhouse and Applebee’s— but its new Presto Prime terminal announced today offers a number of enhancements with Apple Pay among them: The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac The PrestoPrime EMV Terminal’s core benefits include: • Only pay-at-table system with dual processors using a securely partitioned payment module, which enables best-in-class end-to-end EMV security to safely support third party apps, premium content, and integration with complementary devices • Contactless mobile payment capability including Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay, as well as a QR code reader and camera In addition to support for Apple Pay and other mobile payment services, the new terminal also includes an integrated keypad for secure PIN entry, full international Chip-and-PIN support, and enhanced security and storage. E la Carte says it currently has around 90,000 of its previous generation terminals at use in over 1800 restaurants across the US, so there is quite a large number of restaurants that could likely upgrade to the new system and start offering Apple Pay. There’s no word on when Outback Steakhouse, Applebee’s or other Presto terminal customers might be implementing the new system, but the company notes that the new Presto Prime product is software-compatible with the old system, so you’ll likely see restaurants upgrading and moving to the newer terminals in the near future. While support for Apple Pay through systems like Presto Prime will bring table side payments to more restaurants, we recently suggested that expanded support for bar tabs and restaurant bills is something that Apple should build directly into its platform. We asked if you’d want and use such a feature, and over 73% of you said yes. Having it built into Apple Pay as a native feature, opposed to going through third-party systems or having to download apps, would certainly greatly increase adoption among restaurants, live events, and other retailers.

If you are a sweet and gentle and sensitive person, with an obsessive nature and a deep fascination for numbers and a complete infatuation with the calculation of π, today is the day for you! And what better way to celebrate the day than by baking a transcendent(al) pie? Before you decide on a recipe, though, it wouldn't be irrational to think long and hard about the dough you'll use. Maybe you're most interested in a pie dough that's super fast and forgiving, or maybe you want a buttery, flaky crust that doesn't require a food processor. (See here for a little deeper discussion of the merits of Stella's recipe versus Kenji's.) Going gluten-free? We've got you covered there, too. Beginning pie-makers should check out our advice on the best pie pans and how to blind-bake a crust (and even more experienced bakers may want to consult Kenji's foray into pie myth-busting). If you've got the basic knowledge you need and are just looking for an Instagram-worthy way to dress up your creation, we've got step-by-step guides for making a pretty lattice top, or an extra-fancy herringbone pattern. Finally, if you're carting your pie over to a friend's house for a Pi Day celebration (or, you know, any old special occasion), don't forget to pick up a carton of food-grade Epsom salt: When placed inside your carrying container, it'll help keep your crust from getting soggy in transit. Now, on to the recipes. Not three, not 14, but 15 recipes for both savory and sweet pies, including chocolate cream and classic cherry, pie variations like cobbler and crisp, and more hot pies for all your Pi Day needs. Sweet Pi Double-Chocolate Cream Pi [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] This is the chocolate pie to end all chocolate pie, using a combination of Dutch cocoa and dark chocolate to create a filling that's rich and intense. Though the pie does involve a number of steps, the filling's not all that complicated to make, and it won't weep on you. A lovely layer of swirled Swiss meringue on top gets a nice toasty color from the oven, while remaining fluffy on the inside. Get the recipe for Double-Chocolate Cream Pie » Silky Sweet Potato Pi [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] No need for canned condensed milk here; instead, you'll make your own version as you simmer sweet potatoes in a mixture of milk, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla. The process results in a sweet potato filling that's fresher- and lighter-tasting, with an almost vegetal flavor thanks to a generous dose of nutmeg. Don't forget to save the vanilla seeds to make a topping of Brown Sugar Whipped Cream, an elegant touch when dolloped onto the pie. Get the recipe for Silky Sweet Potato Pie » Late-Summer Mixed-Fruit Pi [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] A variety of fruits, both sweet and tart, form a colorful filling for this summery pie—but don't worry, you can totally use frozen fruit in the wintertime. This is a great opportunity for you fancy bakers out there who want to try out a lattice design to top your pie, but if you don't feel up for it, you can certainly just use a solid sheet of dough, cut to span the πr2 of the base. Do read the label on the tapioca starch you buy: Only starch made from real cassava will gel properly. Get the recipe for Late-Summer Mixed-Fruit Pie » Freeform Peach Pi (Galette) [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] A galette, or freeform pie, is the perfect vehicle for fruit like peaches, which won't survive the long bake at high heat that's needed for a traditional pie made in a pie dish. It's also perfect for when you don't want to bother with careful shaping and fluting of that crust, since all you've got to do is pile the filling in the middle and fold the dough over, section by section. You can substitute other stone fruit for the peaches, or swap out some of it for berries. Get the recipe for Freeform Peach Pie (Galette) » The Best Blueberry Pi [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] Nothing beats a classic like blueberry pie, and no blueberry pie beats this version. Using our handy ratio of fruit and sugar, you'll be rewarded with a filling that cooks up nice and thick—no more fears of getting blueberry soup—with a complexity of blueberry flavor from a mix of both cultivated and wild berries. Get the recipe for The Best Blueberry Pie » Gooey Apple Pi [Photograph: J. Kenji López-Alt] An improvement on another old standard. Here, the apple slices are cooked to 160°F (71°C), which helps them hold their shape even as they turn tender during baking. Cornstarch and sugar thicken the filling into a nice, gooey syrup, while a bit of lemon zest brightens up the flavor. Get the recipe for Gooey Apple Pie » Classic Biscuit-Topped Peach Cobbler [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] All right, I can hear you saying it: "This isn't π!" Not quite, perhaps, but it has the crucial elements, and it's a beautiful dessert to boot. Think of it as 1/π, an inverted π, if you will: a sweet, bright interior of peach slices in a rich syrup, with a moist and tender biscuit blanket. Get the recipe for Classic Biscuit-Topped Peach Cobbler » Cherry Pi [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] This may be one of the prettiest pies on the list, but it's also one of the tastiest. Pitted fresh cherries (you can use frozen ones, too) are lightly bound in a clear syrup that doesn't detract from the fruit's naturally sweet and tart flavors. With the right ratio of fruit to sugar, you won't have to sacrifice a crisp crust to get a nicely thickened filling. Hold on to the cherry pits to make a subtly cherry-flavored whipped cream to serve alongside. Get the recipe for Cherry Pie » Extra-Smooth Pumpkin Pi [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] Who says pumpkin pie is only for Thanksgiving? It might even be extra appealing out of season, when you're not suffering from the pumpkin-spice fatigue of fall. Blending cream cheese with canned fresh pumpkin purée gives the filling a smoother, silkier consistency and keeps it less wet than typical versions, reducing your risk of a soggy crust. Get the recipe for Extra-Smooth Pumpkin Pie » Rustic Apple-Cranberry Pi [Photograph: Yvonne Ruperti] Here's another galette for those who just want a delicious pie, without all the fussy presentation. Sweet apples and tangy cranberries are a familiar fall combination, and they get a boost in flavor from a sprinkling of cinnamon; added richness from butter helps to balance out their tartness. Get the recipe for Rustic Apple-Cranberry Pie » The Best Apple Crisp [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] On this one, you got me: It isn't even close to being π. But it's so good, we couldn't leave it off the list—and it's easy. The crisp topping, chock-full of toasty pecans and scented with nutmeg, comes together quickly in a food processor, and the fruit base is nothing more than chopped apples tossed with cornstarch, sugar, salt, and a little whiskey. Get the recipe for The Best Apple Crisp » Gluten-Free Blueberry Cheesecake Pi With Lavender Streusel [Photograph: Aki Kamozawa] This might be the dessert equivalent of Euler's identity, since it combines cheesecake and π in a way that is, quite simply, mathematically beautiful. It's more complicated than many of the other recipes here, but the result is a juicy filling of sweet-tart blueberries, covered in a light cheesecake topping and a delicately floral-scented streusel. Get the recipe for Gluten-Free Blueberry Cheesecake Pie With Lavender Streusel » The Ultimate Snickers Pi [Photograph: Ideas in Food] What kind of pie roundup would this be without an ice cream pie? And this is ice cream pie to the nth degree, with caramelized condensed-milk ice cream in a chocolate crust, topped off with a chocolate-caramel sauce and a chocolate–peanut butter ganache. Get the recipe for The Ultimate Snickers Pie » Meat Pi Mexican Tamale Pi (Tamal de Cazuela) [Photograph: Daniel Gritzer] As good as tamales are, making them at home is a headache. Much easier is packing the flavors of a tamale into pie form. This tamal de cazuela features a filling made with chicken stock, black beans, and lard, flavored with smoky ancho chilies. Alternatively, consider this meatier version, filled with slow-cooked skirt steak, or this vegetarian pie. Get the recipe for Mexican Tamale Pie (Tamal de Cazuela) » Classic, Savory Shepherd's Pi (With Beef and/or Lamb) [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] There may be no pie, whether savory or sweet, that's as satisfying as a shepherd's pie—buttery mashed potatoes with browned peaks, crowning a mix of vegetables and minced meat. I love lamb (and it is called shepherd's pie for a reason), but this recipe will work just as well with less-traditional ground beef, or a mixture of the two.

Andrew Burton/Getty Images This article originally appeared on Quora: What is behind Berkshire Hathaway’s sudden interest in Apple? Speaking at the 2017 Daily Journal Annual Meeting, Charlie Munger joked about how after so many years shunning technology companies and airlines, suddenly Berkshire Hathaway was investing billions of dollars in each (emphasis mine): In the old days, what we did was shoot fish in a barrel. It was so easy, we didn’t want to shoot fish while they were moving, so we waited until they slowed down and then we shot them with a shotgun. It was just that easy. It’s gotten harder and harder and harder. Now we get little edges. It isn’t any less interesting. Remember when Warren bought Exxon as a cash substitute? He never would have done that in the old days. We had a lot of cash and he thought that Exxon was better than cash over the short term. That’s a different kind of thing from the way Warren came up. He’s changed. He’s changed when he buys airlines. He’s changed when he buys Apple. Think of the hooey we built up over the years: we don’t understand it, it’s outside our circle of competency, the worst business in the world is airlines—and what appears in the holdings? Apple and a bunch of airlines. Have we gone crazy? I think the answer is, we’re adapting reasonably to a business that’s gotten much more difficult. I don’t think we have a cinch. We have the odds a little bit in our favor. We have to live on the advantages we can get. I used to say you have to marry the best person who will have you. I’m afraid that’s a rule of life. Things have gotten so difficult in the investment world that we have to be satisfied with the type of advantage we can get. Doing anything well in life means continuously pushing your boundaries as well as evolving to adapt to a world that is constantly changing around you. This is especially true with investing and allocating capital. Understanding why Berkshire Hathaway is now investing billions of dollars into Apple stock requires a deeper understanding of how Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger and Berkshire Hathaway have evolved over the decades. *** In his early years, Warren Buffett was focused on “cigar butts”—typically a mediocre company that had very little going for it other than the fact that its stock price was trading well below liquidation value and maybe good for “one last puff.” It was actually Charlie Munger’s influence that pushed Warren Buffett to start investing in “great companies at good prices”. Buffett and Munger talk about “circles of competence” i.e. focusing your investing in areas that you know extremely well. Both of them have also shown a capacity to expand their “circles of competence” over time. Warren Buffett started out as a huge fan of the insurance business. Some of you might remember him as a young stockbroker in 1951 professing his love for the Government Employees Insurance Company —now more commonly known as GEICO. But over time, he meticulously expanded his “circles of competence” into industrial companies, consumer goods businesses, power utilities, railroads and other sectors while also expanding outside the U.S. as the world economy globalized. Perhaps with investments in IBM and Apple, he has added the technology sector to the list as well. Much of Berkshire Hathaway’s evolution has simply been the need to adapt to the realities of managing its massive girth. Managing a $100 million stock portfolio is very different from managing a $604 billion balance sheet. Part of the reason that Buffett moved on from “cigar butts” was simply that he had to—it becomes harder to find these sorts of opportunities as your minimum investment threshold increases. And even though the annualized IRR you might attain from investing in a “great company available at a good price” might not be as high as doubling your money on a “cigar butt” stock in 18 months, usually you are able to deploy far greater amounts of capital in the former as opposed to the latter. More importantly, you do not need to search for another “cigar butt” to replace it—great companies have the ability to compound returns over very long periods of time resulting in much higher multiples and absolute returns than “cigar butt” investing could ever generate. They are more scalable from a time and management perspective. This is why many of Berkshire Hathaway’s core equity positions—companies like Coca-Cola and Wells Fargo—have been held for multiple decades and have generated tens of billions of dollars of value for the conglomerate. With such a massive balance sheet today, even “great companies available at good prices” are becoming harder and harder to find—the universe of companies with market caps over $10 billion is a small fraction of investable names (although a much bigger fraction of the market by weight of course). At the Daily Journal meeting, Charlie Munger went on to discuss how at some point you are managing so much capital that it becomes nearly impossible to beat the broad market indices. At some point, theoretical returns must converge with overall market returns. While Berkshire Hathaway is not quite there yet, Buffett and Munger have long warned investors that historical returns are simply not repeatable going forward. By this they mean that Berkshire Hathaway investors should not expect the percentage returns of the past—20%+ annualized over multiple decades—to be achievable on a consistent basis in the future. Some of this is just based on pure math and the “law of large numbers”. Generating a 25% return on $100 million of capital means achieving a $25 million gain. Generating a 15% return on a $200 billion portfolio means having to generate $30 billion of gains. Which one do you think is harder or more impressive? It also means being more willing to consider opportunities that offer lower potential returns than you would have considered in the past. In the ’70s and ’80s, Berkshire Hathaway tended to focus on buying businesses that could generate fantastic returns on capital—typically capital-light businesses that needed very little capital to expand. A prime example of this was See’s Candy, which was purchased for $25 million in 1972—at around three times book value and a six to seven times multiple of earnings…implying returns on capital of well over 40 percent. Buffett loves to talk about how over the decades See’s Candy has generated over $1 billion of cash flow for Berkshire Hathaway—most of which did not need to be invested back into the business but could be deployed into new securities or acquisitions of new operating companies. See’s Candy could grow revenue mainly by using its pricing power to raise prices year after year after year. By the early 2000s, Berkshire Hathaway had grown to the point where a $25 million acquisition would have been a rounding error on its balance sheet. Its operating businesses were also starting to throw off significant cash flow that needed to be intelligently re-invested. So after having largely avoided capex-intensive businesses for the first three decades of running Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett purchased a small regulated utility in the Midwest called Mid-American Energy. While the percentage returns from regulated businesses are never going to match those of a “great” capital-light business like See’s Candy, it does have the advantage of allowing you to reinvest large amounts of cash flow at a decent return through the large capex requirements of the business. Today, through a combination of acquisition and organic capex-driven expansion, Mid-American is one of the largest energy companies in the country and helps Berkshire Hathaway reinvest billions of dollars of cash flow back into assets that deliver returns in the 11–15 percent range—which means over $10 billion of operating earnings across $90 billion of invested capital in its “regulated businesses” division (which includes its railroad, BNSF). Today, Berkshire Hathaway generates over $30 billion of operating cash flow per year, which means that in the five or so minutes that you’ve been reading this (admittedly long-winded) answer, an additional quarter million dollars will have flowed into Berkshire’s coffers that needs to be re-deployed. I know…high-class problem if there ever was one! Capex-intensive regulated businesses help absorb some of this incoming cash flow—DRIP investing by Buffett™, if you will. Finally, the most recent example of how Berkshire Hathaway has evolved: After managing most of the investment portfolio for over four decades, in 2010 and 2012 Warren Buffett invited two new managers to help manage the portfolio—Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. As the equity portfolio had gotten larger and larger, it was harder for one man—even the Oracle of Omaha himself—to dedicate the necessary time and effort to cover the entire stock market. Over the past several years, we have started to see new names pop up in Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio and it is safe to assume that many of the smaller new positions are the handiwork of these two new managers. Meanwhile, a position like Apple—which at close to $8 billion means that it definitely needs Warren Buffett’s seal of approval—was likely originally initiated by one of Berkshire Hathaway’s new managers. *** Which finally brings me to Apple itself. First, let me start by mentioning that Apple has been a large “core” position in my portfolio and fund since 2013—not to mention Berkshire Hathaway itself since 2006—and also that none of this should be construed as financial or investment advice. For most of his career, Warren Buffett stayed away from the technology sector, preferring instead to invest in “boring” industries. In fact, one of his more memorable moments was getting up on stage at Sun Valley in 1999 in front of hundreds of venture capitalists, technology entrepreneurs and investors to essentially take a poop on dot-com and technology stocks. So I do remember being a bit surprised when Berkshire Hathaway started buying shares of IBM in 2011. While I never quite agreed with this investment thesis it definitely made me think about how Warren Buffett constantly evolves and pushes his boundaries. But I also think another major reason why he eventually invested over ten billion dollars in IBM stock was that the business itself had changed dramatically—to the point where it wasn’t really a technology company anymore, at least in the sense that its business model was no longer subject to the volatility that haunts many technology businesses. As I wrote in another answer (Why is Warren Buffett’s only tech stock IBM?): Very simply, IBM has evolved to the point where Mr. Buffett is a lot more comfortable with his ability to peer five or more years into the future and see what IBM looks like and what the economics of its business will be. You see, IBM is not really as much a “technology company” these days as it is a “highly competent advisor to Fortune 1000 companies around the world with complex IT needs” that happens to also be very profitable in that role. Because he’s made it such a large investment, Mr. Buffett must believe that IBM’s place in the business world is unlikely to change in the medium to long-term, or that it will change in a way that he is comfortable predicting. In the same way, Apple is not your typical technology company where the future can often be extremely unpredictable and volatile. I was a technology investor for many years and one of the first questions I always asked myself when evaluating a new investment opportunity was “how is Moore’s Law going to affect this company and its industry?” More often than not potential opportunities went straight into the “Too Hard” bucket because I simply had no idea of how to comfortably predict the future even twelve months out at times. Apple has incredible brand value and this manifests itself financially in an extremely sticky customer base (90%+ customer retention rate, almost unheard of for a consumer product). It has a massive ecosystem of content creators and app developers that is making tens of billions of dollars from Apple’s customers. And it has dominant market share of a product platform that billions of people around the world can take advantage of and one that seems to grow in importance every year. Apple is a tollbooth for consumption in the modern global economy—and Buffett has a particular fondness for toll-collecting businesses. There are some reports that Apple generates over 100 percent of the profits of the smartphone industry—meaning that the rest of the industry might actually collectively lose money trying to compete. Its domination of the industry is akin to Microsoft’s near-monopoly of PC operating systems and application software in the 1990s and 2000s or Google’s dominance in the world of digital advertising. And one big difference between Microsoft in the 1990s and Google today that is sure to pique Warren Buffett’s interest is that Apple stock can still be purchased at less than 10x operating earnings. At the latest share price of $135 (as of February 2017), Apple has an implied enterprise value of $550 billion against 2016 operating earnings of $58 billion. Apple’s market capitalization has gotten so large—it represents 3.5 percent of the S&P 500 and an even higher percentage of its profits—that not owning any Apple shares essentially means you are betting against it. So for Berkshire Hathaway and its $600+ billion balance sheet, owning $8 billion in Apple stock is almost the minimum the conglomerate needs to own so that they are essentially not betting against it. The thing that finally pushed me over the edge on Apple back in 2013—I was a staunch “PC guy” for my entire life (much to the chagrin of my IRA)—was that the new management team led by Tim Cook [1] appeared to be a lot more shareholder-friendly and willing to return more of Apple’s rapidly increasing cash flow to its shareholders. After returning almost no cash to shareholders for the first three decades of life as a public company, Apple initiated a capital return program in 2012 and has since returned over $200 billion through dividends and buybacks—the largest capital return program ever in the history of the stock market. Warren Buffett generally likes when companies buy back their own shares at discounts to their underlying intrinsic value so I am pretty sure he saw this in a positive light. Finally, I want to say that beyond the unadulterated capitalism of it all, Apple is very good for America, not only enriching shareholders but its employees, the communities they belong to and society at large. America can definitely use a few more Apples and it is always a nice bonus to invest in a company that you admire. Investing in Apple is not without its risks. It still needs to navigate the rapidly changing nature of the technology industry, Moore’s Law and perhaps increased protectionism. Management still needs to execute—and there are concerns over its recent struggles with Apple TV and allowing Alexa to somehow push Siri out of the way. Like Berkshire Hathaway, it has to deal with the problem of figuring out how to grow from such a massive base. There is no guarantee that Berkshire Hathaway will ultimately generate a positive return on its investment in Apple. Investing in Apple is not like the “shooting fish in a barrel” type opportunities that Buffett and Munger saw in their earlier years. But as Munger remarked above, “the odds are a little bit in our favor” and in my experience betting against Apple, Berkshire Hathaway and/or Warren Buffett has never really been a wise move.

The iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus may not deliver super screen resolutions, but they hit the right notes for many buyers and with iOS 10 there are even more reasons the iPhone is better than Android for many users. iPhone competition includes the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, One Plus 3, the LG V20 and other phones that deliver a bigger challenge for Apple — but there are still places where the iPhone is clearly better than Android and iOS 10 is better than Android Nougat. Many of these could change with the Galaxy S8 and the LG G6 later this year, but for now – iPhone has an edge. You need to learn what the iPhone does better and how Apple delivers a better experience than Android to see if an iPhone is the best smartphone for you in 2017. Here are 15 reasons the iPhone is better than Android phones in 2017. Use our list of reasons the iPhone is better than Android to figure out which new smartphone you should buy this year. Read our iPhone 7 review to learn what sets this phone apart from the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. You can buy the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus at a discount with the best iPhone 7 Black Friday deals. Read: Siri Tips & Tricks Even if you think you know which phone is best, you might be surprised to learn about all the reasons the iPhone is better than Android. iPhone Apps Are First and Better Looking Most of the popular apps are on both platforms, but many top games and apps still come to iPhone first. We’re seeing more apps come to both Android and iPhone at the same time, but there are still way more iPhone only apps that we see than Android only. When apps are available on iPhone and Android we still often see a better design on the iPhone version than on Android. This is something that still rings true in 2017. For example, we still see some new Snapchat features and Spotify features come to iPhone before Android. iPhone owners are enjoying Super Mario Run, but the Super Mario Run Android app is still on the way. Read: Best iPhone Apps Apps are an area where the gap is closing, but the differences still exist and are noticeable. We also see Apple take better care of the App Store. Recently they purged 47,300 apps from the app store that were simply bad or abandoned. Fast iPhone Updates for All iPhone owners enjoy quick and regular iOS updates for the iPhone no matter what carrier they use. Faster updates are available for all iPhone owners. Android updates take months to arrive on all the devices. After an Android device is 18 months old, you may need to wait for a new Android smartphone to get the latest software. Apple delivers iPhone updates to devices that are three years old. Apple offers iPhone 4s iOS 9 support. It is unheard of to see support for an Android phone that old. iOS 10 is available for the iPhone 5. When you look at Android devices support ends much faster. Google promises at least two years for Nexus devices, which means Nexus 6 support ends this fall and the Nexus 6P in September 2017. Google may push farther out, but it is not a guarantee. Other Android device manufacturers don’t typically match the longevity of iOS updates. On top of the added update support, Apple does not allow carriers to hold up the updates. As soon as the update is available from Apple it is available on every carrier. If you really want Android Nougat, you may need to simply buy a new Android phone. Works Great with All Your Devices If you own an iPhone, iPad and Mac your information flows smoothly from one device to the other. You can quickly sync photos to all of your devices, answer a phone call on your iPad or Mac and send text messages from your other devices. There is also support for Handoff that allows you to start a task on your iPhone and continue on your iPad or Mac. The iPhone works great with the iPad and Mac. Overall the connectivity between these devices is something Android doesn’t yet match without relying on a collection of third-party applications and services to hodgepodge together a similar feature. Sharing a file from your iPhone to your Mac is also faster and easier thanks to AirDrop. This built-in service sends the file wirelessly directly to the Mac, even when there is no other WiFi around.

You simply can’t go wrong. I own an iPhone 5, iPad Mini 3, MacBook Pro, iMac, and Apple TV. I would not even consider anything else, especially something from that “G…” company which I abhor. I won’t even use their search engine. Same goes for anything from that software manufacturer that, well, just call it “MS). Try calling any other manufacturer for support and see if you can understand what they are saying. I suppose I am bias toward Apple but after nearly 30 years of dealing with computers of all sorts I guess my opinion is warranted. 07/17/2015 gabe Reply why people like iphones? I never understood why anyone would like to give control to another company of what you do with their device. why force u to follow MEDIA SHARING and digital rights media? you cannot torrent on iPhone, nor transfer music and videos without ITunes or a paid online service in iOS.

I have watch ,I go to the gym. I have apple computer and I can receive my phone calls there and iMessages. It crashes less often than microsoft does. I can contact apple support, whenever I want. The other time ,the bluetooth in my iPhone did not work, I contacted tech support midnight and they were available. We could not fix the problem. They called me the next day and told me to go to the nearest store and pick up a brand new phone. One more thing, my iPhone was out of warranty for 165 days. They told me they cared about customer satisfaction. When I called microsoft in order to talk to me they wanted $250. Now, compare 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply You’re literally so idiotic that you can’t spell the full name of a company. Only Apple, cuz you’re an I sheep. You can go very wrong. If people were smart these days, they would understand that iPhones are unequivocally not the right choice for them. You wouldn’t recommend anything else, because it is too limited and unintelligent to use anything else. Stop trying to influence other people to buy garbage phones and devices 05/12/2016 Nancy Reply Why are u being a hypocrite calling someone idiotic for not knowing how to spell the company name right when some of ur sentences don’t even make sense. Apple doesn’t have any competition be used it is the best phone to get. 07/13/2016 Rona Reply First of all, don’t criticize someone for calling someone else idiotic when you can’t even use proper spelling or grammar. Second, Apple is all marketing. There is nothing special about it. Android offers phones that have expandable memory (and guess who doesn’t?) and better high-speed data services. iPhones die extremely quickly, you can’t use iTunes on any other devices, whereas Android platforms are available on all devices, the picture quality on an iPhone is pathetic compared to Androids, and Apple products are majorly behind in technology. The latest update for an iPhone came out two years ago for an Android. Apple has a set array of things it can do, and you can’t customize or change that. But if you want a high-end technology phone, choose an Android. It does so much more and you can customize and change its features. I have had both an iPhone and an Android phone. 09/14/2016 Abhishek well,mam i am an android user and i would like to say that iphones are the best because when you buy an android first it will give you good performance but after one month it will start hanging and work slow and that is same with every android devices.and their are so many android malware which also affect performance. Iphones are the best, secure and stable. 09/15/2016 Me Stay butthurt, loser ; ) 12/04/2016 jgames “nothing special about it” fastest phone ever 3d touch very good camera looks very nice “nothing special about it” why do we need expandable memory on iOS? gime a few reasons for that. “better high-speed data” give me your source for all this information. iphones die extremely quickly? how? do you even have an iphone? iphones have much better standby and screen on time with heavy usage than android. you cant use itunes on other devices, yes, but ios wants to keep it ios exclusive because their services are one of the major selling points for them. android platforms are available everywhere, but google software is usually preferred to ios software. pathetic picture quality? wut? iphone pictures wont lose quality when you zoom in and support much more colors than any old android camera. android cameras are very nice as well, though. “apple are behind in technology” a lot of people say this but it’s actually quite the opposite. 3d touch was very innovative, its like a ‘right click’ for your phone. the latest iphone update did not come out 2 years ago. you seem like you have no idea what you’re talking about and just spouting nonsense. apple can do a lot of things without customization, but what customization do we really need? people always saying android is more customizable but never give examples, and when they do its “homescreen.” moving home screen icons around is a pretty useless feature tbh android isnt more high end tech than iphone and i dont see how much more it does. you havent even explained how it can in your comment. so please use common sense before spouting nonsense 02/27/2017 Gage iPhones are by far the better phone. I’ve had android phones for most of my life but i bought an iPhone 6 about a year ago and now I have the 7 and I can’t imagine going back. Android is slow, every button you push there’s a lag before it actually opens the app or whatever you pushed. Also, every android I’ve ever had has had terrible battery life, it never lasts the full day but my iPhone almost always does. And my last point, android automatically installs like 10-20 on your phone that you cannot delete no matter how hard you try. Apple has 3-5. Yes, android has a port for SD cards, but what good is that if a large amount of your memory is made up of apps you don’t want. You’re entitled to your opinion but I advise that you get yourself an iPhone 7 and keep an open mind. I’m fairly certain you realize how much better it is 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Not very nice. Also, Apple is just as good as Android, theres aspects that one company has over the other, and vice versa, so the best thing to do is just to test out both and find your favorite and use it because Android and Apple’s problems and advantages weigh out each other so it really just matters which one you like the most so just use the one u like and stop arguing. 08/19/2016 Zane Reis Reply I prefer Android because of the coustomization it has to offer. I prefer to be able to change change almost every aspect about my phone and making it the way “I” like it, not the way Apple likes it. I like the coustomization while others find it chaotic, confusing, and would rather it be (in their eyes) simpler. 05/26/2016 Billy Reply Says the one who has Zombie Knight as their username. 07/18/2016 Nate Pauley Reply That’s an interesting rather stupid mindset to have and it makes me reflect on the time I had those same views. It took me 6 years as an android user to eventually realise how inferior it is to iOS. Android is plagued with fragmentation, so much that not even customisation can save it. There should be a term that describes blindsided android followers, if there is one then I’d like to know it. iOS is solid, stable, secure and much more better looking than android – Apple pays exquisite attention to the finer details and they will continuously improve on the irritating nooks and crannies so many people mention in the comments. The best part is APPLE USERS CAN ACTUALLY BE A PART of the firmware updates and have assurance in a better OS experience overtime. I’ve had my S6 for a year and I’ve only managed to have one firmware update that took 7 months to deliver. I can only give credit to android for the premium android devices such as my S6, until then the physicality of a device alone cannot make me shift in the near future. I want a solid experience, not a hollow one. 08/02/2016 Adarsh Reply Hi, Your comparison of iphone with S7 is not right because in case of iphone both hardware and software are developed by Apple and in case of S7 developer of hardware is Samsung and developer of software is Google. I use Nexus 5 phone, hardware and software both developed by Google and manufactured by LG and ipad Air2 by Apple. Both devices update periodically whenever updates are released and I am happy with both. 09/15/2016 Me Reply LOL stay laughably buthurt/beyond tasteless loser Fandroid X ) 03/02/2017 xxLoser123xx Reply Wow you know how to use a Thesaurus. 03/06/2017 Sally Fallis Reply Wow! I AM impressed! You know about the Thesaurus!! I didn’t think anyone under 50 ever heard of it anymore! 12/17/2015 Noah Reply This comment, as well as this article are laughable at best. Coming from a person who owns all major Apple products but frequently bounces back and forth in the smartphone department, I don’t see how any of these actually make the iPhone “better” than android. I would say the only point that is valid is the support Apple has from app developers. It’s pretty easy to see that apps on the iPhone can be “prettier” than apps on android with the extra animations, and quick gestures. However even that is relative, since iOS gives you security and “pretty animations” but gives of freedom and functionality in the process. I still can’t tell you which phone is better, as that all is personal preference and I really don’t care which phone is “better”. I just want a phone that does what I want it to do without too many hiccups (which is why I’ll never buy another Samsung device). For now, I’d say in terms of productivity, the iPhone is great if you are a person who needs iMessage, FaceTime, and the Apple ecosystem to feel comfortable doing work. While I believe most android phones will get work DONE. With the amount of third party apps available to you on the play store, multi window, Google now on tap, and other gestures. I have always felt an android is phone is more a workhorse while the iPhone is king of simplicity. 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Congrats, you just wasted about 5-15 minutes of your time typing out this article because its not going to convince anyone.

This article and many commenters made me want to vomit thinking he was so biased and the sheep just followed along. I can give numerous reasons Android is a better OS, but that is not the point. However, some Android devices suck. Most of the detractors comments are true of stock Samsung devices. Samsung may be the most popular, but far from the best. They make pretty good hardware, but the software begs for rooting and custom ROMS. I am typing from a Nexus 6P, which is pure Android. Google does good with monthly updates, too. But I am using Pure Nexus, the best reason for owning a Nexus/Pixel device, with ElementalX kernel for out of this world stability, smoothness, flexibility, and battery life. Unless I use hotspot(tunneled over VPN), I only have to charge every 2 days under pretty heavy use. PN is actually updated more than Google’s stock and usually delivers security updates within a day of release, which is faster than Google often rolls it out to most users. 01/06/2016 Leo Keys Reply Why would someone else go with a product by Google, NVidia (I will come back to them), or Microsoft; over that “A…” Company (Repeat)? The reason people would use nVidia over the AMD (god I hate AMD’s Products) GPU’s found in Mac products? They want a more powerful GPU. Apple says that their “PC’s” are better and use top-notch products. Why don’t they use the GeForce GTX 980m in the MacBook Pro? Why don’t they use Quadro cards over FirePro cards? Because Apple doesn’t know anything about Graphics. As for iMac’s I have no clue why some use an i5. Apple products thermal throttle a lot. Android is secure with the right Antivirus programs. It is also much more free to do what ever you want. But, because your an iSheep, you can’t process facts that favor the other side of the grass. Guess your life must be happy, getting råpēd by Apple, every year and paying thousands on eye candy. Why use Google or Bing over Yahoo? Yahoo sucks, that’s why. Face the fact that Yahoo and other search engines are inferior to Google. Apple products are trash and are eye candy for white girls (Starbucks and that stuff). 01/06/2016 Pedro Coimbra Reply Now you have to bring the Nvidia/ATI war? What, the iphone/android isn’t enough for you? Dude AMD cards are equally powerful, no matter how much you “hate them”. Why Apple chose AMD? Maybe prices, power consumption, price/performance ratio, easier to adapt to their hardware, who knows? But a company such as Apple (you can write the complete name, it won’t bite you) so adept at optimization doesn’t make these decisions lightly, they HAVE a reason, one that you *don’t know*, but that’s irrelevant. About the i5, a reason for the apparent lower specs must be because of how streamlined and optimized the OS is, instead of being made to work with zillions of combinations of brands, boards, peripherals. So what you want in hardware to cope with the software, was made achieved with the fat-free software. «Android is secure with the right Antivirus programs», well I guess any system is secure with the right Antivirus programs, isn’t it? but never 100%. How about a system that doesn’t need antivirus, just a little inteligence from it’s user? Android safe… yes, keep dreaming, it’s not as the net isn’t filled with cases of security holes and breaches of android. If you reply to my I advise you right now to not bringing ATI/Nvidia stupid nerdish arguments or sheep mentality, about mobile platforms and geekinesses like that, because I simply don’t have the patience.

Thank you, my hero :) 12/15/2016 Debapriyo Reply You are so dangerously biased towards Apple that some of your words make so sense and are outright stupid. I have no problems with you choosing an apple product but lol. You don’t use Google search engine? Then you are missing out. Their search engine is still the best and most reliable and miles ahead of other search engine options. Google Maps way better than Apple Maps. Every tiny feature Apple introduces in the new version of IOS, Google had it in android 2 years back. I myself love some Apple products and appreciate the high standards of quality they incorporate in their products but please don’t even compare Apple with Google. Apple just makes iphones, macbook and some fancy toys. Google makes much much more and is the spearhead of IT innovation today. Be a fanboy but don’t be an idiot. 06/23/2015 Chris H Reply Some of these reasons for being better than Android phones are oxymoronic. An extended warranty and readily available Apple Stores suggest that the iPhone is prone to bugs and damage. I will stick with my G3 because I know if I drop it it won’t shatter and I won’t have to give more money to Apple either for a case and/or a screen fix. There is a reason there aren’t Android stores out there. Because their phones don’t nearly have as many issues in my opinion. Consider Chevrolet and Honda. The Honda will last and is just as nice if not nicer than the Chevy, which will not last nearly as long and will force loyal customers to buy yet another Chevy. 07/27/2016 eiendiaies your_ufo Reply I would love to hear your comment now about your G3. Android stores are not because android companies dont give a f.ck about costumers, they just improve SPECS SPECS AND SPECS but where is NO improving quality. Why for example iphone 12 megapixel camera can beat sony xperia 23 megapixel camera, why iphone 1500 mah battery last longer than lg 3000mah, why fingerprint on iphone works much better than samsungs? And whats a practical difference between 640p vs 2k smartphone screen? Damn the real sheeps dont understand what apple cares about costumers and they stay at same screen resolutions because they just dont need to improve screens, android companies just keep adding numbers on specs. But where is quality improvment? You say iphone works better because of lower resolution screens, but than why androids keep improving resolutions but forget about older android users? I am ex samsung and LG user, rubbish costumer services, if android die than i must wait couple weeks for replacment, if somethin happen with iphone i know where is apple store and dealing with them in same day. Price stays high for iphone for a real reason. Iphone is not about SPECS, its about quality in every aspect. 09/30/2016 Linked Devices Reply The issue with iPhones that I hated was that the only way you could fix any glitch that would inevitably crop up is by factory resetting the phone each and every time. It’s such an annoying and time consuming process having to set everything back up again. When I made the switch to Android I was really impressed by how stable and self contained it was. Whenever there was a glitch it was limited to that particular app and you could simply reinstall it and it’d be fixed. I’ve never encountered any systemwide issues such as the iPhone misc storage bug that would happen to me all the time with the 6s. Apple does a great job hiding all of its glitches by simply not providing any prompts. Apps just disappear when they crash. It’s terrible. I know a lot of people with the misc storage bug to this day and don’t know it. They just think they’re out of space all the time because they need a new phone.. 09/30/2016 Linked Devices Reply I lol’d at how much superior the author thought the lightning cable was because it was reversible.

Some of these were acceptable reasons, but most were not. My wife is using an iPhone 6, and I have the Galaxy S6 edge. We both agree that my phone is far superior in terms of speed and screen resolution, but her camera, even being spec-deficient to my Android, seems as good as, or even better somehow. I like your point on the updates all rolling out at once, but almost every other “point” you made about iPhone being better boils down to one thing: lots of your friends have iPhones. That’s it. That’s the selling point, and the basis of this article. “iPhone apps look better.” – That’s completely relative. Lots of apps do look better, but they generally are paid apps that are free in the Play Store. “Works for all your devices” – So what? I thought this was a phone article. Android works with all your crap too. “No Carrier bundled apps” – I dont know how that’s a selling point, but okay, you win. Bloatware is an issue on android. “Sharing to other iPhones”/”Better resell” – Your friends all have them, so you should too. Then you can sell them to other friends who have older ones and make more money. Ridiculous. Yeah, you get a few more bucks for them, so that means you should have an inferior phone? Who buys a phone because of resale value? Preposterous. “Lightning cable is miles better” – My S6 charges from nothing to 40% in 10 minutes. iPhone can’t do that. I understand that the cable may be good, but “miles better” is a stretch. “Apple Stores” – So? I don’t even understand how this is a point in your article. Go to best buy, it’s the same crap. “Touch ID”/”Headphone controls” – Those both work flawlessly on a good number of high end android devices as well. “iMessage, Facetime, blah blah” / “Share apps easily” – All your friends have these, so you should too, or they’ll laugh at you. “Siri works better than Google Now” – Google Now isn’t Siri. That shouldn’t be a comparison. It’s not trying to be Siri. It’s a voice search, and that’s it. Siri works, but it doesnt work “better” than anything else, because there’s nothing to compare it to. If you like having Siri, good. “Notifications are better” – No, they’re not. Android’s notifications work exactly the same. Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying iPhone isn’t better, I’m just saying you haven’t proven that it is here in the slightest. Both OS’s are very well made, and the playing field is far more level than any avid IOS or Android user wants to admit. 07/30/2015 Helene Reply Excellent comment.

Bloatware is not really a problem on Android; any respectable company will only install commonly used and necessary apps like the Play Store and Gmail. If you are buying a phone that will leave your wallet intact (and still deliver better specs in every single measurable way than an iPhone 6, such as the lenovo k3 note) from a less known company which may allow bloatware, you can easily root the phone and uninstall it. I do agree with your other points, though! 05/27/2016 ZENCKPRI Reply Phinfankid you are completely right. I agree with everything you said. You are probably the only logical person who has commented so far. Also the iPhones storage is just a scam to keep people paying and buying more storage. Unfortunately the Samsung Galaxy s6 also removed the microsd slot, but luckily Samsung got it sh*t together with the Samsung s7, which in my opinion is the best phone. 07/12/2016 10beasts Reply You really explained the situation very well! Loved it. 07/09/2015 D Reply This article compares Apples to apples. Your references to Android are focused towards Samsung (you know the company that makes the screen, processor, RAM, and ROM in most Apple devices). Compared to a more vanilla Android experience, Apple blows. My $200 Zenfone 2 is better than any fruity phone at a third of the cost. With Apple, you pay more for less, but get a pointless logo. 07/10/2015 Scott Reply What about Apples different charger cords? Droids micro USB cords work with any other Android device. In fact, pretty much all phones but apple use it. They want you to need to buy new chargers more often. Apples are streamlined fads also, just like every product they’ve ever released.

In fact, iPhone is better than android….Because the mobile era is another thing, it’s called mobile for a reason. It should be easy to use and quick. That’s why Apple wins at this point…Come on get real men you wanna play GTA V on your mobile? No for sure. Apps are even better (which surprises me why it isn’t the same for a Mac vs Windows) iPhone’s are faster than most android phones….But if you compare it to stock original android phones, the iPhone still beats them but not as much as other android phones. Because unfourtantely Google didn’t know how to configure Linux properly but i bet you if it does…The iOS faster than android is a history….Linux is ultra-powerful and that’s why most of the world super computers use it…Because you can tweak it the way you like and you will get an extremely faster performance than Windows and Mac. But Google couldn’t handle it I guess….Even the Java language is much faster in terms of processing but I’m still surpsised why iOS apps are still faster….It’s just another replica of Nokia’s fault with Symbian (Nokia never built a stable Eco system for it until it’s near to death period, which led the CEO to get rid of Symbian because it takes years to built an eco system) 05/19/2016 PABLO Reply Right off the bat i can tell you are a little kid who just bought a samsung and is butt hurt you made the wrong choice, “struggles to do one stuff” he also pays great attention in class shown by how grammatically correct this is (as i was writing this I found this… “The iOS faster than android is a history” WHO TEACHES THIS KID I NEED TO COMPLAIN)! 08/04/2015 Robin Reply Poorly written article bringing in irrelevant points and downright false information. Take your “works great with all your devices” section for an example. I use an android phone and an apple computer, and the two devices are 100% compatible with no need for a “third-party application” or service. Completely untrue information in this section. Also I have texts and all the regular online messaging apps I use from both devices well synced. All data, photos, contacts, music, etc from my phone are stored in a cloud service and attainable through my mac computer and my (android) phone.

Here are 10 reasons you have apples for brains: Android is free, Google drive storage is FREE. 15 gig of files, unlimited photos! Androids voice recognition is WAY better, try a comparison, Siri is like a nagging wife who can’t get it right. Android phones have wireless charging! Android phones built in payment that works everywhere. Not at 3% of stores like Apple payment. Android phone MULTITASK, thats right you can run a dozen apps at the same time while talking. Android phones have sizable widgets, so you have live streaming info on your home screen. Android phones are available in endless formats, not like the communist way “everyone has the same”. Android phones PLAY ALL FILES, iphones only play Mp3’s from itunes etc etc pain in the Apple. Android phones have rapid charging, 10 min = 4 hours of use. Android phones are available with 2 days of battery. I could go on and on but your Apple brain will not listen anyways. You probably have a really nice typewriter that you show off the lack of it needing toner or electricity. There is a reason Android is about 82% of the market and Apple has fallen from 33 to about 12%… In fact the remaining iphone users I know all run Google everything on their iphone anyways, why not get the best hardware too.

And childish comparison . 09/16/2015 Srikanth Reply I can say something here because I own and use both iPhone 6 Plus and a Samusng Galaxy S6 edge equally everyday. So I think I am in a position to give a fair judgement …or at least decide what works better for me. I have changed over from iPhone as my default device to S6 edge and back to iPhone few times. But I find myself using iPhone 6 Plus more often than S6 Edge…because of these reasons 1. Smartphone is smart because of quality apps. I always found iOS apps looking neater, working smoother and more consistent compared to Android Apps. Just to quote an example…Adobe acrobat reader which i made default app to open PDF files….is not able to open files since last two days all of a sudden and reporting error. Everything is updated but still doesn’t work somehow. But works fine with iOS. 2. Screen of iPhone is marginally inferior to my S6 edge which is stunning. But I don’t hold them near my nose and try noticing pixels. From a practical point of view iPhone screen is absolutely fine. 3. In spite of inferior hardware specs on paper, I can’t deny iPhone user interface is more fluid and smooth. Thats what makes the experience more pleasant for me. 4. iPhone 6s is already launched…I am not upgrading. But know what? Last night iOS9 update was available to my phone. I have already updated to same. Isn’t that amazing? I can’t help comparing my Galaxy note 4, my near stock android Motorola droid turbo.. etc..which haven’t received even 5.1.1 Lollipop when Android Marshmallow is about to be launched in a month. Sad. This alone is enough for me to stick to iPhone as my default device. 5. I havent noticed parallels for some Apps in Android (Drafts, Soulver etc). Which I learnt to use often and liked. I am a fan of some automation apps like Tasker on android which doesnt have an iOS equivalent. But as of now my use of same is less. 6. I guess iOS is bit more secure compared to android against virus attacks and hacking. it IS something important to me in this era of mobile banking and when we keep so much data on Google drive and One Note etc. and hey…Google has made most of its apps available to iOS. I agree my S6 edge is superior in Camera department and pictures look very good. Also usage of widgets is better in android. But after using both OS since last 3-4 years, I am sticking with iPhone as my default and S6 edge for miscellany and photos. This is what works for me. I know others have other reasons to stick to any one OS. I have best of both worlds now but can’t help saying one is better than other at present. 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply Updates are an invalid point, because the newest version of iOS isn’t as good as a 2 three year old version of Android 12/02/2015 Srikantha Krishna Reply I don’t agree with you there. Updates are important. They optimise the software, remove bugs and important to plug security issues. Of course Google releases them but only nexus customers get it. Other manufacturers don’t release it in time. Tell me now how many handsets are going to get Marshmallow and when???? 04/25/2016 Sally Fallis Reply So which is less complicated for the over-50 me who is good with words but not pictures? I had to ask a young person what all those little dots and waves, etc., meant on my Ipod Touch. I really miss words, but I realize I am alone in that. Is a Samsung any easier to navigate for (duhhh…) me? 07/11/2016 Iggy Z Reply If you are over 50 you should definitely stick with Apple 1. it is extremely easy to use 2. you can do many tasks without even doing anything, but simply telling your phone to wake you up at 5am, or to remind you to take your pills when you get home 3. you can change the text size and icon size to accommodate your eye-sight 4. you can ask any teenager to help you organize the icons into more intuitive way Microsoft Windows phones are rich on words, but while it would satisfy your need for everything being written – the phone will be difficult to use, and will still contain many icons. So, go with Apple, even an older 16GB model, will still be fully supported, and will work perfectly well, do not get 64GB version, you wont need all that memory. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply but apple is expensive 08/25/2016 ermm Reply with android it is much easier to use… you can tell your phone to set and alarm….you can change the text size 01/10/2017 Frank McConnell Android is an absurd ecosystem, the UI is very hard to even remember, iOS is better due to the simplicity of the UI. OP was right about iPhones being easy, I use one because android is hard to use. Maybe you should get an iPhone, it’s 5x faster than every android phone in the world and you’ll get a good one on eBay for like $200! Why do you think Google is better on iOS than on android. lel, Android is a joke OS and should be defunct! 10/15/2015 Andras Reply I´ve been an iPhone user for 2 years, recently I bought an Android phone to verify if really Android is superior… After 2 months of testing it, I sell the Android and bought an iPhone 6… This do not prove that iPhone is better, but for my needs, iPhone is totally superior… Android is good, everything is cheap but is not an stable OS… Yes you can have all personalize, but for what? I´m not a teenager anymore so whats the point to have all personalized and change it every week? By the way the output of the sound of the iPhone is really more superior than the output of any Android phone With an iPhone (in music business) is way better you can control lights, console really simple with iPhone and all tech for music is much more easy to sync and to handled on an iPhone… Music business in a MAC is much much easier I love iPhone and I would not change it anymore Like I said I´m not saying iPhone is better for everyone but for my needs yes it is 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply Wow! You’re actually dumber than every other I sheep here. IPhone has good sound? Better than any Android? Hahahahahahaha! Have you even seen an HTC One phone? Best speakers and any phone! Ever. IPhone speaker is tinny garbage. The S6 even has the same placement, but sounds much better. Seriously, Google HTC One m8 or m9. Cm8 literally got the top phone of 2014, and everyone mention how good the speakers work. I also got first place cuz it was vastly superior to any iPhone. Better software, better design, better screen, etc 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply And please specify what Android phone it was. Otherwise I’ll assume you’re lying because there are so many and you can’t name one. Or you got a cheaper old one. Android high end phones are very stable. Look it up. They’re way more stable than iOS 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply Signed, someone who has never used Viper4Android. Seriously, I can’t stomach the sound output of very many phones without it. Only a few Androids that have nice customized audio processing(like the LG V20) and no iPhones or Windows phones. Many of the rest of Androids can use this superior sound mod. I have a Nexus 6P with Pure Nexus and ElementalX kernel, which has nice front firing speakers, better than iPhones. V4A gives audio processing to match. Not available on iPhones or Windows Phones. 10/17/2015 Tushar Reply Why r u only talking about iphone 6plus,which is much costlier than androide same feature phones, there are some other iphones had launched by apple like iPhone5, 5s,5c i compare this phones whith 20000 rs android phones where battery of iphones so worst and camera and no memory slot, nevertheless this iphones have more cost than android phones. 10/19/2015 Lu Reply LOL you will not get confused using a LIGHTNING cable? are you kidding me????????? Does this mean that it is designed for dumb people who constantly flip the usb port? is this the main reason! why apple cant for some reason jussssssssssssssssst go with the flowwwwwwwwwwwwwww and use a normal USB port that makes it easier for all humans in the world to share chargers? Dude, i use both systems and i can point out one thing better that most people usually ignore, my Father is blind, he uses an iPhone because tbh the Voice-over mode for iPhone is the best ive seen and used so far.

Its like we intentionally left out carrier costs, the limited gb storage that iphones have And dont even get me started on “no company bundled apps”. Do you know how much tracking, data mining even occurs with an iphone? Fingerprint bypass? Are u srs? The iphone is for the general public who doesnt know any better just following ignorantly what is popular culture. Android = Professional industry Iphone= uneducated general public facade 07/11/2016 Iggy Z Reply yeah, tell that to all my banker friends who make millions and choose Apple to be the secure choice for the data exchange and storage, go “personalize” your phone, show them all how individual you are, myspace was definitely better than stupid facebook where you cannot “personalize,” so ignorant right? 11/14/2015 GET REAL Reply A PHONE IS A PHONE 12/09/2015 I phones all the way Reply Umm androids suck, I phones are more high tech and aren’t as slow 12/15/2015 jj Reply Android…LOL, joke. 12/26/2015 juststephen250 Reply Are you Sirious?

All the successful people I know use an iPhone. The only credible alternative in business to an iPhone would be a BlackBerry running BB10. Android devices are for the unemployed and vagrants. Thankfully I don’t know anyone with an Android phone. I don’t want to either! Please only contact me if you use an iPhone and have a job / home. I don’t want be associated with anyone that uses an Android. It would make me look bad. Thanks. 03/03/2016 Jack Reply The fact that u say “Android devices are for the unemployed and vagrants”, just ticks me off. You are what I like to call a dumb ass like every kid I know. You only choose an Iphone because every one else has an Iphone, if not you would of picked android and said Iphones suck, you also don’t even know how technology works bitch, so I would not be talking because there are far more android devices with better specs, and fyi i’m a kid obviously i’m not employed. 04/22/2016 Derp Reply Well then maybe you didnt know what a high end android phone is.. Poor you. 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply This post is what makes you look bad. 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply Also, aside from your arrogance making you look bad, you have got to be kidding about BlackBerry. I carried the Z10 now carry the Passport with BB10. I only have it because my company prefers BB’s security. But as far as fuctionality, it’s like working with bear skins and stone knives compared to iPhone or Android. The lack of apps and limited integration with other devices is stifling. That’s why I carry a separate personal phone. It’s also why BB is abandoning BB10 and switching to an Android platform. So are you going to cast off your somewhat acceptable friends who carry BlackBerry when their platform becomes Android? They better run out and get an iPhone when that happens so they can still be honored to be deemed worthy of your friendship. 07/11/2016 Iggy Z Reply 1. Android they switch to is FULLY custom and has all google services BLOCKED 2. This is the reason why companies are abandoning BlackBerry due to high maintenance costs and instead make private applications for iPhones which you can only download using a special code, a secure application within a secure platform, cheaper to maintain, more convenient for an employee to use. I completely agree with Bob, Androids are for 12 year olds and vagrants, the paper specs of Androids (factually and historically) are not an indicator of how they perform. And the fact that you think that you are smarter than a mass of hard working high ranking professionals, and that you need to show them all how “individual” you are by always “personalizing” your phone – just shows you are a fool and have nothing to do but to play with yourself on your phone like a kid, I bet you are one of those people who thinks wearing a watch is stupid and unmanly because you have a clock on your phone. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply ur insulting me cos im twelve so dont try piggy 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply You guys keep proving how Apple markets to ignorant people with a credit card. Reason many companies don’t use Android is because of the differences in OS customization from device to device and manufacturer to manufacturer. That can be a nightmare for testing in house apps. Nothing to do with security. My company uses Android tablets, but all the same kind. Only point you are right about is specs don’t reflect performance. Nexus/Pixel devices have good specs, not the best, but just try finding a faster Android or iPhone, for that matter. Why? Stock Android that hasn’t been bastardized. 01/17/2016 Grace Reply I use an iPhone, but custom built my own PC. I don’t like Android phones (had a Samsung galaxy for a year before switching back) but I also don’t like Apple computers. Honestly? What people buy is a matter of taste.

LOSER! 03/23/2016 sheel r shah Reply This article is so immature and stupid. Seriously, apps look better? You couldn’t even come up with a better reason?? I can literally break this article point by point. I would just like to say one thing though as a rebuttal, A NEXUS too receives the ota updates. An iPhone 64gb on contract costs almost the same as a carrier free nexus. I am a galaxy s7 user and the screen quality is maybe 2 generations over the iphone. As for the notifications, I prefer android’s iteration way more than apples. And about the cables, except the s7, all flagships use USB type c Samsung compensates with wireless charging. The battery life on a nexus or an s7 edge is way superior than the iPhone. And hangout video quality is as good as facetious. Also I like the fact that you don’t need to get out of hangouts to make a video call. In iphone you can usee iMessage but then to make a video call you need to get out and go to facetime. I get to play with manual controls on my camera which iphone doesn’t permit. I can literally go all day long about this. Just one actual good point about iphone you could have mentioned instead of the trash is that it has a stronger graphic processor that but by a small margin. 03/23/2016 sheel r shah Reply One more thing. You mentioned sharing. Do you feel ashamed that you cannot share media via Bluetooth?? The most basic mode of sharing? Talking about airdrop please use wifi direct once. Or nfc sharing. 03/28/2016 Stanata Reply Basically what this article is saying is: “use iPhone instead of Android – it’s more easy to use if you’re an idiot!”… lol There isn’t even one reason of those in the article that is 100% true… and almost all of them are complete crap! I mean come on – even monkey can plug MicroUSB and it is “a must” standard in Europa for instance anyway. Let alone that the future is in the wireless charging… And who today is NOT using Viber or WhatsApp? Who needs another messenger? I can continue, but don’t see point in that – the articles like this is obviously paid one. But sooner or later it will be clear at the end – the open environment will always be above the close one, because it is more close to the people!

It’s a Huawei, nice BIG screen I guess they call a Phablet. My younger son has an iPhone 6 plus. I decided to try an iPhone 5s just to see what it’s like. I have 30 days to check it out. So far, the ONLY thing see is the slow motion camera that’s cool and maybe some cuter emogies …I think they’re called. Otherwise….. I’m so far not impressed. My Huawei Android is 16g the iPhone 5s is 16g. The Huawei was I think $200 and the 5s $160 with its VERY tiny screen. My son has a 6 plus and 64g and that would cost me $650 or maybe it’s $650 for the6 plus 16g. Anyway…. Lots MORE MONEY. I guess if you have a lot of music… It’s better but I just have Lots of pictures. I like my sd card for these. I don’t know all the techy stuff and I don’t do Twitter or FaceTime or sharing pics except Facebook and text. I thought maybe some apps would be cooler but so far… I’m not impressed with the iPhone at all.

The iOS Is custom built for and iPhone but the android softwares are not built for any particular device or hardware so optimisation is nog as good as in an Apple device. It not about specs the camera which shas more megapixels cannot alone deliver better pictures , a processor with more cores and greater clock speed can not alone give better performence until it utilises the most of it. So as Apple builds it products to its own requirements and deliver better products than android phones. An iPhone has better quality of internals as well as the body and feels premium than its competitors so that’s why an iPhone is an iPhone. 04/26/2016 De'Zsa Smith Reply Currently on my iPhone 6s+, sobbing as I type this. I’ve just got through longingly browsing Google’s Playstore, seeing all the recent updates of my favorite apps and hidden gems that the Apple Store just cannot compete with. Android has some seriously dedicated developers, and I’ve always admired them and even began looking into Android app development. That is… Until I switched over to iPhone several months ago after being a dedicated Android user. I will always be Team Android, hands down. I had a rooted Nexus 5, which means I’m all about customizability, design, testing, flexibility, and freedom. Then I decided I wanted to try something new—FaceTime, great camera, updated social apps like snapchat…you know, the basics. Biggest. Mistake. Ever. Switching over to Apple feels like I’m using a flip phone. Now I’m trying to decide if I should just switch back, or keep this iPhone as a means of communication (don’t know if I’m willing to give up FaceTime with family and friends) and have an Android for all the things I miss. 04/27/2016 weez Reply I just giggle at these articles. Ok Iphone kids, my phone has a webhost, tftp server, a windows deploy share with every iteration of windows going back to w2000, an SMB client, FTP client and host, Tftp server, wi-fi signal scanner, packet sniffer(nmap), a high frequency oscilloscope, a bluetooth HID remote that controls anything bluetooth, a linux/android debugger, point of sale and inventory tracking software(apple has it too but not complete on the phone), and at will I can change my MAC and spoof other phone’s IDs. My phone is a half decade old S2. So I guess if you plan on propping up a desk buy an Iphone, for everyone else that has work to do either grab a toolkit full of different things or just grab your android phone. 04/28/2016 Ken McDowell (@morpheusxp) Reply I don’t understand why it is all Android users say that iPhone users are sheep and that they use an iPhone because everyone else uses an iPhone. The iPhone has less than 20% market share world wide. That means less than 1 in 5 smartphone users have an iPhone. It seems to me going with the herd is more of an Android thing than an iOS thing. Just saying… 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply I think it is more because a lot of iPhone users seem cultic. I honestly think iPhone is a high quality product. But I really like high end Androids as well. However, I know people who use only Apple products and make little comments here and there about how inferior ALL Androids are. In that way I think they are like sheep because they have bought into this notion that their are no good Androids and they are operating on a higher plan than non-iPhone users. 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Agreed. Probably because in the beginning people lined up outside of stores to get the latest and greatest iphone. It’s great hardware, but I can’t get used to a single button. Plus iphones seem to have a higher resale value. I don’t know. I do like how apple updates their devices in a timely manner and no bloatware, etc. I think Android is getting there, but unless it’s a nexus, updates are all over the place. I want the screen of a Samsung, build of an HTC with the battery life of my droid turbo, a headphone jack at the bottom of the phone instead of the top and I would be in heaven. Plus everyone I know say is that a Galaxy? So people in my area associate anything android as a Galaxy. Great marketing by Sammy, but perception becomes reality sometimes. 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply Meant to say plane, not plan. ☺ 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply Yup, it is about the Apple cult and the attitude that you are unwashed and not worthy if you use an Android. The attitude you must be broke, homeless, etc. My Android costs as much as a lower range current iPhone and can do way more. Here in the US, they have much greater market share, unfortunately. 04/28/2016 Joe Reply iphone has nothing on android. They have a good camera but that is about it. isheep all butthurt because android is taking over the world. 04/30/2016 qwertypop13 Reply So far all my favourite android apps were not available on ios, plus a lot of apps are a minimum of 10 cent cheaper on gpl than on apple app store. I also find it totally ridiculous that iphones need to be jailbroken to undergo any form of customization. Plus who wants fast updates at the expense of severe bugs, them slowing down stuff even more and getting a crappy operating system that hasnt changed since 5 years. Iphones are for people that only use their phones to txt and make calls. ps. I have a $20 alcatel phone and wouldnt ever trade it for an iphone. Buy what you like, but the points on this website are the worst I have ever seen. As far as I know you cant even use iphones to transfer files other than audio and photos to and from macs/pc’s. Apple phones are overpriced by like $500 dollars just because they have a flashy logo which they stole from the beatles. 05/05/2016 anthony Reply I love my android devices. Have I had problems. Yes. More than my wife’s iphone? Definitely. But I tinker with it a lot more than her iphone. I transfer files back and forth from a computer a lot easier with my device. Yes using third party apps but it’s still easier. I have all my music in google play, but use itunes (whole family uses ipods) so I just sync up that to google music and playlists as well. Each device has it’s pros and cons. I have used a rooted tablet to get pure android (didn’t like it) and have an ipad 2 which I love. It’s about choice and I like that we have it. Two points I agree with the author about: Timely updates and bloatware. HTC is bucking the trend to stay afloat by addressing this. Wireless charging is not worth it yet. I much prefer quick charging and new devices starting to roll out with usb-c. 05/07/2016 C Reply The article and ensuing comments are a joke. This is what The internet has come to now days. Let me be clear, I have years and years of experience with Android, IOS, Windows & Linux. I have every certification and more hours logged on to these then most of you. Now that we have established my far superior ability to actually comment here goes. First of all, the people on this blog and on others like it simply cannot help the fact that more people love iphone than android, period. So they make nasty little comments because they are frustrated that in reality they couldnt influence people in high school and they aren’t able to now. Second the android users who get angry at Apple users simply appear to only be mad because they don’t have an iphone them selves. Guys! Really! Let me be clear I have Windows and android and iOS. Iphone for the nomal every day user is PERFECT! Let them be! The android is perfect for more shady people who want to be power users an anarchists or some how feel like they are breaking the law or the rules. That is how android feels and that’s the base line of the os. I currently have an android because I can be one of those more shady people who like to go against the grain. But I don’t like android. Who the he’ll wants to root a phone? Who wants to spend hours on doing something? Not I! It takes me 10 minutes to jail break an Apple as and BAM I’m a super users with a linux based system and am sitting with a very powerful device! They all being said I have an android bc of expandable memory, an IR blaster, and a few other small features. When Apple steps up the game with these I will switch to Apple. Here is one reason why. What is a smart device? It is an item created to make your life as a human eaiser. Apple does that by leaps and bounds! The phone thinks of you like a loyal old dog and wants to do nothing more than serve your every whim. I can tell you the iphone holds up better, know why? Ever had to fix your mom or dads PC? And you think to your self wth are they doing with this thing. We never hear that issue out of iphone. So really is a beast just for that reason alone simply bc the general population can break them by doing stupid stuff. Now on to adress some other stupid comments for people who pretend they are SO smart. Windows is better than a Mac ios! Hum WRONG! Know why? Windows is a dos based crap system with a gui created for the average consumer to use a device. It’s not a damn computer it’s a pretty device to help you numb skulls use paint and word or get on the internet. What is my point now!! Oh yet MAC IOS is FAR superior at least for anyone who actually knows how to use Linux which by the way was and still is the base os on which all other smart software was and still is created. So you pretty little Windows fanboy users, please get a grip because until you stop drooling over your poster size photo of Bill gates and actually learn Linux you know nothing about computing. The really dumb person who commented about Honda’s vs Chevys! Hahaha seriously though? You also probably know nothing right? Honda and GM use the exact same part manufactures which in turn makes both cars CRAP! Research before you comment. Go get what ever phone you want and fanboys of each need to get a grip! 05/29/2016 C Reply Just to clarify a few things for the “people who pretend they re SO smart” Windows has been detached from DOS since windows 2000, It maintains compatibility by running an DOS virtual machine on the NT Kernel. Not all systems are based on Linux, Linux is based on Unix, Mac OS (and IOS) is largely based on BSD which is a variant of UNIX, The Windows Micro-kernel is also partly based on UNIX. For someone who has “years and years of experience with Android, IOS, Windows & Linux.” and “every certification and more hours logged on to these then most of you” you are spreading a lot of misinformation. I personally own all apple products, but have and still use the other platforms, They all have their advantages and downfalls. And although I use a Mac, Ipad and Iphone predominantly I still have moments of frustration when I miss windows, android and linux for one reason or another. 05/29/2016 CC Reply Not the same “C” as above btw 05/18/2016 Nikhil Bansal Reply Great Information.

But when it comes to the games the android will never be smooth as Apple or faster the performance in apple will always be better. But android will only have a bit better graphics because of its amoled technology 06/02/2016 Jacob Reply If you wanted to make this a fair comparison you’d compare it against Vanilla Android so it’d be the Nexus 6p and immediately your points about bloatware and cable become invalid. Also, how can you say apple doesn’t come with bloatware? Have you tried removing the stocks app recently? What about file sharing, have you never heard of Android Beam? Or the fact almost every flagship has a fingerprint scanner now? This is the most poorly written, one sided piece of crap I’ve seen in a long time. How do you even have a job? P.s. I own a Nexus 6p for private use and iPhone 6s Plus for work and they’re pretty much equal in every way except for the Nexus having a better screen, free apps, faster charging and longer battery life. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply +1 lol 06/03/2016 alpharidley9098 Reply This article made me laugh pretty hard. I just love the reasons they give for the phone being better. Now 1 thing that is always MORE important than ALL of these is the actual phone. Also, those apps that come with the phone, it depends on what you are getting… Also, you do know apple is making a switch to MicroUSB right? Humph. Seems like just in this 1 paragraph I have already made better points than this article. Anyways, phone-wise, androids are almost always more powerful than an apple phone because of the fact that iPhones are never equip with a good core or a good amount of RAM. They slow down quite quickly and seem obsolete after a few months. Yes. Months. I have had my Moto G3 for awhile and it is still ultra fast and has no technical issues. 06/03/2016 Jens Lipponer Reply problem with iphones is that u need itunes etc.. and too many permissions. I like to just plug in and drag and drop files…. I don’t give a monkey’s behind whether apps look better or what not. let’s be honest, price wise the iphone is beaten every time. there is just no bang for buck.

It seems obvious to me. At least Android screens don’t break when you drop the phone on carpet like iPhone’s do. There’s Applecare because the iPhones break like a window hit by a baseball because the whole phone is either thin aluminum or covered in glass (which is a hazard if the glass shards cut you and potentially make you bleed out). The aluminum iPhone’s are currently being made of bend in your pocket! They’ll need some high quality flexible glass and easily bent straight CPU (without anything on the inside being destroyed). By the way, for the vibration thing on Android you don’t have to input password or anything just click the power button and hold down the turn down volume button for a second or two and that’s it. 06/10/2016 Shaggy C Reply So your reasoning is half “It’s popular” and most the other half is comparing apple features to the bad features of a multitude of android phones?

It could be called Android or robot or Apple or peaches or dog poo. All I care about is having a good phone that can do the most. Phones are expensive. I’m not buying a brand name. I’m looking to buy something that has everything it could possibly have if I’m going to spend that kind of money. You’re “reasons” show good things about IPhone, but are not “reasons” as to why it’s better. IPhones are good phones. People like IPhones because it’s a trend. It’s popular. That’s it. IPhones are not even close to androids. Be truthful. Androids are mini-computers. Literally. IPhone is not. You can do 100 more things with Android that you cannot do with IPhone. The That is the truth. And Apple products are a lot more expensive. Why would anyone pay more for a phone that gives you less? It boggles my mind. Android has variety. There are many, many phones, companies, styles to choose from. They even offer cheaper options that get the job done. They have an SD card slot. Why would anyone dish out $100’s more for more storage? That SD card is yours forever. For future phones or other devices. You can plug your phone into your computer and save(on the phone or SD card) anything (music, photo’s, video’s, contacts) and it’s yours. Without having to go through ITunes or anything else. Apple doesn’t own my stuff. I own it. And I can customize anything I own. There are IPhone stores for these little nick knacks. Transferring files, contacts, etc. It’s like going to a car dealership. One side has a variety of great cars. The other side has one car that is the most expensive. You see that all the other cars have a ton of features, options, colors to choose from, engines, horse power, cylinders, 2-door, 4-door, SUV’s etc. You ask “what’s so great about this lonely more expensive car tht only comes in one model and doesn’t have these other options?” The saleman replies with “Because it’s popular”. 07/06/2016 Gretchen Alexander Reply Yes, this!

I have two iPhones now, a 5 and a 6, that I can’t get my photos off of onto my PC laptop. I’ve gone into the Crapple store more than three times and still haven’t gotten them off. My idea of HELL is the Crapple store! I hate that place. There’s hardly room to stand and then you end up being sat at a table waiting with a bunch of other frustrated people waiting for a tech to help you. Of course this is after you make an appointment, or in my case last time, two appointments. I don’t see that as a plus at all because not only is going there a royal pain in the ass, but then they don’t even offer much help after several hours. My iPhone does not recognize as a drive when I plug it into my PC. It used to, and then stopped. I don’t want to have to use iTunes to transfer photos or music. I want to just plug it in and have it be a drive and copy whatever files I like back and forth. It does not work; and I’ve spent, literally, hours trying to get it to function that way. I also have a pretty complex DSLR camera and yet it is still easy as can be to transfer the photos from the memory card onto the computer. So why can’t a supposedly user-friendly phone just do the same thing? I seriously hate my iPhone 6 so much I wanted to shoot it, except I discovered it’s worth a good bit of money still so I’ll sell it on ebay. 07/09/2016 Joey Reply A lot of childish responses from android fans here. I gave the nexus 6p and try for 2 months after my old iPhone broke. Hardware was great, but I found on this android phone the app integration and interoperability to be no where near as good as an iPhone. Apple is just better when it comes to form and function. Buy an android if you want to tweak it forever and play in a sandbox, buy and iPhone if you need a productive phone. 07/10/2016 Colin Reply Your comment may not be childish but it is not correct. Comparable Android phones have far better form and function. Take the iPhone 6s plus verses a Note 5 or s7 Edge. The Apple is bigger and heavier yet packs has a smaller or same sized screen as the Samsung’s’ yet has far less features. Both these phones are far more productive, can multi-task properly, be fully customized and allow widgets on lock and home screens for speed, convenience and ease of use. The Note even includes a stylus or pencil. Great compact design, fully featured and greater functionality (Android) vs Heavy outdated bloated hardware with mid-range specs and limited functionality (IOS). Not to forget the limited compatibility of iPhones and lack of choice! 07/10/2016 Chris Reply There are facts, then there are opinions. 07/10/2016 Colin Reply This article is a disgrace, misleading at best. Most of the reasons are just not true or highly debatable. 07/12/2016 Benito Paul Reply congratulation all of u commented on weather iphone or android’s is the best In my point of view it may be any phone that is android or iphone. If we had a phone that should meet our requirements.Requirements means each and every people has different requirements in case of security,memory capacity and so and so. Hence apple or iphone buy any thing because all are vanity, “vanity of vanities” 07/14/2016 aileen Reply I’m someone who switched from android to ios but this article is utter bullshit. Yes, I love my iPhone and i’m so glad I switched by my samsung galaxy 4 was nothing but shit lately but these arguments in the article are dumb as hell. Lightning is better than micro usb? excuse me, what? my iphone takes ages to charge (iphone 6) whereas my s4 charged within an hour. i don’t see how that makes micro usb bad. but well my iphone battery lasts over a day and my old phone could have never. sharing location isn’t hard on android since almost everyone uses whatsapp bc imessage doesn’t exist on android and whatsapp has a location sharing option so that argument was dumb. yes, apps do look prettier on ios but i don’t see how only that would be a reason to switch?? this article clearly comes from someone who has only owned apple devices and doesn’t even know what they’re talking about, if you really want to prove a point you need to ask someone who has used BOTH of the things you’re trying to compare otverwise you’re just gonna embarass yourself. just saying. 07/20/2016 KappaPride Reply Why are you guys even arguing about this? 07/24/2016 George Reply The major advantage iOS has over Android is that Apple designs the phone and software. Whereas for Android (open source) other manufacturers have to play with it to get it to work and sometimes it’s not fluid. Take the Nexus phones for example…they just work like the iphones. No bloatware..nothing (like the iphone). Majority of my friends have iPhones and sometimes I wish I did too because of MMS (iMessage). I used both and I hate that i have to use itune for everything but it is what it is I guess. 07/24/2016 Landry Reply I’m 8 years experimented developer for iOs devices and I say that Apple releases so frequent updates because iOs is just a stone age OS to fool iOs users that Apple works seriously behind their products. It must run to compete Android OS. 07/27/2016 Aza Reply Best to have both. I have an Se and G4 best of both worlds 07/30/2016 Bob Reply So many things piss me off in this article but specifically stood out Notifications I have no idea with this author is saying he obviously hasn’t seen an android phone, they are exactly the same. Lightning vs. Micro-USB Micro-USB usually charges everything from headphones, to power banks, and of course cell phones. And multiple times to insert it is an absurd comment, after about a week you’ll probably memorize which way it goes, and how do you insert it incorrectly more than once. And USB type-C is just starting to come to the mainstream that’s why it’s not on everything. Storage Why do people even buy the 128 GB version, not to get apps but to download media like pictures, videos, music, etc. I agree with the statement about how sd cards are treated but there’s a much more simple solution, buy a larger storage option. Sharing purchased content Sign into the play store with the account that originally bought the content, install it, then sign out. Problem solved, and if anyone says “it’s more convenient” think about how often you might actually purchase something that costs actual money, I’ll bet it’s probably less than once a week. And it doesn’t take long to sign in and then back out 08/14/2016 Adso Rossi Reply I love iPhones. They always have nice designs and I like the simple interface. I have been itching to get an SE with its smaller dimensions (I like small phones). Money is not a problem to me but as much as I really want one I will stick with my Android device. Why? Cause the compatibility of iPhones to Windows pcs are real bad or none. You’d say “get a Mac” but I can’t: too many programs I need that unfortunately are only Windows-available. If this one single point of compatibility would be addressed, the iPhone becoming as compatible as Androids, I would get that iPhone SE in a heartbeat! 08/21/2016 nathanlittles plays minecraft Reply Who the hell needs iPhone I can name 100 reasons why Android is better but I’ll just name 20 1. Freedom 2. Apk 3. More sizes 4. More colours 5. Waterproof phones 6. Big and small tablets instead of the HUGE iPad 7. Clear cache option 8. For apps and also all the app store apps 9. No need for jailbreak but if you root you’re device will have no restrictions :D 10. Notification swipe 11. Google now 12. Google maps instead of the crappy apple maps 13. Multiple users feature 14. SD card storage So you don’t run out of storage easily like on the 16 gig iPhones (128GB or even 256GB) 15. Pattern unlock 16. There’s everything on Google play store even GPS spoofers to do the Pokémon go spoof in like 2 seconds 17. Unknown sources option 18. No need for an apple I’d all you need is a Google account which is way easier to set up and use 19. Get apps that are not out in your country easier (Pokémon go) 20. Android sounds better then apple 08/22/2016 Jim Reply This article made me so angry I must go punch a kitten. It’s an interesting psychological phenomenon, our emotional ties to brand loyalty. It’s as if the device we choose to use says something about who we are as people, and there is some ancient war of two types of people being waged through our genetics. Apple users are like Yankee fans, Android users are the goth kid outsiders. And the war rages on. 08/30/2016 Deleau Clément Reply Hi. Please kill yourself.

Like, the notifications. Android is wayyy better. You clear all at once or swipe. It combines like notifications that you can separate. It allows to interact with the notification and app without opening it and its just, way simpler and cleaner. 09/10/2016 Nigel Nderi Reply Let me settle this. Choose an iPhone if you are incompetent or are ok with a company controlling you’re phone completely. Choose an Android if you want to be able to enjoy the latest technologies and can competently manage it’s abilities without whining that it takes more than half a brain cell to use. 09/11/2016 Josh Mcduff Reply Just read all the comments and wow it’s all he said she said. I’ve had my Nexus 6p which btw one poster said it’s Google made nope huewei or whatever. Point is not the same, for about a year now and I’m now getting the iPhone 7. Are the specs pretty damn similar? Yes alot of the same features? Yes update often? Yes Nexus gets all the Android ones first like Apple. Price? Actually the 7 is less than the Nexus by about 150.00 CAD sooo that defeats the argument about price… Just saying. I love my Nexus but I’m open to changing. Ice bounced back and forth alot between Android and iOS can I say one is superior to the other? Absolutely not it all comes down to does it do what I want it to and can I afford it. 09/12/2016 Lee Reply All good and well people love free stuff but free stuff comes with a price of selling your info to the uncontrollable thirst party. iPhone also offer easy printing option than android you have to download something that will ask you to upgrade by paying just to use your printer no way! Also iPhone helps stop third party apps that try to use your phone making phone calls example if you are searching for nearest restaurant Google will show the call number to the same restaurant but when you try to call instead of calling direct the parasite apps like whatsaapp, text… And more they pop up asking you to use them making a call while they can’t function without your service they bug you each time taking away the time you spend trying to make a call. If you’re in a hurry and these app try to suggest you use it think how buggy this is. The same applies to text messages. 09/15/2016 Jada Reply Have u really owned an android? There are many many more possibilities and helpful apps that came with my galaxy s7 edge and i love it alot! So many more features and charging is so much faster and the battery life is amazing 09/15/2016 Ryan Reply You are a stupid retard Apple isn’t better than android. Apple has had to recall their product so many times because people died from the battery exploding. And with Apple every 3rd phone they stop making updates for it. Android always has updates for their products. Plus Apple owes the government 37 billion dollars Android doesn’t. The iPhone 7 that is coming out is a total ripoff. They copied Samsung. Apple has never made a crack resistance screen and a waterproof phone. Samsung is simply better. 09/17/2016 Rob Doyle Reply I completely am for people having their own opinion, that being said I disagree with the title of this article. That being said without any bias coming into play here, some of the points that the author was trying to make aren’t true or aren’t completely true. 1. “Works with all your devices”… The real title should be works better with all of your APPLE devices. The examples in the article are all apple examples. The author obviously has no experience with android or windows. 2. “Faster Updates”…. Compared to what android device? You can’t just say that Iphones get updates faster and compare that to all android phones. The way that this section was written made it sounds like the day an update is release for Android, nine of there phones get it immediately like the iPhones… this just isn’t true. If you have a nexus you get updates as they are released (just like and iPhone) There is a bunch of other examples that just show the author has no experience with android devices, I’m just going to keep this short. People will choose what they think is best for them. My issue is with the author, not the opinion. All the argument were completely based on opinion and not facts. People are going to read this and take it all as fact, instead of doing research and finding the right device for them. 09/18/2016 Jonathan Masters Reply I have both an iPhone 5 and a Galaxy S7. While there are some advantages to the iPhone, there are several reasons why I just can’t make a permanent switch. First, no home screen widgets (like my calendar and agenda). Sure, you can add something like that to the notifications screen, but that involve swiping, as opposed to right on the home screen. Second, it’s so difficult — even annoying — trying to organize files on the iPhone. On an Android, it operates exactly like a computer should (and our phones really are computers these days), with folders, subfolders, etc., so you can just copy the files to where you want them for later use. You can’t do that on an iPhone, where all of your files go to some mysterious and deep “collection” on the phone. If Apple were to add those two features, then I’d happily switch away from Android. 09/21/2016 de Coulon Thierry Reply I wanted to try an iPhone, so I got an old one. I could simply not install anything because everything on the AppStore has moved to iOS > 7. I could not bring a single file to the phone. All it would do is sync with iTunes on my Mac, but there is nothing to sync because I don’t use this Mac for everyday life. The iPhone I got did not have any smart way to save battery. The iPhone I got could not play any of my music because a) I could not upload it and b) I could not install anything that would play ogg files. The iPhone I got was heavier, thicker and less good looking than my current Sony. So OK it was an old iPhone, but 90% of what I say would be true for the latest iPhone, and at what price! If you live in the Apple world, then an iPhone is probably the logical choice. I live in the Linux world and now I know I’ll never take another look at an iPhone. 09/24/2016 Jim Washko Reply Worldwide stats – Android users 82% vs IOS users 18% There’s not enough votes to even tilt the scale towards IOS being better. Being as the story indicates Android phones are only good for 2 years that makes them more expensive. How can IOS users explain why 82% of the market would rather pay more for less?, if that were in fact true. Iphone offers less control, poor resoluion, no expandable memory and not all phones can share the same apps. Android offers all of it as well as compatible with Windows whcih is currently at 80% of the market share. This is like comparing the Yugo to Prius. Sure the Yugo is cheaper at first, but after a year of so, not so much. Iphone resale is more, but that will drop due to fewer and fewer users as they get tired of the box of crayons with only black and white as an option. when they can get the box of 64 and a sharpener 09/24/2016 Capi Reply Is this all a big joke? You keep saying “iPhone is better than Android” about ten times in the article, like a mantra we have to learn and assimilate, Am I the only one who noticed this? I have and iPad, and iMac and I used iPhone (4, 4s and 5) I am familiar with both iOS and OSX but actually I have an Android and installed Windows 10 on my iMac. OSX is a good system if you like simple and easy interfaces, I don’t really have any problem with it, is a really good system once you learn to do things that are diferent with Windows, like formating drives with Disk Utility. (And if we forget how difficult could be for some people to use drive formats like NTFS in a Mac) But iOS, thats another story, Apple manufactures iPhone and developes a OS which works perfectly with that device, which, supposedly, makes it safer. There ends all iOS and iPhone REAL advantages. There are a lot of reason to say Android is better than Android, but the main reason is that you can freely add and delete files from it. I connect my Android to my computer, I press “Windows key” + “E” and immediately I see all my drives and my Android device there, and I can drag or delete files from it. But when I connect an iPhone I have sync up files with iTunes. Why the hell people think synchronization is good? For example, I spent one week adding all my music from CDs to my iTunes library, then I synced my iPhone and… voilá, my music was there. Then my computer died, and my music adquired during years with my money was completely lost, just because I didn’t buy it to Apple. But hey, music was still on my iphone, but NO, I need a third party program, which costs money or could be a malware, just to upload my songs again to a new computer. (Of course I have all my CDs, but thats a week lost) Im simply asking you to do like me if you can, just try everything, because if I read this article (iPhone is better, iPhone is better, iPhone is better…) I have the feeling that not everyone, but many people conform with iPhone. Just for popularity, for Apple fanaticism, or just because a website is telling you to buy it with superliminal advertising. 09/26/2016 wgallagher142 Reply I actually find that android apps have become much prettier and definitely more modern than iPhone apps at this point.

I plug the phone to any pc or laptop with Windows and I can access and modify the memory and sd card just like you do with an USB flash drive. 2) probably my favourite Android feat: if I don’t like a new update for an App I just download the previous version (you can get the whole updates hystory as .apk files of virtually every single app found in Google Play on the web) and there I have my dear older version that works so much better for me. This “roll-back” possibility is just pure gold. 10/01/2016 don Reply Blackberry rules 10/03/2016 B BALL Reply F**k all of you stop writing huge ass stories and go back to 1st grade to learn your grammar and if you like android the os systems are freakin names of candy!! 10/07/2016 Scuba Turtle Reply I can do all of this with my Andriod plus a lot more that an Iphone just cannot do. 10/16/2016 Sally Fallis Reply This is for Charles Alden. If I could have 1/50th of your technical expertise I would be overjoyed. Meanwhile, I’ll just be glad I chose a Samsung. At least I got that right. 10/07/2016 Majid Reply None of these arguments accounts for any good reason to buy an iPhone except argument number 1. Android can do these equally or better. I have been a heavy android user till date until yesterday when I bought iPhone 7 plus. I own an iPad since two years. I am happy with my iPad which I use mainly for games and some handwriting. Yes I was annoyed from android. I owned s3. It had, due to some reason, a built in issue which I only realized after warranty finished. My faulty s3 obliged me to hate Samsung and android. Then I bought note 4. It solved all my problems I faced on s3. But still there were some things I did not feel good about. Now after purchasing iPhone 7plus 128 GB I understand the power of google. The three apps Google search, google maps and google drive are enough reason to close down iPhone factory from the face of earth. 10/10/2016 BM Reply Thinking to upgrade from s5. Thought for iPhone 7. But it can not do even 5 % work compared to android. My andrioid mobile automatically silents itself when I enter meetings or office. Automatic meeting mode when meeting is scheduled (only beeps) I can give my mobile to anyone to see coz I have app specific fingerprint. Only sensitive apps are protected. All other is open. These are not possible with apple except jailbreak. These are just samples. I can write journal what android can do. Speed is not important with a Ibrick which can not do anything smart. I’m not a fan of apple or Samsung. I want my work to be done and my pocket secretary to work according to my requirements. 10/10/2016 Charles Alden Reply 15 reasons why Android is better. Reason number one, you have an actual file system. Anyone who has dealt with iOS horrendous file management paradigm appreciates the ease as at which files are accessible in Android. You simply click on Open, navigate to where your files are stored, select, done. There is also never any reason to use the Share function except when sharing data with the internet. Number 2, multitasking, iOS’s multitasking absolutely sucks, especially when you compare it to Android. Example, I can stream a film to my TV wirelessly, while compiling an application via a remote terminal, while downloading a 40GB file directly to my NAS drive which is mounted as a local folder, while I convert a media file to .mp4, while I play N64, 007 Goldfinger using a replica N64 USB game controller. I’m able to select my own default apps, so when I download a file and click open, the app that I normally use for that extension opens up automatically. I have a global search function, which is one of the worst things about iOS, how do you find files. That was rhetoric, you can’t, it’s basically hunt and peck. I can customize voice commands, this is perhaps one of the coolest things about about Android. I have around 250 custom voice commands, mostly for searching files. Such as, “show me all file [file extension] created on [date]. Even photos, show me all photos from [city] on [particular date/month, years], even for a particular person , “show me all photos for [name] on [particular date/month, year]” External display support, when am connect my phone to a monitor not only is the resolution fully supported but so is the aspect ratio. Mouse support, while connected to a monitor I can use a mouse and a keyboard. Even when not connected to a phone, having access to a mouse is an absolute must when using a tablet as a laptop. USB peripheral support, so besides mouse support, my phone supports a TB external HD, HP All-In-One printer in which the scanner even works, USB replica game controllers in which a have one for the N64, SNES, Sega and PlayStation. Better overall specs, I have a 2K AMOLED display, 6GB of RAM, USB C, SD Card reader, HDMI out support, etc. I can use a custom desktop LDPI, I changed my LDPI to 380 which is the LDPI that activates tablet mode, which means all of my apps are a lot more powerful than the normal phone UI ones. I can customize my entire system to what I want it to be, give it personality, iOS users have been using the same system UI for the last 9 years. There is absolutely nothing I can’t customize. Inner app communication is a lot better, since iOS has a Walled off prison, or so called Walled Garden, apps communicate via API’s, which is the root of everything wrong within iOS. Anyway as stated above, I don’t have to use some half assed sharing function which creates a copy of the file your sharing every time you use it to open up my files within multiple apps, I simply click on Open. I can even open up the same file within multiple apps at the same time. I never, ever have to create more than one file, I just use the original file, always. I can use Linux under a Chroot, meaning I have a full Debian server running under my phone. Why would you want this, well first of all I have CLI applications like; Python, Perl, PHP, MySQL, Apache, etc. I have all of my favorite Linux GUI applications installed like; Dia, Inkscape, Gimp, BlueFish, etc. I can use my phone as a desktop computer, this one might sound weird but not only is it possible, it works incredibly well. Especially when my phone has 6GB of RAM and a Qualcomm 821. Like I said above I have all of my favorite Linux GUI applications installed in which a bring them up using a xterminal, when I’m at work I have access to about a hundred different Windows applications via a Citrix client which works fantastically. All of my applications including the ndroid ones are opened up in individual windows, so none of that dual app view non-sense. In which in iOS less than 0.5% out of a million plus apps actually support. I have access to widgets, they might not interest you but they are extremely handy. I can use wireless chargers. I can use custom ROMs, even completely different OS’s like Ubuntu Touch, SailFish, etc. I will never, ever not be able to run the latest version of Android. When a manufacturer stops updating their phone, no problem, I just install a custom ROM and they work fantastically. My phone is a computer, a real powerhouse, a real smartphone. Every time I use an iPhone I absolutely hate the experience. I mean even to type a post like this I would have to use a text editor as I would be afraid to loose all of my work as anytime you switch to another app, Safari just resets. It has happened to me numerous times, it’s why sites have started saving drafts, not for the Android users but iOS users. Though what bothers me the most is the lack of multitasking, yes, sure, there are a few apps that can run in the background but they are far and few and none of them are the ones that I need or want to use. Than there is the file system or I should say lack of, dealing with files IOS is simply a complete nightmare. Anytime someone at the office who uses an iPhone gets sassy with me about having an Android phone I simply ask them to show me their user directory, what, you can’t mount it, why not, your phone is so great. Not only do I have my remote server directly mounted as a local directory on my phone but my workstation and all of my cloud services as well, all accessible within any app installed. Again, my phone is also my desktop computer and why not, it’s not only powerful enough but more than capable. I couldn’t believe how horrible the external display support was on my iPad Pro, which I recently replaced with a Lenovo YogaBook, best decision I ever made. Talk about a complete makeover on how I work, I’m actually productive now. I can create detailed reports, all in the background and automatically, I have access to a scripting language, automation, multi-user support with OpenID to access my firms internal network, a real Office suite, MS Office for iOS was a complete joke, there isn’t even a import feature, scripting language, nope, database support, nope, by the way, I have the Android version. Which opens up every app under their own window, iOS’s dual app support on the iPad Pro was a joke, hardly anything supports it and that drag and drop feature, only apps designed by the same developer can use it, so MS Word to MS Excel yes, MS Word to Apple photos, no, useless. Yes, my post is huge, but this authors best 15 reasons why the iPhone is a joke. Almost everything listed I have on either my Yoga Book or new Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus or don’t need it as it’s a waste. In fact 90% of the so called new features in iOS 10 are useless. I held on to my iPad Pro thinking iOS 10 would be a game changer, not only was it not, but there wasn’t a single feature that improved my experience. Apple keeps skipping over every feature that we actually want, need. If your happy with multitasking, file management, the fact that you can’t select your own default apps, lack of customizations, horrible external display support, lack of USB C, limited NFC, horrible USB peripheral support, especially mouse support. Horrible inner app communication including the Sharing function in which took Apple 8 years to even release that crap, ugh, the list just goes on and on and …………. 10/11/2016 Gigi Reply This is one of the most biased articles I have ever read on complementing Apple. I am an adult, I don’t need Apple to limit what I can do with my phone and what I can share and who I can share with. I have used Iphone before and it surely not my cup of tea. 10/12/2016 Emma squire Reply Okay Listen what I think is that you have written an article telling the blank truth of your mind. But you see I have an iPhone 6s,iPod 5,MacBook air, MacBook Pro, Samsung TV with built in smart tv, Samsung galaxy tablet pro and I don’t mind Samsung to be truthful. Also I find that Apple is more easier to use but harder to switch from an iOS device to an LGphone. Emma squire, 11y/o from Aus. 10/14/2016 Babble Reply Let’s face it… I use an android lollipop but after comparing and visualizing the specifications.. One can truly say that iPhone is way more better than android. ..though we need to invest some bucks unlike android phones. 😀 10/14/2016 Huen Reply iOS is superior to Android. I was suckered in buying 2 android devices the samsung galaxy s3 and the nexus 4. I gave it a try because my friends raved about android. They are smart people who generally have great advice and knowledge on technology. So I said I’ll give it a shot because they have good judgement. However I found out that their judgement were out of biased hatred toward apple. Android devices: 1. on paper they have more ram, sometimes quicker cpu clock speed, higher resolution etc. however real life performance tests apple out scores android devices, just check geek bench and speed tests. As for higher resolution our eyes dont even detect the larger resolutions. 2. I found out the hard way, downloaded apps that just didnt work for my device. Google needs to improve this I dont know if they are better now but man they need to detect the hardware your using and tell you ahead of time before you download and install an app that its compatible with your device! 3. customizations my butt!! Its a great idea so called if all your launchers actually look good! haha I tried all these loaders for my s3 and they were all ugly. Just go with apple, its like saying would you hire great designers for your house and you would just let them have their way in designing the house for you or would you want to design it yourself? doesnt make sense look at xiaomi great example they just copy everything apple does and it looks great. Dont hire cheap designers to design the way your phone looks and works. 4. OS – android’s solution to everything is “oh just download this app to make it work or oh just kill this task or reduce brightness or this or that” why?! If I’m paying 1k for a phone why does it not just work? Why must I non stop have to tweak things on my phone to get save battery or make things work? For instance for whatsapp there was no function built into the app that when I want to send a larger video than that of the given limit on a video it just rejects it. On iOS whatsapp gives you a little function that u can just cut the video into segments and send them in separate messages? This sounds like it can be something that is on the app level. I dont know but as for end user experience its just not convenient you need to download another app that will cut videos in segments for you this is retarded. 5. battery life just sucks on android – and my friend is all like well it works for me…well that’s because he had to buy a new battery that was double the size and totally threw out the idea of having a sleek thin phone. Theres on and on the list goes android and samsung devices are not superior devices. The features samsung lovers speak of are just gimmicks. Keyboards, widgets, notifications honestly who cares? Especially when widgets just take down performance on your phone? I just dont see any benefits on android especially the argument went something like this: “oh android phones are cheaper for superior hardware” Like I said hardware maybe superior on PAPER but in real life benchmarks iphones outshine samsung and htc and other top tier android devices. By the way prices are not cheaper anymore so android fanboys have no actual argument. Like I said I tried android and they are not superior phones both hardware and software. Aesthetically Android phones are ugly. You now pay a premium price on sub premium products, and they explode. lol 10/20/2016 Jamezz_ Reply Sure. A Samsung or LG’s phone software is ugly. But stock android?! Android 6.0 stock? It’s an extraordinary interface with origami-style apps. The geometry with the shadows and vibrant colors is beautiful. The app drawer is simple, and you can put the apps you use on your home screen. Android’s advantage is software. iSheep are just too autistic to use it. 10/16/2016 Cmi Reply I have both! I have an iPhone for work and I have an Android for my personal use, in my opinion the phone is shit and could not compare to the Android in any area,i f it were up to me I would NEVER own an iPhone. Anybody who argues this point has never used them side by side. No comparison.anybody who stands in line for the new iPhone is absolutely getting the shaft and not even getting the best product , it’s laughable! 10/18/2016 George Brite Reply Great article. Over the years I’ve had both. Even a couple of Macs. I use PC’s now because I like being able to work on them and build my own. For the average user the I Phone is a better choice. They are simple and work well. Here’s the big negatives for me: The hardware and software are proprietary. In fact the phones are sealed. You can’t install an extended battery. No SD slot. No root access. Comparable Android phones cost a lot less. The Android phones natively work with Google Apps. We use our phones in the business. If I were a casual user it wouldn’t matter if it were a Trac Phone or an I Phone. We use the Google phones and Motorola phones. They run pure Android without all the carrier bloatware. I like to say Apple invented the smartphone, but Google perfected it. It’s like the choice between a toaster oven and a microwave or a full commercial kitchen. Most people will get along fine with the toaster and microwave. They don’t need a commercial kitchen. But, what if you could get the full commercial kitchen for the same price as the toaster and microwave? Everyone has an opinion about which is better. But trust me when I say this isn’t a choice between chocolate and vanilla. There are very distinct differences between the Android and Apple phones. 10/21/2016 ZinicHD Reply Wtf, apps never ever releases on iOS first. It always releases on android first. Also app updates releases on android first, so that’s kind of bullshit what you are saying. The only thing iOS beats android in is security and stability. Also you can get virus scanners on android, so that thing doesn’t matter. And one thing more, who ever uses FaceTime or iMessage, when we have messenger, Skype ect… And that point when you said that iOS stock apps was the stupidest crap I have ever heard. First of all it was a shit point, what are you gonna need the looks for? Second is that not everyone thinks it look better, so keep that mind. I am a iOS user and I am so disappointed that you can’t even customize the most of the things. I have to admit that the design of iOS is pretty nice, but you get quick tired of it. That’s why I jailbreaked my device to get the ability to customize it more professionally. But I don’t compare a android device and a jailbroken device, because jailbreaking is not something that comes with Apple. iOS is also very expensive compared to android devices. And checking storage on android is way more organized than iOS, so I don’t know where you get that idea that checking storage on iOS is better. 10/22/2016 Bent Vanwijnsberghe Reply the lightning port part is bs i have an iphone (looking for a new phone android) and there are around me on my desk already 3 micro usb and 1 lightning port witch costs around 40 bucks for a new one 10/25/2016 Selenia Reply Terrible article by an obvious fanboy. You are listing many things, like lack of carrier or manufacturer bloatware, reversible charging plug, seamless sharing, etc and saying they are exclusive to Apple. Try Googling USB-C, the current standard on any higher range Android, some still cheaper than an iDevice. Try a Nexus, or as of this year, Pixel phone. No bloat, Android as Google intended it. That would be a more fair comparison as those are at least close in the chain to Google, like an iPhone is to Apple. That is, instead of being made by some company who may not even care how it represents Android, build quality, and other important things, instead of pure profit(not say all non Nexus/Pixel phones are bad by any means, but some do give Android a bad name with poor specs and modified/outdated versions of Android). Seamless sharing? Ever hear of WiFi Direct, Bluetooth, or NFC? NFC is the simplest. Just hit share and tap. All but the cheapest Androids have that these days. Anyways, I am convinced you have never used a decent Android, ever. Certainly not one from Google themselves. I will leave you to tend to your iFlock. 10/30/2016 MzJens Reply For android, I think google products like nexus & pixel are much better than samsung. However, I noticed a lot of crappy apps available on google play that doesn’t work. Some apps require root access which only advance users should do. Android interface is not as intuitive as iOS. Some android apps hang. I’ve never had ios apps hang on me 11/10/2016 Pixleboy2 Reply “You have to try multiple attempts before putting the charger in at the right angle” 1. If you do it in a lit environment you will get it in first try because the micro USB shape is easy to see 2. If you are in the dark: And have an official Samsung charger – there will be a “bumps letting you know which way to put it and the only thing that can go wrong is you missing the port, which is possible on iPhone too. And have any old micro USB – there are two, normal, ways to insert it horizontally upside down and horizontally the correct way both 180 degree angles so please don’t exaggerate it. Finally Samsung cares about you that’s why they use micro USB. This may seem weird but basically to legally make a lightning USB cable you need a licence from Apple and Apple only have their own unique charger to earn more profit, that’s why apple chargers are always more expensive, because they are sold by Apple or the retailer needs to make his money back from the licence fare. P.S. Samsung devices come with a 1 year warranty for free and because it’s Samsung you can get cheaper insurance than their one (yes they have one) P.P.S. Sharing has always been easier on android to anything because you could share with a variety of options such as Bluetooth, NFC, messaging app, other third party apps, S share (Samsung own “air drop” that came out in Android version 4.1.3 BI7 – before Ios 7 Also the settings icon is useful, it’s like apple not making the send button on messages 3d touch to send so you don’t accidently press it, sure sometimes you send half written messages but it is more convenient and normal to have it to a single normal touch. And there is a difference between apps looking better and having more features on Apple which are usually hardware based, I just brought this up because no matter who you ask if you compare a Samsung phone with its equivalent iPhone generation, Samsung phones ALWAYS have better displays and MOSTLY have better cameras. Samsung phones are also very comfortable, for example I am writing this on a Samsung galaxy s7 edge There is a setting that allows the micro sd card to be added as side by side storage Finally Samsung has always had earphone controls so either I read it wrong that you said these are things we will miss very much or you are really confused 11/12/2016 Tetsuokenpachi Reply Each and every single of these are false. Android is actually better in every single of these areas. From the first to the last one. Worse yet, many of these points are actually some of the very reasons why idevices absolutely suck. 11/16/2016 Billy Sastard Reply apple is crap, these idiots make their products so expensive, but android is cheaper and has alot of awesome features.android is also WAY more customisable, with out necessarily rooting your device.And if you do, you can do almost anything from installing apps to changing your software. 11/16/2016 Calculadora Gestacional Reply I think both of them are just great! 11/16/2016 Caleb Reply The update can still download on older Apple products, because I have a IPad 2 that came out in 2011 and it still receives all of the latest updates. It is running IOS 10 right now. 11/16/2016 saurabh Reply Been an exclusive apple lover for 7 years now. But just bought an edge 7. Was amazed to see how much progress android has made and makes my iphone look so limited. I am aware that android tends to slow down over time but that is yet to happen to me. For now the openness of android is amazing as it is giving me a computer like experience while iOS still strictly behaves like a mobile device only. Classic hurt points being in iphone /iOS being No expandable memory No dual sim version (i travel internationally and need this frequently) Unable to use lastpass like apps the same way as in android (and keychain is BS, BTW) Simple things like themes unavailable Very less system wide control Very limited customisation I can go on but i think unless my expensive edge can give me same performance as now for ATLEAST 2 years, i’ll eat my words back But, the 15 points mentioned here are almost all very unconvincing. 11/17/2016 Philip Reply Apple are just simple phones no really fancy stuff I have had two Android phone I love their features but not their battery life which is crappie I have had two Apple iPods and two iPhone they were the 4 32 GB & 5s 64 GB now on Android your apps get updated every 3 months on Apple sometimes twice a week IOS updates are twice month at least I bought my iPhone 5s 64 GB which started with iOS 7 in 2014 now it got iOS 10.1.1 it seems the IOS are getting worse not better it freezes crashes most apps lot of the app you can’t even post two year let alone one day old photo I can get on my Samsung Galaxy S3 with 3 year old photos on it and post photos off it to any app only reason I like the small iPhones I can collect lot photos that way I can post to my apps like now I got over 106K photos on my 5s 64 GB which you can’t do with big phones only problems I got with iPhones are updates on apps and IOS’S like this month iOS 10.2 supposedly be coming out it seems the new IOS’s don’t really fixing any problems you get on your iPhone it just give you different problems while you still have the same old problems you also got figure Apple iPhones are about 3 years behind Android phones on new ideals 11/18/2016 Nick Reply Apple!?

You are writing about malware crap which is misleading. New android versions since lollipop allow users to modify app permissions but i think you are so caught up in app constrained ecosystem, you didn’t noticed. IOS isn’t secure anymore as we thought it was. Su vulnerability has already been fixed and there is no more stagefright bug in android. And you obviously have no idea about the difference between android based phones and android phones. Most of the Phones from samsung, htc, sony etc run Custom Android based OS, They are actually custom build port of android, not real android phones, so obviously there will be some issues too if you try to port IOS on samsung. A high end smartphone can go head to head with iphone in each and every aspect. My s6 edge is not even a tad slower than iphone 6, in fact, it performs even better.

I decided to upgrade it to the 7, which turned out to be just as bad. For the price, they should be giving people something amazing, not mediocrity! P.S. How much did they apple pay you for such a bad article. 12/03/2016 Brandon McLean Reply You didn’t mention how Apple has a much smaller battery, late software updates, unneeded restrictions, is insanely overpriced, and most of all, Apples processor specs come in at a fraction of what Androids of the same price have, AKA 1.6 GHZ (Apple iPhones) vs 2.4 GHZ (ASUS, Galaxy S7, OnePlus all running Android), 2 GB of RAM (Apple) vs 4 GB of RAM (Android). Android is by far the superior technology. Your only argument is that Android uses Google’s superior sharing system, rather than their own like Apple does. 12/14/2016 Keith Llewellyn Reply For me, it’s all about security, and Apple has the best. Also, if you buy an iPhone you get updates and support for a couple of years more than Google provides for it’s own Nexus or Pixel phones. Two years worth of updates for the OS and Three years for security updates FROM THE DATE OF FIRST INTRODUCTION is totally inadequate. It means that you have to buy a new google phone from the date it is first available in order to really benefit from the updates. 12/27/2016 Apple Marketing Machine Reply Let’s compare the “core” features of a new iphone to a 2 year old android phone: iphone 7 plus – Released 2016, September Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Released 2014, October iphone 7 plus – 1080 x 1920 pixels (~401 ppi pixel density) Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – 1440 x 2560 pixels (~518 ppi pixel density) iphone 7 plus – Quad-core 2.23 GHz Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Quad-core 2.7 GHz iphone 7 plus – 12 MP camera Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – 16 MP camera iphone 7 plus – Non-removable Li-Ion 2900 mAh battery Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Removable Li-Ion 3220 mAh battery okay…you can have your “better looking apps”. 12/28/2016 MACKabiVIPer42 Reply Yes Android phones are better everything wise but iPhone battery is better last as long as up to 3 to 4 years Samsung last up to 6 months I know had S3 and HTC 1 still got S3 3rd battery it’s just iPod on second iPhone first one was iPhone 4 32 GB lasted 4 years got iPhone 5s 64 GB it’s over 2 yrs old but don’t use for taking photos just for collecting photos which small iPhone can collect up too 100K photos like my iPhone 5s I’m not SELFIE PERSON where I got take photo of my self in every window mirror and bathroom I love stealing other people photos like Anime ladies in bikinis to post on my other apps even Animals if they are cute enough yes Apple do make there apps crappie and there IOS’s also which crashes and freezes a lot then half time you can’t post photos or articles from your e-mail too the apps but I take Apple for small phone over android big phone 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply More pixels require more energy and chip performance.

Unless you count changing your phone cover as “customizing”. 3: It’s not apple, so it’s better (see what i did there? I did the shit apple fanboy’s do) 4: No dumb “inovations”. 5: Simplifying things and making something that takes 3 seconds isn’t better, Sony, Samsung etc focus on more important things to improve. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply Well you sound like Forest Gump in his movie when he said that his friend opened Apple company for selling fruits….

I have a android galaxy tab 3 and the iPod 6 generation and if I was to choose which is better it’s definitely Apples product and I never would get an android again. When I got my android new at Walmart it couldn’t even get the latest version, it was completely unbelievable. After I had it for 3 months it slowed down on me and its battery life is horrible. Now when I bought this IPod new I’ve had it for a double the time now and it works like new and best of all it can get the latest version. The quality of Apple is way better. In my opinion the iPhone is the best visual quality I’ve seen yet. Ive done some decent gaming on them and if you want something to save your progress then forget android, because not all the game link to your google play account so if you reset it the ones that don’t link are gone. Unlike apple I haven’t had any issues with it. I’ve lost decent money and progress on android because of it. Yes Apple does come out with the newest technology a bit latter then android but you can see it it a good way or a bad. The bad way would be that their slow, the good way you can see it as if their watching googles failing parts and their making it better. 01/03/2017 Marcelino Reply Also I can see you all are fighting over this topic which is pretty stupid. To be honest you can’t necessarily compare them. Everyone is different so everyone is going to want something different. If we all wanted android or we all wanted Apple we would become robots. If you wanted to find a phone to get then get into inside detail to see what your looking for. If you wanted fun texting and want to be more secure then go straight for apple because they got the best for that but if you wanted fun lock screens or be able to put micro SD cards and changeable batteries then go for android but let me remind you that anyone can take the SD card out and take your information. Hope this helps. 01/04/2017 LOREN FOK Reply people will buy iphone just because thats what everyone else has they dont even know what they are buying. They think because its popular its the best choice..all robots who don’t think for themselves 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply Since it’s more popular it’s better … 01/04/2017 farafit Reply i read almost every comments and keep deciding what should i buy: an android or iphone. i own android for 8 years now (from the era when sony ericsson still existed) and got so accustomed to it. i changed devices for 4 times during the 8 years because i want to get spec updates regularly. i love the fact that it is very simple in android: you can buy any android device you want and you will feel like you never changed your phone. contact, picture, apps, music will all still be the same as in the old phone. i heard that iphone is more stable compared to android so i am thinking of switching but i am genuinely scared the switch will cost me more: i will have to buy new headphones, mac (because many say that iphones does not connect well with pc), and i am very clumsy so i’m scared of scattering my iphone screen and will need to pay more to repair it. my husband owns a 4s and it still works until now, and it is true that android has shorter lifespan for a clumsy user like me because after some point android will keep hanging.. but still i think android is perfect for people like me who doesn’t really have the money to be a vivid apple follower.. i don’t want to be all attached to itunes.. i dont want to be obliged to buy a macbook to operate my iphone well.. i just don’t really like to spend almost all of my earnings to buy a single phone, when at the same time the same amount of money can be used to buy an android and a pc, and a vacuum cleaner.. maybe someday i will switch to apple products altogether when i have a mountain pile of money to spend.. but for now i am quite happy with a middle-end android phone and will stick to it.. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply As they say: expensive shoes last longer… 01/10/2017 Frank McConnell Reply iPhones are better than androids, PERIOD. At least we don’t get viruses, androids are very slow and lag A LOT! iPhones are really fast, while androids have “better specs” than every iPhone in the world. Wow, people here in the comments are blind as heck, like have you people ever used and iPhone before? Think before you speak. 01/13/2017 Angwell Reply I have used an android phone for the last 20 yrs and just in the last 2 yrs switched to an iPhone. Sure there may be more that an android can do ( provided you download appropriate apps) but as a comment above made, after a month or 2 the android starts slowing down dramatically. With the iPhone this does not happen. BUT the major improvement that will keep me with the iPhone is security !!!!!! 01/17/2017 Shivanki Sharma Reply Well said Josh Smith… But My view about your article is…No one can said this iPhone is better or Android is not Or Vice-Versa until you are not aware of their pros as well. There are alot to know about these two before making your mind to go for iPhone or Android, one of them. Both phones have their own features and plus points.

Most of the alleged superiorities are interoperabilty between iPhones (iMessage, Airdrop) or between iPhone and other Apple devices (Handoff) – if you are a PC owner, or have a large number of friends or fellow users on Android, these advantages are insignificant at best. I will concede that updates and lack of carrier bloatware are significant pluses, the author is doing an extreme disservice to new users by basically promoting an iPhone prejudice. 01/31/2017 Matt Perkins Reply iPhones win over Android smartphones for these 5 critical reasons. Security, Privacy, Stability, Performance and Usability. iOS gets far less malware than Android, it has far less critical vulnerabilities than Android. Vulnerabilities are patched quicker in iOS. iOS crashes and freezes less than Android, Apple doesn’t harvest data to sell like Google does (Google has even started collecting identifiable data since they released their new voice assistant). iOS is a faster OS than Android is while Android smartphones slow down faster than the iPhone does. And of course iOS offers the better out of box experience. Not to mention you can never make Android as secure as iOS, only close to as secure. Part of the reason is even if you tweak your Android settings to be similar to iOS, the official Google Play Store gets far more malware than the AppStore and Cydia combined. So only way to even remotely match it is not download apps or games. My other favorite part of iOS over Android is the fact you can use true adblockers in iOS, not just adblock browsers without the need to root or jailbreak. Google will never allow you to block ads in Chrome or block all ads third party ads without rooting. And as you knowing rooting and jailbreaking merely lowers the security of the OS. That’s another thing Jailbroken iOS is more secure than untouched Android as long as you stick to the default repos in Cydia. 02/01/2017 Shaun Anderson Reply Android Download from unknown sources like a regular computer Download files from browser Plug in and transfer anything to and from computer. File System. Just acts more like a computer in regards to freedom to do as you will where iPhone is locked down like a game system. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply You can do all that in iTunes. iPhone is more careful to protect data while android is less careful. Today security is most important and that is iOS goal. 02/02/2017 lg k4 ekran koruyucu Reply LG K10 LTE için sergi 1280 X 720 piksel yüksek çözünürlüklü ekran çözünürlüğe sahip IPS LCD yaptı. 02/10/2017 thomasammy749 Reply Stay at home mom Kelly Richards from New York after resigning from her full time job managed to average from $6000-$8000 a month from freelancing at home… This is how she done !!!!!!!!!!!!!http://jobbuzz7.com 02/14/2017 Debadeep Biswas Reply I also believe iPhone is better than Android.

Who really cares if the poor sods on the other side of the world live the lives of slaves? Who cares if they have to stand ALL day, and ASK for pissbreaks? Who cares if the companies solution to suicides are suicide nets around buildings and removing knives? Who cares if the iphone costs a dollar to make, but sold for $600? Who cares if most of the jobs are not in the countries paying for the status symbols? So lets be clear, its all about “im better than you because i can waste money on bling, and *&$! your community at the same time”. 02/18/2017 exycheezy Reply I’ve had both. many times. I’ve had every version of the iPhone. I’ve never had an Android phone update properly. My 3 year old plays on my old 2nd gen iPhone that has the latest IOS on it. . .. android can’t do that. with the exception of a Verizon flip phone, every single Android phone I’ve ever had got a virus, crashed and I had to reset to factory settings at least 2 times per phone. I have never, ever ever got a virus on ANY Apple product, and never had to put any software or app to keep it running correctly. As far as customization? Who cares. If you’re so busy and have so much time to waste trying to impress everyone with crazy fonts and wild customization, the iPhone is way to sleek, sophisticated and user -friendly for you. Software dictates hardware. The IOS blows Android OS away. And, any (anyone who’s actually worked on both will agree) Apple product gets sometimes twice the speed out of less RAM and processing than ANY other OS (Windows or Android). Give me stability anytime. so your phone has an expandable memory? What good is it when it won’t run half the time. Have a nice day all. . .. .after all, they’re just phones. . .. right? 02/19/2017 Richie Reply Some things to add (pros and cons) as a PC & Android guy that just switched to iPhone (but I’m staying on PC): 1) The iOS versions of Microsoft apps are better than the Android ones and they work great. 2) Article is correct: the iOS versions of apps are generally better than their Android counterparts, in ways you will notice. It’s really kind of a shame for Android – I don’t get why they don’t just match the exact app. 3) Lightning is neat but I found MicroUSB more useful, since it’s used for more devices, i.e. I have a MicroUSB running from my desk to my PC to charge my wireless mouse, and then I would also use it to charge my phone sometimes. 4) Yes I do miss customization heaven with Android, but this iPhone runs like total butter. Android runs WELL but this thing is so zippy and responsive – you wouldn’t believe it until you spent time with one. 5) ALSO customization isn’t as cut-off as it used to be with iOS. Some apps can latch onto some functions in the phone, kinda like installing an extension for your desktop browser. It’s something. Really I just bought an iPhone to “try something new” and I’m really liking it. 02/28/2017 Toby Reply Just do a Quick google search iphone is less reliable than Android, theres your Answer in the studies. End of debate… 03/01/2017 Viking Sheep Reply These comparisons are so lame… Eg: Country X is much better than the rest of the world, because the rest of the world have varying standards, while Country X has only 1 level of corruption. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply First: great respect to Steve Jobs who dedicated his life to Apple iPhone invention and to make communication better more joyful between people. Also to feel the power and beauty of technology in your hand. How I wished that Isaac Newton or Ainstein or Nikola Tessa or… would see what we have today… Second: iPhone is far more serious for people who want job to be done as fast and simpler way without delays. Android phones are for kids who like customizations and pretty colors and to look like iron man or similar… Third: iPhone is made of better materials. And looks for business high class. Android phones are copying iPhone’s look especially Samsung. Fourth: iPhone technology, the software and hardware gives you exactly what you need. No more no less. Android technologies gives you extra things which are seldom used and are simply extra using more battery and device performance. Fifth: iPhone has a specific style in design. Keeping updating same style to better one making it each time better and better. Sixth: Applications on iPhone are much better with much less defects than Android. At the end, I had various Samsung, Sony, Huawei, Htc and iPhone phones. I choose iPhone. Now I have iPhone 6s+ black limited edition with golden Apple. It’s very nice piece of equipment. at the bottom line, Apollo 11 travelled to the moon using Fortan on its 360 kb computer. Today we are talking of gigs bytes.

By: Vigneshravi Menon Published: Friday, March 10, 2017, 18:15 [IST] Apple followed the trend set by other smartphone manufacturers and brought out the iPhones with biggers displays. While bigger the better term has been around for time immemorable, gadgets have always followed a smaller but more powerful concept, in most areas. However, when it comes to smartphones bigger and more powerful is the mantra that's proven to be the key. With Apple making this transition and bringing out new bigger iPhones and being done with conveniently sized ones, it was an end of an era. And with the beginning of a new phase, many users were excited about having iPhones with bigger displays as it offered many new possibilities and better viewability. While on the other hand, some weren't so happy about it including me, this could also be the sole reason why many existing users also didn't upgrade to newer iPhones sooner. As older iPhones provided the convenience with their size. ALSO SEE: How to disable iMessages and go back to SMS on Apple iPhones In any case, if you have a bigger display iPhone then there is a feature which is not very popular among most users and may go unnoticed, but this feature changes things and brings with the convenience of the size of the older iPhones. The feature is very practical and convenient, allowing users to go back to operating their iPhoness with one hand.

Next, tap on Settings and scroll down to the General icon and tap on it, this will take to a new screen.

By Steffen Reich, Mar 14, 2017 Tweet 9 Comments In a statement warmly welcomed by us internet folk, Tim Cook recently proclaimed “you will see us do more in the pro area.” In our circles, this is unquestionably good news, as we all foster an insatiable appetite for new innovations, be that on a hardware or software level. More pro is great, however I invariably had to spare a thought for the average, not-so techy Apple customer. I’m talking about the type of customer that after owning their iPhone 6S for more than a year, still has little concept of what 3D Touch does. Or how about the one that loves their new MacBook, but will gaze at you with a stunned expression when you introduce them to Force Touch on their trackpad. This is by no means meant to sound snarky or patronizing, because as a matter of fact, I don’t blame them for not knowing – I blame Apple for failing to take everyone along for the ride due to poor communication. Shifting up the ‘Pro’ a notch in the future sounds great, that said how do you straddle the line between pleasing us tech-warriors and not entirely overwhelming a large majority of users, a majority already only privity to roughly half of the juicy features on their devices? Apple needs to find some cogent answers to this issue, and rather than creating a two-tier system in their hardware sold (labelling only some products ‘Pro’), I contend that software could be the key. Granted this is anecdotal, but noone around me past the age of 40 (even the ones fairly switched on in the realm of Apple) could reliably point out the location or even use of features such as Markup on iOS or 3D Touch keyboard shortcuts. I would go further out on a limb and wager that many owners of the iPhone 7 Plus know full well about their iPhone’s dual lens in terms of cosmetics, though they would struggle to name only one perk of the technology. Contrast this with the other side of the equation, where we have people licking their lips for 4K Apple TVs, beefier MacBooks or something as ostensibly simple as multiple user profiles for iPad. Reconciling and catering to two segments this disparate is a tough ask. For all the inherent challenges, it is a crucial one, simply because Apple cannot risk to create a bigger rift amongst their customers: pleasing the ‘Pro’ customers without consideration for the average Joe is going to deprive the majority of customers of the nifty stuff and eventually frustrate a lot of people that might feel left out. On the other hand, hampering or slowing down new software or hardware to ensure the lion’s share of users can keep up is sure to exile the techy crowd. The dynamic described is sometimes referred to as a rubber band effect, and it is something Apple by all means needs to forestall. The potential solution to the conundrum is twofold, one can be found in hardware, the other in the software of our devices. Thus far, Apple has largely leaned on the hardware strategy, albeit inconsistently and inconsequentially. The suffix ‘Pro’ in their products ought to suggest being geared towards the tech-savvy customers, while everything else famously ‘just works’. How an iPad Air 2 is going to be easier to navigate or comprehend than an iPad Pro however escapes me, and there are plenty other instances where the lines are at least fuzzy (and that’s being charitable). Not to belabour the point too much, but in conclusion, the average customer can’t keep track of software or hardware developments, all the while the professional crowd don’t feel taken serious enough. This wedge might compound if we speed up innovation of both software and hardware without taking by the hands those dizzied by the pace of it. How, you ask? I’m thinking the great equalizer in this equation could be software. In other words, cut the untowardly hardware differentiation, churn out the best you can and only the best (model variations for price differentiation aside). Thereafter, drape iOS or macOS in a whole new, optional software layer for help and guidance aimed at those who appreciate the help. Done right, this could level the playing field at least a little without impinging on the freedoms of the ‘Pro’ segment. To put my money where my mouth is, two concrete suggestions for what this could entail: Take the set-up procedure on any new device. iPhone or Mac users are routinely asked all sorts of questions anyways (such as Region, Apple ID, Touch ID settings), so why not slot in one more on the user’s expertise or experience with iOS or MacOS respectively? A simple toggle could determine whether or not the user wants more assistance or feature reminders throughout their day. When launching iMessage by way of example, an unobtrusive (but insightful) pop up could continuously bring up the more advanced features tucked away inside. This could be implemented for all stock apps until the user decides the time has come to take the training wheels off. Secondly, shouldn’t this be precisely the purpose of Siri? The personal assistant is remarkably coy when it comes to actually assisting with the device itself. Wouldn’t it be awesome if you could open any app and ask ‘Hey Siri, tell me a little more about this app!’. The request could cue a brief overview of controls or tricks regarding the app in question. Both suggestions run in a similar vein to iOS 10’s Tips app, however that one wasn’t a lot more than a tenuous acknowledgment that for many normal users, the issue of getting lost in the operating system does exist. Once you start thinking about ways to combat it through software, a lot more ideas will come to mind. Mulling over those I will leave to you at this point. The bottom line is that we’re witnessing the unwitting wedge between customer segments increase. If Apple – like Tim Cook said – is planning to ramp up the ‘Pro’ in their brand, they would be well-advised to go about it in a way that counteracts the emerging rift rather than doubles down on it. I believe the answer to it lies in software. And in light of that, WWDC 2017 could become an important fork in the road for Apple.

GUY Hhh GUY you are right! For example what the iPad pro Needs is a software that complements its capabilities and differentiate it from the other iPads … Instead of using a upscaled version of ios maybe they should have used a hybrid version of iOS and macOs ( runs ios apps and behaves like macOs ) GUY Usually we call a device stupid and incapable because we are not smart enough or too lazy to figure out how it works … I mean if you’re going to buy a car know how to drive the God damn thing! n0ahcruz3 If they put conference call for the ipad as exclusive feature, sale for the device will rise. There not much difference with iOS thats why iPad sale keeps declining. White Michael Jackson I agree with this statement. The reason why I have held off on buying a iPad (I really want one) since it was released is because it reminds me a big iPod. I am hoping apple can revamp the iPad mini. n0ahcruz3 Yep i dontknow why tim cook havent put that feature on the iPad. They claim Pro, they claim pc replacement but all they did was add a pencil ports for dedicated keyboard. But Software remains pretty much the same just minor tweaks to differentiate it from the non-Pro.

The tech companies argue that this would set a ‘troubling’ precedent. Business Insider reports that the FBI served search warrants ordering Google to hand over emails belonging to suspects in a criminal investigation. The emails in question were stored on a server stored outside the USA, and Google refused, arguing that a domestic search warrant could not apply to data stored in a foreign country … Anker braided Lightning cables A Pennsylvania court disagreed, instructing Google to comply with the warrant. Google appealed the ruling, and Apple, Amazon and Microsoft have now filed a joint amicus brief in support of the search giant. (An amicus brief is a submission by parties not directly involved in a case but which to express a view for the court to consider.) The filing does not suggest that the government is necessarily wrong to seek to extend the law to data stored overseas, but rather argues that the current law does not permit this, and it is for Congress – and not the courts – to make this call. This case addresses the reach of the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2701 et seq., which Congress enacted as part of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986. Technology has changed dramatically since the SCA became law. The Congress that drafted the SCA could barely have imagined the notion of storing emails halfway across the globe. That is why companies, commentators, and privacy advocates alike have long called for the SCA to be updated in light of the realities of 21st century technology. The question here, however, is the scope of the SCA as it now stands, not as Congress might eventually revise it. The tech companies do, however, argue that Congress should consider carefully the implications of applying U.S. search warrants to data held in other countries. Equally troubling, it invites foreign nations to reciprocate by likewise demanding that local offices of U.S. technology companies turn over U.S. citizens’ private communications stored on U.S. soil. It also places technology companies that store customer data abroad in the untenable position of being compelled to risk violating foreign data privacy laws to comply with warrants issued by U.S. courts. In other words, it would be a dangerous precedent to signal that any country can behave in the way the U.S. is attempting to behave here. Apple of course resisted the FBI itself in the San Bernardino shooting case, refusing to create a weakened version of iOS that would allow access to an iPhone – and Google filed an amicus brief supporting Apple in that case.

This is according to a recent news report from a South Korean publication. At the start of this week, Patently Apple cited a Korean tech report in its story about Samsung suppliers openly doubting the Cupertino giant’s ability to introduce a display-embedded fingerprint sensor in the upcoming next-generation iPhone. The Apple-centric site has learned from the report that Korean display tech firms are skeptical about Apple’s ambitious move. An official from one of the firms was even quoted to have said, “It is still extremely difficult to develop transparent sensors and components to be used for an all-screen smartphone.” Despite the qualms, the suppliers are all for a big leap in industry. “If those technologies are fully developed, it would be a big leap forward within the smartphone industry,” the same official said. What’s kind of intriguing here is how the Korean report pointed out that local firm CrucialTec is also hard at work in developing on-screen fingerprint sensors. CrucialTec even showed off its invention alongside China’s Goodix at the recently concluded Mobile World Congress. Both firms did not divulge their timeline for commercial release of their screen-embedded readers.  Patently Apple went on to slam Apple’s rivals that are trying to discredit the U.S. company’s straight path to showing off another breakthrough in the industry through its upcoming 10th anniversary iPhone. The publication also called out “copycat machine” Samsung for attempting to compete with Apple by initially planning on a Galaxy S8 with on-screen fingerprint sensors. However, the South Korea giant clearly lost its chance now that final leaks of its next flagship are showing the biometric sensor situated next to the primary camera at the back.  Yesterday, IBTimes reported that Samsung decided to place its fingerprint sensor at the back of the S8 due to time constraints. “Samsung poured resources into Synaptics’ fledging technology last year but the results were frustrating,” an anonymous tipster stated. “With the production imminent, the company had to decide to relocate the fingerprint scanning home button to the back of the device at the last minute.” With g giving up on introducing a display-embedded scanner in its upcoming Galaxy S8 flagship phone, Apple is now expected to enjoy the spotlight on its own. The Cupertino giant is already in the process of testing out its on-screen Touch ID and it still has a lot of time to do so ahead of the September launch event for its new iPhones.  Samsung suppliers are doubting Apple’s rumored display-embedded Touch ID.

Sikoryak It’s Apple’s World, Just Click and Agree to It by Sarah Boslaugh 14 March 2017 Tweet Ever wonder what you agree to when you click on the terms and conditions for iTunes? Read R. Sikoryak's Terms and Conditions and be awakened.   Terms and Conditions: The Graphic Novel R. Sikoryak (Drawn & Quarterly) US: Mar 2017 Amazon I’m a great admirer of Apple products—in fact, I’m writing this review on a MacBook Air—but I’ve never been unclear about the fact that Apple is a multinational corporation dedicated to making money. For that reason, I’ve never understood the idolatry surrounding Steve Jobs, nor the shock expressed by some people when they discovered that some Apple products are made in Chinese factories under working conditions that would not be acceptable to Americans. Business is business, as the saying goes, and expecting anything else is setting yourself up for disappointment. With that in mind, it’s not surprising that to use Apple-related software, you have to check a little box that signifies your agreement with all kinds of legalese that you probably haven’t bothered to read and wouldn’t understand if you did. The advantage is all with the company, since by checking the box you’ve agreed to follow their rules, and it’s no defense on your part to say that the rules are ridiculous or that no one actually reads that stuff. Of course, Apple is not the only company to play this game, but it’s the company singled out for attention in R. Sikoryak’s Terms and Conditions: The Graphic Novel, which is also billed as “complete and unabridged” and as an “unauthorized adaptation”. The text for Terms and Conditions is that of the iTunes terms and conditions as of 21 October 2015, while the art is drawn by Sikoryak, based on a number of pre-existing comics and graphic novels. Sikoryak uses one existing page for each of the pages in this book, with specific citations for the source inspiring each page listed in the back of the book. Jobs is a recurring character, easily recognized, thanks to his beard and black turtleneck, while the other characters and backgrounds for each set of panels is taken from the source material. Some of the pages are in color, while some are black and white, presumably to match the source material. This is such a genius idea it’s a wonder no one did it before. Even when broken into many speech balloons and enlivened with characters and backgrounds, the 20,000+ words of the text are pretty much indigestible, although Sikoryak has done his best to highlight phrases that sound particularly threatening (“In order to access and retain your electronic records, you may be required to have certain hardware and software, which are your sole responsibility”) or just bizarre in a cover-your-ass sort of way (“Apple is not responsible for typographic errors”). In fact, those two statements pretty much sum up the whole approach to such agreements: everything is the user’s responsibility, and nothing is the company’s responsibility. Well, whatcha gonna do? You want to play music on your portable devices, and iTunes is pretty much the way to do it, so you will continue to click on those boxes and agree to things you might be later horrified to realize you’ve agreed to. It’s sort of like medical care in the United States (Canadians, Europeans, and anyone who lives in a country with a real national health system, feel free to laugh at us): When seeking care, the first thing you have to do is sign a paper agreeing that you accept full financial responsibility for paying whatever the doctor or hospital decides to charge you, without knowing what that may be or whether your insurer will live up to its obligations. There are so many great pages in this graphic novel that it’s hard to pick just a few to highlight, but these give you an idea of the range of sources Sikoryak employs. The cover draws on an Uncanny X-Men, from 1986, with Jobs as a glowering Wolverine, his adamantium claws piercing an iPod displaying the text “To agree to these terms, click ‘agree.’” Part B of the terms and conditions opens with a splash page from Riyoko Ikeda’s shojo manga The Rose of Versailles, with Jobs as bishi boy Oscar lighting up the big sparkly eyes of Marie Antoinette. Midway through Part C, Jobs appears as Scott McCloud, explaining everything with the assistance of a black-and-white pyramid. The Simpsons make an appearance in Part D, with Jobs as a beer-chugging Homer (the beer can carries the Apple symbol) while Marge and the kids react with alarm as he piles on the threats (“…may subject you to civil and criminal penalties, including possible monetary damages…”). Because every page uses a different artistic style, things never get dull in Terms and Conditions, which may encourage some people to actually read the text. A similar theory lay beyond Sid Jacobson and Ernie Colón’s 2006 The 9/11 Report: A Graphic Adaptation, although that book suffered from some of the dullness of the report itself by relying too much on clipart-style illustrations. The mere existence of this adaptation may make the strongest case for the implied argument that such terms and conditions are ridiculous, as is the premise that any average person, who just wants to access some software which they paid for, would actually read and understand them. But it’s Apple’s world, and we just live in it, so we continue to click and agree without thinking about what we are actually agreeing to.

Reputable supply chain analysts have just revealed that the Cupertino giant is expected to announce new hardware next week. Though the lineup of products has not been disclosed, several sources have already indicated that new Apple tablets are scheduled for launch this March.  MacRumors exclusively reported Monday that it has learned from credible analysts who wish to remain anonymous after sharing this tip that Apple will be announcing new products in the following week, possibly between March 20 and 24. The analysts claimed that this information is from their own sources and not something that’s based on speculative reports.  Unfortunately, the analysts did not divulge which hardware refresh will be part of the announcement. So once again tech consumers and fans are left with the assumption that the lineup could include the rumored iPad Pro models with three different screen sizes — a 9.7-inch, a 12.9-inch and one with a never-before-seen 10.5-inch display.  The rumors about the trio of new iPad Pro models came from people and sites that have mostly been reliable when it comes to leaking certain things about Apple’s products. For instance, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said back in August 2016 that three new iPads are coming this 2017. Japanese blog Mac Otakara has also claimed the same thing. The only difference is the latter has also indicated that a refresh of the iPad mini series could be in the works as well.  However, 9To5Mac doubts that Apple is launching the new 10.5-inch iPad next week. For the Apple-centric news site, the Cupertino giant is unlikely to introduce a new variant at this point and will instead unveil refreshes for the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models because these two are already due for updates should the 12-18 month releasing cycle of Apple’s products be considered. Besides, a supply chain report that surfaced last month claimed that an all-new iPad design is not expected to arrive until May or June of this year.  Meanwhile, TechCrunch has learned that Apple is currently testing the new iPad models in the greater San Francisco Bay area, including Cupertino and its neighboring places. This is according to mobile marketing firm Fiksu, who is claiming that the new iPads will arrive this spring.  iPad unveilingMore Apple is reportedly releasing new hardware next week, and the lineup is expected to include a trio of new iPad Pro models.

Raymond Ronamai   March 14, 2017 18:13 IST Samsung Galaxy S7Samsung Official Website Even as we are waiting for the release of Samsung Galaxy S8, and Apple's iPhone 8 is still months away before being launched, comparisons between two of the most-awaited handsets of the year has started. It is unfair to compare the next-generation handsets at the moment, as they are yet to be announced, but a popular market analyst has claimed that the iPhone 8 could come out winner. Samsung Galaxy S8 is scheduled for release at a special event in New York on March 29, while Apple's iPhone 8 is expected to arrive in the third quarter of this year. [Also read: Samsung Galaxy S8 launch imminent as it gets 3C approval] Interestingly, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI has said in a note to investors that OLED in the iPhone 8 will attract consumers, but Galaxy S8 lacks "sufficiently attractive selling points," according to 9to5mac. He went on to say that Samsung's upcoming flagship may not do as well as its predecessor, Galaxy S7 and S7 edge following the debacle of Galaxy Note 7 last year. However, it may be noted that OLED technology is not new to Samsung as most of its devices feature it. What to expect from Samsung Galaxy S8: Samsung is expected to launch two variants of Galaxy S8, one with a 5.8-inch WQHD super AMOLED screen with 2560x2400p resolution + 3D curved glass, and the other (Galaxy S8 Plus) with a .2-inch WQHD super AMOLED screen with 2560x2400p resolution + 3D curved glass. Both the variants are expected to share similar features under the hood, including Samsung Exynos 9 series 8895 octa-core CPU or Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor (based on region of sale), Android 7.1 Nougat operating system, 4GB/6GB RAM, 64GB internal storage, 12MP dual-pixel camera with f/1.7 aperture and LED flash, 8MP front-snapper with f/1.7 aperture, and a 3,000mAh battery with fast Charging technology. What to expect from iPhone 8: Not much has been heard of iPhone 8 as it is still about six months away before seeing the light of day. Reports claim that its mass production would start in September, which means its release could be delayed. The flagship is expected to sport a 5.8-inch display with an OLED (organic light-emitting diode) screen and come with a wireless charger.

The wheel of dumb has turned yet again and now it’s time for Apple to shake in its well-chamfered boots at the next in a continuing series of Apple killers. Writing for The Motley Fool, Harsh Chauhan explains “Why Apple Should Be Scared of This Company.” (Tip o’ the antlers to Philip Speicher.) Is it because it’s a ghost? The Macalope hopes it’s because it’s a ghost. At least that would be a change of pace. This Chinese company is closing in on Apple’s market share. Dude. Apple and Samsung’s reign at the top of the smartphone market is under threat. A threat like never before! Or, at least since 2014. Yes, remember Xiaomi? They were 2014’s dire threat to Apple. In 2015, even, Ewan Spence gushed “Here’s The Smartphone That Will Give Xiaomi The Market Share To Rule The World.” But now, listen to the dulcet tones of the hit single: “Hate To Tell You, Bro, But That Didn’t Happen.” “Hugo Barra Leaves Xiaomi Amid Market-Share Struggles.” But other companies only exist inasmuch as they can be portrayed as Apple killers. One of the keys to Xiaomi’s success was supposedly its online sales strategy. The direct online sales strategy of the company has helped it make a big breakout in 2013. The key to Huawei’s success, according to Chauhan, will be its offline sales strategy. Huawei has a smart formula to win over customers in big smartphone markets—offline sales. Suffice it to say, whatever the strategy is that’s employed by the company competing against Apple, it will be a huge success. Even if it’s just taping the phones to the backs of alley cats and setting them free. [very serious voice] “We believe the ‘taping phones to the backs of alley cats and setting them free’ strategy will be a huge win for Meow-Meow Smartphone Corp. Apple is far behind in the ‘taping phones to the backs of alley cats and setting them free’ game.” But whose lunch has Huawei been stealing out of the refrigerator and eating even though it says “I love you and am so proud of you. —xoxo, Xiaomi’s mom” on it? Well, Huawei’s rise seems pretty perfectly timed to Xiaomi’s fall, and Apple’s market share has shifted around in the teens for years but there’s no overt trend downward, at least so far. Apple has always faced competition, sometimes stiff, sometimes not so. Its success rarely has much to do with the moves of others and more often its own ability to keep churning out exceptional devices.

The carmaker itself announced at the start of this week that consumers can expect to see Mazda vehicles with support for said software in the near future.  Despite announcing that its lineup of cars and SUVs will soon have the capability to pair up with iOS and Android devices and launch Apple CarPlay and Android Auto on their infotainment screens, the company did not indicate the timeline of this project. Mazda did not state which models are launching new iterations with the smartphone mirroring technology as well, as per Cars.com.  What’s good though is Mazda wants to bring the in-car technology to existing vehicles. Mazda spokesperson Jacob Brown said, both the Apple CarPlay and the Android Auto “should be retroactively upgradeable onto all Mazda Connect systems with a potentially minimal hardware addition needed.” According to Apple Insider, Brown’s statement means Mazda cars released as far back as 2014 will have the chance to have this retroactive upgrade to support the mirroring technology. This is definitely good news to many Mazda car owners, because other automakers only started rolling out support for the mirroring technology in their 2016 releases. Even Audi, BMW and Ford are a bit behind, for they are only rolling out support in their 2017 and 2018 vehicles.  “Mazda has been a CarPlay and Android Auto partner since 2014, so it is no secret that we are developing both systems to interface with our Mazda Connect infotainment system,” a statement from the Japanese company read. “Mazda does not yet have an official timeline for when these should be available or at what cost, however.” Apple CarPlay is already available in over 200 vehicles from various brands, including Chevrolet, Chrysler, Honda, Hyundai, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and Kia, as pointed out by MacRumors. The only global company that has yet to integrate the smart mirroring technology to its cars is Toyota.  Mazda rolling out Apple CarPlay and Android Auto support to its vehicles in the near future.

It is the “best-preserved example of an Apple-1 computer to appear on the market”, according to German auctioneers Team Breker. Released in 1976, the Apple-1 was the tech giant’s first ever product and is now a much sought-after collectors’ item.

This Apple-1 computer, which is in full working condition, is being sold by its original owner, a computer engineer from Berkeley, California. It is believed to be just one of eight working examples left in the world. It is also accompanied by an archive of original documents, including the preliminary operation manual, circuit diagrams and even notes of telephone calls between Steve Jobs and Wozniak in 1977. It is one of eight working examples left in the world  Credit: Caters  “The Apple-1 is already a legendary highlight of the great, young history of the computer,” a spokesperson for the auctioneers said. “This Apple-1 has the very rare, original NTI sign. “According to the Apple-1 register, compiled by Mike Willegal, there are only 60 sets still in existence, and a mere eight in working order! “This model has the serial number 01-0073 and is logged as the fourteenth in the register.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Apple tipped to release new iPads next week Apple is expected to announce its new line of iPads next week, according to a new report from MacRumors. Citing unnamed supply chain analysts, the report said Apple will “most likely” launch new products next week, between March 20 and 24. Apple is expected to announce a 10.5 inch iPad, 7.9-inch iPad mini, 9.7-inch iPad and 12.9-inch iPad Pro. The 10.5 inch iPad is tipped to be powered by A10X processor that is already present on the 12.9 inch iPad Pro. It is said to sport a new design, come with smaller bezels and without a home button.  A separate report from KGI in January had also stated that Apple will launch three iPad models this year- iPad with 10-10.5 inch bezel less display along with the 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2 and 9.7-inch iPad. The report says, Apple has not sent out invites yet and is expected to send them soon or hold an event later than expected, or, make an announcement via a press release. Meanwhile, mobile marketing firm Fiksu (via TechCrunch) claims new iPads are being tested out around San Francisco and Cupertino. The data from Fiksu shows that Apple is testing four different tablets. Fiksu has collected this data from tracking and attribution SDK. The company says iPad identifiers that were found along with their corresponding count are – iPad 7,1- 17; iPad 7,2- 11; iPad 7,3-5, and iPad 7,4-10. These models were said to be be running either the latest iOS 3 beta and iOS 11. Source "Apple tipped to release new iPads next week", 3 out of 5 based on 4 ratings.

Read on for the iPad Pro 2's likely release date, specs, new features, design & UK price rumours. Latest: a new 'inbetweener' 10.5-inch iPad Pro with a bezel-free screen and no Home button has been predicted for an early-April unveiling, as part of the inauguration of the new Apple Park campus by David Price | 16 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments When will the iPad Pro 2 be released in the UK (or whatever they call the next version of the iPad Pro for 2017)? And what new features will be added to the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPads? The iPad Pro 2 launch is an exciting prospect - but we may have to wait a bit longer. Apple made a splash in September 2015 when it unveiled its first giant tablet: a device known at the time only as the iPad Pro and equipped with a blockbuster 12.9-inch screen, quad speakers and a super-quick processor chip. The following March a smaller and frankly better 9.7-inch version of the iPad Pro came out, creating mild naming complications (we now call them the iPad Pro 12.9 and iPad Pro 9.7 respectively) and kindling a degree of regret in the hearts of early adopters. But we are now looking ahead to the future of the iPad Pro line. When will Apple release the new iPad Pro 2 for 2017, and what new features and design changes will this product incorporate? Will there be separate 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch editions of the iPad Pro 2 - will there even be a 7.9-inch model, a sort of iPad Pro mini, or a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2? Our iPad Pro 2 release date & new features rumour roundup weighs up all the clues, hints and evidence about the new iPad Pro models for 2017, as well as our wishlist of new features that are missing from the current generation of iPad Pro hardware. Check back regularly for the latest iPad Pro 2 rumours. Updated, 14 March 2017, with analyst predictions of new Apple announcements between 20 and 24 March; on 9 Mar, with predictions that the iPad Pro 2 will have an A10X processor, up to 6GB of RAM and a MacBook Pro-style 'Touch Bar' feature; and previously with rumours about a possible iPad Pro 2 delay, and a stunning concept video showing the iPad Pro with a 10.5in screen, a dual-lens camera and a new 'wine' colour option. Read next: iPad buying guide 2017 | Best cheap iPad Pro deals UK When will the iPad Pro 2 come out? Late March 2017 still seems a good bet, although it could be slightly later. (Read more: What to expect at Apple's March 2017 event.) "Reputable supply chain analysts" cited by MacRumors claim that Apple will announce new products in late March 2017, with the most likely dates between 20 and 24 March. The sources, who asked to remain anonymous, do not specify the products Apple will unveil, or even that there will be a press event to accompany the announcements; indeed, given the imminence of those dates time is starting to run out for one. (Apple generally sends out invitations about 10 days ahead of an event.) It's possible that Apple will quietly send out a press release and update its online stores; or maybe it will be a last-minute thing. DigiTimes, meanwhile, quotes "Taiwan-based supply chain makers" who say production of the planned 10.5-inch iPad has been brought forward to March (from a previously planned May-June schedule) and will be unveiled at an event in early April. This event will mark the inauguration of the new Apple Park campus, the site says. (Apple has announced that Apple Park will open in April 2017, although work on the headquarters will continue for some time afterwards.)  In January 2017 the Chinese-language site Wei Feng reported a rumour from Apple's Asian supply-chain, which claimed the iPad Pro 2 would launch in March 2017 alongside the Apple Pencil 2. "Wei Feng network through the supply chain that Apple will be held in March this year, iPad new conference, when a new generation of Apple Pencil stylus will also be unveiled," the site reports, as interpreted by Google Chrome's built-in translation. Then in February, new reports emerged from Japanese website Mac Otakara that backed up the claims at the iPad Pro 2 would arrive in March, also suggesting that there would be a new 7.9in iPad Pro, 9.7in iPad Pro, 10.5in iPad Pro and a 12.9in iPad Pro. During Apple's September 2016 event, there was no mention of the iPad line (focusing instead on the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2), while its October event showcased a smart if costly new MacBook Pro. If it had a new iPad Pro up its sleeve, surely Apple could have found time at one of these events to mention it... which suggests to us that the iPad Pro 2 is being held back until spring 2017. March is generally when Apple holds its first event of the year. However, DigiTimes believes Apple will delay the release date of some 2017 iPads: namely the new 10.5in iPad, which we go into detail about below, and the iPad Pro 2. The site claims that Apple will announce the iPad Pro 2, along with a the 10.5in iPad and a cheaper 9.7in iPad to replace the iPad Air 2, at an event in March. While the new 9.7in iPad should ship fairly soon after the announcement, sources claim the iPad Pro 2 and 10.5in iPad won't be released until May or June. Time will tell, and we'll keep you in the loop. One iPad launch event, or two? As with the two strands of iPhone models - the mid-size iPhone 7 and large-screen iPhone 7 Plus, both launched in September 2016, and the smaller iPhone SE, released in March 2016 - there are two schools of thought here. Either Apple will unify the two Pro brands into a single annual update event, or it will continue to update half the models in spring and the other half in autumn. Both theories have downsides. If, as now looks likely, Apple does a full refresh (9.7-in and 12.9-inch together) in March 2017, then the current hardware will be starting to feel old before then - the original Pro will be 18 months old, which is a long time to be the most expensive tablet on Apple's books. Then again, the company would have been in almost as tricky a position if it did a full refresh in September, presumably upsetting a bunch of people who just bought new devices. Three major iPad updates in the space of 12 months might just be taking the mickey. There's also something a bit messy, a bit un-Apple, about having two press event to announce what would essentially amount to two SKUs of the same product line. I think the company will want to keep things simple. A final thought, however, is that people don't update their iPads as often as their iPhones: only 6 percent of the respondents to our poll said they get a new iPad every year. It's therefore debatable whether Apple actually needs to bring out new iPads this often. It could probably switch to a biennial release schedule without causing much of a problem. Read next: iPad Air 3 rumours | iPad mini 5 rumours | Apple Pencil 2 rumours Will Apple launch a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro? The latest rumours suggest that after the lack of an iPad Pro update in autumn 2016, Apple will make up for this in 2017 by launching an entirely new size of iPad. Ming-Chi Kuo, a market analyst with a strong track record, has published a report making predictions about Apple's moves over the next couple of years. Kuo is cautious in his iPad sales predictions - cutting a previous estimate of 45 to 50 million for the year to 35 to 40 million, partly because of a lack of new products in the near term: despite a comparatively strong performance in Q3 2016, iPad sales remain flat - but argues that Apple will sell three sizes of iPad. There will be a 12.9-inch Pro, a 9.7-inch regular iPad and a new 10.5-inch Pro, Kuo predicts, with the smallest offered as a low-cost option with a lower-powered processor as well as a smaller screen. Kuo's reasoning is that an 'inbetweener' 10.5-inch iPad Pro would sell well to the education and business sectors: "If the iPad comes in a larger size, such as a 10.5-inch model, we believe it will be helpful to bid for tenders within the commercial and education markets. As a result, we expect Apple to launch a 10.5-inch iPad Pro in 2017." These three iPad sizes don't include the 7.9-inch form factor of the iPad mini. Apple could continue to sell the mini alongside the three other iPads, but the success of the iPhone 6 Plus and the iPhone 7 Plus means Apple may feel that this area is covered by its phablet offerings. But we'll discuss the prospects of an 'iPad Pro mini' in the next section. This new 10.5in or even 10.9in size is rumoured to come with a bezel-free design, as it will accommodate the larger screen in a smaller form-factor. This might potentially see the end of the home button. Ming-Chi Kuo has reiterated his prediction in a January 2017 report, once again claiming that new iPad models for Q2 2017 will be 12.9-inch, 10-10.5-inch, and 9.7-inch.  He notes that the 12.9-inch model will be "the second generation of the existing 12.9" iPad Pro," that the new in-between size will be "the high-end model equipped with a narrow bezel design," and that the 9.7-inch model will be "the low-priced option." The first two will run on a new A10X chip, with the latter on an A9 chip. With that in mind, it looks like the likeliest outcome would be for the 12.9-inch model to be a new iPad Pro 2, the 10-10.5-inch model to be a smaller Pro, and the lower-price 9.7-inch model simply branded as the iPad. Once again, there was no mention of a successor to the 7.9-inch mini, adding fuel to the speculation that it will be phased out by Apple - unless it plans to stick the 'mini' name on the 9.7-inch model. Kuo also notes that while he expects another decline in the volume of iPads shipped in 2017 - down to 35-37 million - this is set to be a smaller decline than seen in 2016, and will be offset by a rise in the average selling price of the devices, leading him to conclude that the "worst has passed for Apple's iPad." Will there be an iPad Pro mini? Following the launch of the 9.7-inch Pro it's now firmly established that the Pro brand doesn't just refer to Apple's biggest tablets - instead, it refers to a set of specs and features and, in a way that's hard to define, any tablet that sits at the top of Apple's range. If we accept that a 9.7-inch tablet can be an iPad Pro, could we get a 7.9-inch Pro as well? The truth is that there's no concrete reason why there can't be a 7.9-inch iPad Pro 2, but for various reasons we still don't expect Apple to do this. For one thing, unlike the Air line-up, the minis are still being updated; the mini 4 came out at the same event as the first iPad Pro, which suggests that Apple plans to keep both brands going at the same time. And besides, the Pro brand has always existed in opposition to a lower-end alternative: the MacBook Pro sits opposite the MacBook Air (and plain MacBook); the Mac Pro opposite the iMac; and so on. Apple can't just call every tablet a Pro. We're starting to suspect that the Air brand may be phased out across Apple's laptop and tablet departments, but there still needs to be two lines left in each of these areas. Apple still sell a MacBook Pro and a 12-inch MacBook, we expect; in the same way, we'd expect there to be iPad Pro models and iPad mini models. To read more about the iPad mini 5 - or the iPad Pro mini - then take a look at our iPad mini 5 rumour roundup. What design changes will we see in the iPad Pro 2? Let's talk next about the iPad Pro 2's design. Apple Pencil changes Mac Observer has reported, via Weibo, that the Apple Pencil 2 might include a magnet to attach to the side of the iPad Pro - much like with Microsoft's Surface Pro models. This rumour was backed up in January 2017, when a report by the Czech-language website LetemSvetemApplem also claimed that magnets will enable you to attach the Apple Pencil to the side of the iPad Pro 2, citing "information directly from suppliers in China". The site also predicts that the next Apple Pencil will have a clip on the side, like a pen, which would stop it from rolling away across the nearest table - and also mean you can clip it to your pocket. Read more: Apple Pencil 2 rumours Folding iPad We'll start with the most out-there rumour. Analyst Gene Munster - he of the relentless and widely mocked 'Apple television' predictions, who in my opinion was somewhat vindicated when it turned out that Apple had been developing a telly but gave up on the plan - has predicted that Apple is going to make a foldable iPad. The prediction, reported by Apple Must, cites recent patent activity that shows Apple is exploring the idea of a foldable iPhone, and extrapolates this concept to the tablet sphere (where, because of the larger form factor of the devices, a folding design probably makes more sense). The timing of the prediction is interesting, coming as it does shortly after the end of the first series of Westworld, HBO's violent and disorienting TV series based on the 1970s Yul Brynner film of the same name. In Westworld, the human programmers who set the behaviours and personalities of the park's western-themed android inhabitants do all their programming on slick foldable tablets. The foldable tablet designs on the show make a lot of sense and look fantastic. (The idea of programmers working exclusively on tablets presently seems less plausible.) Bezel-free screen Macotakara, a Japanese-language Apple site, predicts that the iPad Pro 2 will have a largely bezel-free screen and no Home button, citing sources in Taiwan. The bezel (the non-screen area around the edge of the screen on an iPad, which you hold while using the device) will apparently be removed from the bottom of the iPad Pro, meaning the Home button will disappear, and Touch ID will have to be integrated into the screen itself. Oddly, the site predicts that the bezel will remain at the top of the iPad Pro 2, and will continue to house the front-facing FaceTime camera. 'Touch Bar' menu bar An odd but increasingly widespread rumour proposes that the iPhone 8 will feature a function area, somewhat like the Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro. Now the rumour has mutated - apparently the iPad Pro 2 is going to get a Touch Bar function area too! It's not an immediately compelling concept, given that the Touch Bar on the MacBook offers a mini touchscreen strip between the non-touch-sensitive main screen and non-customisable keyboard - a sort of overlap between the two - so you don't need to reach up to use a full touchscreen and get tired arms, but on iPhone/iPad there's no such compromise to be made. The entire screen is accessible, and this would appear to be a reduction in functionality compared to a full-chassis conventional touchscreen. The thinking seems to be that this will take the place of the Home button and lower bezel area of the iPad, replacing these with a customisable touch-sensitive area that will ordinarily be occupied by frequently used menus and icons. What isn't clear is whether this area will be accessible when viewing photos and videos full screen. Thicker design Macotakara also believes that the 12.9-inch model of the iPad Pro 2 will be 3mm thicker than its predecessor, and says the middle-size model of the iPad Pro will have a 10.9-inch screen, not 10.5-inch as has been rumoured elsewhere. What tech specs will the iPad Pro 2 include? Let's look next at the internal changes expected from the next iPad. Processor This is an easy one. We strongly expect the iPad Pro 2 to include a modified version of the A10 Fusion chip featured in the iPhone 7 - a strategy Apple usually follows with the iPad it releases shortly after a new iPhone. This modified processor will probably be called the A10X, or A10X Fusion. The Chinese-language site Anzhuo agrees, predicting "iPad Pro 2 will be equipped with A10X chip". RAM The iPad Pro came with 2GB of RAM (in the case of the 9.7-inch model) or 4GB (on the 12.90-inch version). We're fairly sure Apple will offer 4GB across the iPad Pro 2 range, but some believe it might be more generous. Anzhuo, in the same article linked above, thinks we can expect 4GB and 6GB options - matched presumably to the medium and large-screen models, although the site doesn't specify this. Leaked photos, videos and concept illustrations of the iPad Pro 2 This is where we will post the best and most convincing leaked photos and concept designs and videos created by artists and designers. Still from iPad Pro 2 concept video Concept video of iPad Pro 2 We'll start with this stunning concept video showing the iPad Pro 2 in all its (imagined) glory. The iPad depicted here has a 10.5-inch, 4K screen and a dual-lens rear-facing camera, and comes in six colours: adding white, purple ('wine'), and the black and Jet Black options from the iPhone 7 to the currently available gold and Rose Gold. Photos of iPad Pro 2 AppleInsider has published two photos ostensibly showing the iPad Pro 2, which were sent into the site by an anonymous reader. The images, like most Apple hardware leaks, are said to originate from the Asian supply chain; in this case it's said to be an employee at a Chinese supplier who has taken and leaked the photos. Both photos show the same onscreen imagery - the General > About tab of the Settings app, chosen presumably because it includes model number designations and other details that can corroborate the photo's legitimacy. (But, as AppleInsider observes, such details are not difficult to spoof, so the photos may yet be fake.) The About page says the depicted iPad is model MH1C2CD/F: that certainly sounds right, since that designation hasn't been given to any publicly known iPads, while broadly following the conventions of earlier Pro models. (The 128GB cellular 12.9-inch iPad Pro, for instance, is designated ML3K2B/A. By contrast, the iPad Air 2 uses a slightly different format: the 128GB cellular model is MH332B/A.)  Although, we should note that spoofing the model number can be changed relatively easily. More so, the model shows only 12GB of available storage - this can however be a test version, where 12GB of internal storage is more than sufficient. As one would expect, the depicted iPad is running a version of iOS 10 - you can tell because Siri gets its own top-level tab in the Settings app rather than a sub-category within General. Unfortunately - or conveniently, if you're cynical - it's virtually impossible to deduce anything else about the device from the shots, which don't show hardware ports or buttons, and have nothing else in frame with which to compare size of screen and so on. About all this tells us is that a new iPad Pro is probably on its way in the next few months.  Once we know more information or sent more details on the screenshots we will update this article. Our iPad Pro 2 new features wishlist The iPad Pro tablets are great, but they're not perfect. Here are a few new features and design tweaks we'd like to see in the second-gen iPad Pro. Bring the 9.7in Pro's new features across to the 12.9in model An issue we've addressed several times across this article concerns the disappointment felt by a number of 12.9-inch iPad Pro owners when the cheaper and in many respects better 9.7-inch iPad Pro was launched six months later. So the first thing we'd ask for is consistency. To achieve this the larger Pro model needs to get: A 12-megapixel rear-facing camera (up from 8Mp) A 5Mp front-facing camera (up from 1.2Mp) 4K video recording Live Photos Display with True Tone and 'wide colour' A 32GB cellular buying option A pink colour option Better keyboard accessory (for 9.7-inch model) The Pros are explicitly aimed at business users, and for this reason it was critical to get some good keyboard accessories. Apple's own Smart Keyboard is a strong offering in the larger size - even though it's expensive, and Macworld is divided on the issue of whether Logitech's less attractive Create keyboard offers a better typing experience - but the 9.7-inch version is a different matter. As a result of the smaller keys typing accuracy is weaker; the lower weight means it feels less satisfying under the fingers. (The design looks great, however, and is magnificently slim and light from a portability point of view. And the Smart Connector - and the fact that you never have to worry about battery life - is wonderful too.) We feel that Apple needs to create - or persuade a third-party accessory maker to create - a 9.7-inch keyboard you can really type on. And this may involve some compromises. It may need to have a foldout design (sounds ugly, right?) so that it could fit in larger keys. It might need to be heavier (thereby reducing portability) in order to feel better and reduce movement on the desk. But whatever happens, the smaller Pro needs an updated accessory line-up in order to compete as a business tool. Read next: Best iPad keyboards More (smaller) Home screen icons This is a software change rather than a hardware one, but it's frustrating that Apple doesn't allow you to fit more app icons on the screen of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. At present you're allowed 20 app icons (or folders), plus up to six in the Dock, and this is exactly the same that you're allowed on the 9.7-inch iPads, which feels like a waste of the extra space. By default, the icons are the same size, so there's far more empty space on the screen. You can select a zoom view, with larger icons, but we'd prefer the option to have a grid of 5x6 icons, plus a seventh icon in the Dock. iOS 10 We expect the new iPad Pro 2 to ship with iOS 10 pre-installed. Apple's latest mobile operating system brought more than 100 new and updated features. However, no special iPad-only features that have yet been announced or discovered on iOS 10 - so we hope Apple will address this during their March 2017 presentation. iOS 11 will come out in autumn 2017; if the iPad Pro 2 doesn't come out until then - which would be a disappointment, frankly - then it will come with that OS preinstalled instead. Processor We expect the iPad Pro 2 to be shipped with the A10X, a variant on the A10 Fusion processor found in the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Rumours suggest the A10X will be an upgraded A9X built on a smaller FinFET technology. This would point towards a release date of spring 2017, with a new 10nm processor included within the iPad Pro 2. Might we also see 4K (3840x2160) recording abilities? Some rumours suggest that the feature will be integrated within the OS, as the likes of the nVidia and AMD mobile-generation graphics cards might make an appearance within the iPad Pro 2.  Design & display There are certain rumours suggesting that the iPad Pro 2 will feature an OLED or a flexible AMOLED display. Both are possibilities, but it's unlikely Apple will change their display manufacturing process. Nevertheless, it's a speculation some have - as Apple is losing its market share in the tablet industry and with ever growing competition, analysts predict Apple needs to react in a drastic fashion to interest consumers to stay or switch to an Apple product. Some say that the next iPad Pro 2 will feature a borderless design, providing a much better user experience and again, a more unique tablet in the market.  It's also rumoured that the new 12.9in iPad will be 0.3mm thicker, which would be a surprise - especially if it adds better battery life. Through this rumour by Japanese site Makotakara (spotted by 9to5Mac), we could see various design changes, such as the removal of the famous home button - not only on the iPad, but also on the upcoming iPhone 8.

I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents When is the iPad Pro mini/iPad mini 5 release date? What will the iPad Pro mini/iPad mini 5 look like? What are the rumoured new features? iPad Pro mini/iPad mini 5 tech specs How much will the iPad Pro mini/iPad mini 5 cost in the UK? Our iPad Pro mini/iPad mini 5 new features wishlist When will Apple release the iPad mini 5 in the UK? (Or will it rebrand its smallest iPad as the 'iPad Pro mini'?) The iPad mini 5, you might say, is overdue. It's getting on for a year and a half since the iPad mini 4 was unveiled in September 2015, with significant design changes, updated specs and new features that make it one of the best 8in tablets around, and we can't help but wonder what's next for the iPad mini. We're eagerly awaiting word on the iPad mini 5's release date - or potentially the launch of an iPad Pro mini, if rumours are to be believed. Read on to explore the evidence to suggest that a new iPad mini is coming soon, and new iPad mini 5 features and specs to expect when it arrives. Will 2017's iPad mini 5 see another major overhaul, or will it be a damp squib like the mini 3? With this in mind, we've done a bit of research and gathered all of the iPad mini 5 rumours, hints, clues and other evidence in one place. We've also got an iPad mini 5 new features wishlist. Updated, 14 March 2017, with analyst predictions that Apple will announce new products between 20 and 24 March; and previously with rumours suggesting new iPads will be announced alongside the Apple Pencil 2 and iPhone SE. Read next: Best iPad buying guide 2017 | Best cheap iPad deals UK When is the iPad Pro mini/iPad mini 5 release date? The iPad range looks very likely to see a refresh in March 2017 (read more: What to expect at Apple's March 2017 event), and the latest rumours suggest that the iPad mini will be included in that update, although it may well become an iPad Pro mini rather than an iPad mini 5. That's according to Japanese website Mac Otakara, which adds that the new iPad mini will have a Smart Connector, a True Tone display, four speakers and a 12 mega-pixel rear-facing iSight camera. Apple will announce new products in late March 2017, and the most likely dates are between 20 and 24 March, according to "reputable supply chain analysts" cited by MacRumors. The sources, who have chosen to remain anonymous, do not specify the products Apple will unveil, or even that there will be any kind of press event to accompany the announcements; indeed, given those dates time seems to be running out for one. (Apple generally sends out invitations about 10 days ahead of an event.) It's possible that Apple will quietly send out a press release and update its online stores rather than gathering up the press, as it has sometimes done with lower-profile product updates in the past; or perhaps it will be a last-minute thing. Chinese-language news site Wei Feng claimed in January that updated iPads would be announced in March 2017 alongside the Apple Pencil 2 - a prediction it based on an anonymous source in Apple's Asian supply chain. "Wei Feng network through the supply chain that Apple will be held in March this year, iPad new conference, when a new generation of Apple Pencil stylus will also be unveiled," wrote the site (or rather, as Google Chrome's translation function interpreted the site's words). The Mac Observer also reported, via Weibo, that the Apple Pencil 2 might include a magnet to attach to the side of the iPad Pro - much like with Microsoft's Surface Pro models. We had previously expected an iPad mini to be announced at Apple's September or October 2016 events, but those came and went with no sign of Apple's 7.9in tablet. Instead, the iPad mini 5 or iPad Pro mini has looked likely for some time to arrive in March 2017 alongside the iPad Pro 2, and the above rumour adds to this theory's credibility. The iPad Pro was released on 31 March 2016 so we're expecting an iPad event to take place (potentially in Apple's new Campus 2) around that time again this year. Having said that, oft reliable site DigiTimes has reported that the iPads won't enter mass production until early 2017, meaning we could be faced with a June 2017 or later release for the iPads.  Past behaviour In the past, the iPad mini 4 was released in September, when Apple hosted a press event to show off the iPhone 6s, the iPhone 6s Plus, the iPad Pro and the new Apple TV as well as the new iPad mini. The mini 4's September arrival was mildly surprising, as the original iPad mini, iPad mini 2 and iPad mini 3 were all launched at October events, each time coming a month after a September iPhone launch. In 2015, however, Apple didn't have an October event, lumping its new iPhone and iPad announcements into a single night. On the other hand, Apple has added a new date to its calendar earlier in 2015: a March event where the company released new Macs and the Apple Watch.  At Apple's March 2016 event, the company announced its new iPhone SE, 9.7in iPad Air Pro, iOS 9.3 and new Apple Watch straps. Looking at the current trend and rumours, we think Apple will release the iPad mini 5, or iPad Pro Mini to be released at the 2017 March event. It is also rumoured that it might be named the iPad Pro mini because of its new rumoured launch date - as it would follow the iPad Pro line-up. With most iOS device launches, the product itself doesn't arrive in shops for a little over a week after the unveiling, but Apple managed to take the wraps off the iPad mini 4 and announce its retail launch at the same time. As for the UK release date, that's likely to be the same date as the primary launch in the US. That's what happened with the mini 4, at any rate.

While it may seem that we're overdue an update to the iPad mini line, some analyst reports suggest that instead Apple may be phasing the mini out of its lineup.  Noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo issued a report in January 2017 suggesting that Apple would announce three new iPads in March 2017: a 12.9-inch successor to the iPad Pro, a new 10-10.5-inch "high-end model," and a 9.7-inch "low-priced option." Kuo didn't predict the release of any new iPad mini models, but did note that there will be a rise in the average selling price of iPads thanks to "decreasing exposure to iPad mini," suggesting that there may not be any new models on the horizon. Instead the new 9.7-inch iPad might take up the "budget" spot in Apple's tablet lineup. With that in mind, the rest of this article is predicated on the assumption that there will be an iPad mini 5, though that is no longer certain. Podcast - Apple's March 2016 event Design: What will the iPad Pro mini/iPad mini 5 look like? The iPad mini 4 has plenty to recommend it, but in broad design terms it's actually pretty close to the very first iPad mini; it's been slimmed down and had various features added, but the two devices look largely the same. Can we expect a more radical redesign this time around - something like the jump from rounded-corner iPhone 3GS to the sharper-edged iPhone 4? It's possible, but we haven't yet heard anything to back up the theory that Apple is tearing up its old design manuals and starting from scratch. Early hints suggest that, as before, we could be looking at a more conservative redesign and gentle, less noticeable improvements. Thinner design So far, speculation suggests that the iPad Air 3 and iPad mini 5 will be even thinner than their predecessors (which are already an incredible 6.1mm), at just 5mm. It's certainly possible - the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 tablets are already 5.6mm thick, but we're not sure it's entirely necessary. 7000-series aluminium chassis The iPad mini 5 could also have a different chassis, this time made with 7000-series aluminium like the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus to make it more durable, particularly if it is indeed thinner to help prevent the tablet from bending. Flexible display While we're a little sceptical about the iPad mini 5 having a flexible or possibly even foldable display, recent patents suggest that Apple has been working on the technology for the iPhone for a number of years. The technology would arguably be more important on an iPad, allowing users to 'fold up' the large screen of the iPad and put it in their pocket when not in use. We assume that Apple is still experimenting with the technology, and is therefore still a number of years away from release. Smart Connector The iPad Pro models (both 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch) feature a Smart Connector: a set of data and power ports on their lefthand edge, when held in portrait orientation, which connect to a keyboard case. For what it's worth we think the Smart Keyboard available for the 11.9-inch iPad Pro is a lot better than its smaller cousin, but even that is a better option for long-term typing than the software keyboard on the iPad's screen. If the iPad mini 5 gets a Smart Connector it could have a (probably limited but still handy) Smart Keyboard of its own, as well as opening up possibilities for other powered accessories. Read next: How to set up a new iPad | How to speed up a slow iPad | Which iPad do I have? What are the rumoured new features? It's believed that the 3D Touch pressure-sensitive screen tech which Apple currently deploys in its iPhone 6s and 6s Plus only isn't ready to make the move to the iPad line - observers contend that it won't pop up in a spring iPad Air 3 launch - but we think this is only a matter of time. It's possible this would be something Apple can roll out in the mini 5 in the autumn, but we may have to wait until a future update. Cult of Mac is among the sites to predict that the next generation of iPads - the iPad Air 3 primarily, but any changes are sure to make it across to the mini line-up when they are next refreshed - could be waterproof and dust-resistant. For more thoughts on new features to expect in the iPad mini 5, be sure to check our (regularly updated) roundup of iOS 10; the iPad mini 5 will come with iOS 10 pre-installed, and this is sure to add a raft of new features and some tweaks to the interface design. With iOS 10, we see the inclusion of a few features to be included. Be sure to check our dedicated iOS 10 article for the latest developments.  iPad Pro mini/iPad mini 5 tech specs It's believed that the iPad mini 5's thinner design would be made possible by a new, smaller battery, says Cult of Mac: while the mini 5's battery unit may have a lower capacity than the 5,124mAh component in the mini 4, superior battery technology mean it will be able to match its predecessor's real-world battery performance.  Apple isn't expected to up the camera quality in the iPad mini 5, so expect 8Mp on the rear and 1.2Mp on the front. We'd like to see a better front-facing camera, though, particularly for FaceTime. It will be interesting to see if the iPad's chassis has a camera bump. The processor should be improved to an A9 processor over the A8, so we'll see a speed bump and improved graphics for the iPad mini 5, and we could also see an improvement when it comes to the display's resolution. We're certain Apple will scrap the 16GB model and will instead go for 32GB, 64GB and 128GB models of the iPad mini 5. We base these assumption on the recent drop of the 16GB model on the iPhone 7 line, and we're sure to see it continue through Apple's product line.  How much will the iPad Pro mini/iPad mini 5 cost in the UK? The iPad mini 4 was released on 9 September 2015 at $399 USD / £319 GBP / $569 AUD / $439 CAD for the 16GB Wi-Fi only model. The 64GB and 128GB models were £399 and £479 respectively with cellular connectivity adding another £100 on top of the listed price. Since its release, the mini 4 can no longer be found in a 16GB variant, with the Wi-Fi 32GB found for £379, 128GB at £469, and the Cellular variant at £499 for 32GB and £589 for 128GB. We expect the mini 5 to be released at the same price point, with the iPad mini 5 coming in at £379 for the base model. Given Apple has already axed the 16GB model, we don't expect it to make an appearance in 2017. We would be slightly surprised to see only 32- and 128GB models with the mini 5, where we see Apple offering a 32-, 64- and 128GB variants. As soon as we know more about its price and storage option sizes, we will update this article. Our iPad Pro mini/iPad mini 5 new features wishlist We've looked above at the new features we think are likely to appear in the iPad mini 5. But what are the features we'd like to see? Here's our iPad mini 5 wishlist. 3D Touch Given the better integration of iOS 10 and 3D Touch, we see the feature being included on the iPad mini 5. Apple's mobile operating platform also integrates well with Live Photos, which is another feature we expect to see included. An obvious one to start with, but we are highly enamoured of the 3D Touch pressure-sensitive screens on our 6s-generation iPhones and would love to see the feature ported to the iPad mini line-up. We'll take Live Photos too, if you're offering. No headphone port We're going out on a limb here, and we know this isn't a fashionable point of view: after the release of the iPhone 7, there might be a removal of the headphone jack on iPads too. While the iPad mini 4 is already wonderfully slim and light, removing a port streamlines the design on the outside and makes space on the inside: the mini 5 could be even slimmer, or perhaps squeeze in a little more battery capacity. When it comes to implementing new features and entering new market segments, Apple is widely felt to be the slow-turning ocean liner of mobile tech, but it's a fast and usually prescient mover when it comes to ditching soon-to-be-outdated technologies. Fast charging As a general rule, the more portable a computing device is, the more dependent it is on battery power - yet conversely, it'll be relying on a smaller battery unit. The iPad Pro is the least likely iPad to see prolonged usage on the go (most of our Pro use has been desk- or sofa-bound, within easy reach of a power supply), but it has easily the best battery performance of any iPad we've tested. Which is a roundabout way of saying that battery performance is a massive priority for the iPad mini 5, and efficient and convenient charging is an important element of that. We'd like Apple to implement its own version of Qualcomm's Quick Charge technology, so that you can give the mini 5 a quick blast of power in the coffee shop before proceeding on your merry way. We've grown used to the ultra-fast charging offered by the Apple Pencil's little battery, and would like to see something of the same experience (although based on new technology) brought to the iPads themselves. microSD card slot Aside from being an extraordinarily long shot (Apple has never produced an iPhone, iPad or iPod with removable storage, and realistically never will), it might sound odd to ask Apple to streamline the external design by removing a widely used port, and then in the next section ask Apple to clog up the design with an additional card slot. But let's put it this way: if we're obliged to have one non-essential external port, I'd take this over the 3.5mm headphone jack. Apple's storage policies have long been frustrating. The substantial step up in price when you select a higher storage allocation, when we know that storage is incredibly cheap; the removal of the 'sweet spot' 32GB option, so that many buyers fall between the stools of not enough (16GB) and more than you need (64GB); and the refusal to countenance either upgrades or removal storage, so that whatever you buy is what you're stuck with for the lifetime of that product. Full Apple Pay With the inclusion and integration of Apple Pay with macOS Sierra and the Apple Watch, we see its inclusion with other Apple products even more likely. The iPad mini 5, would be a product which would benefit from having Apple Pay integration. We therefore expect to see it included if and when the iPad is released. Like the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3, the mini 4 cannot use the full, in-store version of Apple Pay. (You can buy things online using Apple Pay and verify the payment using your iPad mini's Touch ID, but you can't beep an iPad on the contactless hub in a shop.) This is because it doesn't have an NFC antenna. There probably won't be a huge number of people queuing up to pay in-store using their iPad mini, but the gap in portability between the smallest iPad and the largest iPhone is getting perilously small. (It could be argued that the iPhone 6s Plus has more in common with the iPad mini 4 than with the iPhone 5s.) Given the iPad mini's suitability as an ereader, there ought to be a solid niche of commuters who'd appreciate the small convenience of using an iPad mini to pay for Underground journeys, and we suspect that it would be a popular move for a variety of other reasons. Waterproofing We mentioned just now that the iPad mini is a terrific ereader, and you know what that means: poolside use. We think the mini line-up needs waterproofing just as much as the iPhones. Apple has a peculiar attitude to waterproofing. As people are increasingly noticing, the Apple Watch and two most recent iPhone generations are actually reasonably resistant to water immersion, but you wouldn't know it from the technical specs for these products; unlike pretty much all other tech firms, Apple doesn't send its devices off to get IP-rated. (An IP - or Ingress Protection - rating consists of two digits. The first rates its ability to withstand solid intrusions on a scale of 0 to 6; the second rates fluid resistance on a scale of 0 to 6. So the Samsung Galaxy S7 smartphone, which is rated as IP68, is top of the class.) Waterproofing for most companies is a way of bragging about products' capabilities, but Apple seemingly prefers it to be a nice surprise when your iPhone 6s takes a dip and then doesn't die a watery death. But we'd like to be on rather firmer ground when we take an iPad mini 5 to the beach. iPad Pro mini/iPad mini 5 new features wishlist: Pink option That's self-explanatory, isn't it? I like the pink iPhone colour option. Don't judge me. That's it for now. Check back regularly for the latest iPad mini 5 feature rumours, as we'll be updating this very article as new evidence and speculation emerges, and when the first leaked photos appear.

Latest: reports (and a supply-chain source) claim iPad Air 3 will launch in March of this year, alongside the Apple Pencil 2, and an analyst has predicted that Apple will release a folding iPad. by David Price | 14 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents Release date Design Tech specs Price New features wishlist When will Apple launch the iPad Air 3 in the UK? And what design, tech specs, new features and UK price should we expect from Apple's next 9.7-inch iPad, whether it's called iPad Air 3, iPad Pro 2, just plain iPad, New iPad or something else? Finally, is Apple killing off the iPad Air brand - or even the entire Air brand, laptops and all? The iPad Air 3's release date is overdue. The most recent mid-size iPad was announced in March 2016, but it wasn't the new iPad Air 3 some had expected; instead, Apple unveiled its 9.7-inch iPad Pro, featuring improved specs, design tweaks and more. Does this mean Apple is going to discontinue the iPad Air line, sticking to Pro branding for both 9.7- and 12.9-inch iPads in future? (And maybe even releasing an iPad Pro mini or iPad Pro 7.9in instead of the iPad mini 5?) Or will it carry on releasing 9.7-inch iPads in both Pro and Air configurations, much as it did with the MacBook Air and Pro? In this article we look at rumours about the the iPad Air 3's release date in the UK, and discuss new features and design changes. Bookmark this page and check back regularly for the latest information: as rumours circulate and news leaks out, we'll update it with everything you need to know about the new iPad Air 3: design, features, size and specifications, the differences between the iPad Air 3 and the current iPad Air 2, the iPad Air 3's UK launch date and likely UK price, and much more. If you're more interested in the current iPad range, read our reviews of the 12.9in iPad Pro, 9.7in iPad Pro and iPad Air 2, and of the iPad mini 4 and iPad mini 2. And remember to check our iPad buying guide 2017 and roundup of the best cheap iPad deals UK. Updated 8 March with a tenuous April event rumour; on 15 February 2017, with news of iPad Air 2 stock shortages, suggesting a product update soon; on 19 Jan, with a rumour that new iPads will launch in March 2017, alongside the Apple Pencil 2; on 9 Jan, with a new report predicting three new iPad models in March; on 15 Dec 2016, to talk about predictions of a Westworld-style folding iPad; and on 29 Nov, to discuss rumours of a new line of iPads with a 10.9-inch screen. Read next: iPad Pro 2 rumours | Apple predictions 2017 iPad Air 3 release date rumours UK: Release date If an iPad Air 3 is on the way then March 2017 is the most likely release date. But it's by no means certain that Apple will release another iPad Air model. With no new iPads appearing at either Apple's September iPhone 7 launch or at its October MacBook Pro event, March 2017 looks like the next logical timing for an iPad refresh, although whether these will include an Air model seems less certain. The most likely dates for Apple announcements are between 20 and 24 March, according to anonymous "reputable supply chain analysts" cited by MacRumors. The sources, who asked to remain anonymous, are convinced that some announcements will come from Apple in March but do not specify the products Apple will unveil, or even that there will be a press event to accompany the announcements; indeed, given the imminence of those dates time is starting to run out for one. (Apple usually sends out invitations about 10 days ahead of an event, and it's the 14th at time of writing.) It's possible that Apple will quietly send out a press release and update its online stores, something it has occasionally done before; or maybe it will be a last-minute thing. In January 2017 the Chinese-language tech news site Wei Feng reported a rumour from Apple's Asian supply-chain, claiming that updated iPads would be announced in March 2017 alongside the Apple Pencil 2. "Wei Feng network through the supply chain that Apple will be held in March this year, iPad new conference, when a new generation of Apple Pencil stylus will also be unveiled," Wei Feng writes, as interpreted by Google Chrome's translation function. The Mac Observer also reported, via Weibo, that the Apple Pencil 2 might include a magnet to attach to the side of the iPad Pro - much like with Mircosoft's Surface Pro models.  There's more reason to expect new iPad models in March, as AppleInsider has reported that the current iPad Air 2 models are going out of stock at many retailers - something Apple typically allows to happen before it phases a product out and introduces new models.  Amazon, Best Buy, Staples and more are reporting either no or low stock on several iPad Air 2 models, in both the UK and the US, and even the UK Apple store lists a two to three week wait for a new iPad Air 2. Long, long ago - and wrongly - we predicted an October 2015 launch date for the iPad Air 3. This seemed logical: the iPad Air 2 was unveiled on 16 October 2014; the iPad Air 1 on 22 October 2013. This is Apple's traditional iPad release schedule, and the announcement of iOS 9 at WWDC 2015 on 8 June, same as every year, suggested that things were proceeding as usual. But 2015 was a surprising year for iPad announcements. At the September press briefing, where we would traditionally expect to hear about iPhones, iPhones and more iPhones, Apple gave the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus some company, in the form of the giant iPad Pro, and the petite iPad mini 4. But iPad Air 3 came there none, either at the September event or in October 2015. Apple instead refreshed its mid-size iPad range the following March, and called it the iPad Pro 9.7in. Just to add to the speculation, Apple World Today recently came to an admittedly tenuous conclusion that nevertheless could hold some water. It noticed that in the US, many Apple Stores are showing stock of the 12.9in iPad Pro as 'Available Apr 4'. This could of course simply be a stock issue, but it could well mean that Tuesday 4 April is when Apple will host its first event at the new Apple Park. While we certainly hope new iPads are only that far off, we'll have to wait for some more concrete information before furiously circling dates on the kitchen calendar. We checked stock of the 12.9n iPad Pro in London, and all stock is available on 30 March. It could well be then, which makes sense as its a year after the iPhone SE and 9.7in iPad Pro launch and the day after Samsung's inevitably headline grabbing Galaxy S8 launch. iPad Air 3 release date UK: March 2017 launch - but iPad Air 3 'will be last in Air line' Some pundits - reported by NeuroGadget, among others - are predicting that the iPad Air 3 will be unveiled in March 2017... alongside the iPad Pro 2. Perhaps they're right, but this seems off to us, and appears to go against the strategy Apple has been pursuing with its tablets in recent years. Having a brand-new (presumably 9.7-inch) iPad Air alongside new iPad Pros of the same screen size would be confusing for customers, and it's hard to see how Apple would differentiate the two. Would the iPad Pro 2 be faster than the iPad Air 3? How much faster does it need to be, given that the iPad Pro 9.7-inch is already far quicker than is necessary to run any app on the App Store? Would the iPad Air 3 be slower than the iPad Pro 9.7in? Would the iPad Air 3 be thinner than the Pro 2, when the Pro 9.7in is already only 6.1mm thick? There are surely ways round this, but it would present a headache for Apple's marketing department. The differentiation was easier to maintain for the MacBooks, partly because laptop buyers tend to be tech-savvier on average (and are liable to put in more pre-purchase research) than tablet buyers, but also because laptops have more room for difference in terms of specs and the like. Someone who just wants to read their email can settle for a netbook or Chromebook, while a video editor needs a laptop that's vastly more powerful. But the current iPad range is as fast as anyone could possibly want. Releasing a new tier of products on top, aimed at creative professionals, seems redundant. Releasing a new (slower?) tier of products below, aimed at casual and budget users, would be deeply unlike Apple, which always chases the premium market in any given sector. And seems unnecessary too, given that older iPads are still available. So we're not exactly convinced by this. Apple may choose to release another iPad Air, but to release it at the same time as a new iPad Pro would a branding challenge, to say the least. Separately, those same reports also predict that the iPad Air 3 will be the last Air-branded tablet Apple release. To wait this long, release one more Air tablet, then pack up the brand for good? Seems... strange. Still, we shall see. All of this has been supported by a January 2017 report from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has predicted that March 2017 will see Apple announce three new iPad models: a 12.9-inch Pro, a 9.7-inch "lower-priced model," and an in-between 10-10.5-inch "high-end model" with a narrow bezel design. There was no hint in the report that any of these models would bear the Air branding. It is at least possible that the new in-between size will be the Air 3 if Apple decides it isn't done with the brand just yet, but Kuo has previously that this model would be another Pro, so this seems unlikely at the moment. Just to add more fuel to the rumour fire, DigiTimes reported on 19 January that all new iPads could be delayed further into 2017 as they have not entered mass production yet. We could be looking at June 2017 or after if this is true. iPad Air 3 release date UK: iPad Air 2's second birthday It's been well over two years since the iPad Air 2 was first shown off to the world's media. Back in 2014, Apple used to schedule separate iPhone and iPad launch events in consecutive months in autumn, and the iPad Air 2 (and underwhelming iPad mini 3) were revealed on 16 October, just over a month after the iPhone 6. (What an act to follow!) As we discuss above and below, some pundits think a successor to the iPad Air 2 will be launched soon. Perhaps it will. But now that we've passed the two-year anniversary of the Air 2's launch with no word on the iPad Air 3 (and almost no movement on MacBook Air updates), we need to start facing facts: Apple appears to have lost interest in the Air brand. A two-year hiatus is enormous in the world of tablet updates, and it's been two years and four months. iPad Air 3 release date UK: The end of the Air brand There are widespread rumours that Apple has finished with the Air line, and will in future focus on the (7.9-inch) mini and (9.7-inch and 12.9-inch) Pro ranges - or even just unite everything under the Pro branding, with the various lines differentiated by size. Our feeling, based on the lack of love shown to the MacBook Air recently, is that Apple is moving towards a twin-brand model for its laptops: a MacBook, and a MacBook Pro. Likewise, we could see a product or line of products called simply 'iPad', to sit alongside the Pro models. iPad Air 3 release date UK: Onsale date When will the iPad Air 3 go on sale in the UK? There's usually a delay of about 10 days between the announcement and the devices going on sale. If the Air 3 launches in late March 2017, for example, then expect it to hit UK shops in early April. There are occasionally shortages when a major Apple product launches, so those who are desperate to get their hands on the Air 3 would be wise to place a pre-order if possible. (Pre-ordering using Apple's own Apple Store app rather than on the website often appears to give you a head start that could make all the difference.) Read next: Best cheap iPad deals UK | iPad reviews | How to set up a new iPad | How to speed up a slow iPad iPad Air 3 release date rumours UK: Design Let's look next at the iPad Air 3's physical design. What will the iPad Air 3 look (and feel) like? iPad Air 3 design rumours: Folding iPad Gene Munster - perhaps the most famous Apple analyst out there, albeit mainly for consistently getting it wrong when predicting an Apple television - has predicted that Apple will release a folding iPad. The prediction, reported by Apple Must, is based on Apple's recent patent activity; as we've reported in our iPhone 8 rumour roundup, the firm has taken out a number of 'folding device' patents that seemingly apply to the iPhone, but the larger and less portable iPads actually seem more amenable to such a development. Munster may have been influenced by a popular current TV show, Westworld. In this series, which centres around a Western-themed park where realistic android 'hosts' interact with human 'guests' living out their fantasies, the programmers of the hosts all use neat folding tablets. It's actually one of the most remarked-upon elements of the show's aesthetic, and makes a lot of sense (if you can solve the technical challenges). iPad Air 3 design rumours: Smart Connector for Smart Keyboard... It's an obvious logical progression from the 12.9- and 9.7-inch iPad Pro models, but it seems likely that the iPad Air 3 will have a Smart Connector on the lefthand edge for attaching a Smart Keyboard Cover. Most iPad accessories are dependent on their own battery power - even the Apple Pencil has to be recharged, albeit very quickly, when it runs out of charge - but the Smart Connector allows a connected keyboard cover to draw power from the iPad's battery. In the larger iPad Pro's case, that means a very long usage time, since it has a monster battery; hopefully the iPad Air 3 will be able to offer something impressive in that department too. iPad Air 3 design rumours: ...and Apple Pencil compatibility When Apple launched the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, it was the only tablet that was compatible with the Apple Pencil. That made sense at the time - it was a unique selling point for Apple's most expensive tablet. But plenty of iPad Air owners have told us they would dearly love to be able to use the Pencil, one of the best styluses on the market, with their device, and it would be reasonable to add compatibility to a wider range of devices over the coming year. Apple started that process with the 9.7-inch Pro, and we expect Pencil capabilities to diffuse downwards through the range. iPad Air 3 design rumours: 10.9-inch screen An upgrade mentioned in the new features wishlist later in this article, and which sounds like it may happen: a larger screen. More specifically, a screen that's larger than that of the iPad Air 2, but smaller than the 12.9-inch display on the larger iPad Pro model. Barclays Research has predicted that Apple will unveil three new iPad Pro 2 models in March 2017: new 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch models, and a 10.9-inch version that sits in between. The inbetweener will actually have a chassis that's the same size as the iPad Air 2, while achieving the extra screen space by removing the bezel - which may mean the removal of the Home button. Whether Apple will carry over these changes to the Air line as well remains to be seen. iPad Air 3 design rumours: Thinner than iPad Air 2 Physically, it's rumoured that the next iPad Air will be… wait for it… thinner than its predecessor. It's generally a sound prediction to make, given that the iPad Air 1 was thinner than the iPad 4 and the iPad Air 2 was thinner than the iPad Air 1. The iPad Air 2 is already really thin, mind you, and we do sometimes wonder how much thinner tablets need to get before the compromises start to outweigh the benefits. The Air 2 is sturdy and has stood up to more than a year's heavy and frequent use, but we still recall the nervousness with which we handled it in the early days: it's hard to see an even more slender iPad Air 3 inspiring a great deal of confidence in its ability to withstand bending, chucking on a sofa, holding by one edge etc. (Note that the iPad Pro 9.7in, which improves on the iPad Air 2 in most other respects, is the same thickness.) If batteries are getting smaller, couldn't they just keep it the same size and incorporate a higher-capacity battery unit, and give us a few more hours away from the charger? Indeed, one rumour suggests that the Air 3's thinner chassis will actually mean it has a lower-capacity battery unit than the Air, which seems crazy to us. (Even though improvements in battery technology could mean that this lower-capacity unit actually lasts for a comparable length of time in practice, it seems barmy to consciously choose not to improve battery life when simply keeping the same capacity unit would achieve this.) iPad Air 3 design rumours: 7000-series aluminium body We mentioned above our general nervousness that a thinner iPad Air 3 would also be less robust. But one other change to its physical design could help with that. The Tampa Bay Review thinks the iPad Air 3 is likely to be made of 7000-series aluminium, like the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. There's a certain logic to this: spending the extra cash on stronger materials to make the newest iPhones more bend-proof than their predecessors was a popular move after the (possibly overstated) traumas of Bendgate. But it does raise the question of why the iPad Pro (which is more valuable) and the iPad mini 4 (which is more portable, and therefore more likely to get crammed into a pocket) missed out on this upgrade. If the Air 3 is thinner than either of those devices then we have an answer, but that only poses another: what is it about the Air lineup in particular that makes it more deserving of a super-thin body than those other Apple tablets? iPad Air 3 design rumours: Colour options Like the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, we'd expect the iPad Air 3 to be available in four colours: silver, gold, Space Grey and Rose Gold. Black and Jet Black, the matt and gloss new colour finishes available for the iPhone 7, are also possibilities. Every year someone suggests that the next iPad will come in the bright primary colours of the iPhone 5c and every year that person is disappointed. We don't expect the iPad Air 3 to be particularly colourful (except for the two fairly muted gold finishes). iPad Air 3 design rumours: Concept showcases everything iPad Air 3 should be Although we've not seen many leaks for the iPad Air 3, the latest concept video to hit the Internet showcases everything that the unannounced tablet should feature - Smart connector, a flush camera and, more importantly, 3D Touch support. Apart from that, the concept tablet looks similar to the iPad Pro 9.7in but with smaller bezels at the sides of the display. Take a look at the concept video below: iPad Air 3 release date rumours UK: Tech specs It's time to look deeper into the iPad Air 3. What do the latest rumours say about the iPad Air 3's specs? iPad Air 3 specs rumours: Processor and speed The iPad Air 2 got a new processor chip, the A8X - a souped-up version of the iPhone 6's A8. This has three billion transistors and offers (Apple says) 40 percent faster performance than the iPad Air 1's A7 chip in most apps and up to 2.5x graphics performance. Read next: Best iPad games | Best free iPad games It would be a big shock if Apple didn't upgrade the processor again when it launches the iPad Air 3, and it doesn't take a genius to predict that the iPad Air 3's chip will be an A9 or an A9X, and very speedy indeed. The iPad Pro 9.7in has an A9X processor. Read next: Apple rumours & predictions for 2017 | iPad mini 5 rumours iPad Air 3 specs: Rear-facing camera gains LED flash The iPad Pro 9.7in is the first iPad in history to feature a flash. This is attached to the rear-facing camera, but the front-facing camera also gets the Retina Flash feature, whereby the entire screen is induced to light up as a sort of substitute flash. We feel that the iPad Air 3 is likely to get one or both of these upgrades too. The genie is clearly out of the bottle when it comes to iPad photography: as annoying as you find it when someone holds up their iPad to video a concert, the iPad range are being used as cameras, and Apple knows this. Just look at the hyperbole and feature list here. And a flash is a big gap to have in a device's photographic armour. iPad Air 3 specs: No 3D Touch Ming-Chi Kuo, one of the most famous Apple pundits out there, predicted that 3D Touch wouldn't make an appearance in the iPad Pro 9.7in, and this proved correct. In a research paper, Kuo predicted that the a new iPad would launch in the first half of 2016 but wouldn't get the marquee feature from the flagship iPhones. In the past, Apple has frequently introduced a new feature on the iPhone line and then dispersed it through other iOS devices - Retina displays, Siri, Touch ID - and plenty of analysts have made the obvious logical leap of assuming that 3D Touch will migrate to iPad at some point. Ming-Chi Kuo was the most authoritative voice to doubt this. It would seem strange to allow this popular (if still fairly niche) feature to appear on the iPad Air 3 if it isn't on the iPad Pro, so we assume 3D Touch on iPad will have to wait for a while longer. Read next: 3D Touch tips iPad Air 3 specs: Screen resolution Back in 2014, we wondered if the iPad Air 2 might get a screen upgrade from the Air 1, possibly gaining the Retina HD designation given to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. But its display is largely the same, with the same resolution and size. (One screen modification Apple did talk about was an anti-reflective coating: a nice - if unglamorous - upgrade.) And this idea has been floated again this year. Back in September 2015 the Chinese-language site MyDrivers (link to translation) made some grand claims about the iPad Air 3's specifications. Most eye-catching among these is the unexpected prediction that Apple will increase the resolution and therefore pixel density of the screen on its next mid-size iPad. MyDrivers reckons the Air 3 will get a bump up to 401 pixels per inch (matching the iPhone 6s Plus), which translates on a 9.7-inch screen into a resolution of 3112 x 2334. (This compares to 2048 x 1536 at 264ppi on both the Air 1 and Air 2.) Pixel density is a measure of how tightly pixels are packed on a screen, and increasing it so much would result in an appreciably sharper screen - even though Apple used to maintain that 264ppi was plenty on devices of this form factor. Moving up to 401ppi on the Air 3 would be a major step forward for Apple, which has previously applied its Retina marketing label to 9.7-inch tablets rated at 264ppi on the basis that they are held further away from the eye than smartphones or even mini tablets (the Retina-rated mini 2 and mini 4 both have a pixel density of 326ppi, matching the non-Plus iPhones). There is a simple reason why we don't think this is likely to happen. As well as smashing past the pixel density of half of Apple's smartphones, including the just-released and Retina HD-rated iPhone 6s (326ppi), all of which would be held far closer to the face than the iPad Air 3, it would also show up the iPad Pro, which has a pixel density of 264ppi. And the iPad Pro is a very expensive top-end device that is clearly positioned as Apple's flagship tablet. It's hard to imagine anyone happily paying top dollar for a 264ppi Pro when there's a 401ppi Air 3 for, presumably, about £200 less. Oh, and we dread to think what such a large bump in resolution would do to battery life. The iPhone 6 Plus got round that because its larger size allowed it to include a bigger battery, but we're hearing that the Air 3 will be thinner than the Air 2. iPad Air 3 release date rumours UK: Price We expect it to cost pretty much what the iPad Air 2 cost when it launched - and it launched with a base price of £399. These days the iPad Air 2's UK price starts at £379 for the 32GB model in Wi-Fi only, moving up to £469 for 128GB Wi-Fi. The 3G/cellular models cost £120 more at each configuration: £499 for the 32GB model and £589 for 128GB. (These prices have all dropped since the Air 2 was launched - in stark contrast with the prices of most other Apple hardware, which has gone up since the Brexit vote - and the lowest storage capacities have been phased out.) Mind you, a better comparison point might be the iPad Pro 9.7. That device currently starts at an altogether more intimidating £549, and rises to £849 for the 256GB cellular model. With the iPad Air 3 filling in its predecessors' price points, the iPad Air 2 may drop further in price; the iPad Air 1 is likely to be discontinued. Apple usually tries to keep its range simple. iPad Air 3 release date rumours UK: New features wishlist So much for the rumours concerning the iPad Air 3's design changes, specs and new features. But what new features would we add to the device if we were in Jony Ive's shoes? Here's our iPad Air 3 feature wish list. Some are brand-new wishes: perhaps ideas triggered by issues with Apple's latest line of iPads. Others are features we've been asking for since before the iPad Air 2 but weren't included in that device. Let us know what features you want to see in the iPad Air 3 in the comments, or let us know on Twitter. iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Larger screen They say you can never be too rich, or too thin... or have too much screen space. In fact, there would be plenty of negatives attached to increasing the iPad Air 2's screen size from its current 9.7in diagonal: mainly increasing the bulk of the device (and having to incorporate a bigger and heavier battery to power the screen for as long), thereby reducing its fantastic portability. But a bigger screen would make the iPad Air more adaptable as a work device, and more immersive for entertainment, so who cares about practicalities? In fact, since we wrote this wishlist, Apple has unveiled an iPad with a bigger screen; it just isn't called the iPad Air 3. Go and read our 12.9-inch iPad Pro review for more on that one. We think the iPad Air line will continue to be based around a 9.7in screen. Chances of happening (on the Air line at any rate): low iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Faster processor This too is an obvious one, and something that has happened in essentially every iOS device update: a new, faster processor chip. But is it actually something to be wishing for? The iPad Air 2 is fast enough to run every current app with ease, and on most apps you won't notice any different in performance between it and the iPad Air 1 (iPad Air 1 vs iPad Air 2 comparison). The iPad Air is effectively faster than it needs to be, and apps are trying their best to catch up. The iPad Air 3 (or iPad 7) doesn't need to be any faster. It'll probably get a new chip, and there's a good chance it'll be a bit faster, but maybe Apple will go for greater power-efficiency instead?  Yeah, who are we kidding? You've got to be able to boast about processing speeds at the launch announcement. Chances of happening: nailed on iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Improved camera The last of our recurring requests that crop up every time. Of course an improved camera would be nice, but we wouldn't cite it as an essential, since the iPad is used less for its camera than Apple's smartphones (less, although tablet camera use is growing all the time), and it's got pretty good anyway. A smartphone needs a great camera; a tablet doesn't. Chances of happening: mid to low iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Face recognition Ah, something more interesting! What if the iPad Air 3 uses facial recognition to unlock the device? Face-recognition is already available in the Camera app, but that's facial recognition only in the sense of recognising that something is a face, rather than recognising which one it is - which makes this one a long shot. It does also seem a bit unnecessary, given that Apple has the Touch ID technology, and so does the iPad Air 2. If it wants to do convenient, biometric authentication it can use that.  Chances of happening: low iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Full Apple Pay This one is slightly complicated. The iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 gained Touch ID fingerprint scanners - one of the components required to use the new Apple Pay online/instore payment service, which allows you to pay for things in shops by scanning your iPhone 6 or 6 Plus and touching the fingerprint scanner. And indeed both models can use Apple Pay in the US. (Apple Pay hasn't launched in the UK at time of writing, but it will make its UK launch in July.) But they get only a limited, partial version of Apple Pay: one that doesn't work in shops. Instead they use the online and app-based versions of Apple Pay, which use Touch ID but don't require the NFC wireless antenna component used when scanning the iPhone 6 on an instore receiver. A further complication is the discovery of NFC antennae in both devices when they were disassembled; perhaps these could be activated in future and allow for full Apple Pay. Or perhaps they are intended for some other purpose. Either way, we'd like to at least have the option of instore Apple Pay with the next generation of iPads. Admittedly the average customer is a lot less likely to whip out a full-size iPad at the till, but we thought something similar about iPad photography. Chances of happening: fairly high - especially now that Apple Pay has come to the Mac iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Live multitasking "The fact that you cannot use multiple applications at the same time is a little annoying," said Product Reviews when discussing potential new features for the iPad Air 2, "and it would definitely be a great feature if Apple could add it in. For example you could update your Twitter feed in a sidebar whilst watching a video or check your emails whilst reading an article." We didn't get it in the iPad Air 2, and it still makes sense for the iPad Air 3, although you'd probably need a bigger screen to be able to use this practically. And maybe it's more of an iOS 9 thing. Even as a software update it seems very radical indeed for something that (I think) is a niche requirement. How many people check their emails while continuing to read an article or watch a video? Chances of happening: low UPDATE: Scratch that. Chances of happening: definite. Multitasking capabilities arrived with iOS 9: iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Improved stylus support "I'd like to see more attention paid to the display sensor technology that allows for the next generation of fine tip electronic styluses to be used more effectively and accurately," wrote MacObserver ahead of the launch of the iPad Air 2. Since then Apple has launched the Apple Pencil stylus alongside the two iPad Pro models - the only devices that are compatible with it. We wouldn't be surprised if the iPad Air 3 gets Apple Pencil support.  Chances of happening: decent (albeit the Apple Pencil) iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Subwoofer and other audio/speaker improvements The iPad's audio output could be improved; this is certainly true. (The iPad Air 2 has stereo speaker units, but they are so close together that their output is effectively mono.) Yet there are limits on the richness of the audio a slim and portable unit can produce; I suspect that the average iPad owner would rather buy a separate wireless speaker than add any noticeable weight to the iPad Air's chassis. A touch more bass output would substantially improve the iPad as a games unit, mind you, and it would be great for film fans.  Chances of happening: decent (the iPad Pro models have quad speakers) iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Increase the storage baseline "iPads tend to accumulate a lot of stuff," pointed out MacObserver. "Apps, movies and music that make a 16GB iPad an anachronism. Here's hoping..." In fact, Apple phased out the popular 32GB model instead, leaving the iPad Air 2 (and the iPad mini 3 and iPhone 6 handsets) with an oddly lopsided line-up of 16GB, 64GB and 128GB. Will Apple phase out the 16GB iPad? It's going to happen at some point - remember the 8GB iPad? - but maybe not quite yet. Plenty of users store work documents and photos in the cloud, rarely game and use a small number of lightweight apps.  Chances of happening: nailed on (Apple has bumped up the storage baselines across its iPad and iPhone ranges. All iPads now start at 32GB, and Pro models top out at 256GB. Hooray!) iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Memory card slot We'll say right away: this would be nice in some respects but is highly unlikely. Apple's philosophy embraces the closed box: the complete product experience bought ready-to-use and held apart from user tinkering and upgrades. Without mentioning that this would encourage buyers to go for the lower-capacity iPads and fill the shortfall with removable memory. And it would ruin the iPad's clean lines.  Chances of happening: no way iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Bluetooth mouse support It's been argued that touch is less accurate than mouse (or similar) input, and that Apple's more work-oriented users would enjoy being able to use wireless mice with their iPad Air 3. If we were talking about the Mac OS X-running iPad Pro that some have discussed, this would be a no-brainer, but this would call for a major rethink of how iOS works, and we don't think that's likely.  Chances of appearing: low iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Wireless charging At the moment wireless charging is big let-down, offering only minor convenience rather than the quantum leap it appears to promise. The Air Voltage Qi Chargers are an example of a (comparatively) recent take on the concept: you buy a case for your device, and a separate charging mat. Simply laying the cased iPhone on the mat starts up the charging process - but it has to touch the mat, and the mat itself has to be plugged in.  If Apple incorporated the technology in the chassis of the iPad so that you don't have to bother with a particular case then it would be far more appealing. If you could increase the range of the charge transmission so that, for example, you just need to be sitting with a couple of feet of the charger for the device in your pocket to start charging - then we'd be talking. Chances of appearing: still seems unlikely, although we're hearing more and more rumours about this appearing on the iPhone 8.

Long-suffering Alexa Seary shares her name with the world-dominating Amazon and Apple products. Alexa, 21, endured a torrent of bad jokes after Apple's popular 'personal assistant' function Siri was introduced in 2011. She was was teased by friends and colleagues, at the restaurant she works part-time, who addressed her by her surname and gave her commands like a machine. Although the hysteria eventually died down, she was stunned in 2015 when Amazon released its own human-like bot  - and called it Alexa. With over five million Amazon Echo devices - which use Alexa to function - sold and a billion iPhone owners having Siri on their mobiles, it means that people in every corner of the globe utter her name daily. But the real Alexa, who has Siri on her phone, could never have an Amazon bot in her house because it would be a 'complete disaster'. Stockton University student Alexa, of Ventnor City, New Jersey, said: 'Everyone in my family uses an iPhone so we all use Siri and we all get jokes about it.

'It started off at work. It would be, "Siri, do this, Siri do that," and now they do the same thing with Alexa. 'Mostly people just say, "Haha, I'm telling you what to do," and I'm like, "OK, haha, that's a new one". 'Thankfully, no one in my family has an Alexa so far. My mum's husband was thinking about getting one and he thought it was pretty funny. 'If we had one in our house it would be a complete disaster. I would scream back every time someone said "Alexa" automatically or vice versa.' RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Howbow dat? Chico the parrot learns the infamous saying...

Share this article Share Alexa said that she's now automatically associated with the machines - and seven out of 10 people she talks to comments on the funny coincidence Tech lovers use Siri and Alexa - which operate in a variety of languages - to find directions, carry out Google searches, set reminders and perform tasks. Alexa said that she's now automatically associated with the machines - and seven out of 10 people she talks to comments on the funny coincidence. She said: 'I always thought I was the only Alexa but now people automatically associate me with a machine. I used to find it funny but now it's a bit annoying. 'When Siri first came out I honestly didn't realize that it was pronounced the same was as my last name I thought it was "sir-ee". 'It was only when people began telling me otherwise that I realized I was in for some jokes. She said: 'I'm stuck with this name. I'm hoping it all dies down a little bit but I don't think I'd change it' 'My manager referred to me strictly as Siri when he asked me to do different tasks so that gave everyone at work a laugh I actually started to get used to it. 'When the Alexa started getting really popular is when I realized I'd really run into a problem. I work with a headphone so I was literally getting told over the headphone to do things as though I was a machine. 'I'm stuck with this name. I'm hoping it all dies down a little bit but I don't think I'd change it.' She added: 'Right now, ironically, I'm studying communications at Stockton University and I plan to start out working for a technology company so the jokes very fitting.' Even though the joke gets boring, the bubbly student says having such well-known namesakes is a great way to break the ice Even though the joke gets boring, the bubbly student says having such well-known namesakes is a great way to break the ice. She said: 'Letting customers in the restaurant where I worked know I was Alexa and Siri became one of my best conversation starters or jokes and in the long run became pretty good small talk too. 'Luckily my managers at this job have not put that together yet so for now I'm just referred to by my normal name, but I'm sure once they do they will get a kick out of it. 'One good thing is the spelling isn't completely the same "Siri" and "Seary" so at least I have that to myself. 'I've never heard of anyone else in this situation. As far as I'm aware, I'm the only one in the world who has to deal with it.'  Share or comment on this article e-mail 457 shares Most watched News videos Homeless man brought to tears following incredible transformation Dancing Prince seen talking to mystery woman at Verbier party Little girl is overcome with emotion as her dad meets her from school Train ploughs snow as it pulls into New York station Good samaritan saves police deputy by shooting his attacker Will's got the love!

By Charlie Osborne for Zero Day | March 14, 2017 -- 11:38 GMT (04:38 PDT) | Topic: Security Sixgill A new variant of the Mac Trojan Proton RAT has been discovered in the internet underground which claims to avoid all Mac antivirus sweeps. More security news Automating security? Robots can't replace humans in decision loop ​Machine learning can also aid the cyber enemy: NSA research head Intel, Microsoft launch new bug bounty programs Justice Dept. charges four Russia-backed hackers over Yahoo breach According to security researchers from Sixgill, the new malware strain is being touted on popular Russian cybercrime forums as a way to compromise Mac machines for the purposes of spying and theft. The RAT, dubbed Proton, is intended solely for Apple Mac machines. Written in native Objective C, the malware is apparently undetected by existing Mac antivirus software and can grant attackers full, remote access to a victim's PC. Proton RAT is apparently capable of running real-time console commands and file manipulation, keylogging, SSH/VNC connectivity, screenshot capture, webcam operation, and also has "the ability to present a custom native window requesting information such as a credit card, driver's license and more," according to the team. "The malware also boasts the capability of iCloud access, even when two-factor authentication is enabled," Sixgill says. A screenshot of the forum post marketing the Trojan. This vast list of dangerous capabilities has one real, true threat, Sixgill says, which is the shipment of the malware with genuine Apple code-signing signatures. If this proves to be true, the developer of Proton RAT has been able to dupe Apple's security measures and strict filters which are placed on third-party developers of Mac OS software. If so, the developer has managed to obtain genuine certificates for the malicious code, which throws Apple home security systems wide open. According to the security team, this may be because the malware developer has slipped through the net and falsified their registration to the Apple Developer ID Program, or alternatively, stolen credentials are in play. "Sixgill also believes that gaining root privileges on MAC OS is only possible by employing a previously unpatched 0-day vulnerability, which is suspected to be in possession of the author," the researchers say. In order to gain access to a PC, Proton users masquerade the app as genuine software, and once downloaded and installed, the malware begins its work. Proton RAT is often displayed as true surveillance software, useful for companies seeking to monitor employee devices, parents who want to keep an eye on their kid's online activities, or for spouses looking to catch out a cheating partner. In the past, the purchase price for Proton RAT was a steep $100,000, however, an unlimited install version now costs under 40 Bitcoin -- up to $50,000 -- and a license to install the malware on one system costs only 2 BTC, or roughly $2,500. In January, researchers from Malwarebytes revealed malware strain Quimitchin, created with ancient code, was being used in campaigns against biomedical facilities.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Fiksu’s Bay Area usage data points to new iPad models currently in testing Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Tuesday, March 14th, 2017, 05:09 Category: Hardware, iPad, News The new iPads are en route. Or at least they’re apparently being tested in the Bay Area. Per mobile marketing firm Fiksu, a number of new iPad models are being tested in the region. This jibes with rumors and a leaked investor note from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo that indicated that Apple is expected to update its 12.9-inch iPad Pro model, as well as introduce a new 10-inch or 10.5-inch model with a narrower bezel along with a 9.7-inch option. The data comes from Fiksu’s tracking and attribution SDK, which is used by thousands of mobile apps today. As part of Apple’s testing process, it installs a variety of apps — from popular ones to the more obscure — which inevitably ends up including some apps that has Fiksu’s tracking in them. Roughly a month ahead of the most recent iPad launches, Fiksu noticed new internal model names “6,3/6,4” and “6,7/6,8” being tested around Cupertino. This time around it’s seeing “7,1” “7,2,” “7,3,” and “7,4.” The new device codes appear as follows: iPad 7,3 | 5 iPad 7,4 | 10 iPad 7,2 | 11 iPad 7,1 | 17 The new usage data seems to focus on a range of generally popular apps, like games, music, real estate and weather applications. Another indication that these could be the new iPads is the fact that they’re all running a mix of the latest beta of iOS (iOS 10.3) and the unreleased version iOS 11. As always, stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

The 10.5 inch iPad is expected to have an edge-to-edge display, a new virtual Home Button and other upgrades. Digitimes says updates to the 9.7 inch iPad and 12.9 inch iPad Pro are also in the pipeline … The best, strongest, Lightning cables ... buy braided cables here The supply chain analyst had previously predicted that the 10.5 inch iPad will not be ready for launch until May/June, but this latest report says that Apple has pushed the production schedule forward. The 10.5 inch iPad is expected to be almost the same physical size as the current 9.7 inch iPad Pro, but will gain an extra 0.8 inches in diagonal screen space by losing the left and right bezels, as the product has been described as having an edge-to-edge display. The bezel-less iPad would somewhat presage one of the big rumors for the new iPhone 8 in the fall, which is also expected to feature a bezel-less design. The report says an upgraded 9.7 inch iPad and refreshed 12.9 inch iPad Pro are also imminent. As the new 9.7 inch tablet is likely meant as a cheaper offering in the lineup, Digitimes says Apple will pitch the 10.5 inch and 12.9 inch iPad as the mid-tier to high-end competitors in the tablet market. Apple is only expected to make about 1 million 10.5 inch iPads per month, whilst the upgraded 9.7 inch model will see more a healthy ~3 million/month run rate. Digitimes is a supply chain centric site. Their claims about Apple hosting a product event to announce the new iPads in early April ‘to mark the inauguration of Apple’s new headquarters in California’ should be taken with heavy skepticism. Apple’s plans about an event can change on a whim and are not connected to the supply chain at all. However, it is reasonable to expect the new 10.5 inch iPad sooner rather than later off the back of this report. Digitimes says mass production of the 12.9 inch iPad may not start until May or June, but this does not preclude Apple announcing it alongside the 10.5 inch iPad in April. It makes sense for the ‘budget’ 9.7 inch model to also launch at the same time. Benjamin Mayo @bzamayo Benjamin develops iOS apps professionally and covers Apple news and rumors for 9to5Mac.

Read the latest rumours on the 2017 MacBook Pro specifications, price and UK launch date. All the information you need about the new Apple MacBook Pro By Marie Brewis | 14 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents When is the 2017 MacBook Pro release date? What are the rumoured specifications? All about the MacBook Pro 2016 How much does the MacBook Pro cost in the UK? In October Apple unveiled its long-awaited MacBook Pro with a fancy new Touch Bar, but we won't be waiting as long for the next update.New MacBook Pros with updated processors - potentially Intel Kaby Lake chips - are expected this year, . We outline the 2016 MacBook Pro UK release date, price and specification, plus new MacBook Pro 2017 rumours. See also: Best laptops 2017. Also see: Apple October Event as it happened | MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review When is the 2017 MacBook Pro release date? KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is predicting updated MacBooks with Intel Kaby Lake processor later this year. Kuo says new 12in MacBooks will enter mass production in Q2 (March), potentially with a new 16GB RAM model. Meanwhile new 13- and 15in MacBook Pros will begin mass production in Q3 (July). In Q4 (September) we could see a high-end 15in MacBook Pro with 32GB of RAM as "the most significantly redesigned product this year". What are the rumoured specifications? The notion of new MacBook Pros in 2017 is backed up by a new Bloomberg report. It says a new model is planned for later this year but it might herald a shift away from Intel processors. According to people familiar with the matter the chip, codenamed T310 and built ARM technology, will handle low-power functionality and work along the main Intel processor. This move could mean better battery life as moving the 'Power Nap' feature to the new chip will use even less power. Apple's ARM-based T1 chip is already in the latest MacBook Pro - see below. But what about AMD Ryzen? An article on Arcitosh.com suggests "AMD’s new Ryzen 7 CPUs look to promise more computing muscle per watt than Intel and offer a nicer philosophical fit for Apple." The current MacBook Pro isn't much faster than the model it replaced, since Apple looks to provide performance while conserving battery life. Arcitosh suggests that rather than producing its own or using Intel's chips to look for the ultimate performance per watt, it could instead use AMD's Ryzen CPUs.  As with Microsoft and the Surface Pro 5, Apple is apparently considering AMD for the 2017 MacBook Pro. In fact, it could be powered by the upcoming Raven Ridge APU - a combination of Ryzen chipsets for CPU and Vega-based chipsets for GPU. Raven Ridge was originally planned for 2018 but an updated roadmap shows a 2017 release instead. Watch this space for more updates. All about the MacBook Pro 2016 In October 2016 on the week of the Apple laptop's 25th anniversary, Apple announced the best MacBook Pro yet. There are 13- and 15in models with new all-aluminium designs that are significantly thinner and lighter than their predecessors, just 14.9mm thin and 3lb for the 13in model and 15.5mm and 4lb for the 15in model. The new MacBook Pros, available in Silver and Space Grey, have a two times larger Force Touch trackpad and a new context-sensitive Retina display Touch Bar that replaces the row of Function keys. Touch ID is also built-in with Secure Enclave and protected with Sapphire glass. The new Touch Bar consumed most of Apple's demonstration, and it does look cool. What functions it offers entirely depend on the app you're in. For example, you might get emoji in the Messages app, favourite sites in Safari, and options to reply or delete in Mail. In Photos are useful editing controls, and we particularly like the look of the quick type function in relevant apps, which may speed up typing. The keyboard itself has also been improved, with new second-generation Butterfly-style switch mechanisms that are more responsive and offer better travel. The new MacBook Pro is a sixth-generation Skylake machine with a 2133MHz Intel Core i7 inside (you can opt for a Core i5 in the 13in model). There's up to 2TB of storage via a superfast SSD, and in the 15in model AMD Radeon Pro graphics with up to 4GB VRAM (the 13in model has Intel Iris graphics). Apple says the 15in model is 130 percent faster than its predecessor on graphics, 60 percent faster for gaming, and 57 percent faster for video editing. The 13in model, meanwhile, is 103 percent faster than its predecessor for gaming, and 76 percent faster for both video editing and 3D graphics. The display is better than ever, now 67 percent brighter with 67 percent higher contrast and 25 percent more colours. Each MacBook Pro is fitted with four Thunderbolt 3 ports that can go up to 40GB/s. Each of these ports can be used for power or as Thunderbolt, USB-C, DisplayPort, HDMI or VGA connections. How much does the MacBook Pro cost in the UK? The new MacBook Pro comes in three models, all available direct from Apple. 1. 13in MacBook Pro without Touch Bar and Touch ID, 2GHz Intel Core i5 dual-core processor, Intel Iris Graphics 540, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD, 2x Thunderbolt 3.

Slim and stylish laptops will ensure that work isn’t boring anymore Subscribe to our newsletter. Vishal Mathur At 13.1mm thick, and with a 12-inch Retina Display, Apple MacBook has a very compact footprint. Laptops have changed considerably, in the face of competition from the slimmer, lighter and more flexible convertible computing devices. From the look that resembled a thick black brick, and weighed what felt like a tonne, laptops have undergone a complete makeover. The recent crop of premium laptops focus on an ultra-slim form factor, without sacrificing on the looks, specifications or performance. We pick out the best options that you should consider, if budget is no bar. Apple MacBook Rs1,12,900 onwards At 13.1mm thick, and with a 12-inch Retina Display, the MacBook has a very compact footprint. It is available in silver, gold, space grey and rose gold colour options, giving you the option of colour-coordinating IT with your iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. The Force Touch touchpad can detect differing pressures of the finger touch, and can execute certain functions in some apps. This was one of the first laptops to adopt the USB Type-C standard, and the removal of the USB ports, as we knew them, helped in the thickness reduction. You can get as much as 12 hours of battery life from the MacBook. If you go for the higher spec but marginally thicker MacBook Pro Touch Bar variants, you’ll also get the secondary touch display which sits above the keyboard and shows options and menus relevant to the app on the screen at that time. Dressed in Gold, LG Gram is just 13.4mm thick and weighs 980kg. LG Gram Rs94,900 Dressed in Gold, the Gram is just 13.4mm thick and weighs 980kg. The Carbon Magnesium Alloy chassis should hold it in good stead against the most established rivals. It runs the Intel Core i5-6200U processor, with 8GB RAM and a 256GB solid state drive. It runs Windows 10. The 14-inch display should do well, with the IPS technology that helps reproduce rich and accurate colours—the visual highlight is the 0.26mm measuring slim bezel around the display. It also has the Instant Booting feature, which switches on the laptop and boots into Windows, the moment you open the lid—this is something even the latest generation Apple MacBook Pro machines have. The Reading Mode reduces the blue light impact on the eyes, and makes reading more comfortable. HP Spectre 13 is incredibly thin, measuring just 10.4mm thick. HP Spectre 13 Rs1,10,290 onwards There is no denying the sheer sexiness of the Spectre 13’s design. It is incredibly thin, measuring just 10.4mm thick. The piston-hinge design element stands out, and so does the dash of black and gold colour. Within this aluminium and carbon-fiber chassis are the latest generation Intel Core i5 and Intel Core i7 processor options, 8GB RAM, Windows 10 and 13.3-inch display. The Spectre 13’s battery lasts around 6 hours for most usage scenarios, which while not at the same levels as the Apple MacBooks, is still among the better figures in the Windows genre. Asus Swift 7 is the slimmest of them all—measuring just 10mm in thickness—and has rather understated looks and colour options. Asus Swift 7 Rs99,990 This is the slimmest of them all—measuring just 10mm in thickness—and has rather understated looks and colour options. The other specs include an Intel Core i5-7Y54 processor, with 8 GB of RAM, 13-inch display and a 256 GB solid state drive (SSD) storage. If you aren’t extra careful with the brightness levels of the display, the battery life does suffer a bit—it lasts around 3.5 hours when stressed a bit, but that is the compromise for an ultra-thin form factor. Dressed in black, Razer Blade Stealth is just 13mm thick, yet doesn’t fall short in terms of power. Razer Blade Stealth $899.99 onwards (shipping extra) Razer is better known for gaming accessories, but the Blade Stealth is an ultrabook that cannot be ignored. Dressed in black, it is just 13mm thick, yet doesn’t fall short in terms of power—available with the options of 7th Gen Intel Core i5-7200U and the Core i7-7500U processor options, with 8GB or 16GB RAM options and a 12.5-inch display. You will get Windows 10 preloaded and up to 1TB SSD storage options. The ideal laptop to get, if you are travelling.

Several new iPad models have been spotted being tested in Cupertino and nearby locations, according to mobile marketing firm Fiksu – potentially confirming earlier rumors of a planned iPad refresh arriving this spring. According to reports, a leaked investor note from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo indicated that Apple is expected to update its 12.9-inch iPad Pro model, as well as introduce a new 10-inch or 10.5-inch model with a narrower bezel along with a budget-friendly 9.7-inch option. According to Kuo, the two larger models will sport an A10X chip – a version of A10 chip found in the iPhone 7 – while the low-cost device will use the A9 chip found in the iPhone 6S. The A10X will be manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., and the A9 by Samsung, he also said. Not mentioned in his note is the Apple iPad mini. Fiksu’s raw data is showing four different iPad models, but that doesn’t necessarily mean four new devices will arrive. The company says it saw the same number of devices tested before the release of the last two iPad Pros, which means we could potentially see anywhere from two to four new iPads soon hitting the market, it estimates. The data comes from Fiksu’s tracking and attribution SDK, which is used by thousands of mobile apps today. As part of Apple’s testing process, it installs a variety of apps – from popular ones to the more obscure – which ends up inevitably ends up including some apps that has Fiksu’s tracking in them. Each type of iOS device has a different model name, explains Fiksu. These are generally sequential, the firm says. About a month ahead  of the most recent iPad Pro launches, it saw internal model names “6,3/6,4” and “6,7/6,8” being tested around Cupertino. This time around, it’s seeing “7,1” “7,2,” “7,3,” and “7,4.” There are only a handful of these devices appearing in its logs, Fiksu found. (See chart below) Device | Count iPad 7,3 | 5 iPad 7,4 | 10 iPad 7,2 | 11 iPad 7,1 | 17 All the usage is from the greater San Francisco Bay area, including Cupertino and nearby locations. The usage was also spread across a range of generally popular apps, like games, music, real estate and weather applications. Another indication that these could be the new iPads is the fact that they’re all running a mix of the latest beta of iOS (iOS 10.3) and the unreleased version iOS 11. The launch of new iPads is important to Apple given the current year-over-year decline in iPad sales. As Recode noted in January, iPad sold 13.3 million in iPads, according to its recent quarterly earnings report, generating $5.5 billion in revenue. That represented around a 19 percent drop in units sold, and a 22 percent drop in revenue from the year prior. As Fiksu explains, part of the problem is that people don’t upgrade their iPads as often as they upgrade their iPhones. In fact, the first four full-size iPad generations and the original iPad mini – all of which launched between 2010 and 2012 – still account for over 45 percent of iPad usage, its trackers show. With the release of new models, Apple could encourage users to abandon their old devices for those with newer technology or new features. Kuo’s earlier note about the devices suggested that the budget model could move more units – potentially between 50 and 60 percent of sales, he said. Of course, until Apple makes a formal announcement, nothing is for certain.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Tablets Image Source: Jose Sanchez/AP/REX/Shutterstock Apple to launch brand new iPads in early April at Apple Campus inauguration event Chris Smith @chris_writes March 14th, 2017 at 6:50 AM Share Tweet A report earlier this week said Apple is expected to take the wraps off its 2017 iPads in the coming weeks, a tablet family that’s supposed to bring over a brand new iPad Pro flavor. Usually, Apple announces such new products during special keynotes, but some believed that Apple might launch the new iOS tablets without hosting a media event. A new report out of Asia now claims that a keynote is very much in the works for early April. Apple’s first major keynote of the year will also double as the first event to be held at Apple’s new headquarters. Don't Miss: Google is trying really hard to make a smart jacket you won’t totally hate The news comes from Taiwan-based supply chain sources who spoke to Digitimes. Apple has apparently moved the production of its 10.5-inch iPad to March instead of the earlier May-June estimate that came from the same Digitimes’ sources. The 10.5-inch iPad Pro will target education and business markets, the report says. Apple is expected to sell one million units in March, and ramp up production to 1.2 million units in the following months. The company is also supposed to upgrade its 12.9-inch iPad Pro, though it’s not clear when it’ll happen. Volume production for this model might kick off in May or June, the report notes. As for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, Digitimes says that orders have been steady since February, with shipment volumes expected to reach 3-4 million units a month in the first quarter, and then grow “significantly” in the second quarter. Digitimes did not say whether any other products will be launched at the event, aside from new iPads. Apple, meanwhile, is yet to formally announce its iPad press event.

With no Mac mini launches in 2016, Apple might have called it a day. Read the latest rumours about the 2017 Mac mini specs, price and UK launch date. by Karen Haslam | 14 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents When is the Mac mini 2017 UK release date? Will Apple discontinue the Mac mini? How much will the Mac mini 2017 cost in the UK? What are the rumoured features of the Mac mini 2017? Will the Mac mini 2017 have a new design? Also, what is the Mac mini?! When will Apple release a new Mac mini in the UK? And what new features and design changes can we expect from the updated Mac mini in 2017? A new Mac mini is expected to launch in 2017, since the line wasn't updated at all in 2015 or 2016; but Apple (as usual) is giving nothing away. Nevertheless, based on past experience and the specs of current Macs, we've got a fair idea of what to expect from the new Mac mini, and when to expect it. We've got all the new Mac mini hints and rumours for you right here. Read on for the next Mac mini's likely release date, specs, design changes and new features. We'll update this article whenever new information is unearthed, so check back regularly for the latest Mac mini update rumours. And remember to check our Mac buying guide 2017 for current buying advice, and our guide to the best Apple deals. Last updated, 21 February 2017, to report on Apple's announcement of WWDC 2017, and to briefly discuss the chances of a new Mac mini appearing at the event; and previously with the news that Apple has officially made the Mac mini (Early and late 2009, and mid 2010) vintage and obsolete. When is the Mac mini 2017 UK release date? When will the next Mac mini come out? We think March 2017 is a decent bet. (Read more: What to expect at Apple's March 2017 event.) There were rumours suggesting that Apple would do a low-key update to its Mac desktop range by the end of November 2016, focusing on the Mac Pro but potentially covering the iMac and Mac mini at the same time. But it seems Apple disliked the idea. Instead, we would expect the mini to be updated during the company's usual spring event in March 2017. Availability of chipsets may influence the timing of the launch. The next generation of Intel chips was made available to OEMs in Q4 2016 - they're called Kaby Lake, and it's possible that the new Mac mini could feature processors from this batch. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. We'll talk about processors, and other specs, in a later section of this article. The next slot in Apple's launch calendar after its usual spring event is WWDC. WWDC 2017 has just been announced, and while this event always focuses primarily on software (iOS 11 and macOS 10.13 will be the headline announcements), there is sometimes room for hardware. If we still don't see a Mac mini update by this point, it's probably safe to assume that Apple has killed off the Mac mini line - a possibility we address in the next section. Apple last updated the Mac mini on 16 October 2014 after a two-year wait: the previous model came out on 23 October 2012. Mac mini fans are now waiting for the next iteration of the smallest and cheapest Mac. See also: New iMac release | New Mac Pro release Will Apple discontinue the Mac mini? Apple, to paraphrase a colleague, is generally very good at killing its darlings: at knowing when it makes sense to drop a much-loved product or product feature - one which is often still popular and/or profitable - and switch focus to something else that has more of a future. Think the iPod classic or the optical drive, or dropping the headphone port from the iPhone 7. There are a couple of candidates to be the next iPod classic. The MacBook Air is one. But the Mac mini, which hasn't been updated since 2014, is rarely mentioned at events, and feels surplus to requirements now that the Apple TV is making its claim as a media centre device (although for storing a large number of films the mini remains an excellent choice, offering 500GB as standard and up to 2TB as a configuration option), will be expecting a P45 more than most of Apple's product line-up. The design of the Mac mini hasn't changed significantly since it was first launched and is starting to feel a little dated, and the device doesn't have a clear selling point (or at least, Apple isn't doing a good job of communicating one). So it wouldn't surprise us if Apple quietly retired the line at its next Mac launch event. It's either that or give it a radical overhaul. If Apple does kill off the mini, we'd have to start asking questions about the 'mini' branding in general, and wondering if the iPads are going to be reorganised: there's already a sense that the 'Air' brand is on the way out, across both MacBooks and iPads. But that's a story for another day. How much will the Mac mini 2017 cost in the UK? There are currently three models of the Mac mini available; the one that's best for you will depend on your budget and computing needs. The cheapest model currently costs £479, the middle model is £679, and the priciest model is £949 - this is a price increase since its launch, likely due to Brexit. Of course, you'll still need to factor in the price of a monitor, keyboard and mouse. (For advice on that, see our roundups of the Best Mac monitors, Best Mac keyboards and Best Mac mice.) However, we don't anticipate Apple reducing the price with the new model when it launches, so you can expect similar pricing. Hopefully better specs for your money, though, of course. Which leads us on to... What are the rumoured features of the Mac mini 2017? The Mac mini is Apple's most budget-focused desktop system and as such features relatively low-end components. But what specs upgrades should we expect from the next Mac mini? Processor: The Kaby Lake question It's unlikely that Apple will include an AMD processor in the next generation of Mac minis... unlikely, but not out of the question, given that AMD's new CPUs are set to come out this year. We'd rate the chances of an AMD chip appearing in the 2017 Mac mini as slight. However, we do expect Kaby Lake, the latest generation of Intel chips. Intel has now started shipping its Kaby Lake processors. But the key word there is 'started': the Kaby Lake processors that would be suitable for a Mac mini may not appear for some months, assuming Apple decides to plump for a Kaby Lake chipset at all. According to MacRumors, in fact, mini-appropriate Kaby Lake chips may not roll out until very late 2016 or even early 2017, so any Mac mini launched before then would be limited to Skylake, the previous generation of Intel processors. That would still represent a significant power boost over the current Haswell processors. Kaby Lake supports Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2, as well as 4K video. The chips are manufactured using a 14nm process, same as Broadwell and Skylake. The next generation, Cannonlake, will switch over to a more accurate 10nm process. As we discuss in our iMac rumour roundup, Intel has laid out a roadmap for its next four generations of processor. After Skylake and Kaby Lake, Intel will release Cannonlake, then Ice Lake in 2018 and Tiger Lake in 2019. Read next: Mac mini vs MacBook Air  Graphics Our iMac predictions also include new graphics chipsets: Polaris 10, by AMD, which is particularly interesting because it may make the next iMacs VR-ready. But the current range of Mac mini models feature integrated graphics, and we expect this to remain the case in the next generation. RAM Right now, the entry-level Mac mini features just 4GB RAM as standard, which we think should be ramped up to 8GB in the new entry-level model. Storage The other big change we hope to see in the new Mac mini is the addition of more flash drive options. Currently the 2.8GHz model comes with a Fusion Drive, or you can add 256GB flash storage to that model, or the 2.8GHz model. While the 500GB hard drive in the current entry-level model (and the 1TB hard drive as standard in the £569 model) might appear attractive to some, flash memory is so much faster that we believe it is well worth the compromise of storing additional files on an external hard drive. However, it seems unlikely that Apple would do away with the hard drive storage option altogether, as many workgroups choose the Mac mini as a server and will need the extra capacity and lower prices that HD storage makes possible. See also: New MacBook Pro release | New MacBook Air release | New MacBook release USB-C It's felt like the USB port has been on borrowed time ever since Apple launched the first-gen 12-inch MacBook - with its lone USB Type-C (or, more commonly, just USB-C) port for both data and charging - in 2015. Like the optical drive circa 2012, it seems likely that bog-standard USB 3.0 is no longer in Apple's thoughts, and (unless the market rejects USB-C comprehensively, which despite some qualms about there only being one port on the MacBook, hasn't happened yet) it's surely a matter of time before the rest of the Mac line-up switches across to the newer tech. USB-C offers more advantages than just being reversible and thereby easier to connect when you can't see what you're doing; in theory, it offers twice the data throughput of USB 3.0 and the ability to deliver far more power. The latter factor enabled Apple to use USB-C as a combined data and power port and further slim down its laptop design. Our feeling is that the Mac mini won't be next on Apple's update list, however - our money's on the revamped MacBook Pro. As a budget-focused (and somewhat neglected) line, the Mac mini isn't likely to get the love and cutting-edge componentry of more favoured products. And power delivery - and the ability to remove extraneous ports and slim down the chassis - is far less of a concern for a static machine like the mini than for a portable like the MacBook. Will the Mac mini 2017 have a new design? It's possible that the Mac mini will get a new design. We're not expecting a major visual or build redesign, but it is certainly possible that it could get thinner and smaller, especially since it no longer has to accommodate a CD drive. Right now the dimensions are 3.6cm high, 19.7cm wide, and it weighs 1.22kg. How about a Mac mini that has similar dimensions to an Apple TV? (That's 9.8cm wide, 2.3cm high, and a weight of 0.27kg.) There was some speculation that the reason for the long delay prior to the Mac mini update in 2014 was that Apple was looking at redesiging the Mac mini along the lines of the Mac Pro. This was probably intended as an April Fool's Day prank, but we like this render of a flat Mac mini, as seen on Apple User. Even better, how about a Mac mini that's also an Apple TV? Adding Apple TV functionality to a Mac mini would be a great way of getting the Mac mini into people's living rooms as a home entertainment device. Also, what is the Mac mini?! Not the no-brainer it might sound like to keen mini-heads: plenty of otherwise tech-savvy folk aren't aware the Mac mini even exists. Indeed, sometimes it seems like Apple itself isn't aware of its presence. That would certainly explain the long gap before the 2014 model was launched. The Mac mini is Apple's smallest desktop Mac and also its cheapest Mac, at £479. It's a full-blown OS X or macOS Sierra desktop that fits into a self-contained chassis no bigger than a set-top box. It's an inexpensive living-room Mac that lacks the power of even some MacBooks and comes with no keyboard, mouse or display, but one that works perfectly as the centre of your digital home - not least because it comes with HDMI sockets, so that plugging it into a modern TV is a doddle. There used to be a Mac mini with OS X Server available for £849 but Apple removed that option from the line-up in October 2014.

Crew/Unsplash The other Saturday, as I pulled out of my gym’s parking lot, my Apple Watch vibrated. Glancing down, I saw a traffic report and directions to Philz, the Silicon Valley home of the $4.50 cup of coffee. The striking thing is that I never asked for the help, nor even told any of my iDevices of my plans for the day. Apple simply deduced, by recording and analyzing my previous habits, where I was likely to be headed, and jumped in with unbidden assistance. We are increasingly living in the age of such creeptastic technologies, enthralled by what they can do until we stop to think about how they’re doing it. The companies behind our devices and the services we use know so much about each of us that they can anticipate the information we need and deliver it, not only before we ask, but even before we’re aware we need it. It’s truly amazing. And truly frightening. For most intents and purposes, the services these technologies provide don’t come with a cost attached. But don’t make the mistake of thinking they’re free. You’re constantly paying for them; the currency is your personal data, and if anything, they’re growing more and more expensive. Collecting personal information is as old as the Internet itself, but it’s taken a quantum leap in the last few years. For myself, at least, I date the start of the creeptastic era to Google’s 2012 introduction of its “Google Now” software. Among other things, Google Now started automatically scanning my incoming mail to look for Amazon shipping notifications, tracked my packages without being asked and messaged me when they arrived. Of course, everyone by now is used to those ads for something you’ve looked at online that follow you from website to website. But even I was a little bit startled when Brooks Brothers, the venerable retailer, began emailing me directly about items I had looked at but not purchased—even though I wasn’t signed in to the Brooks Brothers site when I looked at them. Facebook is probably the current champion venue for the creeptastic. Recently, an ad started showing up in my feed for Farmstead, a new grocery-delivery service getting started in the San Francisco Bay Area. The ad features specific items my wife and I buy regularly at our local grocery store: the exact brands of blue cheese and cream we purchase, and even the precise blend of coffee we drink. How do they do that? Farmstead didn’t respond to several inquiries, leaving me to wonder. Has someone along the way acquired data from the store, or my credit-card company, and matched it up with my Facebook profile? Or are they simply using everything they know about me to make predictions about me, along the lines of the “Greyball” tool Uber has been using, according to The New York Times, to identify avoid local authorities who disapprove of its activities. Through tactics such as correlating users’ physical locations near government buildings with the frequency with which they check the Uber app, the Times said, the company has been able to deduce that they are city officials—then serve up fake versions of the app or cancel ordered rides. The company said in a statement that it developed the tool to identify users who violate its terms of service. But it certainly raises some interesting questions. Could it be used to identify other sorts of users? Journalists? Lyft executives? Who knows? Meanwhile, the hottest trend in consumer electronics right now is the voice-controlled robot assistant—Amazon’s Echo and its competitor Google Home. These gadgets are popular for good reason, providing news and music, answering questions and controlling smart devices in the home. To accomplish all that, they’re always listening for their “wake words”—“Alexa” for the Echo, “OK, Google” for Google Home. Your requests—and, occasionally, random bits of conversation when the device mistakenly thinks it’s been queried—are constantly being uploaded to remote servers, analyzed for content, and used in formulating a response. Are they actually spying on you? Very highly unlikely. Could they be used to spy on you? Well, yeah. If the latest batch of WikiLeaks documents are to be believed, all sorts of smart devices—even Samsung TV sets—have already been compromised in the name of national security. What’s the appropriate response to creeptastic tech? Certainly, many of its benefits are undeniable. If the science-fiction author Arthur C. Clarke is right that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,” we are living in a magical time. But it’s imperative that we are constantly vigilant about the price we’re paying. Prudence suggests we all need a generous dose of deep concern—though a little outright paranoia would also be entirely understandable. Oh, by the way, that Saturday when my watch offered me directions to Philz? I deliberately turned in the opposite direction and ran an errand first. My small blow for free will.

Mobile marketing firm Fiksu claims to have tracked four iPad devices with previously unseen model numbers. For the unaware, Fiksu owns a tracker SDK that many developers build into their apps, generating data. This tracker can tell what the model number of a device is, so when it picks up an unknown model number, it almost certainly means that there’s a Fiksu-enabled app being used on a pre-launch device – in this case, an iPad. However, we should note that this doesn’t mean we’ll see four new iPad devices shortly. Before the most recent two iPad Pro launches, Fiksu picked up the follow four model numbers: 6,3, 6,4, 6,7, and 6,8. This time Fiksu is reporting seeing 7,1, 7,2, 7,3, and 7,4 in San Francisco and Cupertino (Apple’s home town). Fiksu also reports having tracked these devices in its logs at least 43 times. Apple is widely expected to launch a new iPad Pro – possibly called the iPad Pro 2 – imminently, with some reports putting the release as soon as next week. Prominent Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, of KGI Securities, believes we’ll see three different iPad models, two of which will feature a new A10X chip that’s based on the iPhone 7 processor. The third will supposedly be a cheaper device using the iPhone 6S’s A9 chip, toting a small 9.7-inch screen. The more powerful devices will reportedly measure in at 12.9-inches and either 10-inches or 10.5-inches. Of course, until Apple actually makes a formal announcement, we’d recommend taking all leaks with a pinch of salt. Related: Best Tablets What would you like to see from the iPad Pro 2?

Nelson01/14/2016 The new Apple Pencil stylus for the iPad Pro may be hard to find, but it isn’t hard to use. Its simplicity can be its downfall, however; when the Apple Pencil stops working, it can be difficult to figure out why. We’ve put together a list of the most common Apple Pencil problems – and their fixes. It might seem like there’s nothing to be done if your Apple Pencil isn’t working right – after all, there are no buttons or displays. That simplicity is actually a good thing, as it makes troubleshooting pretty easy. My Apple Pencil doesn’t work. If your Apple Pencil never worked, you might not have paired it with your iPad, yet. Or you might have multiple iPads, and simply tried using it with the wrong device. To pair it with your iPad, pop off the cap, and insert it into the Lighting port on the bottom of your device. A pop up will appear on your iPad, asking if you want to pair the Pencil with this iPad; tap to agree, and your Pencil should start working. Also, be sure that your iPad supports Apple Pencil in the first place – if you have anything other than an iPad Pro, you’re out of luck. The Pencil isn’t compatible with the iPad Air 2, iPad Air, iPad Mini 4, or anything older. My Apple Pencil stopped working. If your Apple Pencil was working, but now it isn’t, the first thing to try is tightening the tip of your stylus. Just hold the Pencil in one hand, and twist the tip with your other hand. You’ll want to tighten it by twisting it clockwise. Occasionally, the tip can become invisibly loosen, and the Pencil will stop working. Tightening this tip will usually fix the issue. You should also make sure that you have Bluetooth turned on. If you put your iPad into Airplane mode, for example, you might not realize that Bluetooth gets turned off. Just swipe up from the bottom of the screen to bring up Control Center, and make sure the Bluetooth icon is on (if it’s on, it should be mostly white, or lit up). You can also tap on your Settings icon, find Bluetooth in the list, and make sure that the toggle switch is on (it’ll have a green background). If Bluetooth is turned on, but your Pencil still isn’t responding, you can might just be out of a charge. Most of the time, the iPad will tell you when your Apple Pencil is getting low on battery, but it waits until the Pencil reaches 5% before it pops up a notification to let you know. If you’re not within Bluetooth range when that happens, however, your Pencil can die and the iPad won’t be aware of it. Simply pop the cap off the end of the Pencil, and plug it into your iPad Pro’s Lightning port at the bottom of the tablet. Leave it to charge for a few minutes, and up to half an hour. Then, pull it out, put the cap back on, and try to use it. If the battery is dead, your Pencil should respond after charging for just a few seconds – Apple promises 30 minutes of use with just a fifteen-second charge. You might try deleting the Apple Pencil from your iPad and re-pairing it. Don’t worry, this won’t delete any files, or any other work on your iPad that you might have done with your Pencil; it only removes it from your settings. To try this, go into your Settings app and tap on Bluetooth in the left column. On the right, you’ll see a list of devices with which you’ve previously paired your iPad. They’ll say either ‘Connected’ or ‘Not Connected’ depending on proximity and power status; you might see either label next to your Apple Pencil entry. Tap on the little circle with a lowercase i at the end of the listing for your Apple Pencil. A new screen will show, reading ‘Forget This Device.’ Tap on that and, if asked, confirm. Then proceed as you would for a brand new Apple Pencil – take off the cap, plug it into the Lightning port, and wait for the iPad to pair the stylus. The last thing you can try is to reboot your iPad. Sometimes the Bluetooth radio on a mobile device can get a little mixed up, but a reboot will often clear things up. Simply hold the power button down until you see the screen change. Slide the power button to the right, and your iPad will power down. After it’s finished, wait a few seconds, and hold the power button down again until you see the Apple logo appear on the screen. Once the iPad finishes turning on, try using your Apple Pencil – if it still doesn’t work, repeat one or more of the steps above, since rebooting your iPad may have changed something. If none of the above steps work, you’ll probably have to get a new Apple Pencil. You can take it back to the store you purchased it from, if new, or head into an Apple retail store where they’ll probably just exchange it for a new one. I can’t tell how much battery life is left on my Apple Pencil. Normally, when you pair a Bluetooth device with your iPhone or iPad, you’ll see a special battery icon appear next to the Bluetooth icon at the top of your screen – that’s the battery life for whatever you’ve got connected (usually a headset or headphones). With the Apple Pencil, however, that icon never appears, and instead Apple buries the option deep within your notification center. To see how much battery life your Apple Pencil has left, unlock your iPad and swipe down from the top of the screen. Tap on the button that reads ‘Edit’, then pick the ‘Batteries’ widget to include on your Today View (just tap the plus icon on the left, and then move it up and down by tapping and holding on the three lines to the right). Once finished, tap on the Done button in the upper right-hand corner. You’ll now see a listing for Batteries, with your iPad and Apple Pencil both listed. You can check it at any time by swiping down from the top of your screen. My Apple Pencil isn’t writing as well as it used to, or the tip doesn’t feel right. The Apple Pencil is engineered with a tip that will slowly degrade over time, as harder materials don’t feel as comfortable when you’re writing or drawing on a hard surface like the screen of your iPad. As a result, Apple ships a second tip in the box with your Pencil. Just find your Apple Pencil box, and look for the second tip inside. Unscrew the current tip on your Pencil by twisting it counterclockwise, and keep turning it until it pops off. You can throw this tip away, and replace it by pushing the new tip on, then turning it in a clockwise rotation until it’s tightened. If you’ve gone through your second tip, or threw away your Apple Pencil box without getting the free second tip out, you might be out of luck, as replacement tips aren’t yet available. Try stopping by an Apple retail store, or calling their support hotline, and explain the situation – chances are good you’ll leave with a new tip on your Pencil. Did you burn through the list above and still can’t figure out what’s wrong with your Apple Pencil? Leave a question in the comments section below, and someone might have an answer! 27 Responses 01/25/2016 Roberta Coren Reply I find after I’ve paired my pencil it interferes with my ability to use previously paired items, like my Bose speaker for example. It also causes my podcast app to freeze. Even after I’ve unpaired the pencil and “forgot my device” it still give me trouble, I still have to reboot my iPad and occasionally I have to do a hard restart. This issue happens after every time I have paired my pencil. It’s very frustrating and too much time is wasted on this. Any suggestions? It’s a new pencil because my first one stopped working after 1 day. It hardly seems worth the effort/ 01/28/2016 J.R. Nelson Reply Whoa, that’s a pretty strange problem! I wonder if something is wrong with your specific iPad Pro, rather than the Pencil itself? I haven’t encountered any issues, and I stream to my Bluetooth headphones a lot while using the Pencil. 01/26/2016 Oscar Reply Mine pairs, charges and will open, close, select items so I can see it is functioning but it will not write. Tried new tip, tried repairing, rebooting etc but same problem….no lines/drawing/text in any relevant app such as Notes or Mail. Did I get a dud? 01/28/2016 J.R. Nelson Reply Unfortunately, it sounds like you might have. 01/28/2016 Andrew Kin Wai Tsang Reply Mine stopped working after a week for no reason and i tried all the above steps. It is so annoying waiting 5 weeks for a replacement. I really hope i just got a dud and that it is not a common problem as i got the ipad pro just for the pencil and art apps. I took real good care of mine and carried it around in its original box and barely used it.i wish there was a hover cursor for better accuracy when using large brush sizes…the apps on ios are what really impress me so respect to the talented app developers…i love android for some things…but the app market still pales in comparison to the IOS app market. I think the lag on my wacom intuos is slightly faster for sketching…but i haven’t really had much time to try large brush sizes in different apps to see if it performs faster than my intuos. 01/28/2016 J.R. Nelson Reply If you’ve got an Apple retail store near you, you should stop buy and tell them your issues – even though Pencil stocks are still slightly limited, most of the time Apple keeps spares of devices in stores to swap out malfunctioning customer devices – even if they “don’t have any in stock” there’s probably a few in back for this exact reason. 02/05/2016 newmanmark@sbcglobal.net Reply My apple pencil seems to have a more obvious latency delay after only using it for a few days. I did drop it once but it does still work. I changed to the new tip and it still has the latency delay. Could I have damaged it only with a latency problem? 02/11/2016 Wouter Reply My Pencil also stopped connecting as well…it connects when stuck into the Lightning port, but is locked at 74% charged. Strange..anybody has a tip ? 02/13/2016 William Reply My is ☠ Expensive gadget! Light durability! 04/04/2016 Steven Reply Found a elegant wood case that holds the pencil, the cap, and the lighting adapter. I found it here:https://www.antiquecharacter.biz 04/19/2016 Jamie Reply Pencil cannot be used while it is charging; this caught me out today when I tried using my pencil with a flat battery and it wasn’t working (scratching head) so i plugged it into charge but it still wouldn’t work… unplugged it for charge cable after a few minutes and it started working. 05/24/2016 Samie-Jo Reply Purchased an Apple Pencil today. Paired it to iPad Pro. It worked for about 30 seconds. I followed all the above steps. It’s connected and I can view how much charge it has, but it just won’t do anything. Left it for a while, charged it, did everything you could think of. Returned it to the store I bought it from, got a replacement straight away. This one did the same thing. Also as above mention mine is stuck on 74%. I’m not sure if it the pencil or my iPad Pro. But I have only had the iPad for around a month. 05/30/2016 jonathan Reply Recently bought iPad pro and pencil. It activates some functions including keyboard but won’t draw or write. I bought a spare whilst on holiday and it had the same problem…have tried re-booting and re pairing all as recommended. Any further ideas?? 06/09/2016 Needs2Cash Reply Kindly advise how to see the iPencil listed with the devices in Procreate. It lists Adonit Jot, Pencil by FiftyThree, Pogo Connect and Wacom Intuos Creative Stylus… …but not my iPencil despite it being paired with my iPad Pro. 06/17/2016 Shivy Reply I’ve had my pencil for a while, but only now has it stopped working. It’s stuck at 17% and won’t charge. I tried the Bluetooth reconnecting thing and “forgot” this pencil, but now it’s not pairing with the device, for I haven’t received any notification that it has. So now I have a pencil that won’t charge OR connect with my iPad Pro. I’m probably gonna have to replace it. 07/04/2016 Koen Reply I tried and I tried. Pairing went ok, fully charged etc. The pencil was recognized, but still I could not write on the iPad. I was almost returning to the store when I screwed the tip of the pen a bit tighter and then it worked. Maybe this is also worth testing… 08/22/2016 LadyGadget Reply Tightening the tip worked!!!!! After rebooting, I un-pairing and re-pairing, I simply loosed and re-tightened the tip. SUCCESS 09/19/2016 Rurik Halaby Reply I really enjoy my pencil, but have two problems with it. Once in a while it goes to sleep even if full. To wake it up you plug it in for a second or two and that wakes it up. The other problem is that with design trumping function it has no clip to secure it to your shirt pocket. I did find a purveyor of clips but it looks like hell. Too bad. 09/26/2016 James Reply When Apple Pencil is paired with my iPad Pro it causes the wifi to keeping dropping out despit full signal and in same room as router. Wifi is perfectly stable until I connect the pencil and then it keeps disconnecting. When it drops out often it does not reconnect automatically. I have to go to settings and press on my network to rejoin. Sometimes this works and it reconnects and sometimes it repeatedly asks for my wifi password despite entering the correct password. It is extremely irritating. I have heard of other people experience same issue when pairing other Bluetooth devices but no solutions to the problem have been found. 11/15/2016 camilomf Reply THANK YOU! I was about to give up after reading and trying all suggestions in another troubleshooting article online. Turned out my TIP WAS LOOSE! I had tried pushing and pulling on the tip before, used as I am to my other “pencil,” by fortythree. I wasn’t aware of the screw-on, very fine ridges of Apple’s pencil. What’s next? Am I turning into one of those people that call customer service after forgetting to push an “ON” switch? 12/01/2016 Khurrum Reply My pencil is working fine, but one thing I need to know.. I used to switch off Bluetooth, WiFi before turning iPad screen off. Even though my pencil is paired, but every time I switch ON Bluetooth, I’ve to plug pencil in the iPad port for connection.. Is this the correct way to plug pencil all the time you need to use it. Second option is that I keep my Bluetooth ON for all times. Are you all operate pencil like this? Thanks and Regards, KAK 12/02/2016 Christopher DeGrace Reply Does anyone have a problem with your pencil “skipping” while you write and the Ipad is charging? At least it seems to be far worse while charging. Basically I’ll be drawing a character and there are just random gaps in the drawing. 12/12/2016 Mey V Reply My apple pencil freezes up when i go to write with it. The ap im in locks up then i have to get out of it and reboot…..anyone know how to fix this? 12/21/2016 Kenn Reply Deleting and repairing in Bluetooth worked for me. Took me out of panick mode. Thanks much for your article. 12/24/2016 Joakim G Reply So yeah got mine for Christmas, had problems pairing when it suddenly worked! Immediately started “sketches pro” and were able to click the color palette and make a few lines before it just stopped working. It pairs and show full charge (now…) on the battery widget, but doesn’t work at all. Tightened tip, tried spare. Disconnected/”forgot device”, rebooted and tried it all at random for hours. Guess I’ll have to take it back, but it’s holidays. And the thing did work! What’s the deal with these??? 03/05/2017 PierreDC Reply Thanks. In my case, I had to forget the device, which I didn’t dare to do before I read this. It worked. 03/14/2017 Ruba Reply My apple pencil reaches 100% within one minute but once I unplug it show that the battery is very low … I tried leaving it to charge over night but it didn’t work .. I charged it using both the IPad Pro and tried a wall charger too .. but neither worked .. I tried rebooting the I pad , unpairing and pairing it agian Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

The iPhone 6s was announced earlier this month at Apple’s annual fall event where the company was expected to unveil such a device, but they also announced the iPad Pro and the new Apple TV to boot. Of course, though, the iPhone 6s was the main event, and it’s Apple’s latest flagship smartphone that will gain a lot of attention when it’s finally released this week. The new device comes with a faster processor, an improved camera, and the new 3D Touch display. This allows users to hard press on the screen to bring up alternative options and shortcuts to apps that support the feature, and of course you can simply tap something to select it or open it up. As for the camera, the iPhone 6s now sports a 12-megapixel camera instead of the 8-megapixel camera that’s on the iPhone 6. Plus, the newer device can record 4K videos now. In any case, if you’re thinking about upgrading to the iPhone 6s and aren’t quite sure which storage size to get, you at least shouldn’t buy the 128GB iPhone 6s, and here’s why. Way too Much Storage While the 16GB iPhone 6s isn’t enough storage, the 128GB iPhone 6s is way too much storage for most users. With the addition of 4K video and the ability to create “Live Photos” on your iPhone 6s, 16GB of storage just won’t cut it, even for the most casual of users. However, 128GB of storage will probably be overkill. Of course, it never hurts to have a lot of storage, just in case you might ever need it, especially when you go on vacation and are expecting to record a lot of 4K videos. I usually have the same mindset as well, but photos and videos never end up taking up as much storage as I think. If you think you’ll need the 128GB iPhone 6s, that’s cool and all, but you’ll probably never get close to filling it up, unless you absolutely know that you’re going to, since many users will put all of their music and pretty much everything they own onto their iPhones. Realistically, though, the 64GB iPhone 6s is probably the best storage size to get for most users. Too Expensive Of course, the big reason why users have a hard time deciding on a storage size is because of the price. The more storage you want, the more you’ll pay for it. The 128GB iPhone 6s is priced at $849, with the iPhone 6s Plus version priced at a whopping $949. Some users wouldn’t hesitate to spend that kind of money, but most casual users probably don’t need to. Price is obviously the only real downside to the 128GB iPhone 6s, and it’s why you probably don’t need the larger storage capacity anyway. In fact, many users still buy the 16GB version of the iPhone or iPad just to get the lowest price possible, even if 16GB isn’t the best storage size for most users. If anything, the 16GB iPhone is merely Apple’s secret money maker that almost forces users to upgrade to the 64GB iPhone and pay $100 more for it. However, it’s a better deal than what it used to be, as paying $100 more would only get you up to 32GB with past iPhone models, but Apple recently moved to a 16GB/64GB/128GB/ storage tier system, so essentially 64GB is a really good deal, even if Apple is sort of tricking you to get it after all. I kind of wish the 32GB option was still available, since I personally wouldn’t need 64GB, and if I could save some cash by going with a 32GB model, I’d totally go for that, but upgrading to a 64GB iPhone for just $100 more isn’t a terrible deal, and it’s certainly a better deal than it was a couple of years ago. 11 Responses 09/22/2015 James Reply Lets not forget that the actual available user storage is less than quoted by Apple, the iOS and pre-installed apps take up some GB’s. The 16GB (about 12.6 GB available to user) isn’t nearly enough for most people but it is OK for some! I’ve gone for the 128GB 6s in gold as I’d rather have too much storage than too little! I take a lot of Photos!! Plus the new iPhone 6s will likely take up extra space per photo with the higher resolution camera and 4K video capabilities. 09/23/2015 Ronnie Reply While I see the point of re-re-rethinking how much storage you really need, I am leaning towards getting the 128gb Iphone 6s plus as well. I agree with James on the pics point, and to add to that further, Apple has been pitching the new camera quite aggressively. This also means a tonnes more pics, lots of instagram, lot of syncing across devices and the want to share which means duplicity of some pics on your phone. Note that pics are not in kbs these days and are rather in 4 to 5 mbs range for a high resolution pic. Now e.g I have another camera on the go and I want to share pics from that camera, I would prefer to have the pics transfer to my iphone over wifi and then edit and share on the fly. A fine example is the Sony A6000 which seamlessly transfers pics via playmemories. All those pics will take space. icloud choke alarm (some might argue that buying the icloud storage might work cheaper annually but one is complete network dependant and also will need to enjoy the lag for the downloads hopefully not in bad network). Apps are getting bigger and so are games and depending on the kind of user you are, it all builds into the 60gb or so that you ll get from apple. This is ultimately a personal call, as a template, I travel outside US a lot and am not beginning to fdeel the need for carrying limited devices which cover everything. I recently moved to iOs from Android and the luxury I miss is the ability to add memory cards. Have a GoPro (insert memory card edit videos magisto and boom on igram/fb). I now can consider the need for that extra room onboard since apple won’t allow memory cards (high time they do). Not to debunk any price limitations highlighted in the article which are spot on, I just feel one should also measure the time one plans to keep the phone for. I don’t intend changing from the 6s until something earthshattering is released by the behemoth phone manufacturers sprouting around the world. But until then, its going to be an investment into the non-space restraint use of the one device which goes with you EVERYWHERE. 09/23/2015 Tiffany Reply This was the stupidest article ever. Ever. You are stupid. Stop writing. 03/27/2016 Mohammed Nadeem Reply I agreeeeeeeeeeeeeeee 10/06/2015 superball Reply Why would you feel the need to weigh in on how much storage anyone “should” have? To each his own. My iPhone 6/128 does not come close to holding all my music, and frankly I wish it did as it becomes a bit of a management issue. 10/26/2015 ramon Reply You definitely dont want to get the 16gb model, but if you have more money I would just get the 128gb. If you dont have enough getting the 64gb is a must. This is mainly because the 4k video, and live video are going to take up alot more space more quickly http://goo.gl/JvOmqd 02/18/2016 Mk Reply I am confused . 03/31/2016 orangecicada Reply What was the point to this article? When I saw the title,I thought maybe I would learn that for some reason, the extra storage was somehow a detriment to phone’ s functionality. Instead, it just tells me not to spend money on storage I don’t need unless I might need it after all? As long as the extra storage doesn’t cause a problem, why not have it just in case ? The phone is already extremely expensive, so if you can afford the 64gb, you can likely afford the 128 gb. 04/03/2016 Eric Reply Bigger is always Better 10/14/2016 Coralie Reply I’m updating now to 6s plus 64 gb from a 4s. Was going to go to 128 but noticed it’s camera was only an 8medapixel! Why is this. I cannot find an answer on the internet either! 03/13/2017 Carrie Reply This article is a waste of readers’ time because the title is VERY misleading. I’m considering buying a 6S 128mb, and thought this article was going to tell me that something is wrong with that model. PLEASE change the title. Arghhhhh.

The Apple iPhone 6s silicon case is $35 and it comes in a variety of colors that match up well with the four available iPhone 6s color options. Here’s a look at how the official Apple iPhone 6s silicone case feels, protects and looks on the new iPhone. Is the iPhone 6s Silicone case worth buying? After using the leather iPhone case last year, I opted for the Orange Apple Silicone iPhone 6s case that looks a lot better in person than it does in photos. If you love orange, this is certainly a case to consider. If you aren’t a fan of orange, there are 10 other colors to choose from. This is a very thin case so it does not add much to the thickness of the iPhone 6s — which is itself slightly thicker than the iPhone 6. You can use these new cases on the iPhone 6 if you want access to the new colors. A soft interior prevents any scuffs or scratches. The inside of the Apple iPhone 6s case is covered in microfiber to protect the finish of your iPhone while inside. One of the nice things about this thin case is that there is a lip that keeps the screen off tables and other surfaces when placed face down. This is something you may do more often thanks to a new iOS 9 feature that doesn’t light up the display when it is face down with Low Power Mode on. Edges keep the screen off rough surfaces. The raised edges don’t interfere with the new iPhone 6s 3D Touch feature that includes a press on the edge of the screen to activate multitasking and quick action home screen shortcuts. Apple’s design allows full access to ports and buttons without any compromises, which is common in thin cases like this. There is an Apple logo on the back in a slightly different shade of orange, that is similar to the logo on the iPhone. This silicone is much easier to grip than an iPhone 6s without a case. It is not too grippy to put in a pocket or get out of a pocket, but I noticed after almost a week of use that it does catch slightly more on gym short pockets than it did on the first day, so this is something I will continue to monitor. The official Apple iPhone 6s silicone case matches the Apple Watch band in orange. With a thin design this will not protect your iPhone 6s from huge drops, but it makes the phone easier to hold and will prevent scratches. Users who are prone to repeatedly dropping their iPhone may want to consider other options. You can buy the iPhone 6s Silicone case from Apple for $35 in 11 colors online or in stores. Apple sells a larger version for the iPhone 6s Plus for $39. Check out a collection of the best iPhone 6s cases you can buy in the slides below. 23 Best iPhone 6s Cases Speck CandyShell Clear iPhone 6s Case   1 / 23 The Speck CandyShell Clear is the first clear iPhone 6s case from Speck, and the first clear case from the company overall. This form-fitting, minimalist iPhone 6s case delivers a decent amount of protection with a military drop test 810G rating. Speck assures us that the clear case will not yellow with use like many cheap clear case options. The clear finish is perfect for showing off your iPhone 6s color choice while protecting it. Buttons move perfectly and are easy to find by touch and there is a raised front bezel to keep the iPhone 6s display off hard surfaces. $34.95 at Speck   1 / 23 5 Responses 10/01/2015 Tom Reply Is the silicone case is like the silicone case from last year ? (also attract lint?) thanks. 10/01/2015 Georgiaarapier Reply 0=6my classmate’s mother makes $78 every hour on the internet .

This is a custom designed iphone 6s case that not only looks great but has some great grip as well. Its slim light weight and a 2 piece bumper case https://goo.gl/t8swV4 . You should also be signed up for apple care plus on your iphone 6s as well 03/30/2016 Rog Reply I think this case is okay and kind of pricey to be honest. The iphone 6s and iphone 6 is better suited for something thats a lot lighter and easy to hold. The phone itself is pretty slippery. This is a case ive been using for awhile now and have really liked so far http://goo.gl/HE1BhM 03/14/2017 James Smith Reply Mine didn’t last a year, corners frayed, broken.

The report, ironically, was presented by the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Privacy (SRP), Joseph A Cannataci, the day after WikiLeaks published the biggest leak from the CIA that detailed how American intelligence agency hacks Apple and Android smartphones, electronic devices including smart TVs and communication apps like the popular WhatsApp and Signal. File photo of Joseph A Cannataci. Image courtesy: Twitter/@NIHRC The report does not include this latest case of document dumping since it was published after the UN report had already been finalised and submitted to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights but, nonetheless, the UN expert has some strong words for countries like the US, the UK, France and Germany, pulling them up for unwarranted regimes of domestic and international spying. That, tech giants who operate data centres internationally are constantly worried about states overstepping boundaries, is because there is no international law that regulates such surveillance. The UN expert recommends creating an international body with a pool of judges that will review and authorise states’ requests for data access to multinationals with granting an equivalent of an international surveillance warrant or international data access warrant (IDAW) — on grounds of reasonable suspicion under clear international law — that would be enforceable in cyberspace. Countries signing up to such a new treaty or additional protocol could be contributing their own specialised independent judges to a pool who would, sitting as a panel, conceivably act as a one-stop shop for relevant judicial warrants enforceable worldwide – naturally in those countries which would become party to the treaty. The evidence available to the SRP suggests that “some leading democracies” treat the Internet in an opportunistic manner “operating relatively unfettered, intercepting data and hacking millions of devices, (smartphones, tablets and laptops as much as servers) worldwide”. “In doing so, approximately 15-25 states treat the Internet as their own playground over which they can squabble for spoils, ever seeking to gain the upper hand whether in terms of cyber-war, or espionage or counter-espionage, or industrial espionage." “The list of motivations goes on while the other 175-odd states look on powerless, unable to do much about it except hope that somehow cyber-peace will prevail”, the privacy expert states in his report. He reveals that “a tiny minority of states” have actively tried to “informally discourage” the SRP from exploring options for solutions to have internationally enforceable safeguards and remedies on the internet. The present Cybercrime Convention deals only with the criminal justice sector and, therefore, the types of activities revealed by Edward Snowden lies outside the scope of the Convention. This legal instrument regulating surveillance in cyberspace would be another step, complementary to other pieces of existing cyberlaw such as the Cybercrime Convention. Uncharacteristically, the US did not make an intervention during a debate on this report at the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) on 7 and 8 March. The recent WikiLeaks expose of about 9,000 secret files called Vault 7 has left governments, citizens and rights activists worried over the possibilities of unfounded intrusion into millions of lives, especially given the current backlash against immigrants and foreigners in Europe and the US. “Surveillance activities, regardless of whether they are directed towards foreigners or citizens, must only be carried out in compliance with fundamental human rights such as privacy,” Cannataci says in his report. “…especially when it comes to surveillance carried out on the Internet, privacy should not be a right that depends on the passport in your pocket,” the report says. While “traditional” methods of data interception like phone calls require judicial authorisation in some countries but other techniques such as the collection and analysis of metadata referring to protocols of internet browsing history or data originating from the use of smartphones (location, phone calls, usage of applications, etc) are subject to much weaker safeguards. This is not justified since the latter categories of data are at least as revealing of a person’s individual activity as the actual content of a conversation, Cannataci argues. “…if the state is capable of potentially interfering with every flow of information, even retroactively through bulk data retention and technologies such as “quick freeze”, the right to privacy will simply not experience a full transition to the digital age,” Cannataci told the HRC. The Snowden revelations and their aftermath have “clearly shown” that there is a pressing need for government authorities to explain their work to the public which may partially be achieved through ex-post notification of those individuals who are subject to surveillance. “There is little or no evidence to persuade the SRP [special rapporteur for privacy] of either the efficacy or the proportionality of some of the extremely privacy-intrusive measures that have been introduced by new surveillance laws in France, Germany, the UK and the USA,” says the UN expert. Once data has been collected through bulk acquisition or “mass surveillance” these are “increasingly vulnerable” to be hacked by hostile governments or organised crime while there is no proof that such mass data acquisition has helped in lessening security risks. The right to privacy infringed through domestic or international measures is a fiercely debated issue not only in the UN but within national discourses as well. In India, activists have raised privacy concerns of submitting biometric details to the government vis-a-vis the Aadhaar card system — particularly of vulnerable sections such as women rescued from trafficking, young children, the disabled — as well as the possibility of data leakages from the system. Joseph Cannataci was appointed as the first special rapporteur on the right to privacy by the HRC in July 2015 after a resolution that highlighted the need for an expert who monitors this issue globally. #American intelligence#Apple#Facebook#Google#India#Joseph a cannataci#Julian assange#Newstracker#Privacy#Right to privacy#Srp#Twitter#Un human rights council#Un report#Un special rapporteur on the right to privacy#Unhrc#United kingdom#United nations#United states#Wikileaks Published Date: Mar 14, 2017 03:52 pm | Updated Date: Mar 14, 2017 03:52 pm Also See WikiLeaks releases documents exposing alleged CIA hacking programme India, Pakistan wrangle over Kashmir issue during a debate at UN Human Rights Council India, Pakistan spar at UNHRC over Kashmir as New Delhi calls Islamabad 'world's terrorism factory' NSA Ajit Doval meets Israeli leadership in preparation for Narendra Modi's visit Top Stories India vs Australia, 3rd Test: Rudderless and lethargic hosts allowed visitors to take control on Day 1 'BJP Gives Us Dignity, That's Why Muslim Women in UP Voted for Modi' Manipur elections paint a picture of BJP that the country should be wary of Baahubali 2 trailer: Rajamouli has showcased to the world what Indian filmmakers can achieve Income from MF investments must be shown in income tax returns Council clears State, Union Territory GST laws; cap sin goods cess at 15% France: Several injured in shooting at school in Grasse, one student arrested Cricket Scores Current & Recent Upcoming Australia in India, 4 Test Series, 2017 South Africa in New Zealand, 3 Test Series, 2017 Bangladesh in Sri Lanka, 2 Test Series, 2017 Afghanistan and Ireland in India, 5 ODI Series, 2017 Afghanistan beat Ireland by 30 runs Afghanistan and Ireland in India, 3 T20I Series, 2017 Afghanistan beat Ireland by 28 runs Afghanistan and Ireland in India, 3 T20I Series, 2017 Afghanistan beat Ireland by 17 runs (D/L method) England in West Indies, 3 ODI Series, 2017 England beat West Indies by 186 runs Afghanistan and Ireland in India, 3 T20I Series, 2017 Afghanistan beat Ireland by 6 wickets South Africa in New Zealand, 3 Test Series, 2017 New Zealand drew with South Africa Bangladesh in Sri Lanka, 2 Test Series, 2017 Sri Lanka beat Bangladesh by 259 runs Afghanistan and Ireland in India, 5 ODI Series, 2017 AFG vs IRE - Mar 17th, 2017, 09:30 AM IST Afghanistan and Ireland in India, 5 ODI Series, 2017 AFG vs IRE - Mar 19th, 2017, 09:30 AM IST Afghanistan and Ireland in India, 5 ODI Series, 2017 AFG vs IRE - Mar 22nd, 2017, 09:30 AM IST Afghanistan and Ireland in India, 5 ODI Series, 2017 AFG vs IRE - Mar 24th, 2017, 09:30 AM IST South Africa in New Zealand, 3 Test Series, 2017 NZ vs SA - Mar 25th, 2017, 03:30 AM IST Australia in India, 4 Test Series, 2017 IND vs AUS - Mar 25th, 2017, 09:30 AM IST Bangladesh in Sri Lanka, 3 ODI Series, 2017 SL vs BAN - Mar 25th, 2017, 02:30 PM IST Pakistan in West Indies, 4 T20 International Series, 2017 WI vs PAK - Mar 26th, 2017, 10:00 PM IST Bangladesh in Sri Lanka, 3 ODI Series, 2017 SL vs BAN - Mar 28th, 2017, 02:30 PM IST Pakistan in West Indies, 4 T20 International Series, 2017 WI vs PAK - Mar 30th, 2017, 10:00 PM IST Site Index हिंदी फर्स्टपोस्ट About Firstpost Newsletter RSS Twitter Facebook Sections Front Page Politics Sports India World Business Life Entertainment Photos Videos Plus New Delhi Mumbai Photos Videos FP Exclusives Cartoons Video Room eBooks Weather Others Sample Papers Online Business Technology News MTV India Online Shopping in India Budget 2017 Assembly Election Results 2017 Weather E-Learning Franchise Opportunity Tools RSS Feeds Apps iOS Android Copyright © 2017.

We’re not sure when the company will be making it official, but we had heard that Apple could be launching their new iPads without any fanfare which would be odd as it is a new tablet in a new size. However turns out that maybe we might get our event after all. In a new report from DigiTimes (via AppleInsider), it has been revealed that Apple could be revealing the new 10.5-inch iPad at a special event that will be taking place in April. Now we can’t say with certainty that the event will only cover the 10.5-inch iPad or if it will cover all the iPad refreshes. Apple also tends to merge multiple products into a single event, and given that it has been a while since we last saw a refresh of the 12-inch Retina MacBook and the iMac, perhaps the event in April could cover those products as well, but do take it with a grain of salt. Recently there have been signs that Apple could have a new iPad in the works. Logs have shown that Apple is testing out four different iPad models, which we can only assume is the iPad mini, the 9.7-inch iPad/iPad Pro, the 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, but like we said we’ll have to wait and see.

Voter registration in low-literacy economies is now economical. Identifying persons of interest in a crowd can be done with biometrics. Growth of biometric technologies has been in response to global security threats. Terrorist attacks, airport security initiatives, and attempts to lower crime rates have brought an increasing investment in biometric security systems. Government projects include ePassports, eDriving licenses, border management, and national IDs. These initiatives have been implemented in developed countries. A rise in government projects has been seen as terrorists become an increasing threat. This has been accompanied by increasing data security concerns. There is a need for advanced security devices. To Get Complete Report @ http://www.acutemarketreports.com/report/biometrics-market-report Biometrics use cases can be consumer- or citizen-facing. These use cases are typically high-volume, low price broadly implemented systems. Enterprise-facing use cases include government law enforcement, and defense applications where an organization is implementing smaller volumes of devices, or where the devices are more expensive. Use cases define the biometrics market. Biometrics is used to identify individuals with confidence. When used in law enforcement, cases are resolved quicker and with more convictions of guilty people. Security systems implementations drive the market for biometric systems. Biometric data protection is being used to replace photographs, passwords and PIN codes. India, Mexico and Russia are driving the extraordinary growth of biometric systems. China has a biometric national ID program that commenced in 2013. India is getting on board. Computer storage of important documents has created an increasing need for biometric security systems. Key industries in the biometrics market are finance, consumer devices, and healthcare. Key use cases include smart phone payment systems, consumer device authentication, mobile banking, automated teller machines (cashpoints), government IT systems, point-of-sale transactions, pharmacy dispensing, and wearable device authentication. Call center use cases apply across nearly all industries. Biometric modalities include hybrid fingerprint / palm print, facial recognition, iris image, and voice recognition. The global biometrics market is $7.0 billion in 2014, rising to $44.2 billion by 2021. Biometrics revenue and device shipment forecasts are segmented by modality and market segment. There are four market segments, law enforcement, border control which includes government ID systems, workplace access, and consumer ID. According to Susan Eustis, leader of the team that prepared the study, “Biometrics represent a multi-billion dollar industry because the devices provide personal identity protection. Biometrics is used by civil authorities to permit the organization of people into units of government that are a cohesive group of people, not intruded upon by outsiders. Biometrics provides a cornerstone of law enforcement agencies with fingerprint ID.” WinterGreen Research is an independent research organization funded by the sale of market research studies all over the world and by the implementation of ROI models that are used to calculate the total cost of ownership of equipment, services, and software.

And what tech specs, new features and design changes should we expect when Apple updates the Mac Pro line for 2017? Or is it more likely that Apple will discontinue the Mac Pro instead of updating it? We've had a long wait for the new Mac Pro. The current Mac Pro model was announced at WWDC in June 2013, shipping that December, and, for a top-of-the range system, the Mac Pro is looking pretty long in the tooth. In addition, many of the Mac Pro's traditional creative professional audience (videographers, designers, photographers) have hung onto their ancient Mac Pro towers that predate the 2013 redesign because their old Mac Pros, which could be customised, offered more flexibility and power, at least at the time Apple launched the new-look 'trash can-style' Mac Pro. So we're long overdue an update to the Mac Pro before creative Mac professionals turn towards Windows and Linux for their workstation needs... those that haven't already turned their back on Apple, at least. Some pundits believe the Mac Pro should simply be discontinued, though, we look at the reasons why they think that below. If Apple is going to launch a new Mac Pro when are we likely to see it? And what hardware improvements, design changes, tech specs and new features will we see in the new Mac Pro for 2017? Read on to find out everything we (think we) know. For more discussion of upcoming Apple launches, take a look at our big roundup of Apple predictions for 2017. And if you're considering buying one of the current Mac Pro models, read Where to buy Mac Pro in the UK and our Mac buying guide 2017. Updated 1 March 2017: Tim Cook has been talking about the importance of the professional and creative markets in the biggest hint yet that a new Mac Pro could be on the way... See also: New MacBook Pro rumours | New MacBook Air rumours | New MacBook rumours | New iMac rumours | New Mac mini rumours Some Apple appreciators are even working on concept images and videos of what an updated Mac Pro could look like. A concept video by a French designer sees the Mac Pro take the route of looking like an iMac while borrowing a lot of ideas from the Microsoft Surface Studio. Take a look for yourself here. Will Apple update the Mac Pro? There is always going to be the question of whether Apple will turn its back on the Mac, with the iPhone becoming such a significant part of its business, and with Steve Jobs having said that the desktops days were numbered when he spoke about how the iPad would revolutionise computing. However, we can confidently say that Apple isn't turning away from the Mac desktop just yet, based on CEO Tim Cook's comments below. Further comments from Tim Cook indicate that Apple isn't about to give up on the professional market either. Speaking at the Shareholders meeting on 28 February 2017, Cook indicated that Apple is still focused on its professional customers and has plans to "do more" in that area. Cook said: "You will see us do more in the pro area. The pro area is very important to us. The creative area is very important to us in particular. "Don't think something we've done or something that we're doing that isn't visible yet is a signal that our priorities are elsewhere," Cook added. However, the 'and' between 'creative' and 'professional' could be telling, and a way out of giving a clear answer about the Mac Pro (or the iMac or FCP). Regarding Cooks comments, our colleague on Digital Arts suggested that the "people who are creative-but-not-professional and professional-but-not-creative would probably look to the MacBook Pro (which is fine for photo-editing and Office)". He feels that the MacBook Pro is more suited to people who see themselves as creatives, rather than creative professionals. Could the same be said to apply to Mac Pro users. Regardless of nitpicking about what constitutes a 'creative professional', Cook's comments give us hope that Apple will update the Mac Pro, despite all the commentary to the contrary (more on that below). While the updated unit may no longer meet the requirements of professional creatives, and while the cost of production may not justify its existence (and the cost is probably high due to Apple building it in the US rather than outsourcing to China), we don't think that Apple is about to turn its back on a product that allows it to show off its best technological advancements. There is some evidence that a new Mac Pro (one with 10 USB 3 ports) is in the pipeline - some code in Mac OS X El Capitan was discovered that referenced a machine with the codename AAPLJ95,1. The current generation of Mac Pro was codenamed AAPLJ90,1 so it seems a fair bet that the new model is also a Mac Pro. Although El Capitan has now been superseded by macOS Sierra so maybe that was just an anomaly in the code. (More on this code below). In addition, a few months back a source at one of Apple's partner companies confidently told us to expect a new Mac Pro by the end of November 2016, which was evidently wishful thinking; but it is certainly possible that things have been delayed and we could still see a new Mac Pro soon. When is the new Mac Pro release date? We expect (hope that) the new Mac Pro to be launched in March 2017 (read more: What to expect at Apple's March 2017 event), although it may be a more likely star of the WWDC keynote in June, since that event tends to have more of a focus on pro Macs. The present Mac Pro was unveiled at WWDC 2013. That's nearly four years ago (although the Mac Pro didn't actually ship until that December - and supply was so restrained that most users didn't get theirs until the following spring). It's about time, then, for an update to the Mac Pro for 2017. Of course, Apple hasn't announced an official launch date for the next generation of Mac Pro systems - the company is known for its code of silence when it comes to upcoming product launches. We had entertained hopes of a Mac Pro update at Apple's 27 October press event, but no such luck. As it turned out, Apple did unveil a new MacBook Pro at the October event, so there was something for 'creative professionals' (although whether creative pros feel that it is meant for them is another question). You can read more about that device here - New MacBook Pro 2016 review - and here: New MacBook Pro on Apple Store.) If the new Mac Pro doesn't appear at Apple's spring press event in March, then WWDC 2017, whose dates and ticket lottery were announced in February, would be the next slot in the Apple launch calendar. While Apple tends to focus on software at WWDC, and iOS 11 and macOS 10.13 will dominate the event, the launch of the 2013 Mac Pro shows there is a place for hardware at Apple's summer event if the circumstances are right. Could Apple launch a Pro iMac instead of a new Mac Pro? In a rare Q&A session on Apple's internal employee network, Apple CEO Tim Cook gave an interesting response to a question about the future of the Mac desktop, referring only to the 5K iMac in his response. According to a transcript obtained by TechCrunch, an unknown Apple employee asked Cook: "We had a big MacBook Pro launch in October and a powerful upgrade to the MacBook back in Spring. Are Mac desktops strategic for us?" In response, Cook wrote the following (failing to mention the Mac Pro, or the Mac mini for that matter): "The desktop is very strategic for us. It's unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop - the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people. "The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." Cook never used the word "Mac" in his response. At all. Considering it's the name of Apple's oldest product line, you would think it'd get a mention in a question about the company's desktop lineup. Granted, he does mention desktop computers several times, but never the name of the hardware, apart from one exception - the 5K iMac. Essentially, Cook was asked whether Mac desktops were strategic, and he answered that desktops were important before speaking about the iMac. What about the Mac Pro? A report from Bloomberg might explain why the question was asked and why Cook responded in this way, with keen Apple watcher Mark Gurman claiming that Apple has reorganised its software engineering department, meaning there's no longer a team dedicated to macOS - instead, engineers work on both iOS and macOS. He continues to claim that the Mac has been generally de-prioritised within the company, and that Mac engineers no longer get much attention from the company's industrial design team, which was until 2015 led by design chief Jony Ive, allegedly focussing more on iPhones and iPads. Does this suggest that Apple will condense its Mac desktop offering into the iMac, discontinuing the Mac Pro and the Mac mini? Such a move would certainly help simplify its desktop offering. Perhaps Apple plans to do exactly that, with the launch of a Pro iMac that goes above and beyond what the 5K iMac offers currently. It's possible that Apple will update its iMac line to the point where it satisfies the needs of pro users, but it's unlikely that such a model will ever meet the needs of Apple's traditional Mac Pro market, many of whom are still using old Mac Pros from pre-2012 mainly because they are easily upgradable, with options for larger-capacity drives (2TB, 4TB or even more). You can even get a 12-core 3.46GHz processor in the older model that could give the newer, 2.7GHz 12-core processor in the 2013 Mac Pro a run for its money. As for video card options, the old Mac Pro has many more. Will Apple discontinue the Mac Pro? Maybe the Mac Pro will never be updated. MacObserver argues that the current Mac Pro is a failure, and compares it to the ill-fated Cube, which was available for less than a year in 2000/2001. (We look at more interesting failures and controversies in our roundup of the worst Apple products.) Those who did upgrade to the trashcan-like Mac Pro are finding that the need for multiple expansion cards and external drives are cluttering up their desks, where previously these extras could be neatly concealed inside the Mac Pro chassis. Other professional creatives have abandoned the Mac and moved to Windows. It's a shame because these creative professionals, while a niche market, wield a lot of influence. For all Apple's claims about it being a powerful machine, it appears that the Mac Pro is just not considered a professional workstation by the intended market - which does raise uncomfortable questions about its future as a product line. But with its status as Apple's flagship Mac, and the hoopla surrounding its reinvention in 2013, the US assembly plants and so on, we'd be surprised if Apple threw in the towel just yet. Is the new Mac Pro 2017 release date delayed? When Apple launches the new Mac Pro there may well be delays in availability, as there were in 2013-2014. Apple first unveiled the Intel Xeon (Ivy Bridge-E) Mac Pro at WWDC in June 2013, but the unit didn't actually start shipping until December that year. In fact, for most shoppers the supply of Mac Pro was so constrained that they didn't receive their new Mac until 2014 - in some cases not until February, or March, or in a few cases April. Having previewed the Mac Pro at WWDC in June 2013, the company promised availability before the end of 2013, but it wasn't until 19 December that the Mac Pro became available. Then, following the launch, stocks were so limited that only a lucky few, US-based, customers were able to purchase the new professional Mac workstation before the end of 2013. Customers in the UK who ordered their new Mac on 19 December 2014 found that they would have to wait until January 2015 for the new Mac Pro. Some lucky UK customers finally received their Mac Pro around 12 January. This was almost a year after the old version of the Mac Pro was banned in Europe because it didn't comply with EU safety laws. One reason for the delays back in 2013 was thought to be the fact that Apple was building the new-look Mac Pro in the US: Apple had a new design which was being produced at an entirely new factory in the States, so the delays were understandable, although maybe not excusable. Could updates to the current model face the same issues that slowed the production lines back in 2013? We think probably not. If you check Apple's website, you'll see that the wait for the current Mac Pro has come down to 24 hours (although if you want a build-to-order version the wait will be about 5-7 business days). The fact that Apple is no longer struggling to meet demand would suggest that when it launches the next Mac Pro there will not be the significant delays in getting units out to customers that there were at the end of 2013. Instead, the reason for the long wait for an update to the Mac Pro could be simple lack of interest in this workstation-style Mac. Apple may be focusing attention on other projects such as the Retina iMac, which was updated in October 2015. It's possible that Apple doesn't intend to update the Mac Pro at all. The company has launched several other new Macs since the launch of the Mac Pro, including impressively powerful iMacs that can sometimes perform better than the current entry-level Mac Pro can. Video editor Max Yuryev tested Final Cut and Premiere Pro rendering on both the 5K Retina iMac and 6 Core Mac Pro and found that the iMac performed better in some cases, although did suffer from heating issues that the Mac Pro avoids thanks to its design. Yet we don't think Apple is trying to phase out the Mac Pro in favour of a more powerful iMac line-up. It's more likely that it's just spending a long time getting the new Mac Pro right before it launches, after the issues it experiences with the previous launch. There is still a market for the more powerful Mac Pro, we think. But not everyone agrees with us, as we'll see in the next section. What are the rumoured Mac Pro 2017 specifications? Currently, there are two standard Mac Pro models available along with various build-to-order options: Quad-Core and Dual GPU: 3.7GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor; 12GB 1866MHz DDR3 ECC memory; Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM each; and 256GB PCIe-based flash storage. 6-Core and Dual GPU: 3.5GHz 6-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor; 16GB 1866MHz DDR3 ECC memory; Dual AMD FirePro D500 with 3GB GDDR5 VRAM each; 256GB PCIe-based flash storage. It seems likely that Apple will update the Mac Pro with the next-generation Intel Xeon E5 processor, we may also see more RAM in the entry-level version, now that the 15-inch MacBook Pro range ship with 16GB as standard. We'll go into more detail below. Ports: Thunderbolt and USB 3 The current Mac Pro sports six Thunderbolt 2 ports, which means this Mac can be connected to up to three 4K displays. There's also 4 USB 3 ports; Dual Gigabit Ethernet; and an HDMI 1.4 UltraHD, as well as a combined optical digital audio output/analog line out mini-jack; headphone mini-jack with headset support; HDMI port supports multi-channel audio output and a built-in speaker. Code discovered in Mac OS X El Capitan offers a hint that a new Mac Pro may be on its way soon offering more Thunderbolt ports in the form of USB-3. There's a reference to a new Mac that's codenamed "AAPLJ95,1" within El Capitan, according to Pike's Universum. We think adopting Thunderbolt 3 on the Mac Pro may make more sense as it brings Thunderbolt to USB-C at 40Gbps for the best of both worlds. (Read more about Thunderbolt and the Mac Pro here). Many traditional Mac Pro users are still calling out for PCI slots, which would allow users to add faster SSDs and better video cards. Some even ask for internal drive bays. Processor: Intel Kaby Lake or AMD RYZEN 7? The 2013 Mac Pro features Intel's Xeon E5 V2 processors (code-named Romley) offering up to 12 cores (as a build-to-order option). Back in September 2014 new Xeon E5 V3 chips (code-named Grantley) started shipping - bringing the Haswell architecture to pro workstations. At the time we thought the processor would soon make their way to the Mac Pro, but no upgrade emerged. Those Intel Xeon E5 V3 chips were being used in Dell's new Xeon Precision Tower (5810, 7810 and 7910) - find out more on Dell's website. These Dell workstations use the Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 processor series featuring either 14 or 18 cores per processor. The processors in the current Mac Pros are configurable up to 3.5GHz for a six-core option, 3.0GHz for an 8-core option, and 2.7GHz for a 12-core option. We may see a slight boost in these numbers, but we could equally see the same clock speeds, with the processors themselves being faster. It is possible that the new Mac Pro will, like the Dell above, offer an option of 14 or 18 cores. It is likely that we see brand new Xeon processors in the Mac Pro. It's expected that we see a late Skylake (Xeon E3-1585 v5) or the new Kaby Lake ( Xeon E3-1205 v6) processors included. The Intel Skylake processor features a base clock of 3.5GHz, four cores and eight threads - it has 8MB of cache and features the Iris Pro Graphics P580 - a powerful in-built GPU that will help low-profile renders. However, with Kaby Lake already being shipped to OEMs and manufacturers, we are more likely to see these new processors shipped with the new Mac Pro. The rumoured Xeon E3-1205 v6 is a base model - featuring 3GHz of processing power - we expect more powerful and optimised CPUs to be included within the Mac Pro. Another idea, although somewhat crazy, is that Apple could abandon Intel chips altogether and move to AMD. AMD has launched RYZEN 7 CPUs that "promise more computing muscle per watt than Intel" and, according to a report the new AMD RYZEN 7 1800X just set a new world record score for Cinebench, a respected CPU performance benchmark. That report states that the new RYZEN 7 chip lineup roughly competes with Intel’s i7 line including the i7-6900K, i7-6800K, and i7-7700K. Perhaps more at home in an iMac then. Read next: i5 or i7? What is turbo boost? Here's how to choose the best processor for your Mac New Mac Pro specs: Graphics The 2013 Mac Pro features dual workstation-class GPUs. The Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM each in the Quad-Core version, and Dual AMD FirePro D500 with 3GB GDDR5 VRAM each in the 6-Core model. There’s also a build-to-order option of the Dual AMD FirePro D700 GPUs with 6GB of GDDR5 VRAM each (an extra £540).  AMD showcased new its new FirePro W-series at Siggraph in August 2014. The FirePro W7100, W5100 may find their way into the new Mac Pro. Alternatively, there are significantly faster graphics based on AMD's Fury platform that may be destined for the new Mac Pro. An article by a video professional refers to the Nvidia GTX 1080 which is such a big deal that he thinks: "This card alone will most likely cause a shift in computer workstation ownership. However the card isn't compatible with the Mac Pro: "Even a Thunderbolt-connected PCIe expansion chassis to a Mac Pro trashcan won't help, due to the inherent bandwidth limits that Thunderbolt has as compared to the buss speeds of these GPU cards. And forget about stacking these cards in an expansion chassis… just not going to happen." Because using this card with the Mac Pro is out of the question he predicts: "a huge migration of longtime Apple users (such as me) going to Windows systems for their main workstation needs." Apple could move away from AMD with the next Mac Pro though (it has tended in the past to flit between the two graphics card manufacturers). And this time there may be a good reason: a thread on the Apple Support Communities website amassed a huge response when complaining about faulty graphics cards in the Late 2013 Mac Pro, Apple admitted that a number of Mac Pro's have faulty cards and that affected customers could have the issue fixed free of charge. To be legible for a free repair, you must have encountered "distorted video, no video, system instability, freezing, restarts, shutdowns" or system startup failure.  It's not all Mac Pro's though, only those manufactured between February 8 and April 11 2015, and the issue can be fixed by taking your damaged Mac Pro to an Apple Store. Interestingly, MacRumours notes that the issues are known to exist with the AMD FirePro D500 and D700 GPUs, with the AMD FirePro D300 being completely unaffected. Will these issues force Apple into choosing another graphic card manufacturer for the next Mac Pro? While there are no rumours online that suggest so, we think a change could be on the cards for the Mac Pro GPU.

We'd like to see more storage as standard on the Mac Pro, as the target audience tend to be working with very large files. An option for 2TB flash storage would be nice. New Mac Pro specs: RAM The new Xeon E5 V3 Grantley chips are said to have DDR4 memory controllers, so you can expect even faster memory in this year's new Mac Pro. The current models offer 12GB RAM in the Quad-Core model, and 16GB in the 6-Code model as standard. You can add 32GB RAM at point of purchase for £360, or a massive 64GB RAM for £1,080. As we mention above, the 15-inch MacBook Pro now comes with 16GB RAM as standard, so we would hope that the updated entry-level Mac Pro would match that. 64GB RAM might sound like a lot to you, but some of these Dell workstations can accommodate up to 1TB of DDR4 RAM. We hope that the next generation of Mac Pros will be configurable to more than 64GB (four slots of 16GB). New Mac Pro specs: Internal design Here's one last titbit that may offer clues about the Mac Pro of the future. Apple has been granted a patent for the Mac Pro, specifically for the structure and organisation of internal components and external interfaces for a compact computing system, according to a report on Patently Apple. Read: Retina MacBook Pro review (15in, mid 2014) Retina iMac review OS X 10.10 Yosemite review Buying guide for current Mac Pro models While we wait for the next Mac Pro to arrive, it's worth quickly walking through the current line-up - both for the benefit of those who need a pro-standard Mac desktop right now, and for the clues it gives us to likely future updates. Read our Mac Pro reviews: Mac Pro Six-Core/3.5GHz (late 2013) review | Mac Pro Quad-Core/3.7GHz (Late 2013) review | 2013 Mac Pro review, BTO version Where can I buy a Mac Pro? The most obvious place to buy a Mac Pro is from the Apple Store. Other than directly from Apple, you can buy the Mac Pro from Apple Premium Resellers such as KRCS and PC World. You can find an Apple Premium Reseller near you by searching on Apple's site. UK pricing for the Mac Pro Currently the Mac Pro starts at £2,999 in the UK for a quad-core 3.7GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor with 10 MB L3 cache and Turbo Boost up to 3.9 GHz, 12GB RAM, Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB of VRAM and 256GB of flash storage.  There is also a 6-core model with 3.5GHz Xeon E5, 16GB RAM, two AMD FirePro D500 cards with 3GB of VRAM, and 256GB flash storage for £3,899. We expect that prices won't change significantly when Apple updates the range, although we could see a drop in the old model and a rise in the base 2017 model - as we've seen through other Apple products. See: Apple price increases UK. Current pricing for Mac Pro build-to-order options  The build-to-order options will push the price higher. The following specifications are available for the 2013 Mac Pro: Build-to-order options on the 3.7GHz Quad-Core Mac Pro 2013: 3.5GHz 6-core option (add £450), 3.0GHz 8-core processor (add £1,800), or 2.7GHz 12-core processor (add £3,150); 16GB (add £90), 32GB (add £450) or 64GB (add £1,170) RAM memory; dual AMD FirePro D500 (add £360), or or dual AMD FirePro D700 (add £900); 512GB (add £180) or 1TB flash storage (add £540) Build-to-order options on the 3.5GHz 6-Core Mac Pro 2013: 3.0GHz 8-core processor (add £1,350), 2.7GHz 12-core processor (add £2,700); 32GB (add £360) or 64GB (£add £1,080) RAM memory; dual AMD FirePro D700 (add £540); 512GB (add £180) or 1TB flash storage (add £540). A Mac Pro with the maximum 12-core 2.7GHz processors, with 30MB L3 cache, 64GB RAM, 1TB PCIe-based flash storage, Dual AMD FirePro D700 GPUs with 6GB of GDDR5 VRAM each currently costs £8,759 including VAT.

As noted by MacRumours, Apple typically invites the media to its March event roughly 11-12 days beforehand.  The anonymous analysts haven't offered any details about what we can expect from next week's unveiling, but previous rumours have pointed to the unveiling of 7.9in, 9.7in, 10.5in, and 12.9in iPad Pro models.  The 7.9in model likely will likely arrive as the success to the iPad Mini 4, and will reportedly feature a Smart Connector for hooking up Apple's Smart Keyboard, a True Tone display, a quad-speaker set up and a 12MP rear-facing camera. The 9.7in model will be Apple's "low-priced" option and will reportedly feature a Samsung-made A9 processor, while the 10.5in model will be Apple's "high-end offering", complete with an edge-to-edge design. It will reportedly keep the top bezel to support the front-facing FaceTime camera, but could be the first Apple product to ditch the home button in order to keep the same overall footprint as the 9.7in model. This model reportedly won't ship until May, while the other three will be made available that month.

Apple’s annual flagship usually gets this amount of attention with the latest rumour now coming from IHS Markit analyst, Wayne Lam. As per the latest report by MacRumors, Apple will reportedly include a flat OLED panel on the iPhone 8, instead of previous rumoured curved panel. However, the panel included will indeed come with 2.5D curved glass which is not something new in Apple iPhones. Other than this, Wayne also claimed that the Cupertino-based giant might, in fact, borrow the 18:9 aspect ratio display from LG or even Samsung in that case.   "Much like the recently announced LG G6, we anticipate a touchscreen with a new longer aspect ratio design to take advantage of a higher coverage area of the iPhone in its entirety. This new design language is expected to become the trend for 2017, as we all anticipate Samsung's reveal later this month,"   On the other hand, the famous KGI Securities analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo also confirmed that Apple’s next flagship will come with a 2.5D curved glass rather than a curved display. Moreover, in another report, Ming claimed that Apple iPhone 8 is expected to outgun the upcoming Galaxy S8, in terms of sale. The analyst from KGI securities blames the lack of any unique selling point in the Galaxy S8 for this claimant. Samsung has already begun the manufacturing of about 10 million units of the Galaxy S8 for the first round of sales, however, the South Korean giant is expected to hit 40-45 million unit mark this time. Samsung Galaxy S8 has also topped the rumour charts recently and is probably the most hyped Android smartphone, as of now.     On the other hand, Apple iPhone 8 is no exception. With latest rumours claiming that the US-based company is planning to implement the fingerprint scanner on the glass along with the three-dimensional front camera for Augmented Reality, the votes for the next iPhone is certainly more in this case. Apple’s CEO, Tim Cook has gone on record and claimed that the AR is one of the top priorities for Apple and the 3D camera might step forward in that direction. Further, the fingerprint scanner on display is due to some rumours claiming the next iPhone to be bezel-less sporting a 5.8-inch display in a body which usually house a 4.7-inch display. However, of this only 5.15-inches will usable. On the contrary, all these new experiments will come with a price which is expected to be more than $1000 this year.   Regarding the name, a recent report from Mac Otakara claimed that the next iPhone will be named as ‘iPhone Edition’.

The report, citing Apple’s Taiwan-based supply chain sources further stated that Apple could launch the said iPad model at an event marking the inauguration of its Apple Park, including the new spaceship campus. The DigiTimes report published Tuesday states that both the 10.5-inch model and the 12.9-inch model could have a mid-tier and high-end pricing respectively. Read: Apple Releases Info On 10.5-inch iPad Pro Apart from the 10.5-inch model, Apple is expected to launch a 9.7-inch model and a 12.9-inch model of the iPad Pro 2. The report adds that while the production for the 9.7-inch model of the tablet is expected to reach 3-4 million units per month in the first quarter of financial year 2017 and grow during the next quarter, no production schedule was available for the 12.9-inch model. The reported numbers indicate how Apple is still standing strong in a tablet industry, which is declining every year. There is a possibility that Apple might launch the 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2 first, and then go in for a May-June production schedule, indicative of an even later launch. The production of the 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2 is expected to start at 1 million units in March and ramp up to 1.2 million units per month after that.  The production numbers are similar to the production numbers for the iPad Pro when it debuted in August 2015. The expected launch dates of the Apple iPad Pro have gone for a toss, since different reports are indicating different launch dates for the devices — a MacRumors report on Monday stated that the tablets could launch between March 20-24, while an earlier report said that the tablets could be launched on April 4, going by the availability date for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro on Apple website.  Read: Apple Pencil 2 Emerges In Company’s Patent Application The iPad Pro 2 is expected to have features like a Touch Bar, Apple Pencil 2, A10X chipset, a 12-megapixel rear camera and iOS 10.3 and therefore, could be Apple’s flagship tablet for 2017.

  SOFTPEDIA®   Windows   Drivers   Games   Mac   Android   Linux   News Softpedia > News > Apple FLASH SALE: SpyShelter Firewall      30% OFF! Apple Said to Unveil 10.5-Inch iPad Pro at Early April Event GO The event would mark the inauguration of Apple Park Mar 14, 2017 07:24 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Recent reports from East Asia say that Apple has started pushing manufacturing of a 10.5-inch iPad Pro to make an early April launch. The report cites sources within Apple’s supply chain and claims that the new iPad Pro could be announced during the inauguration of Apple Park, expected to open next month. During the same event, Apple could also announce a new 128GB iPhone SE, Apple Watch bands, and possibly a Red iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The information should be taken with some skepticism, considering that Apple has yet to send invites for such an event and that some previous reports stated that the new device could be announced as soon as March 20. The report mentions that volume production could be delayed until May or June. Apple employees are expected to start moving into the Apple Park headquarters in April, but construction of some units, like the Steve Jobs Theater, hasn’t completed yet and should be finalized later this year. More iPad models could be announced soon It’s quite unsure if Apple will actually announce the new iPad this month, but the company has already started testing a series of tablet devices in San Francisco, as a marketing firm recently discovered four new iPad identifiers in device tracking logs. One thing is for sure, the new 10.5-inch flagship iPad Pro could be announced in the coming weeks, most likely in early April. The device is expected to be slightly larger than a 9.7-inch iPad Pro, with a bigger display resulted from thinner bezels. Apple is also expected to announce a refreshed 12.9-inch model aimed at the mid-tier to high-end tablet market in 2017. There have been reports that Apple could introduce a lower-end 9.7-inch iPad Pro and a 7.9-inch model, but that remains to be seen. All in all, this year’s iPad Pro lineup appears to offer options to meet the needs of all consumers, but it remains to be seen when they will be introduced. #Apple#iPad Pro#Apple Park#iPhone 7#iPhone 7 Plus subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Releases Beta 6 of iOS 10.3 & macOS Sierra 10.12.4 to Devs, Public Testers Apple Seeds Beta 5 of iOS 10.3, watchOS 3.2 & tvOS 10.2 to Devs, Public Testers New iPads Could Be Unveiled on April 4 at Apple Park Apple Seeds Fifth Beta of macOS 10.12.4 Sierra to Developers and Public Testers Samsung Galaxy S8 Features Camera and Iris Scanner Improvements LibreOffice 5.3 Office Suite Gets First Point Release with 100 Improvements Study: 96% of Websites Get Attacked by Bad Bots Windows 10 Creators Update Hides a Secret Ad Switch, Privacy Group Warns YouTube Discontinues Annoying Annotations LXLE 16.04.2 GNU/Linux Distro to Bring All the Goodies from Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS Netflix Turns to Thumbs Up/Down Ratings, Ditches 5-Stars System Intel Launches Bug Bounty Program, Offers Rewards of Up to $30,000    iPad Pro in multiple color options New Mac Apps Tidy Up!: A complex duplicate finder solution for macOS that is able to analyze various types of files, such as images, music, applications, and more Things: A stylish and easy to use task management application for Mac OS X that enables you to create, filter and organize tasks by different criteria.

Alongside, the company is expected to launch the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, with more standard features and specifications. While several previous reports had tipped the use of a curved OLED display on the iPhone 8, a new report indicates Apple will go with a flat implementation instead. In the meanwhile, a report also claims the iPhone 8 will affect the Samsung Galaxy S8's sales. Citing IHS Markit analyst Wayne Lam, MacRumors reports that Apple will use a regular OLED display with a 2.5D curved glass design - something seen on Apple smartphones since the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in 2014. Lam adds that the company may also adopt a display aspect ratio similar to the LG G6's 18:9, a design decision Samsung has reportedly also taken with the Galaxy S8 that's due to be launched later this month. Apple iPhone 8 Specifications, Release Date, and More - Leaks and Rumours So Far "We anticipate Apple will adopt a flat implementation of OLED design on their special iPhone model, which is analogous to the current 2.5D glass design... Much like the recently announced LG G6, we anticipate a touchscreen with a new longer aspect ratio design to take advantage of higher coverage area of the iPhone in its entirety. This new design language is expected to become the trend for 2017, as we all anticipate Samsung's reveal later this month," Lam is quoted to say. As for Apple's reasons to go with a flat OLED display design on the iPhone 8, the report cites DisplayMate's Raymond Soneira to claim glass substrates used in flat OLED displays is significantly cheaper and available in higher production volumes than the flexible plastic used in curved OLED displays. He echoes Lam to claim Apple is likely to use the 2.5D curved glass design on a flat OLED display. To recall, previous reports indicate the iPhone 8 will sport a 5.8-inch OLED display with little-to-no bezel, while the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus are said to come with more traditional LCD displays in the same screen sizes as previous generations. Other rumours speak about the inclusion of wireless charging technology, USB-C based fast charging, enhanced Touch ID and 3D Touch, facial recognition and other augmented reality features, an all-glass back, and even the removal of the Home Button for a display integrated fingerprint scanner. A recent rumour also claims the premium iPhone 8 model may just be called the iPhone Edition, similar to the nomenclature used for the Apple Watch Edition. Finally, we come to a report by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has had a near flawless record for Apple leaks. In his latest investor note, he claims that that the iPhone 8 will affect the sales of the Samsung Galaxy S8, which does not have "sufficiently attractive selling points". He says Samsung is expected to ship about 40 to 45 million units of the Galaxy S8 in 2017, less than the Galaxy S7, which in part is attributable to the one-month difference in sale period.

However, latest rumour suggests that the Cupertino giant is actually testing four new models. Mobile analytics company Fiksu has spotted four new iPad model identifiers appear in its logs. According to a report in Techcrunch, "Fiksu's raw data is showing four different iPad models being tested in/around Cupertino." The report though almost confirms the imminent refresh of the Apple iPad series, it does not necessarily mean that the company may launch all four iPads. "The data comes from Fiksu's tracking and attribution SDK, which is used by thousands of mobile apps today," says the report. During its testing process, Apple is said to install a variety of apps many of which end up getting tracked using Fiksu's tracking technology.

The company says that it witness iPad models with names "6,3/6,4" and "6,7/6,8" being tested in Cupertino a month ago. Now, the firm sees Apple testing "7,1" "7,2," "7,3," and "7,4" models. While the iPad 7,3 is seen tested 5 times, the 7,4 was tested 10 times. The 7,2 and 7,1 was tested 11 and 17 times respectively. The models were installed with several apps some of which were games, music apps, real estate and weather apps. Furthermore, the fact that all of them were running iOS 10.3 or the unreleased iOS 11 proves that these are the new iPad versions. Apple’s upcoming iPad models reportedly delayed until later this year In addition, the report cements previous rumours suggesting that Apple could launch a 9.7-inch iPad model with an affordable price. Apple has not tasted huge success+ on tablets front lately. During its Q1 2017 earnings call, the company said that the iPad series witnessed about 19% drop in the holiday quarter, as compared to Q1 of 2016. According to Apple's data summary, the shipment of iPads witnessed a decline of 3,041 units. The company shipped 16,122 units in Q1 2016, as opposed to the 13,081 units in Q1 2017. In terms of revenue, there was a decline of 22% as compared to Q1 2016. Apple has quietly relaunched this iPhone in India The smartphone can also be purchased at further discount using the exchange offer of up to Rs 8,550 off. Hopefully, the launch of new iPads are able to bolster these numbers. According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the upcoming iPad line up will include 3 models. The series is said to feature a new 10.5 or 10.9-inch model with narrow bezels besides an updated 12.9-inch iPad Pro and a low-priced 9.7-inch iPad. Kuo says the 12.9-inch iPad Pro and 10/10.5-inch iPad Pro models will run on an upgraded version of the Apple A10 processor, currently powering Apple's iPhone 7 models. The upgraded processors are likely to be named 'A10X'. The smaller 9.7-inch iPad model will reportedly run on an A9 chip which came along with the Cupertino giant's iPhone 6s series of smartphones.

Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumour Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Contact Us The Bitbag Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumors Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Reviews Tablet Apple Might Release iPad Pro 2 Next Week Even Without an Event By Kiko Antonio https://twitter.com/kikoTBB on March 14, 2017 03:43 PM A few weeks back, it was rumored that Apple could be holding an event sometime in March. Many have attributed this news to the company unveiling the much awaited iPad Pro 2. However, as the days wore on, the rumour just slipped away into oblivion and was never mentioned again. Now it seems that there could be a product launch sometime next week, according to a recent report. According to MacRumors, Apple is expected to unveil new products as early as next week. Furthermore, the report also said that this could happen even without a formal event to mark the releases. This “non-event” could potentially happen between March 20 to March 24, according to the same report. Unfortunately, the claim did not specify as to which Apple product might be released on the said dates. However, many have speculated that the products in question are the upcoming iPad Pro 2 tablets. iPad Pro (via apple.com) It has long been rumored that Apple is due to release the new iPad Pro 2 tablets sometime this year. Many believed that it would happen between March and April this year. However, others believe that it could be done in June in time for Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference 2017. However, Apple has remained silent, as it always does, about the matter. The iPad Pro 2 is rumored to come in three different sizes this year. The entry-level 9.7-inch version will be the cheapest option in the set. Meanwhile, the 12.9-inch model will remain to be the top-tier iPad Pro 2 tablet. In addition to these two, the new 10.5-inch version will also be released this year. This new tablet size will have the same form factor as the original 9.7-inch version. The major difference is the new model will have micro bezels on the display so it can maintain a smaller build. Both the 10.5-inch and the 12.9-inch will receive hardware upgrades like a new A10X Fusion ARM processor. Meanwhile, the smallest tablet will probably have the current A10 processor as it is targeted to be an entry-level tablet. For now, Apple is yet to confirm the release of these tablets. Whether or not the company will release them next week is anybody’s guess. For more updates on Apple’s iPad Pro 2, be sure to check out TheBitbag.

The updated 12.9-inch iPad Pro is expected to feature a 12MP rear camera and True Tone display using advanced four-channel ambient light sensors to automatically adapt the colour and intensity of the display to match the light in the surrounding environment. Apple is also said to launch a 5.8-inch iPhone 8 with an OLED display, that may be called ‘iPhone X’, along with two other devices — updated iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus (with brand names as iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus).
