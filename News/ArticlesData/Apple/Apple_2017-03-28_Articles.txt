Credit: Dale Bowman Dale Bowman @BowmanOutside | email Sign-Up for our Sports Newsletter  Sign-Up Big week for fishing around Chicago, especially Saturday when Illinois’s spring trout season opens, smelt netting begins and Heidecke Lake reopens to fishing; that and much more leads this sprawling raw-file Midwest Fishing Report. The MFR for Chicago fishing appears in a condensed form Wednesdays on the Sun-Times newspaper outdoors page. The sprawling raw-file report is posted here online on the Sun-Times outdoors page. REMINDER The new license season begins Saturday, April 1, in the Lake Michigan states. SMELT NETTING Smelt netting in Chicago begins Saturday, April 1. The regulations are the usual, though there may be one tweak in the open sites (stay tuned later in the week). Prospects are poor, though some perch fishermen caught some smelt at the South Side slips this winter. Here is the general word from Bob Long, “The Fishin’ Guy,” for the Chicago Park District, on lakefront regulations for smelt netters: SMELT REGS FOR CHICAGO LAKEFRONT Smelt Fishing is a family affair. It’s a community of Fishermen enjoying each other’s company and nature’s bounty. Let’s make this season a safe and clean one for families and our fishing future. The following rules apply: * No open fires * No enclosed tents * No alcoholic beverages * No parking or driving on the grass or sidewalks. Park only in designated areas. Violators will be ticketed and towed. * Do not destroy fences, benches, trash receptacles, walkways, and grassy areas. * Do not dump hot coals under trees, on concrete or on grassy areas. Dispose of all coals in the appropriate trash receptacles. Harbor Gates will close at 1 a.m. –start breaking down at 12:30 a.m. to be out by 1 a.m. I would emphasize that last one, the regulation is to be out of the parks by 1 a.m. ILLINOIS’ SPRING TROUT SEASON Illinois’ spring trout season opens Saturday, April 1. Click here for the statewide release. Usual regulations are in place: those 16 and older need a fishing license and inland trout stamp; daily bag is five. Nearby sites include Axehead, Bellaeau, Green, Horsetail (new for spring), Sag Quarry East, Wolf (Cook County): Grove, Pickerel, Silver (DuPage); Bird Park Quarry, Rock Creek at Kankakee River SP (Kankakee): Big Lake at Silver Springs SFWA (Kendall); Sand at Illinois Beach SP, Banana (Lake); Atwood, Pisacaw Creek (McHenry); Milliken (Will). NOTE: EARLY FLY FISHING FOR SPRING TROUT: Illinois’ Spring Catch-and-Release Fly Fishing-only season is now open (regular spring trout season opens Saturday, April 1, see above). Those 16 and older need a valid fishing license and an inland trout stamp. Fly fishing is available at nine sites statewide: Apple River, Apple River State Park (Jo Daviess County); Rock Creek, Kankakee River SP (Kankakee); Pine Creek, White Pines Forest SP (Ogle); Siloam Springs State Park Lake (Adams); Gridley Lake, Jim Edgar Panther Creek State Fish and Wildlife Area (Cass); Horton Lake, Nauvoo SP (Hancock); Morgan Lake at Nichols Park, Jacksonville (Morgan); IDOT Lake, Springfield (Sangamon); and Willow Lake at Peabody River King SFWA (St. Claire).. HEIDECKE LAKE The former cooling lake near Morris reopens to fishing Saturday, April 1. Regulations are the same. Launch opens at 6 a.m., shore fishing at 6:30 a.m.; close is sunset. On Monday, site staff said water levels were good at the launch, there is about 36 inches of clearance at the bridge, they figure half the boats will be able to get through. My column today included some prospects from fisheries biologist Rob Miller; good news is that walleye looked good last fall in the survey and white bass, hybrids and yellow bass were solid, too. INDIANA LAKE TROUT NOTE Note this change coming for lake trout in Indiana as of Saturday, April 1. Here is the word from the Indiana DNR: Indiana lake trout bag limit increases in April Indiana is changing the daily bag limit for lake trout in Lake Michigan. On April 1, the limit will increase from two fish per day to three fish per day under an emergency rule, while waiting for a permanent rule to be approved. Indiana biologists used input from multiple user groups in crafting this regulation. The increase will put Indiana in sync with Michigan’s bag limit. Since many Indiana boaters routinely fish in both states during the same trip, having the same bag limit for both states will make fishing less complicated. Additionally, the increased bag limit will offer more harvest opportunity for lake trout in the spring and fall, when they are readily available in Indiana waters. The nearshore fishery for lake trout is becoming more popular. Biologists are confident the lake trout population can sustain the additional harvest pressure. The lake trout population has been increasing in the southern basin due to the changing Lake Michigan ecosystem. AREA LAKES Joseph Christopher Alfe messaged about this crappie: Dale, I thought you would like this: Here is a picture of a 17″, 2.9# Crappie that I caught yesterday on a jerk bait on a small area lake. For scale, that is a Plano 3700 box. Now here is the kicker. I got this 17″ Crappie on the same spot, almost a year to the date last year. Similar bait. And he is right, I Like that kind of stuff. BoRabb Williams messaged Monday: At Saganashkee now water is 50 …. cold front ..3 crappie. Ken “Husker” O’Malley emailed Monday: Hey Dale, The lipless crankbait bite continues to be the most consistent bite on area lakes. Focus on wind blown shorelines to find the most active bass. Bass are moving up closer to shore as the day goes along. TTYL — Ken “Husker” O’Malley Huskeroutdoors Waterworks fishing team AREA WATER LEVELS Might be worth going to  to http://water.weather.gov//ahps2/index.php?wfo=lot to check area water levels and projection. To get to more specific gauges, even on creeks, in Illinois, go to http://waterdata.usgs.gov/il/nwis/current/?type=flow BRAIDWOOD LAKE Adam Gundlach messaged: Fished north side of braidwood again yesterday. Water was up to 68 at ramp and saw 72 in shallow areas. We caught a lot of bass all 14-16″ nothing big. Used all sorts of stuff. Rob Abouchar emailed Monday: Hi Dale fished Braidwood North side Saturday with friend Joe Schatz and action was really heating up.  Squarebill cranks in Chartreuse and craw colors were again taking numbers and size of bass.  Also got some nice fish on wacky rigged stick worm in riprap, and in midlake area around placard #5.  Bass are moving in midlake area and should improve with stable warmer weather as tall grass growth continues to emerge. temps were 68 by riprap and 70 in midlake natural area. Another angler reported doing well on cranks and green pumpkin jig. Rob Ken “Husker” O’Malley emailed Monday: On Braidwood, water temps range from 70-75. South end is a bit warmer. Focus on pitching  to shoreline cover with a multitude of plastics. Let the fish dictate what they want from day to day. TTYL — Ken “Husker” O’Malley Huskeroutdoors Waterworks fishing team Braidwood is open daily 6 a.m.-7 p.m. until April 13, when hours will change again. Check with Jon Meder at Jon’s Bait Shop–(815) 237-2822–in South Wilmington. CALUMET SYSTEM BoRabb Williams messaged Monday: CALUMET..SLOW WATER 48 … CHAIN O’LAKES AREA Proprietor Greg Dickson at Triangle Sports and Marine in Antioch said with the low-water conditions, use caution when, where and how launching; most effort is on chasing crappie in the deeper backwaters or walleye on the south end of the Chain.

FOX RIVER: WESTERN SUBURBS No update. FOX RIVER: WISCONSIN No update. GREEN BAY/STURGEON BAY Lance LaVine at Howie’s Tackle in Sturgeon Bay sent this Monday: Good morning…here is what I have as far as the fishing is concerned Brown Trout fishing is off to a very strong start for both the shore fishermen and the trollers.  Fishermen are having good action trolling the Lake Michigan shoreline from Bailey’s Harbor south past Algoma especially out in front of the tributaries.  Another very good spot right now has been right in downtown Sturgeon Bay from the bridges out to the pier heads and as soon as the ice finally totally goes away, fishermen will be trolling the shorelines from Sturgeon Bay and north all the way up to Gills Rock on the bay side.  We anticipate that to happen within the next 2 weeks.  Mauler spoons and stick baits like Thundersticks and Rapalas have been the top baits. Stream fishermen are having some very good success in the Lake Michigan tributaries for those high flying Rainbow trout.  Floating spawn sacs, yarn eggs, gulp eggs and spinners all have been quite effective. Walleye trollers and rip jig fishermen are getting for all of the floating ice to go away so they can go after some giant pre-spawn Walleyes.  Areas to try are right in downtown Sturgeon Bay, the Potawatomi Park shoreline, Sherwood Point, Henderson’s Point along with the vast shoreline to the north of Sturgeon Bay.  Night time trolling with large suspending crank baits is what most folks do, but some will anchor up and cast a spot with active fish.  Also, during the day, you can drift with sucker minnows while pitching some plastics and Rip n Rap style baits to trigger some good bites. Pike fishing has been OK for the fishermen in the Sturgeon Bay channel that are willing to dodge ice berges…jigging with OddBall jigs tipped with minnows, dragging suckers on bottom bouncers and trolling large crank baits and spoons all good ways to boat a big Pike or 2 Thanks; Lance LaVine Howie’s Tackle 1309 Green Bay Rd Sturgeon Bay, WI 54235 Ph: 920-746-9916 The Wisconsin DNR report is usually posted Tuesdays and includes reports from both the bay and lake sides. ILLINOIS RIVER The Spring Valley Walleye Club tournament is this weekend out of Spring Valley, some question of where the sauger will be in terms of the spawn. Have bait before you go. Live bait is tough to get. B & B Live Bait–(815) 433-0432–is open in Ottawa, 7 a.m.-noon until weather breaks, then it will be open the usual 6-6 or so. Joe Sanderson messaged that Cajun’s in Utica is now open, too.

KANKAKEE RIVER No update. LAKE ERIE The Ohio DNR has general Lake Erie info and a fishing report. LAKEFRONT CHICAGO: Biggest story is ongoing coho bite, especially for powerliners; but still some good perch reports, too. Steve Palmisano at Henry’s Sports and Bait texted: Very similar report for us lots of browns and coho did picked up a bit since the weekend. Water clarity clear water seems to help coho fishing Staff at Park Bait said powerliners were taking lots of coho Monday and Tuesday; best spot varied (Horseshoe best Monday, jetty Tuesday) depending on wind, minnows or crawlers are working. Victor “The DIZZ” Blackful emailed Tuesday after fishing 89th: Well after hanging out in Anglers Outlet this morning I thought I might run out to the big pond and see if any perch were around. It was cold and very windy and there was only 2 guys out there fishing. In 35 minutes I went through a 2 dozen minnows and caught about 30 fish with this nice 1 pounder as eight I kept for dinner. Just picked up some mango salsa and now looking forward to dinner. Indeed, I can taste why. Arden Katz said there were excellent perch at Navy Pier Sunday, best on jigging spoons tight to wall; but the key was to keep moving to find active perch.  NAVY PIER NOTE: The fisherman’s parking special is $6, if out by 10 a.m. Find an parking attendant after you pull in to get the special. PIER PASSES: Friday, March 31, is the end of this season for pier passes.

NORTHERN WISCONSIN Remember that gamefish season is over, as in closed. MINOCQUA: Kurt Justice of Kurt’s Island Sport Shop in Minocqua, Wis. sent this: Some intermittent rain, but mostly cloudy weather has been hanging over the Northwoods this past weekend. Fishing overall good, if not great.  East wind on Saturday may have slowed bite but action has been considered steady with some periods of excellent action. Crappies:  Very Good – Fish of choice for many anglers at this time of year.  When bite on, tip-downs baited with crappie minnows or small rosies hard to beat.  As bite slows, slow dropping Lethal Cecils tipped with sliver of Chena, white plastic or waxie best.  If fish shy from this offering, time to get more subtle with a smaller jig, preferably #10 or even #12 Rocker, tipped with plastic.  Still some deep fish being caught, yet on most lakes the 8-12’ cabbage, with some reports of fish in as shallow as 5-6’ being found Yellow Perch:  Very Good – Most action in shallow weeds.  Fish moving to these areas heavy with spawn, feeding big.  Use crappie minnows or even medium fatheads on tip-downs or below small floats.  Jigs shaped like tiny bluegills tipped with waxies a favorite.  Some deep perch still being found in 20-25’ of water.  Tip-downs baited with rosies on larger Tungston jigs as well as Halis and Pimples to get down quickly.  Tip these jigs with wigglers or red spikes. Bluegills:  Very Good – Action hot in some locales, but sorting needed.  Still, nice limits of gills reported.  Anglers using small Purest, VMC Larvae jigs, and small #2.5 or #3 Fiska jigs tipped with a waxie or single spike as well as any “ant” style jig.  Fiska jigs tipped with dark colored plastics (purple, red, maroon, black and motor oil) doing well. Ice thickness varies from as high as 20” to as few as 14” with most reports of 15-16” averages.  Low 40’s with clouds wasn’t enough to counteract the night time lows – but that could be changing!  Forecast of highs in the low to mid 50’s this week, plus sun, could eat away at the ice pretty good.  For most locations this weekend, will probably be the last for safe ice.  The south end of Big Arbor Vitae lake traditionally holds on to its ice longest so should still have some fishable ice next week. Access and bite still good for now, take advantage while you can. Kurt Justice Kurt’s Island Sport Shop www.kurtsislandsports.com EAGLE RIVER: B+L, from reports from Colin Crawford of Colin Crawford Guide Service for the Eagle River Chamber of Commerce, sent this: Fishing Report Bluegills: These fish are being found in the weeds using small jigs tipped with waxies, spikes or tipped with plastic. Perch: You can find these on the deep weed edges and muddy bottoms feeding on minnows and bugs. Be sure to match the bait to the area you’re fishing for success. Crappie: We are finding a few up in the shallow weeds, but the majority are still in the deeper water. Reminder:  All ice fishing shelters must be removed from the ice daily and when not in use on inland waters north of Highway 64 by March 19 and Wisconsin-Michigan boundary waters by March 15. NORTHWEST INDIANA Capt. Rich Sleziak  at Slez’s Bait in Lake Station, Ind., texted: Coho was good for boaters anytime the weather let them get out. Brads thinfish 00 dodgers and peanut flys doing best. Shore not producing nearly as good but a few being caught on squid shrimp and skein fished bottom or slip bobber at portage lakefront port of indiana and washington park michigan city Good gill and crappie action yesterday for a couple groups of customers fishing the slough in boats black jigs tipped with waxworms and moving around did good. The ditch was giving up a bunch of crappie and some gills along old docks and stick ups hot colored jigs tipped with waxworms or peices of crawlers along with crappie minnows did well for the guys that went ROCK RIVER, WISCONSIN No update. ROOT RIVER, WISCONSIN The Wisconsin DNR Lake Michigan Report is generally posted on Tuesday and includes a Root river section.

What does it do and how does it work? We’ll tell you everything. Dive into Deep Silence with watchOS 3.2’s Theater Mode for Apple Watch Although the Apple Watch is an extremely minimal device, but it can become obtrusive for others if its display is constantly lighting up from time to time. This sort of thing is extremely annoying if you are in a theater environment. So, in order to combat this situation, Apple developed a brand new feature for Apple Watch users that comes as a part of the new watchOS 3.2 update. It’s called Theater Mode. Once enabled, your Apple Watch will go into complete silence, and the display can only be accessed if you either tap on it or press down on the Digital Crown. It’s like airplane mode, but keeps all the wireless radios running while silencing everything else down. It’s extremely wonderful, and we’ll show you how you can use it. Related How to Use Find My AirPods in iOS 10.3 Tutorial As mentioned above, this feature is available for watchOS 3.2 users only. If you don’t have the OS installed already, then this tutorial is not applicable for you. 1. On your Apple Watch’s watch face, swipe up to reveal the quick toggles. 2. Swipe all the way down and tap on the button that looks like a mask. If you are enabling this feature for the first time, you will see a quick little rundown of it on the display.

Watchlist | 21 Mar 2017 | Print  | Comment (2) iTunes 12.6 by Agen G. N. Schmitz Apple has issued iTunes 12.6 in conjunction with the release of the new iPad (“Apple Replaces iPad Air 2 with New 9.7-inch iPad,” 21 March 2017) and iPhones (see “Apple Introduces (PRODUCT)RED iPhones, Doubles iPhone SE Storage,” 21 March 2017) with a feature that’s long been requested — the capability to watch iTunes movie rentals on any of your Apple devices. The feature also requires iOS 10.3 or tvOS 10.2, both of which have just been released (see “iOS 10.3 Adds New File System, Find My AirPods, Other Major Refinements,” 27 March 2017, and “Apple Releases macOS 10.12.4, watchOS 3.2, and tvOS 10.2,” 27 March 2017). Dubbed “rent once, watch anywhere,” the feature enables you to start watching a movie on your Apple TV at home and then finish it on your next morning’s bus commute by streaming it on your iPhone. Previously, you could transfer rentals made on your Mac to an iOS device by performing a sync, and you couldn’t access rentals made on an Apple TV on any other devices. Other changes in iTunes 12.6 include the capability to open playlists in their own windows and a redesign of the MiniPlayer.

"Finally" would be if they upped the rental duration from 24 hours to 30. It just doesn't make sense. People rent the movie at the time they want to watch a movie. So if you rent a movie at, say, 8pm, but you don't finish it, you're probably not going to be able to watch it until around 8pm the next night. Except that's when the rental expires. Does anyone agree? Reply Rick  2017-03-28 01:10 In Japan, the rental duration is 48 hours. I agree with your general point: if they could add, say, 4 hours (allowing for a long movie and a slightly later starting time than on the first night) to the stipulated times, that would make things so much easier.

According to a report from The China Post, Apple’s mobile payment platform has started rolling out to users in the country… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case To coincide with the launch of Apple Pay, Apple has launched the Apple Pay information page on its Taiwan website. The website offers a variety of details on Apple Pay in the country, including banks, retailers, and more. At launch, Apple Pay will work with MasterCard and Visa cards from seven banks in Taiwan – including the “big four” banks: Taishin International Bank, Taipei Fubon Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, Cathay United Bank, CTBC Bank, E.SUN Bank, and Union Bank of Taiwan. As for retail support, Apple Pay in Taiwan will be supported by most businesses that support NFC terminals, including The Breeze Center, Far Eastern Department Stores, Sogo, Carrefour, and PXMart. Additionally, Apple Pay will be supported at FamilyMarts throughout Taiwan, though only for users of Taishin International Bank cards. Apple Pay’s launch in Taiwan was first rumored back in September of last year, but we’ve been waiting on the launch ever since then. More evidence emerged earlier this month regarding the launch, with banks approving the notion of Apple Pay. Taiwan marks the fourteenth country in which Apple Pay has launched. Most recently, the mobile payment platform came to Ireland earlier this month. Apple Pay lets you make purchases in supported stores using your iPhone or Apple Watch. Apple Pay can also be used to make purchases in supported apps on iPhone and iPad. Here’s how to set up Apple Pay if your bank is supported (full list): On the iPhone, just head to the Wallet app on iOS 9 or later and tap the plus (+) icon in the top right corner to begin, then follow the prompts. To add a debit card to the Apple Watch, go to the Apple Watch app on iPhone and look for the Wallet & Apple Pay section, then Add Credit or Debit Card section. iPads with Touch ID can use Apple Pay in apps; go to Settings then Wallet & Apple Pay to add your card there. Apple Pay works with the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone SE, iPhone 7, and iPhone 7 Plus; all Apple Watches; iPad mini 4, iPad Air 2, and both iPad Pro models. Macs can also now use Apple Pay with macOS Sierra. If you’re in Taiwan, let us know how your first experiences using Apple Pay go. We should expect the service to go live in Taiwan in the near future, while Apple is always working to bring the mobile payment platform to more countries around the world.

Is that true? We suppose that remains to be seen, but in the meantime it looks like Apple is still exploring fingerprint scanning technology. According to the folks at 9to5Mac, they have discovered that Apple has recently been granted a patent for what appears to be an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner. This is actually not the first time that an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner has been rumored/hinted for the iPhone 8, but whether or not it will be realized into an actual product is still up in the air. The patent talks about how this will be better than regular print scanners because, “Contaminants such as grease, lotion, dirt, sweat, and food particles on a finger can degrade a captured fingerprint image, which can prevent a fingerprint sensing device from matching the captured fingerprint image to a known fingerprint image.” So far the rumors about Apple ditching the home button for the iPhone 8 have been pretty steady. Exactly what this means for biometric security is anyone’s guess, whether it be a facial recognition system, an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner, or maybe moving the old scanner to the back, but we guess we’ll just have to wait and find out.

According to a report from VentureBeat, Apple has started rejecting applications which tout their price in the name, icons, screenshots, or previews… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Apple has reportedly gradually started this practice over the last month. In the past, Apple has discouraged developers from highlighting an app’s price in titles, but it has not gone as far as to reject apps that do so. If a developer attempts to submit an application for review that contains the word “Free” in the name of the app, they will be presented with an error message. The message explains that price is not considered part of metadata and thus cannot be included in an app’s name, icons, screenshots, or previews. Instead, Apple suggests that developers highlight prices and discounts in the app’s description. Below is the full error message: Your app’s name, icons, screenshots, or previews to be displayed on the App Store include references to your app’s price, which is not considered a part of these metadata items. Please remove any references to your app’s price from your app’s name, including any references to your app being free or discounted. If you would like to advertise changes to your app’s price, it would be appropriate to include this information in the app description. Changes to your app’s price can be made in the Pricing and Availability section of iTunes Connect. Since the inception of the App Store, developers have regularly touted if an app is free in its title in an effort differentiate from competitors. While an Apple spokesperson has confirmed that pricing information is no longer allowed in app names, the company didn’t offer a specific reason for the policy change. Apple has been working to clean up the App Store over the last year. In September, the company started removing apps in deemed “problematic and abandoned.” It was later revealed that Apple’s purge of the App Store removed almost 50,000 applications over the course of a month – a 238 percent increase compared to how many apps are normally removed in a month. Do you think Apple is making the right move by stopping developers from touting pricing in metadata? Let us know down in the comments.

The O2 MVNO launched the new offerings today (March 29), with the full range of Apple handsets available alongside the Samsung Galaxy S7, A5 and J5 smartphones. Devices from Sony and LG can also be bought. It comes nearly four months after the company went to market at the start of the year and allows customers to separate both airtime and handset contracts. Two packages will be available with no upgrade fees; Swap12 and Swap24. They will be added alongside existing data plans of 1GB (£10 per month), 3GB (£15 per month) or 5GB (£20 per month). Customers on either package will simply be able to swap their old device after one or two years for a new device. They would simply need to send their phone back. Those who wish to keep their phone will have reduced monthly payments on the handset until the end of their airtime contract. Pricing for devices start from £6. For example, a 32GB iPhone 7 on a Swap24 plan will cost £33 altogether (£23 for the handset and £10 for the airtime). The pricing of the handset reduces to £21.50 if the subscriber chooses not to trade in the device. The company claims the service has four USPs. ‘Roll’ allows customers to save unused data from any billing period for up to three years. Second is ‘Mix’ which enables the upgrade or downgrade their data plans. Third is ‘Save,’ which waives any charges on minutes or texts for Sky TV customers. Lastly ‘Sync’ will allow Sky TV subscribers to watch Sky box shows on their smartphone. Sky Mobile UK and Ireland chief executive Stephen van Rooyen said: “Our mission to shake up the mobile market continues. Customers told us they want an affordable way to have the phone they want, when they want – so that’s exactly what we are doing. This means no more paying for expensive upgrade fees or long waits to get the latest models.”     TAGS Apple O2 Samsung Sky Mobile Sony lg SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleGamma revenue rises 11pc to £213.5 million Alex Yau RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Gamma revenue rises 11pc to £213.5 million Elitetele.com Mobile on course to hit record turnover of £6.7m Maintel hits heights by doubling revenue to more than £100m NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply The leading news source for the mobile communications industry 8-10 Godson Street Islington London N1 9GZ Editorial Team Telephone: 020 7278 0795 Email: editorial@mobilenewscwp.co.uk Advertising Kimberley Glover - 020 3122 0871 Stephen Watson - 020 3122 0872 POPULAR POSTS Reaction: Can Huawei really overtake Apple and Samsung?

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Image Source: Gabor Balogh iOS 11’s big feature could be a massive Siri upgrade Chris Smith @chris_writes March 28th, 2017 at 5:44 PM Share Tweet While there’s an abundance of iPhone 8 rumors to check out on a regular basis, we don’t see that many iOS 11 leaks. It’s surprising, given that iOS represents one of the most important features of the iPhone and a reason why many people would not leave Apple’s platform for any competing mobile operating system. A new report out of Israel brings says that Siri will get a massive upgrade in iOS 11, revealing some of the new purported features of Apple’s smarter virtual assistant. Don't Miss: NASA just captured a photo of Jupiter that you won’t believe is real According to The Verifier, Siri will gain more powers on all of Apple’s devices, including iPhone, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. The most important features, if the report is accurate, seem to be Siri integration in iMessage and iCloud. Siri in iMessage would probably work very similarly to what Google’s Assistant inside Google Allo. The assistant would be ready to offer context-based suggestions, like where to go to dinner and how to get there. Apple already has a patent detailing such a feature. The iCloud integration would allow Siri to identify the user’s various devices that might be associated with an Apple ID, and offer actions and responses across operating systems, including Mac and iPhone. Siri would reportedly learn more details about the user’s habits, and offer different actions based on the context, not just in iMessage, the report indicates. The report says Siri will be comparable to Bixby when it comes to feature, which is Samsung’s recently introduced voice-based assistant. Bixby, however, is yet to prove itself as it’ll only launch in limited form with the Galaxy S8. Considering that everyone is beefing up their virtual assistants, it’s likely Apple will upgrade Siri in iOS 11, even though there’s no way of verifying The Verifier’s interesting claims at this point.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Moe Slah The iPhone 8 will have a very different way of reading your fingerprint Chris Smith @chris_writes March 28th, 2017 at 7:18 PM Share Tweet We’ve seen a bunch of iPhone 8 rumors so far, and most of them offer the same predictions. The all-screen iPhone will ditch the home button while retaining all of its functions, including fingerprint-sensing. But some analysts say that the Touch ID fingerprint sensor is going away, as Apple is looking to add face recognition features to the new iPhone. However, we’re probably unlikely to see the iPhone lose its fingerprint-sensing powers. Touch ID represents a critical security feature, one that Apple probably will not ditch anytime soon. Analysts who may be looking only at supply chain information may be right in one regard: the iPhone 8 won’t have the same traditional Touch ID components we’ve seen since the feature was introduced on the iPhone 5S. Don't Miss: NASA just captured a photo of Jupiter that you won’t believe is real A new patent awarded on Tuesday to Apple and first seen by 9to5Mac explains a new way of reading fingerprints, one that involves the use of ultrasonic imaging. The Biometric sensing device with discrete ultrasonic transducers patent describes technology that would employ sound waves to capture biometric data such as a fingerprint image. These “discrete ultrasonic transducers” could be placed in a home button, the patent indicates, but they could also be placed anywhere else on a device. The ultrasonic transducers could be embedded in a display — in the image below, the system would use ultrasounds to detect a fingerprint when a finger is either pressing on a traditional home button or touching the area on the screen labeled as 110. Image Source: Apple via USPTO These transducers, which can be placed under/in an iPhone’s display or an area of a display, produce a sound wave pulse in response to an electrical stimulus. These waves would reflect off the input surface. Each fingerprint would create unique reflections, allowing the system to authenticate a user. Image Source: Apple via USPTO The obvious advantage of this tech is that it allows Apple to ditch the fingerprint sensor in the home button. One other benefit is that the method might be even more efficient than previous Touch ID iterations, and prevent failed reading attempts. “The performance of some biometric sensing devices may be adversely affected by conditions unrelated to the biometric sensing device itself,” Apple explains, including contaminants on a user’s finger, or differences in pressure when touching a fingerprint reader. In other words, the new solution might read your fingerprint even if your hands are wet, or you’re not pressing the Touch ID home button appropriately. Even if the iPhone 8 is at least six months away, and we won’t know for sure what user authentication methods Apple will equip in it, it’s pretty clear that the iPhone maker is looking at different Touch ID fingerprint sensing solutions that would allow it to expand the size of the iPhone’s display without losing this particular security feature.

Business Apple's Chicago River flagship taking shape Apple store along Chicago River takes shape A new Apple store along the Chicago River on Michigan Avenue is taking shape. Apple isn't saying when it will open but sources have said it is targeting October. (Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) A new Apple store along the Chicago River on Michigan Avenue is taking shape. Apple isn't saying when it will open but sources have said it is targeting October. (Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) Lauren ZumbachContact ReporterChicago Tribune Right now, the glass walls starting to encircle Apple's new flagship store alongside the Chicago River, by North Michigan Avenue, don't look like much. That's exactly the point. Eventually the scaffolding will be taken down, leaving floor-to-ceiling glass walls opening a view from the Pioneer Court plaza to the river. "We wanted the building to be as light and transparent as possible," said James McGrath, a partner at Foster + Partners, the London-based architectural firm that designed the Chicago store and Apple's Cupertino, Calif., headquarters. Apple isn't saying when its $27 million store under construction in front of 401 N. Michigan Ave. will open, but sources have said it is targeting October. Apple's new Chicago flagship store on the riverfront is taking shape. The roof is going in place this week as March draws to a close. (Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) Michigan Avenue's shopping district traditionally has clustered farther north, and Apple already has a store at 679 N. Michigan, which the new location will replace. But the retail corridor is expanding south, and the riverfront spot was an opportunity to build an updated store bridging the gap between the parks and tourist sites along the southern stretch of Michigan Avenue and the shops farther north, McGrath said. The retailer wants its stores to be gathering places where people can check out products, learn how to use them, attend public events or simply check out the view from the plaza. "We want it to be more than just a shopping experience," McGrath said.

The store was photographed March 28, 2017. Curved glass panels wrap around the sides of the Apple store under construction on Michigan Avenue at the Chicago River. The store was photographed March 28, 2017. (Nancy Stone / Chicago Tribune) The glass walls and thin roof supported by four columns are meant to nearly invisibly connect what's inside the store and what's out. All retail is below street level, to avoid blocking the view overlooking the river. The transparent walls, 14 feet high at street level and 32 feet high near the river, are made of four layers of half-inch thick glass joined with layers of stronger, thicker laminated glass so they won't bend in the wind or break if hit — though they can crack. The roof is made from a lightweight material used in yacht hulls to keep it thin — 4 feet thick at its widest point and 4 inches at its narrowest, with an Apple logo on top. Apple unveils red iPhone, cuts price on iPad as stock hits high Tribune staff with news services Apple announced a new color for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus Tuesday morning and slashed prices on iPads, a move that comes after stock hit an all-time high.

(Tribune staff with news services) The store will have many of the new elements introduced at a San Francisco Apple store that opened last year, McGrath said, including the outdoor plaza, a gathering place centered around a video wall Apple calls "The Forum" that can host events and classes, a stretch of windowlike displays showing off products and indoor ficus trees. Early images of the store's design drew comparisons to a high-tech take on Frank Lloyd Wright's Prairie-style homes. Foster + Partners wasn't trying to echo Wright's aesthetic, but McGrath said the connection wasn't surprising. "It's a response to its environment, just as the Prairie style was," he said. lzumbach@chicagotribune.com Twitter @laurenzumbach Copyright © 2017, Chicago Tribune Skilled immigrants often struggle to put degrees, credentials to use in U.S. Offering $99 flights to Iceland, Wow Air picks Chicago for 1st Midwest market Wells Fargo rolls out card-free access at all of its ATMs Sports Breaking RedEye Trending Opinion Suburbs Entertainment Advertising 36°

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars DEV Apple now rejects App Store submissions when the name includes the price Jordan Novet@jordannovet March 28, 2017 5:13 PM Tags: App Store, Apple, iOS, Mac App Store Above: App Store. Image Credit: Jordan Novet/VentureBeat Apple has stepped up its efforts to stop developers from promoting the price of their apps in app names and screenshots. For the past month or so Apple’s iTunes Connect service has been blocking submissions to the App Store or Mac App Store when app metadata includes pricing information. The change could have consequences for those who push free apps in the iOS and macOS stores and are trying to stand out from similar free apps. For years developers have mentioned “free” in apps’ names. Apple has previously discouraged developers from doing so in its developer guide for iTunes Connect and its overview of App Store product pages. Now the company has gone further. This is the error message you’ll see if you mention “Free” in the name of an app build that you submit for review: Your app’s name, icons, screenshots, or previews to be displayed on the App Store include references to your app’s price, which is not considered a part of these metadata items. Please remove any references to your app’s price from your app’s name, including any references to your app being free or discounted. If you would like to advertise changes to your app’s price, it would be appropriate to include this information in the app description. Changes to your app’s price can be made in the Pricing and Availability section of iTunes Connect. Chris Apostle, chief revenue officer at mobile marketing company Moburst, told VentureBeat in an email that the company found out about the change while working with its customers’ iOS apps. The company typically inserted the word “free” in a given app’s name and screenshots, but then app updates with that content started getting rejected, he wrote. An Apple spokesperson confirmed the changes but declined to comment further. Despite the change, some apps in the App Store and Mac App Store continue to use the word “free” in their names or in screenshots. Updates containing that same information are likely to be rejected in the future. Google’s Developer Program Policies for Google Play don’t explicitly restrict apps from making allusions to price in the name and other metadata. Microsoft’s Windows Store Policies also don’t say anything about whether names and other metadata can include pricing details.

And after a lengthy stint in beta, the iOS 10.3 update is now available for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. As expected iOS 10.3 is a huge update for Apple’s mobile devices bringing new features, fixes and a ton of security patches with it. An iOS 10.3 release is confirmed. Today we want to take an updated look at the most important things to know about the iOS 10.3 update and its release. We’ll continue to update this roundup with new details so check back for frequent updates. iOS 10.3 Review: First Impressions Yesterday we opted to download the iOS 10.3 update on several devices including the iPhone 7, iPhone 6, and the iPhone 5. Three popular devices. The iOS 10.3 update for the trio of iPhones is massive, over 600MB for the iPhone 7, and the installation process took a lot longer than usual due in part to the inclusion of Apple’s new APFS file system. We didn’t run into any issues but the download/installation took upwards of 20 minutes on all three of these devices so make sure you set aside some time to monitor the installation and the final product. So far, we haven’t noticed any major problems with the iPhone 7, iPhone 6 or iPhone 5 iOS 10.3 update. In fact, we’ve seen some nice improvements on the eldest device. Battery life is currently holding up on all three phones. We haven’t experienced any weird drain when in use or standby. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and cellular data are also stable. We’ve noticed some improvements to the iPhone 5’s boot speed and its UI. The user interface feels faster and more fluid than the previous versions of iOS 10. As of right now, iOS 10.3 is treating these three devices well and it’s recommended if you’re interested in iOS 10.3’s features, protecting your device from potential harm, or if you’re suffering from an unfixable iOS issue. If you’re doing fine on iOS 10.2.1, you might want to wait a few days for more long-term feedback to emerge. We’ll keep you posted. In the meantime, we’ve put together a list of reasons to, and not to, install the iOS 10.3 update right now. If you’re having an excellent experience on iOS 10.2.1 or below, we highly recommend digging into those reasons before making the move to iOS 10.3. iOS 10.3 Problems iOS 10.3 went through a lengthy beta but problems have slipped through the cracks. iOS 10.3 users are complaining about a wide range of issues including weird battery drain, issues with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, lag, random reboots, and issues with third-party apps. As of right now, these issues are isolated. They’re also extremely common after a major iOS update release. Most of these iOS 10.3 problems can be solved from the comfort of a computer chair at work or the office. If you’re seeing an issue after downloading iOS 10.3, take a look at our list of fixes. You’ll also want to report it to Apple so that its engineers can get to work on a fix. You Can Downgrade from iOS 10.3 If you decide to download the iOS 10.3 update know that there is a way to drop down to another official version of iOS 10. If iOS 10.3 starts causing problems for you, you can get off it for a limited time. Apple is currently signing off on iOS 10.2.1 which means you can drop down to it if you’re unhappy with the update’s performance on your iPhone or iPad. Unfortunately, you can’t drop down to anything older than iOS 10.2.1 so you’ll want to be absolutely sure about the iOS 10.3 update if you’re coming from an older iOS 10 update or an older operating system like iOS 9. For more on the iOS 10.3 to iOS 10.2.1 downgrade process, take a look at our roundup. It’ll take you through the important steps. More Features Coming A new feature, which requires the iOS 10.3 update, is on its way next month. Apple recently announced a new Clips application that requires the iOS 10.3 update to operate. Apple hasn’t confirmed a specific date but the company has said that Clips should be out for iOS 10.3 users sometime in April. Clips will allow select iOS 10.3 users (some older devices won’t get it) to create unique videos. It’ll let you combine video clips, photos and music that you can share via iMessage, Instagram, Facebook or another popular social networking platform. It also features Live Tiles which will let you create animated captions and titles using your voice. You’ll then be able to add effects like comic book filters, speech bubbles, shapes and full-screen animated posters. For more on Clips, take a look at our roundup. What’s Next Apple’s already confirmed the next iOS 10.3 update. The iOS 10.3.2 update is currently in beta ahead of an unknown release date later this year. As of right now the update appears to be a maintenance release which means it’ll probably deliver bug fixes and security patches as opposed to features. While you might be tempted to try the iOS 10.3.2 beta ahead of time, be aware that Apple’s early software can cause problems. Issues with apps and services, connectivity, and battery life are common beta issues and we expect these, and other problems, to plague the iOS 10.3.2 update as it passes through the company’s beta program. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3 & 6 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3 If You Want Better Security   1 / 10 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3 update on your iPhone or iPad.  The iOS 10.3 update brings over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 10 7 Responses 01/10/2017 Stephen Reply Really a very terribly written article, with numerous grammar mistakes.

Uber’s first report on employee diversity shows low numbers for women, especially in technology positions. Uber’s report doesn’t count drivers as employees. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) (Photo: Seth Wenig / AP) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE New York — Uber’s first report on employee diversity shows low numbers for women, especially in technical positions. In that regard, the company is similar to other Silicon Valley giants such as Google, Facebook and Apple. But Uber’s report comes as pressure mounts on the company in light of sexual harassment claims by a former employee, the antics of its embattled CEO Travis Kalanick and ongoing criticisms of a boorish “brogrammer” culture. Management defections include that of the company’s president, Jeff Jones, after just six months on the job. Thirty-six percent of the company’s worldwide employees are women, according to the report, which does not count drivers as employees. Google, in comparison, has 31 percent women and Apple, 32 percent. When it comes to technology jobs such as engineering, only 15 percent are women at Uber. At Google, it’s 19 percent and Apple, 23 percent. As with other tech companies , Uber is making some progress in diversifying its work force. The new hires at the company show a higher percentage of women — 41 percent — as well as more underrepresented minorities. In the U.S., the largest ethnic group at Uber is white and the second largest is Asian. The report also shows that nearly 9 percent of the company’s U.S. employees are black and almost 6 percent are Hispanic. At Google, a much larger company, the numbers are 2 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Uber also says 15 percent of its U.S. employees hold work visas, and they hail from 71 countries. Other technology companies have not been disclosing this information, but it’s possible that they will follow Uber’s steps — especially as the industry continues to clash heads with President Donald Trump’s administration over immigration issues. Uber has about 12,000 employees worldwide, about half in the U.S. The San Francisco company has hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to lead an investigation into the sexual harassment charges leveled by the former engineer, Susan Fowler. The company plans to release the findings next month. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

By Emily Bary March 28, 2017 6:32 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large The next iPhone won’t come out til September, but investors are already looking well beyond the new phone. Photo: Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Apple shares keep going up in anticipation of the iPhone 8 launch later this year, but for the most part Wall Street is already looking at what comes next, after the September iPhone launch. More from Barron’s Next Why Chipotle Might Raise Prices Viacom: Why Barron’s Sees The Stock Jumping 40% When to Buy Airline Tickets to Get The Cheapest Fare While UBS analyst Steven Milunovich currently sees limited upside for Apple in the next year -- the stock may rise perhaps 5% from its current $144 -- he sees more potential over the long term. In his view, Apple shares could realistically hit $175 in the next two to three years (a 22% rise). But he says $200 (a 39% jump) is possible if products besides the iPhone really take off. Here’s what it would take for Apple’s stock price to hit $200 by 2019, according to Milunovich. • This fall’s iPhone 8 ushers in a “supercycle” of phone upgrades, and investors feel confident that next fall’s lineup will also be strong. • Apple’s “other hardware” business, consisting of products like the Apple Watch and AirPods, starts seeing “strong growth” of 20% next fiscal year. Right now, investors are primarily focused on quarterly iPhone sales and the potential of Apple’s “services” business. The company would have to show that its wearables have mass appeal and that the overall Apple ecosystem is “more sticky” than investors originally thought. • The company’s price-to-earnings ratio rises from 14 currently to 16 -- or even higher, starting next year. If investors have more confidence in Apple’s potential going forward, they’ll likely pay more for every dollar the company earns. Were Apple to enter a completely new category, such as transportation, Milunovich says investors might “believe Apple has caught the next major trend and see a decent runway for growth,” pushing Apple’s price-to-earnings ratio above 17 times two years from now. • Apple buys back more of its stock. That reduces the number of shares outstanding, meaning that the company’s per-share profits increase. Big Picture: For the company’s shares to head significantly higher, Apple will have to show investors that it has more than just a few iPhone launches in store.

The boy, who identified himself as Roman, told the emergency service call handler that his mother was dead. She was, in fact, unconscious, lying on the floor. To make the call, Roman had unlocked his mother’s mobile phone by pressing her thumb to it. Then, he used Apple’s Siri voice assistant to ask for help. Siri dialed 999: the British emergency number. Police were dispatched after the call handler stayed on the phone talking with Roman long enough to piece together his address in Kenley, south London. They arrived 13 minutes after the call and forced their way in to find Roman and his two brothers inside with their mother, who was lying unconscious on the floor. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More Paramedics were able to give what the Met’s Command and Control Unit (MetCC) called life-saving first aid to the woman. She regained consciousness, after which she was taken to the hospital. Police released this audio of the call in the hope that people teach their kids what their home address is and how to call police or emergency services in an emergency: Chief Superintendent Ade Adelekan, from the MetCC, where 999 calls are handled: If you do nothing else today, then I’d implore any parents of young children to sit down with them and make sure they know what to do in this kind of situation and that they know how to contact police or other emergency services in an emergency. As this case demonstrates so poignantly, it could really be the difference between life and death. It’s an amazing story, and thanks to his quick thinking and by asking Siri for help, this little boy saved his mum’s life, and it means she is still here and can be extremely proud of him and his brothers. It is an amazing story, but it’s not the first of its kind. In June last year, an Australian mother, rushing to the nursery when a baby monitor showed her one-year-old had stopped breathing, dropped her phone while she was turning on the light. She still managed to tell Siri to call for help while she performed CPR. Both she and her husband credited the few precious seconds that Siri gave them for potentially making all the difference. The outcome of that particular story is one of the upsides of the fact that recent iPhones can be set to always be listening for commands. That new feature came about in iOS 9, when Apple enabled activation of the built-in personal assistant at the sound of your voice, rather than waiting for you to hold down the Home button. If that’s turned on, Siri can not only open music and send text messages; it can also make hands-free phone calls on its own while you drive, or, obviously, in critical situations like that faced by the Australian family last year. Note that Siri in hands-free mode only works on newer models when not plugged in to a power source. Older models – at least back to 5s – need to be plugged in to a power source to enable Siri to work in hands-free mode. Other phone brands can also be set up for hands-free voice assistance, of course. This story illustrates one good reason to activate the feature. But your kids don’t need to know all that. What they should know, as the MetCC said, is their home address. Another part of their training should be how to unlock a phone and how to summon help – be it through a voice assistant or pressing an emergency services number like 999 or 911. Roman’s mother is probably thanking her lucky stars that Roman knew how to do just that.

Australia now officially has 'Google tax', aims to collect $2b Treasurer Scott Morrison arrives in the press gallery for an interview, at Parliament House in Canberra on Monday 27 March 2017. fedpol Photo: Alex Ellinghausen Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit The Turnbull government's "Google tax" has been passed into law, arming the Australian Taxation Office with some of the world's strongest powers to fight multinationals as it moves to recoup $2 billion in revenue from some of the nation's biggest companies including Apple, BHP Billiton, Chevron and Crown. But as more countries hunt for a greater share of revenue from multinationals, concerns remain that disagreements between global agencies about which nation is entitled to tax profits could spark revenue wars. Nevertheless, in a local context the Diverted Profits Tax (DPT), informally dubbed Australia's "Google tax", has already had a big impact on the behaviour of multinationals. A number of companies including tech giant Google restructured their tax affairs in anticipation of the laws passing and others have been negotiating with Tax Commissioner Chris Jordan. The federal government said the DPT, to commence on July 1 2017, would raise about $100 million in revenue a year from 2018-19. Australia has a range of other laws aimed at multinationals and the ATO already has audits of big companies under way, which could see up to $2 billion in revenue flowing in, depending on whether or not those companies fight their tax bills. Big profits targeted The DPT laws are aimed at multinationals with global revenue of more than $1 billion and Australian revenue of greater than $25 million. They will be hit with a 40 per cent tax on all profits - that is 10 per cent higher than the 30 per cent company tax rate. It aims to ensure that the tax paid by global entities properly reflects the economic substance of their activities in Australia and prevents the diversion of profits offshore through contrived arrangements. The tax does not apply to managed investment trusts or similar foreign entities, sovereign wealth funds and foreign pension funds. It will, however, encourage significant global entities to provide greater information to the ATO to allow for the timely resolution of tax disputes. Treasurer Scott Morrison announced the legislation in the 2016-17 budget in response to public outcry over companies shifting billions of dollars in profits each year to lower-tax nations. Mr Morrison told Parliament the laws will "encourage greater cooperation between unco-operative multinationals and the ATO". Timelier resolution? "As a result this will greatly reduce the length of disputes between the ATO and multinationals, and lead to timelier dispute resolution," he said. Australia followed the lead of Britain, which has a similar laws aimed at multinationals which resulted in Google agreeing to a deal with that country's tax authorities to pay ??130 million ($214 million) in back taxes. "It provides a powerful new tool for the Australian Taxation Office to tackle contrived arrangements and unco-operative taxpayers, and will reinforce Australia's position as having some of the toughest laws in the world to combat multinational tax avoidance," Mr Morrison said. But shadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh said the government was "waging a phoney war on multinationals". "The fact is that the government estimates their Diverted Profits Tax will raise just one-eighth of the revenue that Labor would raise through closing debt-deduction loopholes," he said. "Since coming to office, the Turnbull government has cut over 3000 staff from the tax office. With fewer staff, it's harder for the tax office to enforce their laws." The staff cuts have happened in the midst of several laws being passed. The Multinational Anti-Avoidance Law (MAAL), introduced in January this year, which also targets multinational profit shifting by boosting the ATO's anti-avoidance powers. The ATO also has at its disposal tough transfer pricing rules. The government in last year's budget also announced a 1300-member ATO tax avoidance taskforce that would be dedicated to stopping rorting by multinationals, private companies and wealthy individuals. That measure is expected to raise $3.7 billion up to 2020. Audits underway In a speech at The Tax Institute's conference in Adelaide earlier this month, Mr Jordan said the federal government's tax avoidance taskforce was aimed at catching companies "who are not doing the right thing". There were already 71 audits under way in the large business area covering 59 multinational corporations, Mr Jordan said. At least seven major multinational audits were expected to come to a head before June 30, Mr Jordan said, four in e-commerce and three in the energy and resource industries. The ATO expects liabilities to total more than $2 billion from these seven companies. Oxfam Australia spokeswoman Joy Kyriacou welcomed the passing of the DPT laws, but said more needed to be done to stop about $6 billion of offshoring of profits by Australian-based multinationals. She said the government needs to ensure country-by-country reporting of tax affairs for all big businesses happens and is made public. "Australian Tax Office data shows more than one in three big companies are paying no tax," she said. "Big companies operating from Australia should be required to be transparent and publicly report on their profits, taxes and assets for every country in which they operate, so it's harder for them to shift profits and dodge paying their fair share."

Problem Solving | 13 Mar 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (14) How to Identify High-Performance GPU Apps on the MacBook Pro by Jeff Carlson Shortly after the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar began shipping, battery life became a hot topic. Although Apple boasts up to 10 hours of performance per charge, I wasn’t seeing anything near that on my machine. I’d get maybe 4 hours. For a while, Consumer Reports refused to recommend the MacBook Pro because of battery life, although their testing methodology was questionable (see “Why We Should Care about the Consumer Reports MacBook Pro Rating,” 12 January 2017). The upside of the tempest was that Apple was able to fix some graphics and battery life issues in the macOS Sierra 10.12.2 and 10.12.3 updates. One of those problems centered around the way macOS switched between the built-in Intel graphics processor and the discrete AMD Radeon Pro graphics card available in the 15-inch models. (Although I’m writing specifically about the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the following discussion applies equally to any MacBook Pro with a discrete graphics card.) When you launch a graphically demanding app, such as Adobe Photoshop, macOS switches to the Radeon processor, which consumes more power. When you quit the power-hungry app, the machine is supposed to turn off the discrete card and switch back to the integrated graphics processor, which offers less graphical power but doesn’t chew as much battery life. Before 10.12.3, macOS wouldn’t accurately sense that the changeover had happened and would continue to drive the display using the discrete GPU. Since applying that update, my battery life has dramatically improved. Even still, though, there are times when it seems as if my battery level is slipping away faster than I would expect given the work I’m doing. If you’re experiencing something similar, here’s how you can determine which apps are using which graphics processor and potentially track down the culprit. You have a couple of options: First, click the Battery menu bar item, which will tell you which applications are “Using Significant Energy.” That’s a fuzzy indicator, however. You can be running an application that’s using significant energy and still be using the integrated graphics processor. So, a quick trip into Activity Monitor is more helpful. Launch Activity Monitor (located in the Utilities folder in the Applications folder; you can get there quickly in the Finder by choosing Go > Utilities) and click the Energy tab. At the bottom of the window, see which graphics card is currently in use: Integrated (the Intel GPU) or “High Perf” (the high-performance Radeon GPU). If it’s the latter, you may be burning energy faster than you want. To determine which application is causing the discrete GPU to run, click the Requires High Perf GPU column to sort the list of running processes based on that attribute. You may have to click the heading twice to sort it correctly; the caret to the right of the column title should be facing down to indicate that you’re sorting in descending order. At the top of the list, the apps that say Yes are your culprits. Quit those apps. Even if you’re not actively using them, their presence can keep the discrete GPU active. The Graphics Card indicator at the bottom of the screen should switch back to Integrated. You’ll notice that Activity Monitor also includes a Time Remaining estimate. When Apple released 10.12.2, it took the unusual step of removing this information from the Battery menu bar item (see “macOS 10.12.2 Sierra Focuses on New MacBook Pros,” 13 December 2016). Happily, you can still get that information in Activity Monitor. The estimate is still just an estimate, though, and shouldn’t be taken as gospel because macOS adjusts its energy management features frequently. Nevertheless, the Time Remaining estimate can be a helpful guideline if you’re getting close to the wire. Of course, if you have to use even a single app that requires the discrete GPU, your battery life will suffer, and there’s nothing you can do about it. Similarly, even if no apps are using the discrete GPU or reporting as using significant energy, the battery may drain faster than you expect due to other factors. Especially on the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, I’ve found that turning off keyboard illumination (expand the Control Strip on the Touch Bar to reveal the keyboard brightness buttons) and reducing screen brightness can make a big difference.   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

Is your MacBook Pro with Touch Bar getting less battery life per charge than you think it should? The culprit could be applications that are forcing it to use the high-performance graphics processor. Here’s how to tell which GPU is in use and which applications to close to switch to the integrated processor. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Richard  2017-03-13 15:31 This is brilliant and incredibly useful. I'm using a 2014 MacBook Pro but I've always wanted to see which of my application uses the discreet GPU. It looks like my only application that uses it is Lightroom. Safari has memory issues but they're not related to the GPU. Reply Greg  2017-03-13 21:16 Why would pgAdmin need the graphics card? It's the only app that was using it. pgAdmin can view Postgres databases. That doesn't seem too demanding. Is there any downside when the MBP is not running off the battery? Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:08 I just downloaded the latest version (4.13) and also found it requires the "high perf. GPU." My guess it's because its GUI is made using the Qt framework and there's something about the framework that makes the Mac think it should use the discrete video card; every application made with Qt likely will do the same. I would report it to Postgres in case there's some setting they can use in the Mac build process to make the application *not* trigger use of the discrete video card. When you're not running off battery, the consequences of using the discrete video card are much less significant; you're using more electricity than necessary and may be adding wear to the cooling fans. Reply Tony Voss   2017-03-14 01:55 I use a 15" MacBook Pro as the navigational system on a yacht and power consumption is critical, especially when there is little sun or wind for power generation. For years I have used gfxCardStatus (http://gfx.io). This useful app places an extra item in the menu bar which indicates by displaying the letter i or n whether the integrated or Nvidia discrete processor is active. Pull down on the icon and it shows a list of apps requiring the external card processor. You can also switch between using Integrated only, discrete or dynamic switching. You cannot switch to 'Integrated only' if an app is already using the discrete processor. Some apps and an external display force discrete mode anyway. I have gfxCardStatus set to display a notification whenever the mode is switched. This is a useful warning when you happen to launch an app that turns on the discrete processor and comforting confirmation when you quite a culprit. I have successfully got app developers to remove unnecessary use of the discrete card and to fix an app that left it on when quitting. But if the app is no longer being maintained you may be out of luck - Bento for example. Thoroughly recommended. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:17 I wanted to mention gfxCardStatus, but it's no longer actively maintained, and doesn't work reliably under Sierra (and maybe a version or two back). I used it for years, and wrote about it for TidBITS in 2011: Reply Troy T  2017-03-19 22:55 I've used this utility for years and continue to be happy with it. As it isn't maintained, it's less helpful in shifting sources of video drivers, but it continues to flawlessly show when the system is using discrete graphics and which apps are forcing its use. As long as gfxCardStatus still reports what's going on with the video circuitry, I'll strongly recommend it for anyone who is interested in stretching their battery capacity. Reply DelfM  2017-03-14 08:35 It's probably rare that you would be concerned about power consumption when you connect an external monitor, but my 2012 MacBook Pro Retina switches to the high performance graphics card when I connect an external monitor, even if none of my open applications need it. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:14 Yes, I think all MacBook Pros with discrete cards switch to the GPU to power an external monitor. Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:18 I don't understand why it automatically uses the discrete card when an external monitor is attached, Macs without such cards are able to use the same monitors. It also happens regardless of whether the external monitor is extending the desktop or mirroring the built-in display. At work, we always advise faculty to use the AC adapter when presenting from a laptop but it would be nice if they didn't have to. I don't have the ability to check at the moment but I wonder if screen mirroring over AirPlay or using 3rd party mirroring software triggers use of the discrete card. It would be a little ironic if they don't, given that mirroring by software almost certainly is more intensive than mirroring on a physically connected display. Reply David Redfearn   2017-03-14 13:57 I started looking at this data when I got my new MBP 15. One oddity I have noticed is that Apple Photos does not seem to use the AMD GPU. I have two Photos extensions (RAWPower and DxO) that do trigger the GPU when they are used, but when I am finished with them, the GPU is turned off. David Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 16:15 I would bet Apple tuned Photos especially so it doesn't need the GPU. Reply Brian Harvey  2017-03-28 00:43 More a question than a comment. MBP 2016 with 2.9 GHz Intel Core i7. running with 598 GB free. Docked most of the time using a Benq 32 inch 4K monitor; currently running at 1080P. Latest s/w not beta. I seem to have a lot of spinning beach balls. I cut they system down to only a few add ons such as SwithcResX. I still frequently get the spinning beach ball with Safari and iTunes. I even get the ball with the MBP native resolution with no external monitor attached. Anyone seen this happening? Reply Tony Voss   2017-03-28 04:55 I have seen a lot of spinning beach balls of late - maybe since Sierra 10.12.3? MacBook Pro 15" with Thunderbolt Display and lid closed. I only rarely use iTunes and have the feeling it is linked to use of Safari. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-28 09:34 This sounds like the sort of thing you'd need to track down carefully.

All software on the target computer is patched immediately before the contest, so even an attack that worked fine in the lab the week before might end up stymied on competition day In other words, Pwn2Own isn’t just about spotting vulnerabilities that might be exploitable, but also about exploring exploitation techniques to come up with genuine zero-day security holes that will work even on properly-updated systems. Prizes run to hundreds of thousands of dollars each. Not everyone approves of the competitive “winner-takes-all” approach, in which vulnerabilities may be kept secret for weeks or even months until showtime arrives. But whether you like it or not, high-stakes bug bounty contests like Pwn2Own have become part of today’s responsible disclosure scene. The “responsibility” comes from the fact that to claim the prize, the bug finders have to give the affected vendor full details of the attack and keep those details confidential until the vendor has had time to fix the hole. The high payout for many Pwn2Own bugs reflects that they would be similarly valuable if crooks were to find them instead, so fixes typically follow as quickly as is practicable. The TL;DR version of this story is this: as Apple patches go, treat these as “first among equals” and make sure you get them as soon as you can. If you wait for your turn to come around in Apple’s staggered autoupdate process, you might end up several days behind, so we recommend checking for updates manually right away. On a Mac, click on Apple Menu | About This Mac | Software Update… and then click on the blue “update arrow” in the App Store app. On an iPhone or iPad, use Settings | General | Software Update to make sure you have the latest version. When we updated, the download sizes were about 1.5GB for macOS 10.12.4 and 650MB for iOS 10.3. As is typical for Apple security updates, a restart was required, and the update completed over a 15 to 20 minute period as part the reboot, during which time we couldn’t use our Mac or our phone. Just so you know. If you’re still not convinced about the value of getting into the patch queue as early as you can, here are some statistics from Apple’s official Mac security announcement: 65 fixes listed.
127 CVE-numbered vulnerabilities listed.
23 fixes deal with arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges.
42 system components affected, from AppleGraphicsPowerManagement to tiffutil.
 Some of the vulnerabilities can be triggered by viewing booby-trapped files as diverse as images, fonts and iBooks files, all of which can be unexceptionably embedded in or linked to from otherwise innocent-looking web pages. And if that’s not enough, consider this one. We’ve written about Thunderbolt-related memory probing and firmware hacks before; this time the flaw could theoretically allow an attacker with physical access to your Mac to find your hard disk decryption password in memory: Component:     EFI (macOS Sierra 10.12.3)
Impact:        A malicious Thunderbolt adapter may be able to 
               recover the FileVault 2 encryption password
Description:   An issue existed in the handling of DMA. 
               This issue was addressed by enabling VT-d in EFI.
CVE-2016-7585: Ulf Frisk (@UlfFrisk) One way to mitigate memory-probing attacks against your Mac, or any other computer for that matter, is to shut down your computer completely instead of relying on hibernation or sleep mode. When powered off, the decryption password is lost from RAM, so there’s nothing to recover until you’ve booted up and typed the password in again. Especially if you travel a lot, when you can’t guarantee to have your computer in sight and under your own control at all times, get into the habit of doing a full shutdown instead of simply closing the lid. It requires a bit more discipline, and takes longer than simply ‘sleeping’ and ‘unsleeping’ your computer, but it’s an orderly thing to do, and breaks the risky habit of leaving loads of applications alive with interesting documents open in them. Before we go… We mentioned a security patch for iWork at the top of the article. The iWork fix is small and simple, but nevertheless a serious reminder of how “forgotten history” can come back to bite us all. According to Apple, the password protection feature in the Export To PDF… option of the Numbers, Pages and Keynote apps could sometimes leave you with a 40-bit RC4-encrypted file, instead of the 128-bit AES encryption that today’s encrypted PDFs are expected to use. We’re guessing that this was a long-forgotten hangover from the days when the US regulated cryptographic exports as if they were munitions, requiring export versions of US software to use carefully weakened encryption versions so that US intelligence typically could crack selected files, but less well-funded adversaries couldn’t quite. Of course, 40-bit keys that were “just about” crackable by the NSA 20 years ago are crackable by everyday computer hardware now… …a reminder, given that the UK government this week called for deliberate cutbacks to the encryption strength used by services such as WhatsApp, that you can’t strengthen security by weakening it.

The update to iOS 10.3 is now rolling out to the iPhone and iPad, while Apple Watch owners are receiving a bump to watchOS 3.2. On the iOS side of things, you can expect the new update to bring Find My AirPods, a feature that’ll help you locate your lost wireless earbuds, as well as lots of other smaller tweaks. Also included is the change to Apple File System (APFS), which isn’t exactly user-facing, but is still a big enough change that you should probably perform a backup before updating. Focusing specifically on T-Mobile, folks on Reddit are reporting that they’re getting a new carrier update today, too. Here’s what the official iOS 10.3 changelog from Apple looks like: Find My iPhone View the current or last known location of your AirPods Play a sound on one or both AirPods to help you find them Siri Support for paying and checking status o bills with payment apps Support for scheduling with ride booking apps Support for checking car fuel level, lock status, turning on lights and activating horn with automaker apps Cricket sports scores and statistics for Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council CarPlay Shortcuts in the status bar for easy access to last used apps Apple Music Now Playing screen gives access to Up Next and the currently playing song’s album Daily curated playlists and new music categories in Apple Music Other improvements and fixes Rent once and watch your iTunes movies across your devices New Settings unified view for your Apple ID account information, settings and devices Hourly weather in Maps using 3D Touch on the displayed current temperature Support for searching “parked car” in Maps Calendar adds the ability to delete an unwanted invite and report it as junk Home app support to trigger scenes using accessories with switches and buttons Home app support for accessory battery level status Podcasts support for 3D Touch and Today widget to access recently updated shows Podcast shows or episodes are shareable to Messages with full playback support Fixes an issue that could prevent Maps from displaying your current location after resetting Location & Privacy VoiceOver stability improvements for Phone, Safari, and Mail Meanwhile, Apple Watch owners are receiving an update to watchOS 3.2. One of the big new features in this update is Theater Mode, which will disable Raise to Wake and turn on silent mode on your Apple Watch so that your smartwatch doesn’t disturb your fellow moviegoers. Here’s Apple’s official watchOS 3.2 changelog: Siri now works with apps from the App Store to start workouts, send messages, make payments, book rides, and more. Theater Mode setting turns on silent mode and keeps the screen dark until you tap it, even when you raise your wrist. Scribble is now available in French, Spanish, and Italian. Music playlist sync progress is now displayed in the Apple Watch app on iPhone.

Contrary to a previous report saying that the Cupertino giant’s smartphones have become faster mainly because the update is freeing up more space, the engineer is crediting the evident change on software performance to the tweaks made to the animations.  On Tuesday, Apple engineer Renaud Lienhart — who is directly involved in the development of the iOS operating system — took to Twitter to explain why users are seeing a positive change on the performance of their iPhones since installing the iOS 10.3 update. According to Lienhart the reason why devices feel “snappier” with iOS 10.3 is because of the tweaks they have made to the animations. He also admitted that animations have been shortened for the better.  The Verge points out that though the animations for launching and exiting apps as well as switching between apps do not have significant differences from the ones in iOS 10.2.1, the operating system does feel more responsive with the overall daily tasks on the iPhons 6s Plus. Other iPhone generations and variants are expected to also have the same tweaks, so they are presumed to be more responsive than before as well.  Aside from the tweaked animations, iOS 10.3’s new modern file system is also contributing to the overall faster performance of the operating system. The APFS is reportedly designed to be low latency, and this should enhance the read and write speeds on the iPhone and the iPad. Not only does the APFS boost storage, it also lays the foundation for when Apple fully switches to supporting only 64-bit apps on iOS, a move that is expected to happen with the upcoming iOS 11, as noted by The Verge in a separate report.  On Monday, Apple rolled out iOS 10.3 to the public, keeping its promise of introducing a new Apple File System, Siri improvements as well as the Find My AirPods feature to the public. For users who have yet to update their devices, they are advised to create a backup prior to downloading iOS 10.3.  An Apple engineer has explained why iOS 10.3 feels “snappier.” Photo: Reuters/Phil Noble Related Stories Apple Stock Jump To Record High After Analyst Predicts $200 iOS 11 Rumors: Siri To Get A Boost in Artificial Intelligence, Will Come With Contextual Learning iOS 10.3 Release: New Features, Updates To Apps Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

UberþÄôs first report on employee diversity shows low numbers for women, especially in technology positions. UberþÄôs report doesnþÄôt count drivers as employees. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) NEW YORK – Uber’s first report on employee diversity shows low numbers for women, especially in technical positions. In that regard, the company is similar to other Silicon Valley giants such as Google, Facebook and Apple. But Uber’s report comes as pressure mounts on the company in light of sexual harassment claims by a former employee, the antics of its embattled CEO Travis Kalanick and ongoing criticisms of a boorish “brogrammer” culture. Management defections include that of the company’s president, Jeff Jones, after just six months on the job. Thirty-six percent of the company’s employees are women, according to the report , which does not count drivers as employees. Google, in comparison, has 31 percent women and Apple, 32 percent. When it comes to technology jobs such as engineering, only 15 percent are women at Uber. At Google, it’s 19 percent and Apple, 23 percent. As with other tech companies, the largest ethnic group at Uber in the U.S. is white and the second largest is Asian. The report also shows that nearly 9 percent of the company’s U.S. employees are black and almost 6 percent are Hispanic. At Google, a much larger company, the numbers are 2 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Also like other tech companies , Uber is making some progress in diversifying its work force. The new hires at the company show a higher percentage of women – 41 percent – as well as more underrepresented minorities. Uber also says 15 percent of its employees hold work visas, and they hail from 71 countries. Other technology companies have not been disclosing this information, but it’s possible that they will follow Uber’s steps – especially as the industry continues to clash heads with President Donald Trump’s administration over immigration issues. The San Francisco company has hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to lead an investigation into the sexual harassment charges leveled by the former engineer, Susan Fowler. The company plans to release the findings next month.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Mobile Technology Apple iPad (2017) vs. Google Pixel C Emily Ferron March 28, 2017 How does the newest, cheapest iPad compare to the pricey Android-running Google Pixel C? View gallery - 23 images Last week, Apple unveiled its most affordable iPad to date. Here's how the features and specs of the newest 9.7-inch iPad compare to those of the Google Pixel C, one of the most premium Android-running tablets on the market. Size Sick of Ads? New Atlas Plus offers subscribers an ad free experience. It's just US$19 a year.More Information When both of the tablets are held in the portrait orientation, the Pixel C is slightly taller and about 5-percent wider. However, the iPad is the thicker device – it's half a millimeter thicker than the Pixel C, and it's thicker than its predecessor, the iPad Air 2, as well. Weight The Pixel C is the heavier tablet, which could make a meaningful difference when you're holding it in one hand or toting it in a bag with other essentials. It weighs about 9-percent more. Build Both makers stick with uncomplicated aluminum unibody builds. Colors The iPad is available in three metallic color variants, while the Google Pixel C is offered only in silver. Display size The Pixel C display, with its 10.2-inch diagonal and 1:1.4 aspect ratio, offers about 8-percent more overall screen area than the 9.7-inch, 4:3 iPad. Display resolution The Pixel C has a higher pixel density, so it should have a sharper-looking display. In Apple's defense, however, resolution is not the only indicator of display quality. Speakers Both tablets have stereo speakers. Fingerprint sensor The iPad has a fingerprint sensor built into the home button for easy, secure logins. The Pixel C is not equipped for any kind of biometric access. Cellular connectivity option The iPad is available in both Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi + LTE variants, but the Pixel C doesn't offer any built-in cellular connectivity options. Keyboard support Unlike its sibling the iPad Pro, this iPad does not have any Smart Connectors for connecting to keyboard accessories, though it does support third-party Bluetooth keyboards. On the other hand, Google makes two optional snap-on keyboard options for the Pixel C, which retail for US$149 each. The advantage of a docking keyboard? It draws power from the tablet, and does not need to be charged individually. Active stylus support Neither of these options support active stylus input. Charging/data port The iPad uses Apple's Lightning connector, while the Pixel C has a more-universal USB Type C charging port. Processor We're not yet sure about the clock speeds for the A9 chip in the new iPad – we'll know better once the tablets start shipping and benchmarks become available. However, the two chips are shaping up to have very similar speeds. RAM The Pixel C likely has more RAM than the iPad, but to be fair, the two operating systems use RAM differently. Apple doesn't publish the amount of RAM in its mobile devices, but chances are, this one has the same 2 GB amount as its other 9.7-inch tablets. We'll know for sure once device tear downs become available. Storage The new iPad is available with either 32 GB or 128 GB of built-in storage. When the Pixel C was first introduced, it came in 32 GB and 64 GB options, but these days, the 32 GB option has vanished from the Google Store and is hard to come by on the US market. MicroSD Neither tablet accommodates expandable storage via microSD. Camera megapixels Photography isn't usually a selling point for tablets, but regardless, these two are neck-and-neck in terms of camera resolution. The Pixel C packs in more pixels in the front-facing camera for a slight advantage in the selfie and Skype department. Battery Battery size and life expectancy are also on par with one another. Both makers offer an "up to 10 hours" estimate, though of course actual performance varies with how the device is being used. Software Naturally, the iPad runs the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS 10. The Pixel C was released with Android Marshmallow but has since received the Android Nougat update. As a Google-branded device, it should be one of the first in line for software updates in the near future. Multitasking Both operating systems allow a certain degree of multitasking, by allowing the user to view/use more than one app at a time. Release In the US, the iPad is expected to start shipping and hitting shelves at the end of this week. The Pixel C made its first appearance almost a year and a half ago. Starting price The entry-level iPad is nearly half the price of a brand new Pixel C. Originally, the 32 GB Pixel C was being offered for $499, but since it's no longer readily available, we're referring only to the price for the 64 GB size. Stay tuned for a full-length review of the latest iPad (that's just "iPad", no suffixes), which has replaced the iPad Air 2 in Apple's tablet lineup. For an incrementally better equipped (but more expensive) Apple tablet, you could also consider the 9.7-inch iPad Pro.

Apple on Monday released security updates for multiple products, and in the process also reconfigured iOS to address a pop-up issue that scammers were abusing to lock users out of their Safari mobile browsers in an attempt to extort money. According to mobile security company Lookout, its research team reported the pop-up problem last month, after discovering that the Safari browser executed JavaScript-based pop-up dialogs on iOS devices in such a way that could render a device inoperable, if maliciously exploited.  Indeed, online scammers have been using this exploit to trick users into thinking law enforcement agencies such as Interpol have locked their devices due to supposedly illicit activity. Victims receive a threatening message purportedly from these agencies demanding that they pay a fine in the form of an iTunes gift card code sent via SMS, Lookout explained in a company blog post. In at least one published example, a message warned that failure to comply would result in the delivery of digital evidence to London's Metropolitan Police. Lookout first learned of the scam after a client complained of visiting a website and subsequently receiving a ransom message from pay-police[.]com, along with an overlaid "Cannot Open Page" pop-up from Safari. Clicking "OK" on the dialog did nothing other than to present the same prompt over and over in a loop. In its blog post, the security company explained that the group behind this campaign "purchased a large number of domains that try to catch users [who] are seeking controversial content on the Internet" such as pornography or music downloads. Upon visitation, these websites download the malicious JavaScript code that launches the unceasing pop-ups and fools victims into thinking they've been caught committing a illegal act. "Users should be aware of these types of tactics that are designed to scare the user into making a payment they normally would not," said Andrew Blaich, security researcher at Lookout, in an email interview with SC Media. "The user is never in any real harm with regards to this attack, as no data is being stolen and the device is not being broken into."  Apple closed the attack vector, Lookout noted, by updating iOS so that Safari pop-up dialogs are now limited to individual tabs, rather than being able to take over the entire app. That way, if a pop-up loop has locked down one particular tab, the user can simply close it out and open a new one. Even before Apple's fix, scam victims could have avoided paying the ransom simply by clearing the Safari browser's cache. But this is not an obvious solution to all users. Because this was a software reconfiguration as opposed to a bug repair, Apple did not associate the fix with a CVE, nor did it list the fix among its software updates, according to Lookout. SC Media has reached out to Apple for comment. "A user that is informed of attacks like this can realize they have the power to make it go away if they think through the message and try resetting apps like their browser to see if the messaging continues," said Blaich. "The user should also be careful about the sites they visit on the Internet, as while this attack was relatively benign in nature, other attacks that look to break into the device could have much different results." Apple's latest batch of updates addressed the following products: macOS Server (three fixes); tvOS 10.2 (39 fixes); watchOS 3.2 (31 fixes); iOS 10.3 (65 fixes); macOS Sierra, El Capitan and Yosemite (65 fixes); Safari 10.1 (24 fixes); and iWork for Mac and ioS (one fix). Cisco's Talos division also released research addressing one of Apple's newly patched vulnerabilities. Officially designated CVE-2017-2485, the flaw was a use-after-free vulnerability in the X.509 certificate validation functionality of Apple macOS and iOS, which, if exploited, could have resulted in remote code execution.  "This vulnerability manifests due to improper handling of X.509v3 certificate extensions fields," the company explained in a Monday blog post. A specially crafted X.509 certificate delivered via malicious files, websites or mail servers "could trigger this vulnerability and potentially result in remote code execution on the affected system," the post continued. Talos and Apple specifically credited Talos researcher Aleksandar Nikolic with discovering the bug. - Users should be aware of these types of tactics that are designed to scare the user into making a payment they normally would not. The user is never in any real harm with regards to this attack as no data is being stolen and the device is not being broken into. A user that is informed of attacks like this can realize they have the power to make it go away if they think through the message and try reseting apps like their browser to see if the messaging continues.

After all, discovering that another human doesn't care about you (or can't stand you, dependent on your level of douchiness) isn't generally considered good news. But this does little to sate the burning curiosity about who has deleted you, why they've deleted you, and what exactly they think you did wrong. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Clearly this is madness as most un-frienders have long-since dropped off your social radar, but the undiscovered well of human crazy runs deep, and social media is a bucket attached to an infinite stretch of rope. Which brings us to the matter at hand: it's now possible to discover who has removed you as a friend. Masochists rejoice! ©  Who Deleted Me Who Deleted Me takes snapshots of your friends list over time. By comparing the before and after lists, it calculates who has dropped you like a stone-cold villain. This means that Who Deleted Me won't be able to pick up unfriending activity dating before its first scan. So don't go in expecting a list of everyone who's ever removed you.

By Rob Verger posted Mar 28th, 2017 at 5:25pm Apple Apple recently released a Poduct(RED) version of the iPhone 7 series to match the rest of its charity-driven product line. If you update your iPhone to iOS 10.3 today, you'll likely find that you have an extra gigabyte or more of free storage space available on the phone's internal memory. For that, you can thank Apple's new file system, called APFS, which replaces the Hierarchical File System that has been used in one form or another for three decades. The Apple File System (APFS for short) was originally announced at Apple’s 2016 Worldwide Developer’s Conference and will eventually spread across all of Apple’s product lines, from the high-end MacBook Pro all the way down to the Apple Watch, later this year. In addition to improved storage efficiency, APFS is also made with increased ability to maximize advantages offered by solid state media. More importantly, the file system was engineered with modern security in mind. "It's been built with encryption as a primary feature, from the very beginning, as we brought this idea to fruition," Eric Tamura, a manager focusing on file systems at Apple, said at Apple’s WWDC event last summer. The previous, decades-old system, is called HFS+. That old system “was designed in an era where floppies and hard drives where state of the art,” Tamura said. “Its original design is almost 30 years old at this point. And the world has changed since then.” Rather than focusing on the portability of large individual files, the emphasis is placed on quickly reading and writing smaller bits of data, which is required for the operation of smart devices. “We wanted something that was designed and tuned specifically for Apple products,” he added. Stan Horaczek Tech editor Stan Horaczek saw a tangible jump in available space on his 128 GB iPhone 7 Plus after the update. The Verge points out that the added storage has been noticed since the update was in beta form, and has carried over into the final release. In addition to the new Apple File System, iOS 10.3 also includes other new features, like the ability to use the Find My iPhone app to locate an AirPod headphone that has gone missing. The CarPlay system also gets some updates, including some streamlining of the user interface during popular functions. To update your iPhone or iPad, open the Settings app, then click General, then Software Update; you can check the local storage you have on your device also under that General menu, by either clicking on About or, further down, Storage & iCloud Usage.

Get that speculative nonsense out of your head. Apple just launched its latest iOS update, 10.3, and quietly added a few features that should make your current iPhone (or iPad) feel like it's moving a bit faster. Alongside a slew of Siri tweaks and AirPods support, iOS 10.3 marks Apple's move to a new Apple File System. According to Business Insider's Kif Leswing, this changes how the device stores and locates data. With the upgrade from HFS+, the new Apple File System is expected to help iPhones and iPads run "more smoothly going forward."

For at least one early adopter, non-old phones equipped with the new update now feel "slightly more responsive" than before. The Verge's Tom Warren added that users shouldn't expect to notice an increase in speed immediately, but apps requiring high amounts of data writing may seem faster right out of the gate. Here are a few more tweaks and additions to look out for in the latest iOS update: Support has been added for searching "parked car" in Maps, presumably for those moments in which one's parked automobile is MIA. You can now delete unwanted Calendar invites and report them for what they really are: junk. Find your AirPods using the Find My iPhone feature. A sound can be played on one or both AirPods while you're searching aimlessly. Siri has also been equipped with additional support for ride-scheduling apps, checking the gas level in your car, and checking the status of bills paid using payment apps. CarPlay has been boosted with status bar shortcuts and a sleek Apple Music Now Playing screen.

Apple might have impressed us with its new black and jet black finishes on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, but should it offer even more color and customization options in the future? The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac It’s not much of a stretch to imagine despite Apple traditionally sticking to just a small handful or less of iPhone colors over the years. It of course did offer a few options with the brightly coloured iPhone 5c, but that approach didn’t last or carry-over to subsequent models. It has offered a lot more colors on its various iPod models over the years which could soon be on the way out. And other smartphone manufacturers have certainly offered much more than Apple in terms of not just color options but customizations, with some Android makers offering devices that customers can customize before they receive them. But perhaps the most notable reason to believe Apple could offer more customization with a future iPhone is due to its step into fashion with the Apple Watch. Everything changed with that device, with Apple offering a number of models that were essentially the same device but with higher-end materials and higher-end price tags. Apple has never really done that with the iPhone for a flagship release, but its approach with Apple Watch makes it a lot easier to imagine. Apple has already started matching its iPhone 7 case color releases to its Apple Watch bands with the latest update unveiled last week, so it wouldn’t be too much of shock if the iPhone continues picking up a thing or two from the more fashion oriented approach it has been taking with Apple Watch. But do you think Apple should offer more color and customization options for iPhone? And would you be willing to pay more for a premium iPhone with higher-end materials?

The app sent iPhone users alerts when a United States drone strike led to death. Apple’s reasoning at the time was that the app contained “content that many users would find objectionable.” Fast forward to this week and Metadata+ is again in the news for being approved and removed, all in the span of less than 12 hours… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case In a post on The Intercept, Metadata+ creator and developer Josh Begley explained the situation, noting that the app has been rejected 12 times since 2014. At long last, however, the app was approved this morning and made available on the App Store for everyone to download. Begley was pleased with the decision, saying that people should be aware the “drone war.” Begley explained that over recent years, he has occasionally resubmitted the app to see if Apple might change its mind. Today, it seemingly had reversed its viewpoint. Over the years, I would occasionally resubmit the app, changing its name from Drones+ to Metadata+. I was curious to see if Apple might change its mind. The app didn’t include graphic images or video of any kind — it simply aggregated news about covert war. Begley announced that his app was available from the App Store this morning at around 9AM ET. By 2:30PM ET, however, Apple had removed the app. At this point, Begley has not offered detail as to why Apple removed the app this time, but it likely centers around the same objectionable content reasoning that the company has cited in the past. Begley has a counter argument to that: If anything about the app is “excessively objectionable or crude,” perhaps it’s the airstrikes themselves. When the app was first approved and removed in 2015, we explained how it was unlikely that Apple would reverse its decision because it was the entire functionality of the app that was the center of contempt. What likely happened here is that Metadata+ slipped through the cracks of Apple’s App Store review team this morning and thus was briefly made available. Once higher-ups at the company, however, became aware of the app’s newfound status, it was quickly removed. What are your thoughts on this? Is Metadata+ an app that should be allowed on the App Store or is Apple right with its “objectionable and crude” argument? Let us know down in the comments.

[Photo: courtesy of Apple] By Mark Sullivan03.28.17 | 6:00 pm When Apple launches its much-anticipated foray into augmented reality, it is likely to start with a version that works on your phone, not on a dedicated headset or pair of glasses, analysts say. Though somewhat underwhelming, it’s a necessary first step for a technology that could eventually transform personal computing. AR technology is meant to superimpose digital imagery over the user’s view of the world through a smartphone camera or a dedicated pair of glasses. Apple now has reportedly “hundreds” of engineers working on the company’s efforts to build an AR wearable. Citing anonymous sources, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman highlighted some key members of the team, including its leader, Mike Rockwell, an ex-Dolby Labs executive. Actually, Apple has been working on AR for more than a year, and the initiative has become harder to keep secret as the AR group has grown. The face-mounted glasses seem more in line with Apple CEO Tim Cook’s statements about the technology. Cook visited AR headset maker Magic Leap in Florida and is said to be excited about the potential of AR. While the phone-based AR may not be as captivating as the head-mounted AR, there is good reason to start there and release some kind of headset later on. “Apple’s strategy may be to release a technology that gets people used to the idea, and then release a headset in a couple of years,” says Technalysis Research chief analyst Bob O’Donnell. “It’s going to be a 3D depth camera something like Google’s Tango . . .” O’Donnell says. Apple has been working with Lumentum (formed when JDS Uniphase split in 2014) on 3D-sensing technology that will be in a new high-end iPhone coming later this year, ]as previously reported by Fast Company. The main reason to start with the phone is that the technology needed for a headset simply is not available yet, O’Donnell says. “It’s not clear now that the core technology is available for anyone—the display, the compute engine, as well as the battery,” O’Donnell says. If Apple were going to release an AR headset anytime soon, the component parts would already be showing up at the companies that supply the components, he says. Not only would the technology need to be available, but it would have to be well enough established so that manufacturing facilities would be capable of pumping out the millions of components required by Apple. Creative Strategies president and long-time Apple analyst Tim Bajarin also believes Apple AR will start in the phone: “Their entry into AR will most likely be through the iPhone in terms of the way they use their dual cameras and AI to deliver AR functionality to the iPhone via the iOS platform.” Both analysts also say that Apple is uniquely positioned for AR because of its ability to eventually design an AR headset or glasses that people will actually feel like wearing, coupled with its ability to create unique software experiences to go with the device. “I see them being able to add virtual characters into live scenes that add images, animation, and data to all types of settings to deliver an enhanced AR experience,” Bajarin says. Apple always builds ecosystems around key products, and the success of its AI offering may depend on the development of cool AR content by third-party developers. Bajarin believes that Apple will likely issue a software development kit (SDK) to developers to help them develop new AR experiences for the iPhone. “That will help them [Apple] differentiate themselves from the competition and grow their market for iPhones,” Bajarin says. And Apple’s own apps will have to work beautifully in AR. “To be successful in AR, there is the hardware piece, but you have to do other stuff too: from maps to social to payments,” Loup Ventures partner Gene Munster told Bloomberg. “Apple is one of the only companies that will be able to pull it off.” The final question about AR is whether consumers want it, know how to use it, or even know what it is. Apple typically jumps into a product category after there’s already an established market for the technology. “While an established market certainly isn’t a requirement for Apple to get involved in a particular space, the lack of competitors introduces a different kind of risk,” says Above Avalon analyst Neil Cybart. “There is a benefit to waiting in the wings and coming out with a product that addresses shortcomings found with existing products.” Fast Company Daily Newsletter: Get our best stories delivered to your inbox.Sign Up I'd also like to receive special Fast Company offers Related Stories Technology Bluetooth Trackers And The Race To Help You Find Your Stuff Technology Chris Berka’s Lifelong Quest To Make Consciousness Visible Technology How Restaurants Use Big Data To Learn More About Their Customers Video The Lesson Your Startup Needs To Learn From Thinx’s PR Nightmare Trump's Wall Is Also Dividing The Architecture Community This Plane Could Fly To Europe In Under 4 Hours--And Other Stories You Might've Missed Americans Are Becoming Increasingly Unhappy, According To The Global Happiness Report How Matt Damon—And A Bunch of Balloons—Are Raising Awareness for World Water Day What John Legend Learned From Working in Consulting Hollywood Can't Win When It Comes To Race Your Next iPhone Can Now Come In Red Former Thinx CEO Miki Agrawal Revealed Her Questionable Office Behavior Last Summer Former Thinx CEO Miki Agrawal On Why Thinx Didn't Offer Period Leave How Sweetgreen Stays Competitive In A Crowded Space Of Dining Options A Microsoft Engineer Discusses Why Diversity In Tech Will Make Better Products Now You Can Literally See The Differences Between Apple And Google These Married Chefs Prove Working With Your Spouse Isn't Always A Terrible Idea Why One CEO Says It’s A Company’s Responsibility To Speak Out Politically Buzz Aldrin Wants To Take You To Mars--And Other Stories You Might've Missed Beauty And The Beast Has Had Some Wonderful (And Weird) Adaptations How This Company Could Allow You To See The World--While Juicing Why This CEO Thinks Millennials Are Socially-Conscious And Good For Businesses These AI-Powered Robot Spiders Utilize Your iPhone's Incredible Processor This New Technology Uses Your Phone To Track Your Heart Health You’ll Never Guess What The Most-Shared Story Was On Facebook In February Wolfgang Puck Impressed His First Boss—And Built A Career From It President Donald Trump In A Minute How One Modeling Agency Is Diversifying The Runway You Can Land A Drone On This Vehicle--And Other Stories You Might've Missed Why This Psychedelic Drug Is Drawing Entrepreneurs To Peru How Diversifying Barbie's Look Dramatically Increased Sales Why This Bento Box Of Clothing May Be A Woman's Answer To Getting Dressed For Work These Companies Are Making Political Statements—But Staying True to Their Customers more stories Apple’s Augmented Reality Debut Will Look More Like “Pokémon” Than Magic Leap It Only Took 5,000 Years, But The Flip-Flop Is Finally Getting Smarter Tom Colicchio Wants To Transform How We Think About Food Policy How Fake Fixes To Fake News Could Lead To Real Problems Ideas Ideas Large-Scale Energy Storage Is The (Virtual) Power Plant Of The Future Ideas Resistbot Turns Your Angry Trump Texts Into Faxes To Congress Ideas Can Red Bull Make Social Entrepreneurship An Extreme Sport?

Still, there are always those looking to advance their own success and that is why Wall Street believes Apple could very well look into possibly buying Disney. While Disney is one of the largest and most profitable companies in the world, there are a few others who can hold their on in their company. One of those companies is Apple who sports cash assets of more than $200 billion and investors are always curious as to what they may do with that excess money. Well, once again, the rumors of Apple looking into buying The Walt Disney Company are coming about and they seems stronger than ever. [Image by Disney] Business Insider states that the belief going around right now is that Apple is looking to buy Disney and RBC analyst Steven Cahill sees it as a possibility. “Bulls think it portends well for a swan song exit via a sale to a giant like AAPL.” As things currently stand, Disney has no less than two dozen huge projects in the works and those are spread across their theme parks and the world of entertainment. In just two short months, Pandora – The World of Avatar will open as a brand new land at Disney’s Animal Kingdom and the hype is at an all-time high. In 2019, Star Wars-themed lands will be opening at Disney’s Hollywood Studios in Walt Disney World and at Disneyland Park in California. Disney will also be opening Toy Story Land at Hollywood Studios in the coming years and add two new ships to its Disney Cruise Line fleet in 2021 and 2023. One of the biggest things that is making Disney so appealing to an investor such as Apple is content and they know that Disney does it well. In 2016 alone, Disney was responsible for half of the top 10 grossing films: Finding Dory Zootopia Star Wars: Rogue One The Jungle Book Captain America: Civil War – Highest grossing film of 2016 The live-action version of Beauty and the Beast has already earned more than $540 million worldwide in one week, according to Box Office Mojo. With many more live remakes of Disney animated classics, Pixar, new animated films, the Star Wars galaxy, and the ever-growing Marvel Cinematic Universe, there is no end to the huge amounts of money that the company will make in theater [Image by Marvel] Now, the idea of Apple buying Disney isn’t necessarily new as The Washington Post reported that the deal was “frighteningly obvious” to happen back in 2014. Of course, nothing has happened as of yet, but the rumors simply won’t go away about this merger or takeover, of sorts. While a deal of this immense size may not happen any year soon, it does seem to be one that keeps coming back around. It may not even happen while current Walt Disney chairman and CEO Bob Iger is still in his position even though he did just extend his deal to stay in his current position until 2019, per Fortune. There are a number of things that would have to happen and take place in order for Apple to buy Disney, but it isn’t fundamentally out of the question. Liberty Media Chairman John Malone believes that global companies such as Apple and Disney would be a perfect fit if Disney could just get rid of the domestic-based ESPN. For years now, the idea of Apple actually buying Disney has been rumored and it is something that a lot of people say could never possibly happen. If that truly is the case, though, why do the rumors keep coming up every few months? As Disney continues to broaden its wide span with new additions to Walt Disney World and Disneyland, more Marvel movies, the sports world, and more, it seems only reasonable that a multi-hundred billion giant such as Apple would want to acquire them.

The flaw, fixed in Monday's iOS 10.3 update, had been reported to Apple a month ago by researchers at San Francisco-based mobile security firm Lookout. "One of our users alerted us to this campaign, and said he had lost control of Safari on his iPhone," Andrew Blaich, a Lookout security researcher, said in a Tuesday interview. "He said, 'I can't use my browser anymore.'" The criminal campaign, Blaich and two colleagues reported in a Monday post to Lookout's blog, exploited a bug in how Safari displayed JavaScript pop-ups. When the browser reached a malicious site implanted with the attack code, the browser went into an endless loop of dialogs that refused to close no matter who many times "OK" was tapped. The result: Safari was unusable. At the same time, the attack showed a message, purportedly from a law enforcement agency, demanding payment to unlock the browser for, in one instance at least, simply steering to a URL that suggested the site's content was pornographic. Payment was to be made by texting a ÂŁ100 ($125) iTunes gift card code to a designated number. Blaich stressed that the attack was as much scam as scare: To regain control of Safari, all one had to do was head to Settings, tap Safari, then Clear History and Website Data. "This was a scareware attack, where [the attackers] were trying to get people to not think and just pay," said Blaich. Scareware is a label applied to phony security software that claims a computer is heavily infected with malware. Such software nags users with pervasive pop-ups and fake alerts until they fork over the "registration" fee, sometimes in the hundreds of dollars. Ransomware has largely replaced scareware as the go-to shakedown; the former compromises a computer, encrypts some or all the contents of the local storage, then promises to hand over an encryption key in return for a large payment. What Lookout found was definitely not a ransomware attack against iOS. "The device was never compromised nor was its data exposed to the hackers," Blaich said. "You would have to compromise the device and encrypt the data [to conduct a ransomware attack]. The app sandbox prevented this from happening." In iOS 10.3, Apple re-engineered Safari so that it handles JavaScript pop-ups on a per-tab basis. iOS 10.3 also patched 84 security vulnerabilities. "[The hackers] hoped you would just react, want to cover it up, then pay and move on," Blaich said. Lookout Scammers hobbled Safari with an endless loop of pop-ups, then tried to scare iPhone users into paying $125.

Here’s all the new stuff in Apple’s latest security document Posted 9 hours ago by Kate Conger (@kateconger) 0 SHARES Next Story Tech will lead to new sub-prime crunch Hey guess what? Apple has a new security whitepaper! Apple only releases these things once every few years, and they represent the public’s only window into how iPhones and other Apple products secure the massive amounts of data entrusted to them. Even though Apple hasn’t released a security whitepaper since September 2015 (or since iOS 9, if you prefer to measure time in software updates), there’s not much earth-shattering new information in the latest edition, which covers iOS 10. This is probably a good sign for users — the fact that Apple isn’t making many changes to the basic security structure of the iPhone likely means that Apple hasn’t uncovered any major flaws in its product. The company puts significant resources into testing its own security and invites outside researchers to do the same through its bug bounty program. But Apple has rolled out plenty of new features and products in the last few years, and the security whitepaper reflects that. Here are some of the biggest new developments: Touch ID opened to developers When Apple first debuted Touch ID, it used customers’ fingerprints solely for unlocking iPhones and approving purchases in Apple-controlled environments like iTunes and iBooks. But starting in iOS 9, Apple opened up Touch ID to support biometric-approved logins for third-party app developers. The whitepaper gives us a small update on the encryption key generation and storage that makes this possible: With iOS 9 or later, developers can: • Generate and use ECC keys inside Secure Enclave. These keys can be protected by Touch ID. Operations with these keys are always done inside Secure Enclave after Secure Enclave authorizes the use. Apps can access these keys using Keychain through SecKey. SecKeys are just references to the Secure Enclave keys and the keys never leave Secure Enclave. By generating the codes on a one-time basis, Apple is able to offer access to Touch ID confirmations without re-using keys that could get stolen or leaked. This is similar in philosophy to the way that Apple Pay generates one-time transaction codes without transmitting your actual credit card number. HomeKit won’t let your smart house spy on you In the dystopian future our current reality, your smart TV might spy on you or let someone else spy on you. Or your digital assistant might testify against you. Apple wants to avoid these scenarios with Apple TV and the rest of the HomeKit-enabled devices that make up its smart home offerings. Apple offered details about how HomeKit securely communicates with a user’s iPhone and the devices in his house while keeping his information private, even from Apple, in its last whitepaper, but there’s one new tidbit about how it secures Apple TVs. Apple makes an effort to keep hackers away from your Apple TV by requiring two-factor authentication on iCloud accounts in order to provision the TVs: The process to provision Apple TV for use with HomeKit is performed automatically when the user signs in to iCloud. The iCloud account needs to have two-factor authentication enabled. Apple TV and the owner’s device exchange temporary Ed25519 public keys over iCloud. When the owner’s device and Apple TV are on the same local network, the temporary keys are used to secure a connection over the local network using Station-to-Station protocol and per-session keys. This process uses authentication and encryption that is the same as that used between an iOS device and a HomeKit accessory. Over this secure local connection, the owner’s device transfers the user’s Ed25519 public-private key pairs to Apple TV. These keys are then used to secure the communication between Apple TV and the HomeKit accessories and also between Apple TV and other iOS devices that are part of the HomeKit home. Siri’s still clunky with third-party apps (but it’s for your own good) After more than seven years on the market, Siri is pretty good at answering your questions — as long as those answers are contained within Apple apps. Siri can tell you the weather or schedule reminders, but she runs into trouble if you ask her to Venmo some cash to a family member. The security whitepaper explains why: Apple is trying to follow the privacy rules users set in place for apps and not violate them with Siri requests: Although Siri has access to iOS contacts and the device’s current location, Siri checks the permission to access iOS-protected user data of the app containing the Extension to see if the app has access before providing that information to it. Siri passes only the relevant fragment of the original user query text to the extension. For example, if the app doesn’t have access to iOS contacts, Siri won’t resolve a relationship in a user request such as “Pay my mother $10 using PaymentApp.” In this case, the Extension’s app would only see “mother” through the raw utterance fragment being passed to it. However, if the app does have iOS contacts access, it would receive the iOS Contact information for the user’s mother. New possibilities (and privacy) for live streaming iOS 10 expands a developer tool called ReplayKit, which makes it possible to live stream or record video from the iPhone’s screen. Naturally, Apple’s added privacy notifications to let customers know when their screens are being recorded and make sure they consent to the recording. Originally impossible, recording and playback of iOS screens had been a popular feature available to jailbroken iPhones before it was added to iOS. Unsurprisingly, Apple has applied a logical but highly restricted scope to how the feature can be accessed. Apple also ensures that users don’t lose control of their recordings: “The movie file is written to a directory that’s only accessible to ReplayKit’s subsystems and is never accessible to any apps. This prevents recordings being used by third parties without the user’s consent,” the paper explains. Start a payment on the computer, finish on your phone Apple Pay is available for web transactions in iOS 10 and most of the security architecture is what you’d expect for a web-based payments system. Apple requires websites to register and have their domain verified by Apple, and sites need to serve their content over an encrypted HTTPS connection. But there is one cool feature that’s new here — you can start a transaction on your laptop and finish it with your iPhone or Apple Watch. This transaction hand-off requires some interesting security wrangling that allows your credit card information to remain securely on your phone or watch: In the case of Mac to iPhone or Apple Watch handoff, Apple Pay uses the end-to-end encrypted IDS protocol to transmit payment related information between the user’s Mac and the authorizing device. IDS uses the user’s device keys to perform encryption so no other device can decrypt this information, and the keys aren’t available to Apple. Device discovery for Apple Pay handoff contains the type and unique identifier of the user’s credit cards along with some metadata. The device-specific account number of the user’s card isn’t shared and it continues to remain stored securely on the user’s iPhone or Apple Watch. Apple also securely transfers the user’s recently used contact, shipping, and billing addresses over iCloud Keychain. About that bug bounty… Apple was a bit slow to adopt a bug bounty, finally introducing one last year. The program, which offers financial rewards to researchers who find security flaws in Apple software or hardware, was invitation-only at first, but Apple said it would slowly expand the list of invitees. The bounty program gets a nod in the new whitepaper, which notes that hackers can participate even if they haven’t received an invite. “In order to be eligible for an Apple Security Bounty, researchers are required to provide a clear report and working proof of concept. The vulnerability must affect the latest shipping iOS and where relevant the latest hardware. The exact payment amount will be determined after review by Apple,” the paper explains. There are a few other tweaks (helpfully highlighted on GitHub), but that’s everything major in this update.

Uber’s first report on employee diversity shows low numbers for women, especially in technology positions. Uber’s report doesn’t count drivers as employees. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) NEW YORK (AP) — Uber's first report on employee diversity shows low numbers for women, especially in technical positions. In that regard, the company is similar to other Silicon Valley giants such as Google, Facebook and Apple. But Uber's report comes as pressure mounts on the company in light of sexual harassment claims by a former employee, the antics of its embattled CEO Travis Kalanick and ongoing criticisms of a boorish "brogrammer" culture. Management defections include that of the company's president, Jeff Jones, after just six months on the job. Thirty-six percent of the company's worldwide employees are women, according to the report , which does not count drivers as employees. Google, in comparison, has 31 percent women and Apple, 32 percent. When it comes to technology jobs such as engineering, only 15 percent are women at Uber. At Google, it's 19 percent and Apple, 23 percent. As with other tech companies , Uber is making some progress in diversifying its work force. The new hires at the company show a higher percentage of women — 41 percent — as well as more underrepresented minorities. In the U.S., the largest ethnic group at Uber is white and the second largest is Asian. The report also shows that nearly 9 percent of the company's U.S. employees are black and almost 6 percent are Hispanic. At Google, a much larger company, the numbers are 2 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Uber also says 15 percent of its U.S. employees hold work visas, and they hail from 71 countries. Other technology companies have not been disclosing this information, but it's possible that they will follow Uber's steps — especially as the industry continues to clash heads with President Donald Trump's administration over immigration issues. Uber has about 12,000 employees worldwide, about half in the U.S. The San Francisco company has hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to lead an investigation into the sexual harassment charges leveled by the former engineer, Susan Fowler. The company plans to release the findings next month. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

Digital Trends Home > DT Daily > Elon Musk invests in Neuralink startup… Elon Musk invests in Neuralink startup that’s looking to mind-meld human brains, computers, and AI By Bill Roberson — March 28, 2017 1:38 PM Share Please enable Javascript to watch this video Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Samsung sets its sights on a new Galaxy Tomorrow’s the big day for Samsung as they will officially take the wraps of its new halo phone, the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus. The phone is expected to be jam-packed with tech goodness, of course, but the real story here is how far it will go to shore up Samsung’s tarnished reputation following the Galaxy Note 7 “exploding phone” disaster. Samsung is reportedly making the phone with three different battery suppliers, and they’ve been highlighting their 8-step battery safety check program for months now. Suffice to say, if any Galaxy S8 phones go pop, it’ll be a disaster that makes the Note 7 fiasco look like a minor stumble. But beyond battery concerns, we’re looking forward to seeing the new S8 in action, and we’ll have a full wrap up after Samsung’s big introduction party tomorrow. Apple updates iPhone files for the future One the Apple side of things, Cupertino dropped a big update for iPhones and other iOS devices yesterday. Don’t expect to see big changes right up front, the update is fairly lite on user things, but heavy on the back end. Give yourself some time for the update to execute – and definitely back up your phone or iPad first – as Apple moves away from the 30-year-old HFS file system in the phone and implements “APFS,” a more future-friendly file organization system. APFS is faster, more efficient, and plays better with solid state drives and encryption schemes, and Apple says users should see speed improvements and better use of memory – as in it uses less of it – once 10.3 is installed. We’ve got a full breakdown of everything 10.3 brings to the iOS party, so hit this link for all the details. The mind boggles at Elon’s latest mind-boggler Just when you think Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk can’t top his last flight of fancy, out pops another one. Hyperloops and tunneling under cities to beat traffic? That’s so 2016. Now, Musk says what humanity needs is a big firmware upgrade, and he’s formed the Neuralink company to make it happen. OK, truth be told, Musk has talked about this idea in the past, saying that once AI really gets rolling, we’re gonna need to adapt to it. How so? Musk envisions a literal personal neural net, a device he once called a “neural lace,” which will interface with our brains to speed up thought processes by facilitating a mind meld between our pea brains and computers, and eventually, a hopefully friendly AI. Now he’s dropping millions on Neuralink in an effort to jumpstart the project, and the Wall Street Journal says the company has been working in stealth mode since last July. Harnessing, controlling and dealing with the human brainwaves is nothing new, but expressly starting a company to design a device to link brains to computers? That’s definitely some evil genius or Tony Stark action. Read more about Musk’s latest new company and let us know in comments if you’d be willing to lace up your brain to a computer or AI. Is it the beginning of the end of humanity – or how humanity and tech should move forward together?

Lurking beneath the surface of iOS 10.3, however, are a number of important security updates worth highlighting. iOS has always been a rather robust OS, but as the recent CIA leak from Wikileaks demonstrates, there are always hackers and government agencies dead set on unearthing and exploiting iOS security holes. Don't Miss: Hidden changes in iOS 10.3 will give your iPhone a speed boost As a prime example, iOS 10.3 fixes a Safari security vulnerability that allowed hackers to prevent affected users from browsing the web (via an endless stream of pop-ups) without ponying up some cash in the form of an iTunes gift card code. Lookout, the security firm which first discovered the attack a few weeks ago, writes of the patch: Lookout found this attack in the wild last month, along with several related websites used in the campaign, discovered the root cause, and shared the details with Apple. As part of the iOS 10.3 patch released today, Apple closed the attack vector by changing how Mobile Safari handles website pop-up dialogs, making them per-tab rather than taking over the entire app. All told, iOS 10.3 introduces hundreds of security fixes, a tally which makes iOS 10.3 an update you’d be well advised to download sooner rather than later. While some of the fixes are rather obscure, a good number of them address exploits that allow for arbitrary code execution with root privileges. A full list of Apple’s numerous security fixes in iOS 10.3 can be viewed over here.

Apple Outs First Betas of iOS 10.3.2, macOS 10.12.5, watchOS 3.2.2 & tvOS 10.2.1 GO Available now only to registered developers Mar 28, 2017 21:01 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Just one day after announcing the final versions of the iOS 10.3, macOS 10.12.4 Sierra, tvOS 10.2 and watchOS 3.2 operating systems, Apple seeded today the first Betas of iOS 10.3.2, macOS 10.12.5, watchOS 3.2.2, and tvOS 10.2.1. Tagged as builds 14F5065b for iOS 10.3.2 Beta, 16F43c for macOS 10.12.5 Sierra Beta, 14V5465b for watchOS 3.2.2 Beta, and 14W5563b for tvOS 10.2.1 Beta, they are available right now from your Apple Developer account if you are a registered application developer with an active paid account. Apple published release notes for all these new Beta versions, but, only for iOS 10.3.2 Beta, they noted the fact that the newly introduced SiriKit car commands should now work as expected. The rest show information about known issues and how to submit bug reports. Public Beta builds of iOS 10.3.2 and macOS 10.12.5 coming soon You should know the drill by know, when testing Beta versions of Apple's operating systems, access your Apple Developer account, download the builds for your registered devices, and update. As usual, please try to keep in mind that these are pre-release versions and are not recommended for use on production devices. At the moment of writing, Apple didn't release Public Beta builds of these first Betas of iOS 10.3.2 and macOS 10.12.5 Sierra, as they should usually be available about 24 hours after they're seeded to developers. We'll publish a new story or update this one when Apple published them. However, don't get too excited because iOS 10.3.2, macOS 10.12.5 Sierra, watchOS 3.2.2, and tvOS 10.2.1 are small maintenance updates that only address some of the most annoying bugs, as well as security issues. Now that iOS 10.3, macOS 10.12.4, watchOS 3.2, and tvOS 10.2 stable versions are out, we recommend using them instead of a Beta release. #iOS 10.3.2 Beta#macOS 10.12.5 Beta#watchOS 3.2.2 Beta#tvOS 10.2.1 Beta#Apple subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Outs watchOS 3.2 with Theater Mode and SiriKit for Apple Watch, tvOS 10.2 Apple Releases macOS 10.12.4 Sierra Update with Night Shift, Siri Improvements iOS 10.3 Officially Released with Find My AirPods, Apple File System, and More macOS 10.12.4 Sierra Release Imminent As Apple Seeds Beta 8, watchOS 3.2 Beta 7 The Best Antivirus Software for Windows 7 Phishing Campaign Promises Free In-Game Pets to World of Warcraft Players Mozilla Firefox 52.0.2 Released to Fix Linux Crash on Startup, Other Issues HTC U Flagship With Touch-Sensitive Frame to Launch in April Samsung Galaxy S8 User Guide Leaks Hours before Official Unveiling Microsoft Releases a New Windows 10 Build for Mobile but It’s Not What You Think The Best Antivirus Software for Windows 7 Oracle Linux 6.9 Released with Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel 4.1.12, TLS 1.2    iOS 10.3.2, macOS 10.12.5, watchOS 3.2.2, tvOS 10.2.1 Beta released new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Apple Doubles iPhone SE Storage, Keeps the Same Price more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Likely to Announce Dividend Increase Next Month Another dividend increase for Apple stock is pretty much already in the bag. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Mar 28, 2017 at 4:35PM Ever since Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) initiated its dividend in March 2012, the tech giant has increased its dividend every year in March or April. With the company recently adopting the practice of announcing its annual dividend increase alongside its fiscal-second quarter results, Apple should announce its dividend increase for 2017 next month. Here's a close look at Apple's dividend, as well as an overview of what investors should expect from this year's increase. Image source: Apple. Consistent increases Apple's dividend increases have been very consistent and predictable. Since Apple initiated its dividend in 2012, management has increased the company's dividend four times. Each time, Apple's annual dividend payments have increased by rates between about 8% and 15%, averaging compound annualized growth of about 11%. Apple's dividend increases more recently have been very close to the company's compound average during this period. In 2015, Apple increased its dividend by about 11%. In 2016, its dividend increased by 10%. And if this four-year track record isn't enough for investors to rest assured in management's commitment to dividend increases, management explicitly said in its 2014 press release about its capital return program that it "plans to increase its dividend on an annual basis." Further, Apple said in its update on its capital return program last year that the company would provide investors with an update on the overall program -- including dividends and share repurchases -- "on an annual basis."  Beyond management's promises for ongoing dividend increases, a quick glance at Apple's financials provides the best reason for the company's ability to consistently increase its dividend. Of Apple's annual earnings, the company is only paying out 26.5% of it in dividends, leaving plenty of room for increases. Similarly, of Apple's $52.5 million in free cash flow during the trailing 12 months, the company paid out just $12.3 billion in dividends. No wonder Apple easily increases its dividend by about 11% annually. And no wonder management isn't afraid to promise dividend increases on an annual basis. What to expect Expected to report results for its fiscal second-quarter of 2017 toward the end of April, Apple should announce a dividend increase next month. Image source: Getty Images. There's no reason Apple won't maintain a dividend increase near the 11% compound average growth rate for its dividends it has averaged in the past. But anything between its historical range for annual increases of 8% to 15% wouldn't be surprising. Investors should also look for Apple to share an update on its overall capital return program, which includes authorized cash to be used for dividends and share repurchases. In April 2016, Apple expanded its authorized amount for its capital return program by $50 billion to a total authorization of $250 billion, with an expiration date of March 2018. Given that Apple had just $49 billion left of this authorization going into its second fiscal quarter of 2017, management will likely either expand its existing capital return program or announce a new authorization.

Einhorn insists the move will boost shareholder value by as much as $38 billion. This sounds pretty similar to his proposal for Apple (AAPL) four years ago. Einhorn took his case to Apple shareholders early February 2013. He said a new perpetual preferred stock he coined 'iPrefs' could unlock billions of dollars of shareholder value. Here's his slide presentation. The iPhone maker said it would review the idea, but decided to opt for a 7-to-1 stock split in June 2014 instead. GM is rebuffing Einhorn's suggestion too. In a statement on GM's website, Chief Mary Barra said: The proposed structure creates an unacceptable level of risk for our company and its shareholders. Earlier on this blog, I suggested that GM may entertain the stock split proposal. I was wrong. This idea will likely be thrown away just like iPrefs.

The analyst, Steven Milunovich, predicted a scenario that would boost Apple’s stock by 40 percent by 2019, according to a Tuesday Business Insider report. "For Apple to hit $200, iPhone needs to continue to grow beyond F18, new product categories must be established, and buybacks should exceed $50bn per year, boosting the P/E to 17x," Milunovich wrote. Read: Apple Worker Conditions Detailed In Sustainability Report Milunovich said the $200 stock price could be achieved if everything goes well for Apple in the next few years. He also predicted a separate, most likely scenario in which the company's stock price would be $175 in two or three years.   Apple’s stock spiked from a day low of $140.62 to a high of $144.04, according to MarketWatch. That breaks Apple’s previous record-breaking close of $141.46, which happened on March 20. Tuesday’s record also surpassed the previous record intraday high of $142.80, reached on March 21, the day Apple introduced the all RED Special Edition iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, two new iPhone SE models and the new 9.7-inch iPad. Read: iPhone 8 Will Have Hybrid Lightning-USB port, Apple Watch 3 Could Have LTE: Analyst Apple still has more products to release this year, including the much-anticipated 10th anniversary iPhone expected this September. The iPhone 8 (iPhone X) is rumored to have numerous new features, including an embedded fingerprint sensor, OLED display screen and a 3D-sensing front camera. The 10th anniversary iPhone could cost up to $1,000, reports say. Apple is also expected to release two LCD display phones alongside the iPhone 8.

The Intercept’s Josh Begley wrote an upbeat column on the morning of March 28 exclaiming that after 12 failures, Apple had finally accepted his app, Metadata. At 2:32 that afternoon, however, the journalist and app maker’s aspirations were crushed by the gatekeeper that is Apple.  — Josh Begley (@joshbegley) March 28, 2017 ​In the past, Apple had justified the removal by saying the content was “excessively objectionable or crude,” even though, as Begley points out, the app does not show pictures or videos. It merely aggregates the articles about drones that have already been reported, then sends it to your phone as a push notification.  But for the app’s creator, “the story of this app is about more than a petty conflict with Apple.” Instead, Begley believes the big theme is what Americans can see about the nature of Washington’s “covert wars.” US President Donald Trump has moved to roll back restrictions on the use of drones, meaning news about drone strikes could be as relevant as ever, especially considering the ongoing armed conflicts in Yemen, Pakistan, Somalia. Over a two day period in March, the US conducted 30 airstrikes against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula forces in Yemen, Sputnik reported.  Apple did not immediately respond to an inquiry into the rationale behind the decision to take down Begley’s app.  ...

Einhorn And GM Activist investor David Einhorn unveiled a plan for General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) to split its stock into two classes, much like the plan he proposed for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) in 2013. Einhorn maintains he wants GM to create two different classes of common stock for GM, and separate dividends from the rest of the company’s earnings. Like Apple did four years ago, however, GM has rebuffed Einhorn’s plan. GM makes up around 10 percent of Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital portfolio and is one of its three largest holdings. Ford Invests, Trump Praises Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) announced it was investing $1.2 billion in three Michigan facilities. The move will likely save 3,700 jobs from moving to Mexico, and add 130 additional jobs. President Trump praised the announcement, solidifying his rhetoric of jobs "coming back to the U.S." Tencent's Tesla Stake Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) shares rose after revealing in a 13G filing that Chinese internet company Tencent Holdings (OTC: TCEHY) took a new 5 percent stake in the company. Tencent's stake includes around 8.2 million shares in Tesla, making them the fifth-highest shareholder In the company. "Elon Musk is the archetype for entrepreneurship, combining vision, ambition, and execution. Tesla is a global pioneer at the forefront of new technologies including electric vehicles, assisted driving, shared vehicles, digitizing real-world information, sustainable energy generation and scalable energy storage," Tencent said in a statement to Bloomberg.

How to Transfer Your Data From iOS or Android iPhone and iPad Android New iPhone? How to Transfer Your Data From iOS or Android Tim Brookes March 28, 2017 28-03-2017 6 minutes New iPhone? How to Transfer Your Data From iOS or Android Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon Whatsapp Email We carry a lot of digital baggage around with us, most of it on our smartphones. When it’s time to replace your old phone, you’ll need to migrate your contacts, pictures, and even software to the new device. Fortunately this is an easy, if time-consuming task. Moving from an old iPhone to a new iPhone is a breeze, but even moving from Android to iPhone is now considerably easier than it once was. The following advice is also applicable to the iPad and Android tablet devices. If you’re looking to switch from iOS to Android then we have a guide for that too Google Makes It Easy to Switch From iOS to Android Google Makes It Easy to Switch From iOS to Android Google just made it much easier to escape the clutches of the Apple ecosystem by switching to Android. And making it easier to switch between the two can only be a good thing for consumers. Read More . iPhone to iPhone: How It Works If you’re replacing an old Apple device with a new one, the process is painless. If you’re moving from Android, you can skip straight to the next section of this article. We’ll be using iTunes to create a backup of your existing device, which can then be copied straight to your new iPhone. By the time you’ve finished, your new phone will resemble your old phone — even if you’re opting for a larger (or smaller) model this time round. These instructions are identical whether you’re using a Mac or a Windows PC. If you are using Windows you’ll need to download and install iTunes if you haven’t already got it. 1. Back Up Your Old iPhone Simply plug your old iPhone into iTunes then click on the device icon in the top-left corner of the window. Choose the device from which you are migrating from the list. Click Backup on the Summary page that appears and follow the prompts. You may be asked whether or not you want to transfer purchases and back up your apps — both are a good idea. Make sure you have enough space to complete the backup by clicking Apple > About This Mac > Storage at the top of the screen. iTunes will tell you what size your device is, including the amount of free space you have available — simply subtract the free space from the total capacity to work out how much space you need. Lost your old phone? If you don’t have an old phone from which to backup, all may not be lost. First check whether you have any old device backups available by launching iTunes, then heading to Preferences > Devices. If you have any old iTunes backups, they will be listed here along with the date. You’ll need to decide whether or not the backup is too old to be useful to you. If you backed up to iCloud, you can choose to restore from iCloud in the next step. 2. Activate and Restore Your New iPhone Once your old device has been backed up, open up your new iPhone and connect it to your computer. Launch iTunes and you should be greeted with a welcome notice inviting you to get started with your new iPhone. When prompted, choose Restore Backup. You’ll be invited to choose a recent backup based on the device name and when the backup was created. Hit Restore and wait for your data to be transferred — it can take a while, so you might want to make a coffee or something. Note: If you are told that your device’s software is outdated, you’ll need to choose Set Up as New iPhone instead. Head to Settings > General > Software Update, update to the current new version of iOS, then erase your device again under Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings. Finally reconnect to iTunes and choose Restore Backup again. You can also choose Restore from iCloud Backup on the phone itself. If you haven’t got an local backups and you had iCloud backup enabled, this is your best bet (but it really can take a while). 3. Start Using Your New iPhone Once your backup has been restored your iPhone should look very familiar, though things might not be quite the way you left them. Some apps may still need to download, and you’ll need to provide login details for some accounts. This is especially true when it comes to services that use two-factor authentication, as app-specific passwords can only be used once. Got a new iphone but can't transfer my data from my old phone bc the new macbook only has type c ports zzz #firstworldproblems — Alyssa Jayne Vergara (@AlyssaJayneVee) March 19, 2017 You’re now ready to explore the new features of your device Everything You Need to Know About the iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus Everything You Need to Know About the iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus No headphone port, water and dust resistance, and Apple's best camera yet -- this is the iPhone 7. Read More . Android to iPhone: You Have Options If you’re switching to iOS from an Android device then it’s also quite easy to transfer your old smartphone’s data since Apple introduced an app that automates the process. Download the Move to iOS app from Google Play on your old Android device, then transfer your data wirelessly. Note: As this process could take a while, it’s worth ensuring both devices are connected to a power source while the transfer completes. 1. Prepare Your Android Device Download and install the Move to iOS app on your old Android device, it works with all phones and tablets running Android 4.0 or later. With it you can transfer contacts, message history, photos and videos, bookmarks, email accounts, calendars, and some free applications. Launch the Move to iOS app once installed to get the process started. 2. Choose Data to Transfer Turn on your new iPhone and follow the setup procedure until you get to the “Apps and Data” screen. If you accidentally passed this point, you’ll need to reset your phone to factory settings under Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings and start again. Choose the Move Data from Android option, and hit Continue until you see a 10-digit numerical code. Enter this code on your old Android device and hit Continue. At this point your iPhone will create an ad-hoc private wireless network, which your Android device will connect to in order to copy data. Once the two devices are connected, you’ll be asked to choose which data you want to transfer. Make your selection and hit Next and the transfer will begin. 3. Start Using Your New iPhone Once the transfer is complete you can finish setting up your iOS device by logging into your Apple ID, and verifying details like email passwords. Your data should be sorted into the correct apps like Photos, Contacts, and Messages.

Also Consider Using the Cloud If you’re moving from iPhone to iPhone, there’s no reason not to transfer data using the foolproof iTunes backup method. But if you’re coming from Android or elsewhere, you may not need to transfer everything. If you’re already using the cloud for much of your computing habits, you might be content to just “start afresh.” Maybe you’re already organizing your media with Google Photos?

The group claimed to have stolen a massive trove of iCloud credentials — the first over 300 million, then as many as 559 million — and unless they got $75,000 from the company before April 7th, they would start remotely wiping phones. Apple responded with a limited denial, stating that company servers hadn’t been breached, but allowing for the possibility that the credentials had been obtained some other way. As journalists began to confirm smaller sets of profiles released by the group, it gave Apple users plenty of reason to be nervous. Were we headed toward some kind of mass iCloud hack? Now, those threats are starting to unravel. Today, ZDNet examined the largest account drop yet — just under 70,000 login / password pairs — and found that 99.9 percent of the pairs matched accounts already included in a database of previous leaks. In short, the Turkish Crime Family was working from recycled public data. At the same time, Motherboard obtained documents showing the group using the data for a quick cash out, asking for $3,000 from the breach notification site Leakbase in exchange for bringing good publicity to the service. Got a tip for us? Use SecureDrop or Signal to securely send messages and files to The Verge without revealing your identity. It’s a confusing turn in an already confusing story, but the upshot should be reassuring to Apple users. If the database really is built from public credentials, it’s likely to be far smaller and far less damaging than the group initially promised. You should still change your iCloud password and set up two-factor verification — both of which are worthwhile regardless — but it’s looking less and less likely that you’ll need to. So far, the group seems to be more interested in securing a quick payout than causing havoc, which makes it far more likely that the April 7th deadline will come and go uneventfully. To understand why the Turkish Crime Family threat isn’t so frightening, we’ll need to get a little more technical. The group seems to have pulled off a credential-stuffing attack, taking login / password pairs from a public leak and testing them against separate services. Out of the 117 million logins in the 2012 LinkedIn breach, for instance, one might find tens of thousands of logins that also worked for iCloud, simply because users kept the same password for both services. Credential-stuffing attacks are a real and persistent threat, and one of the main reasons security writers tell you not to use the same passwords across multiple accounts. But it’s the kind of attack Apple and other companies deal with every day, either quietly forcing password resets or blocking suspicious logins. As a result, it rarely rises to the level of a crisis. Apple did not respond to a request for comment, but Shape Security CTO Shuman Ghosemajumder, who previously worked on click-fraud protections at Google, says iCloud is likely expecting the attack. “Apple is certainly watching for an attack like this, particularly because of the announced threat,” says Ghosemajumder. “They definitely see credential stuffing attacks on iCloud accounts every single day, just like all major online account systems do.” The Turkish Crime Family’s trick was making that credential-stuffing attack seem like something larger and more threatening. By claiming hundreds of millions of accounts and threatening attacks on a specific zero-hour, the old credentials suddenly seemed like an imminent threat — worth paying attention to, and maybe even worth paying for. But as more details came out, that case got weaker and weaker. It’s still hard to say for sure what will happen on April 7th — and again, entirely worth resetting your passwords — but the chances of a hacking apocalypse are looking slimmer by the day.

March 28, 2017 1:03 PM   Subscribe My Dad (75, moderately computer literate) has an iPhone, iPad and a Mac. Tonight I tried to change his Apple ID password for him, but couldn't because 2-factor authentication is switched on; he says not by him. Has his account been hacked, and if so, what should I do? Dad told me that the Mac wasn't connecting to his iCloud account, and tonight when I started the Mac up and entered his iCloud password, he got a pop up on his iPhone to say that a device near London was trying to use his Apple ID. We are in the UK but not near London so, feeling worried, I clicked the 'Don't Allow' option. Then, to be safe, I decided to change his Apple ID password, but when I tried to do so via Apple's website, I was prompted to enter the 6-digit 2-factor authentication code - however no code had been sent to his phone. Dad says he didn't switch on two-factor authentication, and I don't think he would be able to do it without help. However he did visit the local Apple store a couple of weeks ago, and it is certainly possible that the guys there turned on two-factor and that he has forgotten or didn't pick up on whatever they told him. But I don't know that for sure, and obviously I am well aware that fraudsters will turn on two-factor to get control of your account, so I'm worried. The phone has subsequently displayed more messages to say that a device near London is trying to use Dad's Apple ID, but these messages have corresponded with me trying to change the password, and no messages have popped up randomly. Additionally, Dad's Broadband provider is BT, and my husband says that back when he used to use BT, his location would often show up as being in south east England even though it wasn't. Essentially, my goal is to reset Dad's Apple ID password, which I can't do right now because his account has two-factor authentication enabled and I don't know why. I have been looking on the support section of the Apple website and have requested a call for tomorrow morning, which is the soonest I can get one, although I am concerned they may not talk to me (because I am not my Dad and I'm a woman so I can't pretend to be him) but I can't leave my Dad to talk to them himself because he doesn't understand what he needs to ask. I can also go to the local Apple Store if I need to. I am also wondering if the two-factor authentication code is not getting to my Dad's iPhone because I have clicked 'don't allow' when it asks to allow the log in. If there's nothing sinister going on, maybe I just need to allow the log in to get the code. But if there is something sinister going on, I can't risk doing that. My questions are: 1. How likely is it that the account has been hacked or that someone is trying to hack the account? 2. How do I reset Dad's Apple ID password / turn off two-factor authentication? (Needless to say, since Dad doesn't know how it got turned on, he doesn't have the backup emergency codes that you receive when you set it up.) posted by meronym to Computers & Internet (5 answers total) 4 users marked this as a favorite   I recently found that Apple was using two-factor authentication for my Apple ID without me requesting it. This involved a code being sent to my devices that were registered with that ID, so the code just popped up right on the computer I was using to change the ID. The code also appeared on my other Apple devices at the same time. And as you have found, geolocation based on IP is normally frighteningly accurate except when it isn't. So I also got the alert that someone was attempting to use the ID in a location far away. Scared the heck out of me, but once I realized I was getting notified about my own attempt to log in, and got the code entered, everything was fine. Fingers crossed this is true for your dad. Is there anything of value in the iCloud storage? Because changing the password and removing any devices you don't recognize from the account is not too onerous, if in fact you're not sure about what happened. posted by wnissen at 1:32 PM on March 28 [1 favorite] It sounds like someone at the Apple store set up 2FA, and your father may not have been aware that that happened. Your attempts to login to the account are being flagged. Ideally your father would have some recovery codes saved someplace. Maybe you can go back to the Apple store to get some help. posted by My Dad at 1:35 PM on March 28 [1 favorite] 1. Not likely. As far as I know, people don't generally turn on two-factor authentication as a way to hack someone's account. It would make getting access more difficult, not less. Two-factor authentication almost certainly got turned on by your dad at some point -- maybe at the Apple Store and he forgot, or maybe he did it while tinkering in settings and forgot. Especially if every pop-up about a device in London coincides with your trying to log in. That really indicates those pop-ups come from your log-in attempts, not from a third party trying to access the account. 2. Try clicking "allow" next time you try to log in and see a pop-up. I just tried it with my iPhone (attempting to sign into iCloud from my work computer), and as soon as I click "allow", the code pops up. You can then sign in and either turn off two-factor, or get backup codes, and change the password if you're worried. (Incidentally, the pop-up was wrong about my location as well. Don't put a lot of weight on that.) posted by snowmentality at 1:45 PM on March 28 [3 favorites] So recently Apple has included the switch for Two Factor in the Setup Assistant after updates, etc. Most people just click through this and it's very easy to turn it on without realizing it; this is almost 100% what your father did. The location is based on IP location and can vary wildly; as long as it's coming up when you're attempting to sign in, you're fine. Ideally your father would have some recovery codes saved someplace. Maybe you can go back to the Apple store to get some help. This is for 2 Step Verification, not Two Factor, so he won't have any. Also, if you do have trouble with Apple Support and they need to speak to your father, ask for a Senior Advisor. They should be well-trained in dealing with this super common scenario and as long as you're receiving the codes on his iPhone when trying to sign into his Mac, you're not actually locked out and you're in good shape anyway. MeMail me if you have specific questions, I do this for a living. posted by sixfootaxolotl at 2:16 PM on March 28 [3 favorites] Oh and as for changing the password; this should be doable from any Trusted Device; which his iPhone is because it's receiving the Allow prompts. This page is a great resource for you to read over. To update the password (likely actually unnecessary but I'd never say don't unless you think it'll confuse your father more): Go into Settings on his iPhone. IF it's updated to 10.3 (dropped yesterday) tap on his name at the top of the Settings page and then to Password & Security. It'll allow you to change the password there. You may or may not need to enter the current iCloud password depending on whether or not his iPhone has a passcode unlock set. If he's not on iOS 10.3 you'll go to Settings > iCloud > tap on his name at the top > Password & Security. Just a different path to the same page. posted by sixfootaxolotl at 2:26 PM on March 28 [1 favorite] « Older Casual Group Dinner in Midtown NYC   |   Where should I eat (alone) in Seattle?

The app called Metadata, created by Josh Begley from The Intercept, sends a notification every time a U.S. drone strike is reported in the news. Begley, created the app five years ago and called it Drone+. He said Tuesday in an article for The Intercept Apple rejected the app three times for “excessively objectionable or crude content.” Read: Trump Allows CIA Drone Strikes, Reversing Obama Policy: Report However, the app didn’t include graphic images or video and only aggregated news about drone strikes. “If anything about the app is ‘excessively objectionable or crude,’ perhaps it’s the airstrikes themselves,” wrote Begley. Begley resubmitted the app multiple times -- even changing the name -- to see if Apple changed its mind. After five rejections, Apple accepted the app in 2014 and remained in the App Store for about a year, with more than 50,000 people downloading it. In September 2015, the app was taken down completely. On Tuesday, after 12 attempts, it was back on the App Store and was taken down just hours later. When trying to download the app at about 3 p.m. EST on Tuesday App Store said it was not available: Apple takes down Metadata, a drone notification app, off the app store. Photo: Screenshot, Denisse Moreno But the app’s story is more than the back and forth struggle with Apple, Begley said before it was taken down again. Read: Signal App Update: How To Make Encrypted, Secure Video Calls “It is about what can be seen — or obscured — about the geography of our covert wars,” wrote Begley. “For the past 15 years, journalists on the ground in Yemen, Pakistan, and Somalia have worked hard to uncover the contours of U.S. drone attacks — in some cases at their own peril.” Begley continued: “But buried in the details is a difficult truth: no one really knows who most of these missiles are killing. Because the particulars of the drone wars are scant, we only have ‘metadata’ about most of these strikes — perhaps a date, the name of a province, maybe a body count.” Related Stories iOS 11 Rumors: Siri To Get A Boost in Artificial Intelligence, Will Come With Contextual Learning Apple Sustainability Report: Conditions For Workers At Supplier Factories Improve Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

This update is likely the last big hurrah for iOS 10, and as expected, it came with several major enhancements. These mostly pertained to Maps, Carplay, and Siri. One major change that’s largely been overlooked has been the introduction of Apple’s new filesystem – APFS. It sounds boring, but it’s actually pretty sweet, and it’ll change how your phone works. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 143.80 +2.92 +2.07% The introduction of APFS is long overdue. iOS (and pretty much every other Apple product) uses the HFS+ filesystem, which was introduced in 1998. This is a direct descendant of the original HFS filesystem, which dates back to 1985. Obviously, things have moved on since then. The era of mechanical hard drives, floppy disks, and ZIP and JAZ drives is long gone. Today’s computer is always on, is based on super-fast flash memory, and sits in your pocket. APFS – which Apple announced at last-year’s WWDC – wipes the slate clean. It’s designed with flash storage in mind, and emphasizes scalability. It’ll work just as well on an Apple Watch as it will on a MacBook Pro. From a security perspective, it’s miles better. APFS is designed with encryption as a headlining feature, and supports snapshots, which should make it easier to restore your iDevice should things go awry. The new filesystem also overhauls how it calculates available storage. As a result, many users are reporting seeing an increase of usable storage space. On iOS 10.2 I had 215GB and now on iOS 10.3 with APFS I have 220GB of free storage! That's amazing!!!!!!— Jonny (@jonnymmxvi) March 28, 2017 Sweet ✌️ More storage! IOS 10.3 changes to a new file system (APFS) for 64bit apps in the future. pic.twitter.com/Ct70CUEJmM — Terence Huijgen (@TerenceHuijgen) March 27, 2017 Before and after #APFS. pic.twitter.com/i6Vxhd2Wmr— Shazly Makeen (@mack005) March 28, 2017 Apple also designed APFS to be low-latency. In the most simple of terms, this means that reading and writing files to and from the filesystem will be quicker. But ultimately, APFS is an exciting sign of something to come, when Apple switches entirely to 64-bit apps. It’s believed that this will happen with the release of iOS 11. iOS 10.3 is available to download now. If installing it takes a little longer than you’d expect, don’t worry – it’s making a pretty big change.

Apple Just Banned the App That Tracks US Drone Strikes, Again The tech company really doesn’t want you to use this app, banning it thirteen times over five years. Apple has always been a bit of a black box when it comes to allowing, or banning, third-party apps for its iOS App Store. The company's murky policies have often drawn criticism and even accusations of censorship. No app has been a better example of Apple's strange and borderline dumb policing of the App Store as an app that tracks US drone strikes around the world. The app, which was originally called Drones+ and launched in 2012 by Josh Begley, a data artist who now works at The Intercept, has been removed from the app store thirteen times—most recently today. Read more: The Government Is Using a No Fly Zone to Suppress Journalism At Standing Rock On Tuesday, Begley celebrated the fact that after twelve rejections, Metadata, the new name of his drone strike-tracking app was back in the Apple App Store. But the celebration lasted only a few hours. Just this afternoon, Begley tweeted a screenshot of his iPhone, informing him that Metadata had been removed for download once again. It's unclear why Apple thinks Begley's app doesn't deserve to be in the App Store. The app is as simple, and innocuous, as it gets. There's no graphic content. The app consists simply of a world map, with pins indicating the location of US drone strikes, culled from news reports. Again: no pictures, no videos, no violence, no political content. Nothing. In the past, Apple justified its decision saying the content of the app was "excessively objectionable or crude." At some point, during a phone conversation, an Apple employee told him that the app could not just be about US drone strikes, according to what Begley told me at the time. Unsurprisingly, Apple did not respond to a request for comment. But hopefully one day the company will explain why an app that's perhaps a bit boring, but totally harmless, can't be in the App Store while other apps such as a video game that simulates American drone strikes against terrorists—which, remember, kill more civilians than terrorists—is still available. Until then, we'll only be able to guess, while others accuse the company of unnecessary censorship.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Smartwatches What should be next for the Apple Watch? Emily Ferron March 28, 2017 It's time for Apple to add these specs and features to the Apple Watch (Credit: Will Shanklin/New Atlas) View gallery - 6 images Now that Android Wear 2.0 is hitting wrists in an array of smartwatches, the Apple Watch sticks out in a sea of increasingly masculine, analog-informed designs. It stands alone as an iPhone-dependent piece of wrist tech with a distinctly 21st-century look. While the wearable certainly has its merits, we think the Apple Watch is begging for a few key updates. LTE connectivity – or at least less dependency on the iPhone Sick of Ads? New Atlas Plus offers subscribers an ad free experience. It's just US$19 a year.More Information Despite the consideration of a slightly increased monthly data bill, it seems the time is right to at least offer an LTE option for the Apple Watch, which so far has been Wi-Fi/Bluetooth-connected exclusively. With cellular connectivity, smartwatches become standalone devices that you can use completely independently from your phone and Wi-Fi network. This could be very appealing to those who think it's overkill to sport both a smartwatch on the wrist and a smartphone in the pocket. Since the introduction of Android Wear 2.0, which introduced several features to untether watches from phones, Apple's competitors have a few advantages in this department. LG Watch Sport, perhaps the best standalone smartwatch available now (Credit: Will Shanklin/New Atlas) Perhaps most noticeably, Android Wear 2.0 includes an on-watch version of the Google Play Store. We'd appreciate seeing a similar on-watch approach to the App Store. The current method of adding new apps to the Apple Watch – downloading them on your phone, then syncing the phone and watch together – is a bit of a chore. While we're no strangers to screen time, there's something unpleasant and backwards-feeling about needing two devices to make basic Apple Watch updates. Add an altimeter The Apple Watch does not have an altimeter, which measures altitude. This sensor may be near-useless to some, but for those who use their smartwatch to map outdoor workouts, it could seem like a glaring omission (especially in the Nike+ running-centric variant of the Apple Watch). It's a necessary bit of tech if you want to quantify the changes in elevation that you've run, biked or hiked. The Huawei Watch 2 includes an altimeter (Credit: David Nield/New Atlas) It's no secret that many smartwatch owners rely on the devices for the fitness-tracking functions, so it would be nice to count on your Apple Watch to record those hard-fought hills. Furthermore, Apple seems well on its way to elevating the watch's fitness-tracking capabilities into proactive health management and diagnosis tools, according to reports from Bloomberg and reputable analyst Ming-Chi-Kuo via Apple Insider. This would require improvements to both its HealthKit framework and the watch's biometric sensors. The latest Apple Watch is already equipped with a heart-rate sensor and built-in GPS, but it doesn't offer much in the way of proactive data interpretation. Which rumored advances could we possibly see? The ability to gauge fitness levels by tracking how quickly heart rate rises and falls during and after activity, as well as a built-in sleep analysis app (right now, sleep analysis requires a third-party app). Always-on display The Apple Watch is one of the few smartwatches that doesn't offer the "dumb watch" function of viewing time at a glance. While there is a raise-to-wake feature on the Apple Watch that wakes the display when you twist your wrist, it's imperfect and can be distracting. We'd like to see an always-on display option for when we don't want to constantly wake the watch. After all, the Apple Watch already uses an OLED display, which can support this feature better than other types of display tech. An updated form factor We do appreciate that the Apple Watch is offered in two sizes, and that both are fairly streamlined as far as smartwatches go. We hope that Apple sticks with this compact take. Many of the smaller-wristed, bulk-averse amongst us are disappointed to see that so many well-equipped competitors (like the Samsung Gear S3, LG Watch Sport and Huawei Watch 2) are considerable chunks of gear. We're in no rush to shave millimeters off of already razor-thin smartphones or laptops, but it seems well worth it when it comes to wearables. Even the smaller Apple Watch Series 2 may jut out prominently from the average woman's wrist (Credit: Emily Ferron/New Atlas) The watch case itself would benefit from a design update as well. With its rounded rectangle aluminum frame, curved-edge glass display and minimal chassis, the Apple Watch is a distinctly Apple device – and that's a good thing. The problem is that is looks like an old Apple device, like a chunk from an early iPhone. Aesthetic updates could take many forms, but we wouldn't mind if they just mimicked basic trends in the rest of the Apple lineup, like thinned-out bezels and larger displays while growing increasingly flat and light. We doubt that Apple will depart from the watch's distinctive rectangular shape, but we would not complain if it made the unlikely leap to a round display, either. Long shots: Android compatibility, longer lasting battery, a killer app There are some perks we'd appreciate but don't expect to see. We'd like it if the Apple Watch could pair with Android phones, for instance, but we doubt that Cupertino would grant this concession to let non-Apple devices into its walled courtyard. We'd also like to see battery life extended to edge out 24 hours – that would make it easier to take advantage of the Apple Watch's sleep tracking and haptic alarm clock features. Right now, it maxes out around 18 hours, and night is often the most convenient time to charge it. However, we realize that's unlikely in light of higher-priority updates. Lastly, smartwatches aren't flying off the shelves as some people expected them to when they first arrived on the scene. Why not? We suspect, among other reasons, that it's because smartwatches have no "killer app" – there are very few experiences that are more compelling on a watch than on the other devices we already own. For now, it seems that their most compelling functions are to be notification delivery machines or fitness trackers. The latter is important if you receive many high-priority notifications, but otherwise, it can represent the worst part of the connected age with little of its merits. You're constantly being distracted from the world around you, but your watch doesn't always offer a way to react meaningfully. We realize asking developers for a revolutionary new smartwatch app is a moonshot – we can't even offer any suggestions, apart from incremental improvements to the app library already available. Nevertheless, there's no doubt that groundbreaking watchOS software or dynamic new app content would give the Apple Watch a significant boost over its competitors. While we do not expect the Apple Watch Series 3 (or its equivalent) to be released any time soon, Apple patterns do indicate that the next iteration of the watch could include more significant updates than previous generations. Historically, Apple makes appreciable changes to its devices every fourth or fifth generation, and we've already seen the original Apple Watch plus the Apple Watch Series 1 and Series 2. The next in the lineup could be a major departure from its predecessors. While we wait, revisit New Atlas' reviews of the two currently available Apple Watches, the Series 1 and Series 2.

By: Vigneshravi Menon Published: Friday, March 10, 2017, 18:15 [IST] Apple followed the trend set by other smartphone manufacturers and brought out the iPhones with biggers displays. While bigger the better term has been around for time immemorable, gadgets have always followed a smaller but more powerful concept, in most areas. However, when it comes to smartphones bigger and more powerful is the mantra that's proven to be the key. With Apple making this transition and bringing out new bigger iPhones and being done with conveniently sized ones, it was an end of an era. And with the beginning of a new phase, many users were excited about having iPhones with bigger displays as it offered many new possibilities and better viewability. While on the other hand, some weren't so happy about it including me, this could also be the sole reason why many existing users also didn't upgrade to newer iPhones sooner. As older iPhones provided the convenience with their size. ALSO SEE: How to disable iMessages and go back to SMS on Apple iPhones In any case, if you have a bigger display iPhone then there is a feature which is not very popular among most users and may go unnoticed, but this feature changes things and brings with the convenience of the size of the older iPhones.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox News Tech Expand/Collapse Search Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Business Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World On Air Tech Home Computers Google Video Games Military Tech War Games Slideshows Wearable Tech Warren Buffett gets into wearable technology By Jennifer Schonberger Published March 28, 2017 FoxNews.com Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print   From smart bracelets to smart engagement rings, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is getting into wearable technology. Richline, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkshire, is launching a smart-jewelry line called Ela. With Apple’s smartwatch gaining traction despite initial doubts, and brands like Fitbit firmly established, wearables is becoming a crowded space buzzing with competition. Apple’s watch has turned the tech giant into the second largest watch brand in the world behind Rolex based on 2015 worldwide watch sales. Executives at Richline are encouraged by Apple’s strides and optimistic they can succeed. “As a whole the company has really found that the tech space is no longer a category that can be ignored,” said Cliff Ulrich, product innovation manager for Berkshire Hathaway’s jewelry wholesale division, Richline. “It’s kind of now almost a utility.” MARCH MADNESS: NCAA HARNESSES INTEL TECHNOLOGY TO BROADCAST GAMES IN VR "Jewelry is a centuries-old business that isn't going anywhere, so it's a safe bet. With the addition of technology, we're simply updating something everyone knows and loves to better fit our modern age," Warren Buffett said in a statement. Richline isn’t trying to compete with Apple or Fitbit by creating a prettier step tracker that offers texts and Facebook messages on your wrist. “We’re focusing on a different customer,” says Ulrich. “Someone who doesn’t want to strap a screen to their wrist, but wants to continue to wear jewelry … and feel more connected to people in their lives.” The Ela line will launch initially with four different bracelets featuring Italian marble quartz stones in the center with bands ranging from 18-karat gold plated to leather. BUZZ ALDRIN HOSTS VIRTUAL REALITY EXPERIENCE ON HOW TO GET TO MARS The smart bracelet, which is compatible with Apple iOs and Andriod, connects to your phone via Bluetooth and alerts you when someone is calling or texting by glowing. You can assign different colors for up to eight different people in your phone. For instance, if you assign the color red to your mom’s phone number, the bracelet glows red when she calls or texts. But you can only stray 25 feet from your phone before losing connectivity. The device also stores pictures and tracks steps; but since there’s no screen you’ll have to check the Ela app on your phone to view photos or steps walked. Think of it as a modern day locket. The bracelet is for someone who wants to maintain fashion, but wants unobtrusive notifications for phone calls from people who are most important to them. But a veteran tech analyst is skeptical the product will perform well. “Sounds far-fetched to me,” says Paul Meeks, chief investing officer for financial management firm, Sloy Dahl and Holst. “Buffett rarely invests in technology; and besides Apple’s stock, his track record [on tech] has been poor. I don’t use him as a credible fashion or tech source regardless of his investment success.” FOR THE LATEST TECH FEATURES FOLLOW FOX NEWS TECH ON FACEBOOK And the competition is fierce. A brand called Ringly offers a similar concept to Ela with bracelets and rings that retail for $245 and $195 respectively. Ringly’s jewelry similarly connects to your phone via Bluetooth and gives you customized mobile alerts through vibration and a subtle color-coded light. However, Ringly doesn’t offer the variety of designs and assortment of materials as Ela. Michael Kors also offers fashionable smart bracelets, which range in price from $95 to $195 -- though the bracelets only track your steps and sleep. The bracelets don’t alert you to phone calls and texts. Richline expects to experiment with more materials and branch out from bracelets into different categories from rings to necklaces. “We’re watching the technology get so small that even now we can put a very tiny chip in your engagement ring and probably keep the entire memories of your wedding vows, wedding ceremony or the moment he proposed to you,” says Joel Schechter, executive vice president of Richline who also oversees the division’s pearl line.   Ela will be available in Macy’s, Amazon and independent jewelers starting in April. It will retail for between $195 to $295 a piece. That compares with an Apple watch with comparable basic features to Ela that retails for around $260 and Fitbit, which retails for $100.  Advertisement TRENDING IN TECH 1 House votes to block Obama-era online privacy rule 2 Boy donates gaming console to Wisconsin police department after string of shootings 3 Indiana inmates could receive tablets as part of bold tech program 4 Warren Buffett gets into wearable technology 5 UK battles counterfeiters, launches ‘most secure coin in the world’ See all Trends Scitech Connect Subscribe to the daily Geek Sheet for the top science and technology stories.

Phone launches follow a pretty similar pattern: Flashy press conference, excitement, pre-orders and the investing world keeping an eye on how well these devices sell. It's always high stakes for the companies, but perhaps more than ever, the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S8 on Wednesday, and the anniversary edition of the iPhone later this year, could be the most important smartphone launches ever for both companies. That's because it comes at a time when the smartphone market is saturating and after both companies have gone through testing periods. The Galaxy S8, which has been extensively leaked, will be released following the Note 7 scandal last year, in which Samsung was forced to recall and eventually discontinued the handset after several caught fire. The South Korean giant apologized and released a full report on what went wrong in January, but the episode is still fresh in consumers' minds. At the same time, Samsung Group's heir-apparent Jay Y. Lee was charged by prosecutors with bribery and embezzlement connected to South Korea's ongoing corruption scandal which led to the impeachment of the country's President Park Geun-hye. A successful and innovative Galaxy S8 smartphone will be key to shifting attention away from Samsung's current issues, putting the Note 7 saga to bed, and boosting sales and profit in its mobile division. Meanwhile, Apple has also had a tough time recently. In its fiscal 2016 results, the U.S. technology giant experienced the first annual revenue decline since 2001, after iPhone sales fell for three consecutive quarters. Many have questioned Apple's chief executive Tim Cook's ability to innovate pointing to the Apple Watch as the only new product category under his leadership. While talk of driverless cars and augmented reality (AR) – a technology Cook has said could be as big as the smartphone itself - have yet to materialize in any products. The iPhone 7, Apple's last flagship got criticized for not being a big change from the iPhone 6s. But from recent leaks, the Galaxy S8 and the iPhone anniversary addition, potentially called the iPhone 8, may just be the best devices both companies have ever produced. Samsung's flagship will have a big screen and new artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, while Apple's smartphone is rumored to have a new 3-D camera and AR capabilities. Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that the next iPhone will create a "supercycle" for Apple. Driving a new wave of users to buy the next flagship devices will also be crucial if Apple and Samsung want their customers to adopt technologies and services that they are staking their future on such as AI and virtual reality. But competition is tough and Huawei is chasing both Apple and Samsung with the Chinese firm establishing itself as the number three smartphone player in the world.With such high-expectations and both companies keen to put recent issues in the past, Samsung and Apple need to deliver with their flagship launches, which can't be like any other. tags #Apple #Driverless Cars #Huawei #Note 7 #phone #Samsung #Samsung Galaxy S8 #Samsung Group #smartphone #Technology Related news Business Samsung faces 'biggest test' with Galaxy S8 launch Mar 29, 2017 10:38 AM Business Online needs to work for us, we have no Plan B: Aegon Life Insurance Mar 29, 2017 09:06 AM Business Samsung's fire-prone Note 7 phone may return after recalls Mar 29, 2017 07:58 AM Business India's data traffic growth in 2016 led by 4G technology: Nokia BY rishma Mar 28, 2017 08:34 PM Business Modi govt warns against use of Bitcoins, says can attract anti-money laundering law Mar 28, 2017 07:07 PM Business China's Tencent takes 5 percent stake in electric-car maker Tesla Mar 28, 2017 07:06 PM Business Elon Musk to develop technology to link brains with computers Mar 28, 2017 06:49 PM Business Truecaller ties up with ICICI Bank for making UPI payments Mar 28, 2017 04:28 PM World Why Samsung's Galaxy S8 and Apple's iPhone 8 launches could be the most important ever Mar 28, 2017 12:28 PM News Most Popular Top News Maybe it's time for hostile takeovers; govt must back honest risks: Uday Kotak D-Mart bumper listing: Should you buy, book profits or hold shares?

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > T-Mobile's rolling out new plans, discounted… T-Mobile's rolling out new plans, discounted Apple Care+, and free MLB.tv streaming By Kyle Wiggers — March 28, 2017 9:54 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you T-Mobile's new prepaid plans are cheap, and its free MLB.tv streaming benefit and Apple Care+ discount aren't bad deals, either. You can’t stop the inevitable march of progress. In T-Mobile’s case, that means new prepaid plans and subscriber benefits. This week, the self-coined “Un-carrier” announced revamped prepaid offerings with unlimited talk, text, and a bucket of data: Simply Prepaid and One Prepaid. The carrier’s Simply Prepaid plans cost $45 or $55 for 4GB and 6GB of data, respectively, and includes many of the same features available to T-Mobile’s postpaid customers. Wi-Fi calling is included, as is a mobile hot spot and unlimited music streaming. More: T-Mobile takes the wraps off its new Un-Carrier Next Service The $75 One Prepaid offers all the benefits of Simply Prepaid with the addition of on-device 4G LTE, coverage in Mexico and Canada, and 200MB of roaming data, but with caveats. Hot spot speeds are limited to 3G, and the resolution of streaming video is downgraded to “DVD quality” (HD video passes are available for $3 each). Prepaid plans aren’t the only things T-Mobile rolled out this week. Postpaid subscribers to the carrier’s Jump plan get Apple+ coverage for the discounted rate of $12 a month per device. That’s in addition to Jump’s other highlights: The freedom to upgrade your smartphone once you’ve paid 50 percent of the previous model’s cost, and insurance for loss, theft, and accidental damage. Apple+ coverage, normally $130, includes 24/7 priority access to “award-winning” technical support via chat or phone, hardware service with genuine Apple parts, a discounted $29 service fee for iPhone screen damage, $0 for battery maintenance, and an Apple-certified repair or replacement at Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers. More: T-Mobile covers nearly as many people as Verizon and will commit to 5G in the future To cap off the revamped plans, T-Mobile announced a new subscriber benefit on Tuesday: A free year of MLB.tv baseball streaming. All prepaid, postpaid, and business subscribers get unlimited access to the service, which normally runs $113 a year (and an additional $20 for MLB at Bat mobile phone streaming). Customers have until 4:59 a.m. ET on April 5 to sign up for the promotion. Once registered, they’ll need to sign into to the MLB.tv app or website before 4:59 a.m. ET on April 11 to retain the free subscription. Free access expires on February 28, 2018. In addition to the MLB.tv subscription, T-Mobile’s gifting a free Vudu baseball movie rental, a $2 Dunkin’ Donuts gift card, and 30 percent off Groupon Local purchases (up to $40). More: T-Mobile’s new One plan, with no hidden fees, is rolling out now T-Mobile has been adding steadily to the pile of benefits its customers already enjoy. Mobile Without Borders extended T-Mobile coverage to parts of Mexico and Canada. Binge On and Music Freedom provided access to a number of streaming video and music services that don’t count against data caps. And in December, T-Mobile announced Digits, a new service that provides a single phone number that works across smartphones, tablets, and even wearables like smartphones. These moves come on the heels of a range of network improvements. In December, T-Mobile announced that it covers 313 million people in the U.S. — one million shy of Verizon’s coverage — and that its current generation of cellular can now achieve a faster theoretical speed (1Gbps) than every other major carrier in the U.S. Shop T-Mobile Pre-Paid Plans
News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Security Attackers Launched a Safari Scareware Campaign to Extort Users Watching Porn By Rafia Shaikh Mar 27, 2017 11Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple has fixed the issue with iOS 10.3 release With the release of iOS 10.3, Apple has today fixed a flaw that scammers were using to extort iOS users. Security researchers at Lookout explained in a blog post earlier today that scammers abused the way Safari displayed JavaScript pop-up dialogs, locking victims out of the browser. Victims wouldn’t be able to use Safari browser until they paid attackers money in form of iTunes Gift Cards. Scammers also displayed threatening messages until they were paid to coerce uninformed users into making the payment. Safari bug exploited to extort iOS users – several other security flaws also resolved Researchers from the mobile security provider explained how scammers planted the exploit code on multiple websites causing an endless loop of windows to be displayed, preventing users from accessing the browser. The scammers usually targeted those browsing adult entertainment sites and other “controversial content.” Related How to Downgrade iOS 10.3 Final Version to iOS 10.2.1 Lookout added that scammers registered domains such as police-pay.com to launch the attacks. The naming choices were apparently made to scare “users looking for certain types of material on the Internet into paying money,” researchers said. “Examples range from pornography to music-oriented websites.” The attackers effectively used fear as a factor to get what they wanted before the victim realized that there was little actual risk. To fix this endless loop of pop-ups, Apple is changing how Safari handles website pop-up windows, making them per-tab rather than having them take over the entire browser. Lookout said that while informed users could get rid of this mess by clearing the device cache, many users easily fell for the trick, especially since attackers posed as law-enforcement, falsely claiming that the victim had to pay a fine to get the browser access back. Advertisement Lookout reported this attack to Apple last month after discovering it in the wild. Apple has now released the fix with iOS 10.3 rolled out earlier today. Users can install the latest OS version to stay safe from this particular attack, along with a number of other security bugs. You can also go to Settings > Safari > Clear History and Website Data to get Safari back on iOS without paying anything. Related iOS 10.3 for iPhone & iPad Released – Final Download Now Available “Once a person erases all web history and data, effectively starting Safari as a fresh app, the ransom campaign is defeated,” Lookout said. Apple has also fixed several other security flaws, including a memory corruption issue due to which processing a maliciously crafted image could have led to arbitrary code execution. Another issue in Safari could have enabled a local user to discover websites a user has visited in Private Browsing. Apple’s macOS Sierra has also received a whopping 127 security patches with version 10.12.4, which was also released today. For more details about today’s super-long security bulletin, visit Apple.

The newspaper reported yesterday that both Apple and Facebook are "gearing up to challenge" Microsoft HoloLens and secretive startup Magic Leap in the race to create a pair of AR glasses that could replace the smartphone. The FT claims, however, that while Apple and Facebook  may be working hard on their creations, neither of the tech giants will likely beat Magic Leap to market  - a startup that has raised $1.4 billion from investors to date and is reported to be working on a piece of eyewear that sources say is smaller than Microsoft's HoloLens, with a "wider field of view, but larger than a regular pair of glasses", the FT said. Pax8's new hire Value-added cloud distributor Pax8 has announced the appointment of John Walters as VP of service operations. In the newly created role Walters will be responsible for the strategic direction of the company's service delivery and technical support, Pax8 said. He will report to COO Klaus Dimmler. Pax8's SVP of partner solutions, Ryan Walsh, said in the announcement that the addition of Walters will enable its partners to "gain new leads, add monthly recurring revenue and ensure they are getting the highest level of support". Walters joins Pax8 from professional services firm Wipro, where he held the position of senior director. He has also worked at Level 3 Communications, AT&T, Bell Labs, Lucent Technologies and Avaya. Deloitte's cloud Consultancy Deloitte is making "significant investments" in its cloud services by acquiring cloud consultancy Day1 Solutions, the firm said yesterday. Along with the acquisition, the firm is creating 3,000 U.S.-based, high-tech engineering jobs and is opening new cloud studios across the nation, according to its announcement. The new hires will focus on creating cloud technologies to "accelerate and enhance the depth of analytics and cognitive solutions available to customers", Deloitte said, adding that the bulk of the engineers will be based in three new cloud studios opening in Orlando, New York and Washington, D.C. over the next year. "Cloud capabilities are the great enablers of digital transformation and there's a strong demand from clients to help them innovate their businesses with new cloud-based platforms," said  Ranjit Bawa, principal at Deloitte Consulting. "These strategic investments help strengthen Deloitte's cloud-based solutions by providing clients with a full spectrum of digital, analytics and enterprise cloud services," he claimed. WaaS's new offering  Workspace-as-a-Service (WaaS) vendor CloudJumper has announced a new onboarding offering for MSPs, CSPs, telcos and agents that provide WaaS. The solution, called JumpStart, is an onboarding solution integrated with CloudJumper's partner portal, the vendor said. The new product provides orchestration of on-premise discovery, price quoting and the provisioning of complete IT workspaces in the cloud, according to CloudJumper. It also "eliminates" manual onboarding procedures through automation, the vendor's announcement added. JumpStart is set to become generally available in the second quarter of 2017 and is free to existing nWorkSpace partners. McAfee's movie Antivirus personality John McAfee is set to have a movie made about him starring Johnny Depp, Hollywood publication Deadline reports. Entitled King Of The Jungle, the picture is said to focus on McAfee's time spent at his Belize compound with a Wired magazine journalist in what Deadline describes as an "Apocalypse Now-like tour…filled with paranoia, machine guns, sex and murder". At the time of the tour, McAfee was said to be a person of interest in the murder of his former neighbor, Gregory Faull. In more recent times, McAfee has hit the deadlines for declaring a presidential bid in the 2016 election, predicting all-out cyber war and, according to PC World, trying to block Intel Security's return to the McAfee name until a dispute involving another company's use of the McAfee name is resolved.

Apple has begun releasing iOS 10.3 for iPhone 5 and later, iPad 4th generation and later, and iPod touch 6th generation and later. Among other enhancements, this newest update includes support for locating a lost pair of AirPods, an all-new file system, CarPlay improvements and more. A big feature in iOS 10.3 is the introduction of the new Apple File System (APFS). This is the company’s all-new file system that will be used across macOS, iOS, tvOS, even watchOS. Unlike the earlier file system (Apple HFS+) that has been in force for the last 30 years, this update brings better support to today’s technologies. Most importantly, it is optimized for devices based on flash and solid-state storage -- a trend that is increasingly becoming the norm in many of today’s personal technology devices. Also -- just in time for this year’s edition of the IPL -- Siri will now have the ability to deliver match updates from the Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council You can ask Siri individual questions like: 1) What are the 2017 IPL rankings? 2) Who has scored the most runs in 2017? 3) Show me Mahendra Singh Dhoni's stats. 4) When is the next KKR match? Ask any of these questions and you can get the details from Siri, and you can also check match schedules and player rosters can also be checked. With the new update, Siri can now also be used to schedule rides with certain taxi hailing apps, check status of bills with payment apps, and check various car parameters when used in conjunction with certain auto maker’s apps.

(Photo by Gary Reyes/Bay Area News Group) By Patrick May | pmay@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: March 28, 2017 at 9:49 am | UPDATED: March 28, 2017 at 11:03 am Dear fanboys and fangirls, you may all now take a deep breath and relax. Apple this week has given you the ultimate iPhone gift: The new iOS 10.3 includes a nifty feature that lets you use the Find My iPhone tool to find your missing AirPods. And AirPods, as we all know, are specifically designed to go missing. In fact, never before has a technology been developed that so perfectly enables a user to misplace it. To prove our point, we did a Google search just moments ago for “i lost my airpods” instantly came up with 2,220,000 results. Related Articles Apple’s iOS update helps find lost AirPods, empowers Siri, more Apple takes aim at Snapchat, Instagram So, if you’ve lost your AirPods, and we know you have, you are not alone. First, here’s Apple’s good news: “With iOS 10.3 or later, Find My iPhone can help you locate your missing AirPods. If you already set up Find My iPhone with an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch that you’re using with your AirPods, it’s automatically enabled for your AirPods too. So if your AirPods are lost, out of their case, and somewhere close by, you can use Find My iPhone to find them again. If your AirPods are out of range of all of your devices, need to charge, or are in the AirPod Case, Find My iPhone can still help by showing the time and location where they were last connected.” And here, from assorted online forums for the digitally forlorn, are a few tales about lost AirPods from your fellow losers: AppleRobert: “I am more concerned about losing the case than a single Airpod to tell the truth but I have not yet resorted to using some kind of tracker. I will stay tuned for suggestions.” AdonisSMU: “I put my case in my pants pocket. It’s small enough that it doesn’t annoy me…and I can rest assured that I’m not going to lose the case because I put it in my pocket.” “AppleRobert: “You don’t think it could fall out? My smartphone has fallen from my jacket pockets a number of times, especially while seated.” ip67: (with photo of recently washed AirPods) “These took a beating and they still work after being dropped, washed in a washer machine and dried in a dryer then being submerged in water they still survived. That is amazing!!!!” woodynorman: (referring to Tile, a Bluetooth tracker for lost items) “I’m looking for a small tracking device that I can use the next time I set it somewhere and can’t find it. Preferably one that plays a tone when being located. I want something small enough to attach to the outside of the case. I looked into the Tile tracker, but its 1.75″ square. Thats too big to stick to the outside of the AirPods case.” rockyromero: “How about a case for the case that clips to your keys?  Which also has a tile clipped to the keys. Next problem? Traverse: “Throughout the day I constantly (even without realizing it) briefly check for my wallet, phone, and [now] AirPods so they shouldn’t get far. Unless you’re sitting at a sharp incline, your stuff shouldn’t slip out of your pockets and the AirPod case is bulky enough to feel it move. When not in use, I set my AirPods in their case [although I have briefly laid them on my desk or bed to do something, but I have no pets so they’re not running away].” woodynorman: “The first time I misplaced it, I was using them in bed. They ended up falling behind the bed and wasnt easy to find. Second time was in my work truck. They fell into the “black hole” between the seats. Took me forever to find it.” Night Spring: “What’s wrong with having a key ring just for your AirPod case? Or attach a lanyard — anything that makes the case “larger” will make it easier to find. We’ve taped ribbons to a few of our stereo remotes that were so small they were constantly getting lost, and the ribbons really help to keep them in sight.” Lennyvalentin: “Myself I can forget most anything; not keys or wallet thankfully (so far anyway); I am rather firmly attached to those – as am I to my head or else I’d probably lost that too somewhere, more than once most likely. I’ve forgotten loads of other stuff however, a Polar exercise watch at the gym and multiple gym pants too, a nice leather backpack from Crete on a tram, multiple umbrellas… If I don’t forget stuff when I’m out, I forget them at home. Like back when you paid your bills in person at the bank or post office, you go into the city to do your monthly errands and all your bills stayed behind even though you put them right next to your friggin shoes so you’d absolutely remember to bring them? Yup, that was me.” chriscrowlee: “I just don’t think a product is for you if the case which IS small, is hard for you to keep track of. It’s like if you’re a 6ft7in tall, and complain that a Ford Fiesta is really cramped. The product wasn’t designed for people who have a hard time losing tiny things, much like a Fiesta is not designed for NBA players. It’s not rude, it’s just matter-of-fact. This isn’t a site for coddling, it’s a site where people ask questions of others and they respect everyone’s opinions. I gave my opinion. You really have two options. You can either take a little more care in keeping track of them (cause even if you use a chain attached to them, you’re going to have to take the chain off to charge), or move on to a different product less likely to be lost. It’s quite simple.” AppleRobert (referring to a friend at work): “who purchased the Airpods. He took the case out of his pocket and no lie, no Airpods inside. Can happen to anyone anything. We all lay things down and they get misplaced and have to figure out where the heck we left them.” angusmatheson: “I think the worst problem with these is losing them. My son lost my iPod shuffle repeatedly. The Apple TV remote also needs a find my iPhone like beep function as well. (And it it means larger, great the thing is too damn small anyway.) bamf-hacker: “If you lose one or both you can send audio to them and crank up the volume on your phone to listen for them . That is what Rene did when he dropped one of his in a pile of snow.” robertk328: “If it falls out of your ear, you’ll know Otherwise it should be in the case charging. If you misplace the case itself, that’s a different story!” Tags:  Apple Patrick May Patrick May is an award-winning writer for the Bay Area News Group working with the business desk as a general assignment reporter.

Last month, KGI securities analyst Ming Chi-Kuo suggested the iPhone 8 (iPhone X) could have a 3D-sensing front camera. Earlier this month, it was reported STMicroelectronics would work on components for the 3D sensors. Now, Himax is rumored to supply 3D sensors. Barron’s reported Himax shares have spiked 56 percent this year after rumors that the company will supply 3D sensing components to Apple for the iPhone 8, could open up possibilities of augmented reality and virtual reality features on the device. Read: Apple and Augmented Reality: AR Tech The iPhone 8 Could Feature When It Releases Morgan Stanley’s Charlie Chan said Apple could go with Himax for its 3D components, since the company makes smaller sensors than other competitors. “Himax’s wafer level optics (WLO) technology can further reduce the size and fit the 3D sensing in smartphones,” Chan said, according to Barron’s. Himax’s stock has an additional 22 percent upside, Chan said. That positivity stems from the assumption that other smartphone makers will follow Apple and will also implement 3D sensing to its products. Chan explained: “Our 2018 EPS is now 54% higher than consensus, as we are more optimistic about the 3D sensing opportunity in non-Apple smartphones. We estimate that 3D sensing will contribute 20% of Himax’s 2018 revenue, with better margins, and this would fill the vacuum of the company’s AR smart glasses business (Google Glass or Microsoft HoloLens) before it takes off again in 2019. That means the stock’s P/E multiple is likely to expand to 25-35x (i.e., the high end of its historical range), given the strong product cycle.” Read: iPhone 8 Release Date Rumors: Apple Will Launch 10th Anniversary Phone In September In Limited Quantities Apple’s iPhone lineup this year is expected to include three new models, a 4.7-inch model, a 5.5-inch and a 5.8-inch version. Two iPhones will sport LCD panels this year and the iPhone 8 will come with an OLED panel which could stretch across the entire front of the device, meaning the iPhone might be priced at more than $1,000. Apple is also rumored to include the 3D sensors on the iPhone 8 and ditch the physical home button by embedding the fingerprint sensor.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 28, 2017 at 1:30PM Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently announced low-cost iPad (known simply as the iPad) is an interesting device; it's essentially a variant of the company's older iPad Air 2, with some changes that ultimately allow Apple to sell it at a modest price point ($329 for the entry-level variant with 32 gigabytes of storage) while maintaining reasonable margins. Although the device is, in my view, a win for Apple, there's one Apple supplier that stands to lose from Apple selling this new iPad, rather than a price-reduced iPad Air 2: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM), or TSMC for short. Image source: Apple. Out with the A8X, in with the A9 In a previous column, I went over why I believe that the A9 is both cheaper to manufacture and simply a better processor than the A8X found inside the iPad Air 2. For potential iPad customers, Apple's use of the A9, rather than the A8X, in the low-cost iPad is a clear win. It's worth noting, though, that the A8X was manufactured exclusively by TSMC. This means that had Apple simply discounted the iPad Air 2 to the levels that the new iPad currently sells for, TSMC would see a clear benefit from any unit-volume upside that those price cuts might engender. With the new iPad incorporating an A9 processor, on the other hand, the situation isn't as nice for TSMC. Recall that the A9 was (infamously) dual-sourced from both TSMC and its archrival Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF). Apple's current supply arrangements for the A9 aren't entirely clear, but it's reasonable to expect that Apple is buying A9 chips from both Samsung and TSMC. If so, TSMC isn't going to sell as many chips to Apple as it would have if Apple had used the A8X in the new iPad. Moreover, Apple had previously sold the iPad Air 2 as the cost-reduced product (though at a higher price point than the new iPad), so this isn't a case of "lack of upside" for TSMC, but more a story of potential share loss at the low end of Apple's iPad product stack. Is this a big deal? The good news for TSMC is that Apple's iPad business simply isn't anywhere near as large as its iPhone business (Apple shipped almost 212 million iPhone units in fiscal 2016; it shipped just under 46 million iPad units in that time), so share shifts -- especially at the lower end of the iPad stack -- aren't going to impact TSMC's financial results as much as, say, shifts in iPhone chip share would. I do expect TSMC's position in Apple's iPad to improve over time. The upcoming iPad Pro refreshes should use chips built using TSMC's latest 10-nanometer technology (the current iPad Pro models use TSMC-built application processors exclusively), and I wouldn't be surprised to see the 2018 models use TSMC's 7-nanometer technology. At the same time, I expect that next year, the low-cost iPad will be updated to use the A10 Fusion processor, manufactured exclusively by TSMC. There will likely come a time when all of Apple's tablets are powered by application processors built only by TSMC, but when that time comes, it likely won't make much of a difference.

Registered developers can update to the new betas via each platform’s respective OTA mechanism, or via the developer portal.

We don’t know yet what new features have been added in today’s betas. Apple’s release notes do say that SiriKit has been fixed in iOS 10.3.2, and SiriKit car commands should now work as expected.

You’re upset about that? Agneev TBH, it bugs me out! John Why? How does it Apple releasing all these betas affect you? tbf, I think people would be more pissed if they didn’t release any/fewer then they do. John Because these betas are for developers. If there’s a change in benhavior in the system, developers need to update their apps. You don’t needn’t to install every single beta. Agneev Thanks for the info. 🙂 🙂 Sebastien Not sure why they skipped a number for iOS and watchOS. Agneev Maybe they accidentally released .1 and suddenly retracted it and released .2… Nirvana could be that 10.3.1 doesn’t need beta stage and might be released shortly Charlie My good God. They can’t even last a day now Tony Trenkle Jr. They skip 10.3.1?

Andrea Malinverni More betas means better security for everybody! As Mr. Assange teaches us (Vault7) Blip dude Still can’t update my watch to 3.2, not sure if it’s because I have a Jailbroken phone, or just the fact that I’m in 10.2 on the iPhone that I can’t update my watch : /. burge The phone needs to be on 10.3 for the watch to update to 3.2. Ara Rezaee *Personal speculation* 10.3.1 will be a bug fix release for 32bit devices only and there will be no more updates for them. Richard Chhay 10.3 release just a day .

The average environment assessment score across Apple’s 705 supply chain assessments in 2016 was 87 out of 100. The company says the majority of violations found in 2016 were related to hazardous substance management and environmental permits. In 2016, Apple suppliers’ facilities diverted more than 200,000 metric tons of waste from landfills, compared to 74,000 metric tons in 2015, according to the report. One of the sites to achieve UL Zero Waste to Landfill validation in 2016 was the Tech-Com final assembly supplier in Shanghai. Apple says it discovered that more than 20 percent of the waste produced at this facility was being incinerated or going to landfills. The company worked with the supplier and the local recycling facility to develop a better process for separating and recycling waste, enabling Tech-Com to recycle 100 percent of its manufacturing waste. The facility also developed a new process for managing food waste, which it now sends to a local composter instead of a landfill. Since 2015, Tech-Com has diverted more than 10,000 metric tons of waste from landfills, according to the supplier responsibility report. In addition to highlighting suppliers’ waste management achievements, the report also highlights these facilities’ efforts to improve water management and reduce their carbon footprint. Apple’s Clean Water Program, which focuses on using less freshwater in suppliers’ processes and increasing the reuse and recycling of treated wastewater, saved more than 3.8 billion gallons of freshwater in 2016. This represents a 35 percent average reuse rate across 86 sites. Since 2013, the water management program has saved more than 8 billion gallons of freshwater, Apple says. Apple is also working to reduce supply chain emissions by increasing suppliers’ renewable energy use. In 2016, Apple tripled the number of supplier sites participating in its energy efficiency program, thus reducing more than 150,000 metric tons of carbon emissions. The report says several large suppliers have already committed to power all Apple manufacturing with renewable energy by the end of 2018. The company expects this to reduce carbon emissions by 7,000,000 metric tons per year.

A separate Galaxy S8+ leak suggests that the smartphone, said to have a 6.2-inch display, will be significantly taller and thinner than its predecessor, Galaxy S7 Edge. We just have to wait one more to day to find out whether the reports so far are bang on with their leaks, or if Samsung has something that tipsters have been unable to leak over the Internet.

Previous leaks said that the two smartphones are powered by the yet-to-be-released Snapdragon 660 SoC, but not much else is yet known about the Nokia duo. Samsung Galaxy Note 7 refurbished units to be sold in certain markets Samsung Galaxy Note 7 will make a comeback soon as part of the South Korean company's efforts to manage its stockpile of the now-defunct smartphone in an "environmentally friendly" manner.

The markets and release date for Samsung Galaxy Note 7 refurbished units will be finalised accordingly, the company said in a statement.

The deal comes just a day after Emaar Malls PJSC, operator of Dubai’s biggest mall, in a regulatory filing said that it offered to acquire Souq.com for $800 million (roughly Rs. 5,207 crores). COAI wants DoT to check handset quality over call drops The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has asked the Department of Telecom (DoT) to create a framework to regulate the quality of mobile devices India in order to tackle call drops. Saying that the role of handsets has not been adequately considered in the issue, COAI has sought an urgent intervention to address “the massive influx of untested and uncertified smartphones (more than 10,000 models in India) due to design variations introduced by the device manufacturers.” The COAI letter also mentions cases of degradation of data in dual-SIM LTE smartphones, specifically regarding “chipset-specific implementation by MediaTek.” Truecaller 8 update brings SMS inbox, flash messaging, payments Truecaller has released the Truecaller 8 update for its Android app that brings a host of new features, such as SMS inbox that allows you to filter spam texts, flash messaging to send pre-defined messages to other Truecaller users, and Google Duo integration for video calls.

Users will be able to transfer money using any UPI ID, or mobile number registered with the BHIM app. In addition, the Airtel Truecaller ID, which brings the app’s caller ID function to feature phones (even those without Internet access), was launched today.

Moto X 2017 images, specifications leaked Moto X 2017 has leaked once again, with images and specifications surfacing online, but without any mention of its launch plans or price.

Elon Musk launches Neuralink to merge AI with human brain Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk has reportedly launched a company called Neuralink Corp, which will attempt to merge artificial intelligence (AI) with human brains. The company will focus on the possibility of implanting tiny electrodes on the brain that may someday allow people to upload or download thoughts, which Musk calls the “neural lace” technology. Neuralink has not been officially launched yet, but it was registered as a medical research company in Calfornia in July 2016.

At long last, developers now have the ability to respond to user reviews in order to offer support, ask follow-up questions, say thanks, or otherwise interact with their app’s customers. The change has been a long time coming – the feature has been standard in Google Play since 2013, and a huge headache for Apple’s developer community over the years. Not only was the prior system a sore spot for developers, it was bad for consumers, too. If an app crashed on you or had some sort of weird bug, you might head over the App Store to leave a complaint. This was often easier than trying to track down the developer’s contact information, especially because many publishers don’t include an email address or support information in their App Store description. Those complaints could help developers identify new bugs or other previously unknown glitches, yet there was no way to reach out to the user to ask follow-up questions that could help them address the situation and create a fix. Some developers would even try various tactics to try to identify the user in question, simply to be able to ask more for information – like reverse engineering a UserID to figure out which email was associated with the user’s account, for example. @Cocoanetics @siracusa Finally! I use to have to reverse engineer their UserID to determine email for comments a crash in our app that we were desperate to debug — Tim Schallberger 🚴 (@tschallb) March 28, 2017 In addition, the lack of a review response system also prevented developers from fostering a sense of community around their apps. They couldn’t respond to feedback about feature requests to explain their thinking, talk about where that feature was on the roadmap, nor could they thank users who shared kind words. Being proactive by responding to issues that need addressing isn’t just about developing better software – it can also impact the developer’s bottom line. When users feel the developer is paying attention and being helpful, they’ll likely rate the app higher. Better rated apps will see more downloads, and then move up the charts on the App Store. What’s New For Developers With the launch of the new feature, Apple offers a series of suggestions about how developers should respond to reviews. It explains that timely, clear and concise answers are best, and they should reflect the tone of the brand – even if multiple people write the responses. The company also suggests that developers should prioritize those reviews with lower star ratings, for obvious reasons. The users’ reviews appear iTunes Connect, the dashboard where developers manage the apps they offer for download on the App Store. A page will display the incoming reviews, allowing developers to now respond or report them. (Under App –> Activity –> Ratings and Reviews). There are also filters for finding reviews from users in different countries, which can be helpful for triangulating reviews for versions just rolled out to new markets. Developer responses appear to go through a process of their own, MacStories discovered. (See below tweet). Some developers are seeing responses marked as ‘Pending,’ for instance. 🤗 Confirmed: you can use emoji in your iTunes Review developer responses! What a time to be alive!!! pic.twitter.com/oXSD7HZAL1 — Panic Inc (@panic) March 27, 2017 What’s New for Users  For consumers, the process of leaving a review hasn’t changed, if in the App Store itself. However, developers have gained a new option for soliciting reviews in the app itself. By using the SKStoreReviewController API, developers can ask you to rate or review an app while you’re actively using it, without being redirected to the App Store. This will have a bigger impact in terms of collecting ratings and reviews from a larger audience, as many people dismiss the nagging review prompts today. Even better, the API restricts developers from asking for reviews more than three times per year, which will have a huge impact on user experience. Some apps (Tinder comes to mind), literally ask their users for a rating at some point during every single use. And once reviewed, the prompts can’t reappear. Unfortunately, the option to completely disable review prompts for all installed apps, as promised is not appearing in the updated version of iOS, as it had in the beta. We understand that this feature was actually pulled out early on in the developer betas, however, and will likely return in time. The idea here is that Apple wants to give developers a grace period to implement the new API, so until that period wraps, the user-facing “disable” setting will not be available. Another new feature for users are email alerts that arrive if a developer responds to your review. Following the answer from the developer, the email includes further prompts with links: “Do you want to update your review?” and “You can also contact the developer.” Users get email if developer responds to review. And an option to update the review! pic.twitter.com/aOVnDFz8i6 — Cocoanetics  (@Cocoanetics) March 28, 2017 In the App Store itself, the responses are clearly labeled with arrows and the heading “Developer Response,” eliminating any confusion. The reviews and responses are also timestamped, which is another means of seeing how quick the developer is handling incoming complaints. Only one response can be associated with any review, but developers are able to edit their answers, Apple notes. Plus, users can now use 3DTouch on a review to mark it as Helpful or Not Helpful. One minor complaint is that the links a developer might provide – like to a support page or FAQ, for example – are not functioning URLs. (See screenshot below). This could make replies more time-consuming for developers who now have to type out instructions that are already on their site, and users won’t be able to click the links directly. Seeing my review replies from ~8hrs ago hit public. I kinda like how this looks. pic.twitter.com/DbtsoXTuyF — Curtis Herbert (@parrots) March 28, 2017 Developers are thankfully forbidden from manipulating reviews or incentivizing feedback, per Apple’s App Store Review Guidelines. The company clearly tells developers not to “offer users an incentive to change their review ratings in your responses,” as a means of keeping the review system honest. Certainly some developers will try to skirt this system, so it should be interesting to track how Apple handles those in violation. Yesterday, Apple released new versions of its operating systems and an updated version of iTunes. You’ll only see these changes if you’ve upgraded your Apple software to the latest version.

The ideal response is concise and clearly addresses your customer's feedback. Communicate in the tone of your brand, and use terminology your target audience will appreciate and understand. If multiple people in your company can reply to reviews for your app, they should use a similar voice and style. Make sure your replies follow Apple’s Terms and Conditions, which prohibits using profanity, posting users’ personal information, and spamming. The guidelines also recommend: Always providing individualized responses, even if only by pairing a personalized introduction with a more generic response. Soliciting feedback from users regarding what they'd like to see in future updates. Replying to reviews in a timely, consistent manner. Prioritizing responses based on a review's apparent level of importance. Writing release notes for app updates that specifically address issues mentioned in past reviews, and letting those past reviewers know of the update. Staying on topic with the issue raised by a review; no using replies as a means of advertisement. Besides these guidelines from Apple, as App Store responses have gone live for the first time, more details have come out concerning how those reviews will work. It appears that every reply submitted by a developer goes through some sort of review process before it is posted to the App Store. In the following tweet's screenshot, you can see a 'Pending' tag on the developer's review. 🤗 Confirmed: you can use emoji in your iTunes Review developer responses!

It can be downloaded by connecting the Apple TV to a computer with a USB-C cable and installing the beta software from a registered developer account using iTunes. Because of the tricky installation requirements, tvOS betas are limited to developers. tvOS 10.2.1 will not be available to the public until the final version of the software launches. Apple does not typically provide detailed beta release notes, so we don't yet know what's included in tvOS 10.2.1. It's likely to focus primarily on bug fixes and under-the-hood performance improvements, so we may not know what's new until the software sees an official release. Should any noticeable changes be discovered in tvOS 10.2.1, we'll update this post.

Facebook has hired Apple veteran Michael Hillman to head the virtual reality (VR) hardware division at its subsidiary Oculus. At Oculus, Hillman will work closely alongside chief operating officer Hans Hartman to galvanise the hardware effort. During his 15 year stint at Apple, Hillman handled many of the tech giant’s iconic products after starting as lead iMac designer. He served in many managerial roles before assuming the role of chief architect of all Apple desktop computers, Bloomberg reported. In the latter part of his career at Apple, he worked on a confidential hardware role. Hillman is another notable hiring by Oculus, following Hugo Barra from Xiaomi. Facebook believes that virtual reality has huge potential as the next major platform for computing. Though the company is looking to push ahead with its hardware effort, it will have to compete with other players who have better experience in this domain. Oculus’ present products include the Rift headset and controller, as well as the Gear VR attachment for Samsung phones. The company is looking to grab a major share in the VR market by taking virtual reality mainstream, which includes offering virtual reality experience to PC consumers. READ MORE: Oculus price drop sees $200 cut from VR headset and controller Oculus has already developed a prototype, code named Santa Cruz. But, the company did not disclose whether it will mass produce the device in the near term. Oculus released the Rift headset one year ago, dealing with several delays caused by manufacturing issues. These delays have led to quite a bit of anger among its early customers. It also released the Touch motion controllers for the Rift in December and recently, slashed the prices of both the controllers and headset by $100.

As part of the iOS 10.3 update, Apple changed a basic part of how every iPhone and iPad works — its file system, or the way the computer stores data and knows where and how to find it. With Monday’s update, Apple updated iPhones and iPads to its new Apple File System, upgrading from HFS+, which was developed over 30 years ago. It was a smart move for the future. Apple File System “is optimized for Flash/SSD storage and features strong encryption … and improved file system fundamentals” and should help iPhones and iPads run faster and more smoothly going forward, Apple says. But this was a risky move, too. Because a computer’s file system is a fundamental part of the device, there was a chance, if something had gone wrong, that people’s files could have been deleted, as Business Insider previously reported. The good news is that 12 hours after the update went out — and was downloaded by millions — there doesn’t seem to be any major problems with the transition to Apple File System. That’s a big achievement for the Apple employees working on it. If something had gone wrong, Apple would’ve heard about it, and it could’ve been bad if people actually lost their files. The one complaint is that the update takes a long time to install, and that’s most likely because of the rewriting of the entire file system. Apple could’ve made a big deal about this achievement. I’m sure people at Microsoft and Google, which have to push similar major updates, took notice. But instead, it pulled it off without much fanfare, and most people won’t even know their iPhones have changed in a big way. source: businessinsider.com Tags With: appleiPadiphone ← Scottish Parliament votes to hold second independence referendum Federica Mogherini calls on Turkey to respect neighbours → Mar, 29 2017 Brexit!

And so of course yesterday I dutifully downloaded the update, went without my phone for the few minutes while it got kind of hot and installed the new OS, and then promptly forgot about it. When I got into my car for the night to head home, I was pleasantly surprised by a few tweaks and new features that anyone who drives a car and uses an iPhone should appreciate. We happen to be pretty big fans of CarPlay (which we named our Tech Feature of the Year for 2016) as well as its Android Auto counterpart. What makes them both useful is the ease with which you can access apps on a smartphone with minimal distraction. In iOS 10.3, that distraction should be further limited, because now along the left side of the screen, you'll see the icon of the app you're currently using as well as the two most recent apps below it. This lets you switch to a recent app (and let's face it, you probably only use two or three in the car) without first hitting the Home "button" and then tapping (or swiping to a new page and then tapping) the app you want to go back to. It's a subtle change but one that will make things just a little easier and safer. And speaking of subtle, you'll note that on the home screen, shown below, all three little app icons in the column are equally sized, while when an app is running the top icon is slightly larger to denote it. There are a couple more CarPlay updates in 10.3, including one that takes the guesswork out of what song is coming up. Here's how Apple describes them: Shortcuts in the status bar for easy access to last used apps Apple Music Now Playing screen gives access to Up Next and the currently playing song's album Daily curated playlists and new music categories in Apple Music There is also a nice little update in the Siri section, which allows the digital assistant to interface with automaker apps, so you can ask her to do things like see if your car is locked, which is handy. This will depend on whether the automaker's app developers have updated the app with this feature, which hopefully should happen soon. Support for checking car fuel level, lock status, turning on lights and activating horn with automaker apps And in the miscellaneous section of the release notes is a mention of a minor improvement to the parked car tracking feature, which drops a pin where you leave a car that the phone was paired to over Bluetooth or CarPlay: Support for searching "parked car" in Maps Oh, and for those who use Apple Maps (which is not as bad as you remember but still not as good as Google Maps), that app sees a whole list of improvements. So maybe it's time to try it again. You can read the full release notes for iOS 10.3 at Apple's site.

NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images hide caption toggle caption NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images Drake in 2016, just before he released Views, which would go on to be the year's most successful album. NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images On March 18, Drake released More Life, 22 songs packaged as what he's calling a playlist and what everyone else (including the streaming svengalis at Apple Music and Spotify) have categorized as an album. Whatever you call it, on Monday, Billboard announced that More Life had arrived at the top of the Billboard 200, which tracks the performance of the world's most popular albums, mostly through fans streaming it on Spotify and Apple Music. And today, the Toronto-born rapper broke his own record for most simultaneous songs on Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart — all 22 songs on More Life plus appearances on two hits by other artists, "Both" by Gucci Mane and "No Frauds" by Nicki Minaj, for a total of 24. Drake cast a wide net with More Life, both artistically and in his business decisions around it. Between wider distribution, an expanded palette of global sounds and a digital world of instant availability, the weather conditions were perfect... by design. More Life Wasn't An Exclusive Release Drake's last album, Views — a "proper" album released in late April — was 2016's most successful album by a very wide margin, as reported at the end of the year by both Nielsen Music, which powers the Billboard charts, and BuzzAngle, an upstart competitor to Nielsen Music. Released as an Apple Music and iTunes Store exclusive (his deal was reportedly not cheap) with Spotify initially only receiving its wide-release singles. Despite this significant limitation on its availability, Views' various songs were streamed 245.1 million times within its first week of release. More Life, by comparison, was made available widely following its debut on OVO Sound, the radio show hosted biweekly by Drake's manager, Oliver El-Khatib, on Apple's Beats 1 station. Songs from the record were streamed 384.8 million times over the "tracking week," as Billboard refers to it — a 63 percent increase. Zooming in, within its first day songs from the More Life were streamed, globally, 89.9 million times on Apple Music, a new record. (Also consider that Apple Music has just 20 million subscribers.) More Life also set a record over on Spotify, where songs from the album/playlist generated 61.3 million streams its first day. That is a lot. (Note: That Spotify, which has far more listeners than Apple Music, claimed nearly 30 million fewer streams than Apple is something NPR has been unable to reconcile. Apple told NPR that Beats 1 streams were not included in its aggregate number, but demurred when pressed for a more detailed explanation. Spotify, asked to clarify whether its 61.3 million streams were U.S.-only, which could explain the discrepancy, also refused to comment. If these numbers are accurate, we're forced to guess that central placement within Apple Music contributed to the disparity in streams.) Streaming at the Center More Life's is also a sign of music streaming's maturation. Around the time Views was released last April, Spotify had 30 million subscribers (and many more free listeners) while Apple Music claimed 13 million subscribers (and zero free listeners). Spotify now has 50 million subscribers and Apple Music 20 million. That's a 62.5 percent increase in paying subscribers across both services — just about exactly the increase in streams that More Life received over Views. (As well, last year song consumption increased by 27.2 percent, according to BuzzAngle. Overall music consumption increased by 4.9 percent.) To further illustrate the point: Universal Music Group, Drake's corporate home and the largest record label in the world, made most of its recorded music earnings through streaming last year. Streaming is how the world listens now. In Search of Widened Appeal More Life has an almost comically diverse range of influences across its vast 22-song tracklist. The record, contoured smoothly, transitions from house music (via Detroit legend Moodymann and South Africa's Black Coffee) to grime (with two guest spots from Giggs) and Atlanta (Young Thug and Future both make appearances). Drake is in — and practically defines — the one-percent of musical artists worldwide; that kind of visibility leaves few places to draw new fans. Bringing in big names and attendant styles from subcultures he hasn't penetrated is one way to go about it. The tactic drew, along with memes about his Maddona-esque linguistic and stylistic appropriation, accusations of sonic dilettantism, but for every detractor there is almost certainly a genre representative happy to see some shine. Apple's Imprimatur Drake's deal with Apple buys the tech giant a few favors, such as an appearance in a self-deprecating ad for Apple Music — an ad that has the double effect of getting Drake's name next to Taylor Swift's in headlines and humanizing one of the world's best-known artists. As well, it gets you top billing in articles like this from The Verge, wherein your success is the story being told by some of the most powerful people in music. (Unfortunately, that article is rife with confusing assertions, such as crediting Beats 1 with Drake's streaming record despite Beats1 plays not counting towards streams, saying that it replaced SoundCloud for the rapper despite the two properties' vast fundamental differences and letting Apple executive Larry Jackson claim Beats 1 is the largest radio station in the world without providing the numbers to back it up.) Oh also — a pretty dad-cool jacket. All Together Now Taken together, the continuing and growing success of Drake is both anomalous and relatively easy to understand. That he's been so ahead of the curve both artistically (something for everyone) and strategically (getting Apple executives to promote a record available everywhere is a trick you're not likely to see repeated anytime soon) is both an illustration of Aubrey Drake Graham's business savvy and an expression of a new world. Some people can do some of what he accomplishes, but only he can do all of it. When she released 25, Adele saw that keeping her music off streaming would net her one of the most lucrative records in recent memory. Drake and his team recognized the same, just in the inverse.

Apple's release notes don't often provide much insight into what's included in new beta software, so we don't yet know what features it might offer. As the update follows the release of 10.12.4, which was a major update, this one may focus primarily on bug fixes and other small improvements. The release notes accompanying the beta release say only that the "update improves the stability, compatibility, and security of your Mac." Should any new features be found in macOS Sierra 10.12.5, we'll update this post.

Bugs are often discovered far too late in a release cycle to include fixes in that release. So, fixes are deferred to the next release (in this case, deferred to 10.12.5).

Eager iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users rushed to download and install the update, and they were greeted with some nifty new features. In a post on Monday afternoon, we went through the eight best new features in iOS 10.3, including a new Find My AirPods feature, updates to the Maps app, Apple’s new file system and more. There was one feature in particular that we listed in the post that deserves more attention though, and not many people realize it’s even there. Don't Miss: It’s probably time to admit the Galaxy S8 design is better than Apple’s iPhone 7 design When Apple releases any new iOS software, hardcore Apple fans always rush to download and install it immediately, regardless of what new features Apple adds. This is a good thing for many reasons, not the least of which is the fact that new iOS software always includes security updates that are crucial. iOS 10.3 is no different — it’s packed full of security fixes that users should be eager to install immediately. Of course, the user-facing features are typically the main draw for new iOS updates, and iOS 10.3 has a few nice additions and changes. One set of changes in particular is worth noting, but it’s hiding in plain sight so most iPhone and iPad users won’t even notice it’s there. Apple engineer Renaud Lienhart‏ tweeted on Monday afternoon about something that we mentioned in passing in our post covering the best new features in iOS 10.3. “iOS 10.3 feels ‘snappier,'” he said, “because many animations were slightly tweaked & shortened, for the better.” iOS 10.3 feels “snappier” because many animations were slightly tweaked & shortened, for the better. — Renaud Lienhart (@NotoriousBUGS) March 28, 2017 Long story short, Apple has made a number of small adjustments to the animations that are played when the user does things like opening an app, closing an app, or switching from one app to another. Longtime iPhone users may recall that Apple did something similar back in 2014 with iOS 7.1. The speed difference back then was much more dramatic and noticeable, but the improvements in iOS 10.3 are still nothing to scoff at. If you have an iPhone or iPad and haven’t yet updated to iOS 10.3, a faster UI should be reason enough to install the update as soon as you can. iOS 10.3 is available to download in iTunes, or as an over the air (OTA) update accessing in the Settings app by navigating to General > Software Update.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Apple Rolls Out Major Update with iOS 10.3: Here's What's New By Shirley Siluk / NewsFactor Business Report PUBLISHED: MARCH 28 2017 Released yesterday, the latest update to Apple's mobile operating system makes it easier for users to locate their misplaced AirPods and introduces a new look for the Settings app. Likely to be the last update before iOS 11 comes out later this year, iOS 10.3 also comes with a new file system designed for improved storage, and new features for app developers. Devices that support iOS 10.3 include iPhone 5, 6 and 7 models, the iPhone SE, the iPad Air, the iPad Air 2, and the fourth-generation iPad. Since iOS 10 was released in September, Apple has updated the operating system several times to address a number of issues and add new features and functions. This latest version of iOS 10.3 has seen seven beta releases since the first came out in late January. File System Optimized for Flash/SSD Storage Apple users are noting on Twitter and elsewhere that downloading and installing iOS 10.3 could take longer than some previous versions as this release comes with a number of major changes. Many report that their devices show improved memory and performance after updating. One of the big changes arriving with iOS 10.3 is the Apple File System (APFS) that replaces the Hierarchical File System Apple has been using for more than 30 years. Announced at last summer's Worldwide Developers Conference, APFS is optimized for Flash and SSD storage and also delivers many other improvements, Apple said. "Apple File System is a new, modern file system for iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS," Apple said in its online developer guide. "It is optimized for Flash/SSD storage and features strong encryption, copy-on-write metadata, space sharing, cloning for files and directories, snapshots, fast directory sizing, atomic safe-save primitives, and improved file system fundamentals." New Support for Finding AirPods In its review of the iOS 10.3 release, Ars Technica noted yesterday that the update will "automatically convert your iDevice's filesystem from HFS+ to APFS when you install it, making it the first Apple operating system to ship with APFS as a non-beta default filesystem." Ars Technica said that rolling out the new file system to Apple's biggest platform first "feels pretty brave," adding that the move makes sense because mobile devices tend to have "predictable and uniform partition maps." Computer security analyst Graham Cluley commented about the new file system's arrival on Twitter yesterday, noting, "Hmm . . . lot to go wrong. Think I'll let other folks install this before me." Another new feature of iOS 10.3 could be a welcome addition for owners of Apple's new Bluetooth-powered audio devices, the AirPods. Both small and wireless, the new earbuds are easy to misplace, so Apple has added the ability to locate them using the Find my iPhone feature. In addition to showing the current or last known location of the AirPods, the update lets users play a sound on the AirPods to help track them down. Other updates arriving with iOS 10.3 include new Siri support for bill paying and ride booking, shortcuts in CarPlay, support for searching "parked car" in Maps, and a rent-once-watch-anywhere feature for iTunes movies. Developers will also gain new tools for updating app icons, and posting public responses to customer reviews on the iTunes and iOS apps stores.

Google Offers Android O Preview Next Article > Samsung Needs Galaxy S8 Phone To Impress, Mend Its Reputation PUBLISHED: MARCH 28 2017 The Galaxy S8 will feature Samsung's Bixby virtual personal assistant. Samsung will on Wednesday [March 29] hold an event in New York, which will be live-streamed around the world, to launch its flagship Galaxy S8. The South Korean electronics company needs to repair its brand perception as a viable smartphone manufacturer after its flagship phablet device, the Galaxy Note 7 [pictured above], had to be recalled last year and eventually cancelled after a fault in battery design led to the smartphones catching fire. The launch of the S8 was pushed out by a few months. Samsung's new handsets are normally launched in February every year at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. This year, the company apparently wanted to fully resolve the battery issues that led to the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco. Information officially released by the firm, and a series of leaks from Korean-based tech blogs, have given customers a glimpse into what to expect this week. Bixby, which will be included in the S8. Bixby is the firm's Siri and Google Assistant equivalent. The virtual personal assistant (VPA) will supposedly be more conversational than Apple's Siri and ask follow-up questions if it did not understand the request. Samsung says Bixby will let users control compatible apps via voice only. In Apple's latest update, Siri can interact with other apps, like order an Uber, but users still have to physically touch the phone at some part in the process to complete the order. Adverts for the Galaxy S8 launch have been taking up prime-time slots on television for the past few weeks. The ads feature a black screen with two white lines that outline the top and bottom of the device. This suggests the S8 will have a small bezel -- the space between the screen and edge of the device -- and no home button. This is in line with previously reported leaks. The company also released an advert in January to show off its new super AMOLED display in South Korea. The video features an unreleased device with small bezels which is suspected to be the S8. The rumors Various leaks suggest there will be two versions of the S8 unveiled this week: one with the standard 5.7-inch display and the second with a larger 6.2-inch screen. The curved 'Edge' display that previously appeared on the S6 and S7 is said to have been done away with. Both S8 smartphones will have flat screens. As there will be no home screen button at the bottom of the screen, it is rumoured the fingerprint sensor will be embedded into the screen or at the back of the device. The S8 is expected to be one of the first phones to market with Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 835 processor. Both the S8 smartphone models will allegedly keep the 3.5mm headphone jack, which Apple controversially decided not to include in its iPhone 7 range last year. An updated version of the virtual reality headset, the Gear VR, and the Samsung 360 camera are also expected to be announced this week. © 2017 ITWeb under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

At some point or another, most of us will delete a contact from our phone in error. Once those digits leave your device, the outlook may seem bleak — but you might be able to recover the contact if you know where to look. Between iTunes and iCloud, Apple is overly cautious when it comes to making automated backups The Best Backup Software for Windows The Best Backup Software for Windows Your data is fragile – it only takes one small accident to lose everything. The more backups you make, the better. Here we present the best free backup software for Windows. Read More . Unless you’ve disabled this functionality, these two services should be your first port of call when you need to recover a deleted or missing contact. Restore Your Contacts via iTunes The easiest way to recover a lost contact is to use the most recent backup stored in iTunes 5 iTunes Alternatives for Windows to Play Music or Manage iPhone or iPad 5 iTunes Alternatives for Windows to Play Music or Manage iPhone or iPad iTunes is bloated and slow, especially for Windows users. Did you know plenty of Windows apps let you play music and manage your iDevice? We show you five fantastic iTunes alternatives. Read More . Whenever you connect your iPhone to iTunes, the software creates a restore point that you can use in an emergency. However, this method will revert your phone back to its earlier state. If you’ve added new contacts, or made any other changes in the meantime, they will be lost. Be aware of this before you start the procedure. To use iTunes to restore your missing contact, connect your phone to your computer via USB, and open iTunes. Use the iPhone icon near the top of the user interface to access settings related to your device. Use the Restore Backup button to return your phone to its earlier state Everything You Need to Know About Backing Up & Restoring Your iPhone from iTunes Everything You Need to Know About Backing Up & Restoring Your iPhone from iTunes Most iPhone users take for granted that the contents of their iPhone is backed up wirelessly to their iCloud account, but it is still useful to know how to restore your iPhone from iTunes. Read More . If you’ve just made a new backup, this option will be greyed out as above, so make sure that iTunes doesn’t start the process automatically when you plug in your phone. You can cancel any automatic backups by clicking the “X” button in iTunes, and prevent it happening in future under Preferences > Devices by checking Prevent iPods, iPhones and iPads from syncing automatically. Restore Your Contacts via iCloud If you haven’t connected your iPhone to iTunes recently, iCloud might be your savior. Check whether your device is set up to backup contents to iCloud by opening Settings, finding the iCloud section, and seeing whether the Contacts slider is activated. If it is, you may be in luck. Head to iCloud.com in your web browser and log in. You’ll see a screen that looks like a selection of iOS apps. Click Contacts and you’ll see a list of your contacts Apple Keeps Track of Your iMessage Contacts Apple Keeps Track of Your iMessage Contacts Apple's privacy credentials have taken a knock with the revelation that Apple logs your iMessage contacts.

For the latter, you’ll need to go back to the iCloud section of the Settings app on your iPhone. Turn the Contacts slider off, then select Keep on My iPhone when prompted. Next, turn the slider back to the on position. Select Merge when prompted. This back-and-forth process combines the contacts on your phone with any missing contacts that are being stored via iCloud. Manual Backups Using iCloud It’s possible to recover missing contacts via iCloud if you’re quick about it — but if your iPhone syncs to iCloud How to Use the iCloud Control Panel to Sync Data Between Your iPhone & Windows How to Use the iCloud Control Panel to Sync Data Between Your iPhone & Windows Do you regularly work on a Windows computer. And are you looking for a way to keep your iPhone data in sync? The iCloud Control Panel could be the tool you've been looking for. Read More in the meantime, you might be out of luck. To avoid this scenario, it’s worth using iCloud to make an occasional manual backup. First, open iCloud in your browser as instructed above. Then, head to the Contacts page. Click any contact, then use Cmd + A (or Ctrl + A on Windows) to select all of your contacts. Next, click the small cog in the bottom-left corner of the screen. Click Export vCard and your browser will download a backup of your contacts. Keep this on your computer somewhere safe, and make sure to update it every now and again, and you won’t need to rely on iTunes or iCloud next time you lose a contact.

Read More , and even iCloud. If that’s the case, then you won’t be able to take advantage of either service’s ability to back up your contacts. Fortunately, there’s third-party software that can provide similar functionality. TouchCopy by Wide Angle Software is one such option, and it’s available for both Mac and PC. However, it’s paid software that costs $29.95 for a year, or $39.95 for a lifetime subscription. Alternatively, there’s CopyTrans Shelbee, which is free but only works on Windows. Again, these programs will only provide a backup, and won’t help you recover lost contacts if there isn’t already a backup available. As with any software that’s working with private content on your phone, be wary about the access you give any recovery to your device. Do you have another tip for recovering lost iPhone contacts?

Developers can now respond to any review — no matter when it was written — and after an Apple moderator approves the reply, the user will be notified of the response. After that, the user will be given the option to update their review, and then the developer can also update their response, providing a way for both sides to discuss (or argue over) any concerns. No matter how many times the response is edited, only the most recent version will be displayed on each review, and Apple is still moderating all posts to maintain some sense of decorum. The company has also rolled out its StoreKit API with the release of iOS 10.3, allowing developers to streamline the process for requesting app reviews. Instead of sending the users out of the app and into the App Store to leave a review, the new process allows the user to leave a rating and/or review without ever leaving the app. Developers also won’t be on the hook for writing their own code to create the review prompt any more, but Apple will now limit the maximum number of requests to three per year and prevent apps from prompting too frequently, where before it was at the whim of the developer. So far Apple hasn’t made updating to the new system mandatory, so developers can decide whether they want to hand over so much control over their review requests to Apple. While the beta version of iOS 10.3 provided an option for users to opt out of receiving the prompts altogether by toggling the options within the iTunes & App Store section in Settings, the option appears to be absent from the final version of iOS 10.3, despite the feature being mentioned in Apple’s iOS Human Interface Guidelines. Why Apple would leave out the feature is unknown, but could have been the result of developer feedback or concerns that the setting won’t actually function properly until more developers switch over to the new StoreKit API.

After a trip through Asia meeting with members of Apple’s supply chain, analyst Christopher Rolland said the USB-C won’t replace the Lightning jack in 2017’s iPhone line up, but that his contacts “believe Apple may be creating an interoperable hybrid that mixes the best of both technologies.” And while Apple is still working out the battery life and size problems related to delivering a cellular Apple Watch after failing to get one working for 2017, Rolland said the next version will include a SIM card to allow it to make calls independent of the iPhone and provide the ability to sync up with the company’s AirPods. As far as this year’s remaining product launches, Rolland said he’s confident Apple will produce a 4.7” iPhone 7s, 5.5” iPhone 7s Plus and 5.8” OLED iPhone 8, all featuring wireless charging, but said ” there is some skepticism regarding charging efficiency as it may take 3 hours to receive a full charge.” He also said he expects Apple to eliminate the home button as plenty of others have predicted, but warned that move “may be in limbo as Apple has had some technical issues validating the technology.” He expects the 7s and 7s Plus to begin manufacturing in June and the iPhone 8 to hit assembly lines two months later—possibly to provide more time top work out the kinks in Apple’s prototypes.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Wed, Mar 29, 2017 - Page 10　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Didi mulling Softbank funding: sources LOOKING AHEAD:The ride-sharing giant’s business remains constrained by strict rules in numerous cities and it needs capital to expand research into driverless cars Bloomberg Chinese ride-sharing giant Didi Chuxing (滴滴出行) is weighing whether to take a US$6 billion investment backed by SoftBank Group Corp that could dilute existing backers, such as Apple Inc, people familiar with the matter said. If the deal goes through, the funding would be the single largest for a Chinese technology start-up on record. However, the Beijing-based company that ousted Uber Technologies Inc from China now needs to balance the interests of its more than 100 investors, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (阿里巴巴) and China’s sovereign wealth fund, said the people, who asked not to be named, because the matter is private. Chinese social media giant Tencent Holdings Ltd (騰訊) and Apple are considering whether they should join the investment on a pro rata basis to avoid a dilution of their stakes, the people said. It was unclear if the money would be coming from the Japanese company itself or its yet-to-close US$100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund. Didi, which last year amassed US$10 billion in cash and equivalents, will need to decide whether it will take the additional funds as it locks horns with Uber and Alphabet Inc in the development of driverless technology. The company is currently coping with stringent regulations limiting the number of private cars and drivers it operates, a regulatory uncertainty that might delay its timeline for an initial public offering, the people said. Didi spokeswoman Sun Liang (孫亮), Tencent spokeswoman Canny Lo (羅琳) and Apple spokeswoman Carolyn Wu (吳純) did not respond to requests for comment on funding. SoftBank spokesman Matthew Nicholson declined to comment. Billionaire SoftBank chairman Masayoshi Son is trying to close the Vision Fund, backed by his own company along with money from Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Development Co. Apple, Qualcomm Inc and Oracle Corp chairman Larry Ellison might invest US$1 billion each in the fund, people familiar with the matter have said. The fund’s mandate is to back next-generation technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things. SoftBank is already a backer of Didi’s, but Son might now be doubling down on a bet that technology will transform transportation in China — the same way he gambled on e-commerce giant Alibaba and shifts in domestic consumption. “The car-hailing business might be limited in market size, but if you look at the entire transport industry and possibilities, then Didi is very well positioned,” said Zhou Xin (周鑫), an Internet consultant at Beijing-based Trustdata. “Son bet on Alibaba years ago for the potential consumption upgrade that China would experience, investing in Didi would follow the same philosophy.” Didi, led by CEO Cheng Wei (程維), became China’s ride-sharing leader after buying out Uber’s domestic operations. As it does not charge taxi drivers any fees, the bulk of its revenue comes from taking a commission from rides in private cars and limos — a sector that has been hampered by stricter qualification requirements for drivers and cars. Earlier this month, it won an operating license from the Tianjin city government, affirming its right to legally operate in China. However, business in cities including Beijing and Shanghai remains dogged by stricter rules that, for example, require drivers to have local residency to operate. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 1712 times.

After Apply Pay becomes available, consumers would be able to use their iPhones and Apple Watches to make payments when they make purchases at physical stores, on apps and on Web sites, according to information on the Apple Web site. It said shoppers would simply need to place a finger on the Touch ID sensor and hold the iPhone within 2.5cm of a contactless reader to make a purchase. When using the Apple Watch, buyers need to double-click the side button and hold the display within 2.5cm of the contactless reader, then wait for a gentle tap that signals completion of the purchase, it added. It takes only a few seconds to complete a purchase, the Web site said. Apple said that seven banks are to be part of the initial launch of the Taiwanese service — Cathay United Bank Co (國泰世華銀行), CTBC Bank Co (中國信託銀行), E.Sun Commercial Bank (玉山銀行), Standard Chartered Bank, Taipei Fubon Commercial Bank (台北富邦銀行), Taishin International Bank (台新銀行) and Union Bank of Taiwan (聯邦銀行). The service is to be available to users of all credit cards issued by the seven banks, which have a total of more than 25 million credit cards in circulation, accounting for about 60 percent of the total credit cards in circulation in the nation, the Financial Supervisory Commission said. Convenience store chain FamilyMart (全家), and hypermarket and supermarket chains Pxmart (全聯), Carrefour, RT-Mart (大潤) and Amart (愛買) yesterday said that Apple Pay payments would be accepted at their stores once the service is launched. Apple Pay was introduced to the global market in September 2014, allowing contactless payments via iOS apps. Taiwan is the latest location to launch the Apple Pay system, which is already available in the US, Canada, Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore, Japan, China, Britain, France and Spain, among other nations.

Siri is rumored to get a boost in its level of artificial intelligence, sources from the development teams based in Israel told the site. The digital assistant will reportedly be able to carry out current voice commands and it will also be able to learn a user’s usage habits and offer different action options based on the context of content, similar to Samsung’s Bixby, the report said. Read: 4-Year-Old Boy Saves Unconscious Mother Using iPhone Touch ID, Siri To Call For Help [Listen] Siri is rumored to become an “integral part” of iMessage with the iOS 11 update. For example, Siri would be able to give restaurant recommendations, make a reservation or book an Uber “directly from the screen messages in an intuitive way,” The Verifier said. Siri is also rumored to be integrated into the iCloud, which will allow it to identify the connections between multiple devices under an Apple ID account and “continue to offer relevant actions and steps” from all gadgets, the report said. Apple is also expected to provide Siri with a broader range of voice commands for the Apple TV, according to the report. Furthermore, the next watchOS update will reportedly bring new “deep” and advanced possibilities to Siri for the Apple Watch. Read: iPhone 8 Will Have Hybrid Lightning-USB port, Apple Watch 3 Could Have LTE: Analyst Although these are just rumors, the report does align with other expectations. A Digitimes report in January also said Apple would revamp Siri this year to compete with Amazon’s Alexa and Google Assistant. Supply chain sources suggested Apple’s next iPhone lineup will feature an improved version of Siri. Meanwhile, a research note revealed last month said Apple has 1,000 engineers working on augmented reality in Israel. Apple’s iOS 11 update is expected to be released with the company’s newest iPhone lineup in September. However, Apple could give fans a glimpse of the update will include at the Worldwide Developers Conference 2017 in San Jose, Calif. in June.

Most noticeably we got updates to macOS and iOS, but Apple also jam-packed a ton of security fixes into all its software. Totaling nearly 350 known vulnerabilities, Apple has pushed to make all its software more secure. Starting with iOS 10.3, Apple’s latest version includes Find My AirPods, Apple’s new file system, CarPlay, and a few other small visual tweaks. With nearly every update Apple does, they also include a handful of security fixes that easily go unnoticed by the user. iOS 10.3 is no exception with over 85 different common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) listed. For example, iOS 10.3 fixes a security hole that allowed attackers to spam Safari with a ‘Cannot Open Page’ dialog. Lookout, a cybersecurity company, learned of the attack after one of their users complained of losing control over their browsing experience. The dialog was meant to trick users into eventually paying money to “unlock” their Safari browser. Another update for both iOS and macOS is a fix to a vulnerability where connecting to what appears to be a secure server actually opens the door for remote code execution. Talos, a threat intelligence organization, shared details on their CVE-2017-2485. The vulnerability discovered showed that when a Safari browser navigated to a HTTPS site, macOS and iOS would validate the invalid and malicious certificate leaving the user open to attack. Talos also mentioned that the vulnerability existed within Chrome as well. It’s important to understand that just because these vulnerabilities have been discovered and eventually fixed, proof that they were used in the wild is hard if not impossible to track. When companies release details of discoveries, as Lookout did, it can help to better understand real-world scenarios. Just in the past few weeks alone, WikiLeaks has released reports from previous exploits that the CIA used on iOS and Mac devices. While the reports were aged and shared outdated exploits, the sheer number of fixes that Apple released this week alone shows that many vulnerabilities still exist. In a world where cybersecurity is taking the front seat, remember to back up and secure your devices. The full list of Apple’s fixed CVEs from yesterday’s updates can be found over at their security updates page.

Apple first announced its plans to launch its e-wallet app in Taiwan in February 2017. While the news that Apply Pay is launching today did not come from an official Apple representative, an undisclosed bank representative working with Apply Pay said that he or she received notification of Apple Pay's Mar. 29 launch. Seven banks in Taiwan — Taishin International Bank, Taipei Fubon Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, Cathay United Bank, CTBC Bank, E.SUN Bank, and Union Bank of Taiwan — have signed up to allow their cards to be used via Apple Pay. Apple users with an iPhone 6 or any newer iPhone model are now able to scan their cards from any of these banks and pay at select stores that have a contactless point-of-sale terminal. Businesses Jumping On Apple Pay 　The Breeze Center, Far Eastern Department Stores, Sogo, Carrefour, and PXMart are four businesses that are capitalizing on Apply Pay's launch from the get-go, allowing the e-wallet service to be used at their stores starting today. The service can also be used at FamilyMarts throughout the country, but only for users with Taishin International Bank cards. FamilyMart will open up the service to CTBC Bank, Cathay United Bank, and E.SUN Bank in July. Owners of an iPad Air 2, iPad Pro, or an Apple Watch can use the service on their devices as well. Currently, users can register up to eight cards to their Apple Pay service. While it is essentially another mobile payment service, Apply Pay differentiates from the other e-wallet programs that already exist in Taiwan due to its two-factor authentication system. This authentication process uses a Touch ID, PIN, or passcode to successfully authorize the payment in process. The more widely-used option for Apply Pay would be the Touch ID authentication process, whereby one puts his or her finger to the power button to authorize the payment. E-Wallets in Taiwan Whether you are an iPhone user or not, there are plenty of mobile payment services available in Taiwan. These include GOMAJI, All Pay, Line Pay, and JKOS Pay. Furthermore, Samsung Pay and Google Pay, which have both been approved by Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Committee, will reportedly be launching in the country in May. As with the launch of other mobile wallets, Apply Pay will be accompanied by promotional events at the stores where it can be used. These include promotional events at Breeze Center, where users of Apple Pay who make purchases of at least NT$399 on any Thursday of the month will get a NT$100 coupon. It is expected that more promotional events will roll out as more stores start to allow Apple Pay.

 How one analyst thinks Apple could hit $200 Kif Leswing Mar. 28, 2017, 11:38 AM 2,057 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty/Andrew Burton UBS analyst Steven Milunovich believes Apple might be able to hit a $200 stock price if everything goes right for the company over the next few years.  "For Apple to hit $200, iPhone needs to continue to grow beyond F18, new product categories must be established, and buybacks should exceed $50bn per year, boosting the P/E to 17x," Milunovich wrote in a note distributed to clients on Tuesday.  Basically, Apple still has lots of upside left, even at its price of $141 at publication, especially if CEO Tim Cook decides to pursue more aggressive buybacks. However, Milunovich does see some downside risk too, especially if the iPhone underperforms and whatever next big product Apple is working on — the car, or augmented reality — gets delayed or underwhelms.  In the near term, UBS sees "double-digit" iPhone growth next year and high single-digit iPhone growth in fiscal 2019. Apple's iPhone performance will affect "Apple's narrative" as it goes through three phases, according to the note. First comes the "super cycle" later this year, as a redesigned iPhone spurs a bunch of user upgrades, then it shifts to an "sustainable growth phase," as Apple's services business throws off reliable annual revenue, and finally, in 2019 and beyond, Apple will move into an "innovation phase" as it chases the next big thing.  "As investors adjust to a post-super cycle reality and become comfortable with new growth expectations, we expect focus to shift to 'the next big thing,'" Milunovich wrote.  Here's the most likely scenario, according to Milunovich, which sees Apple stock hitting about $175 in two to three years:  UBS Here's the scenario which could take Apple to $200 by 2019: UBS UBS rates Apple a "buy" and raised its 12-month price target to $151.  Visit Markets Insider for constantly updated market quotes for individual stocks, ETFs, indices, commodities and currencies traded around the world.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. By Glenn Fleishman Senior Contributor, Macworld | Mar 27, 2017 5:15 PM PT Credit: Apple More like this How to choose the best Wi-Fi replacement for your Apple AirPort routers Review: Refined iOS 6 highlighted by stunning Maps overhaul The 10 must-have utilities for macOS Sierra Video Tim Cook speaks cybersecurity at Stanford Earlier on Monday, my wife let me know that “Apple Support” had called about iCloud security. She was dubious, and rightly so. “Apple” then called five more times (and counting). Suffice it to say, it wasn’t Apple, but fraudsters trying to piggyback on reports that a major breach of iCloud credentials could render hundreds of millions of accounts vulnerable. Apple says no such breach occurred, and security researchers, like Troy Hunt of HaveIBeenPwned.com, say the group trying to extort Apple likely has reused credentials from other sites’ password leaks. (We recommend turning on two-factor authentication at iCloud regardless.) However, media reporting an potential iCloud security failure makes unsolicited calls claiming to be from Apple more credible. My wife wasn’t taken in, but also didn’t immediately dismiss the call. She hung up, and then told me about it. We have Apple devices and both use iCloud, and we have regular issues with iCloud not working precisely as we expect. While Macworld readers may already know these sorts of calls are a scam, it’s vital to alert friends, family, and colleagues about such calls and help immunize them from falling for it. Many of these services sound and act professional, and have been victimizing Windows users for years. Below are some of the “tells” for me that it was a fraud, and that you can teach others about: Apple called unsolicited: I’ve never had Apple call me—a consumer—for any reason I can recollect unless I called them first, and it’s always a human being calling back. Apple notes this on its phishing tips page: “If you get an unsolicited call from someone claiming to be from Apple, hang up and contact us directly.” (Microsoft, Google, and others never place unsolicited calls, either.) The call was automated: The call used a fairly cheap sounding computer-synthesized voice. An Apple automated call would be much higher quality, and probably use a real person (or at worst, a Siri analog). We never give this number out: This is a home line we use effectively as a backup and for outgoing calls only. I can check via the Apple ID site which phone numbers I have provided, too. The message didn’t provide details: It offered an unfamiliar 855 toll-free number, and didn’t provide an apple.com address at which more details could be found or verified. The message offered to put me through “to a support adviser right now”: This is not what Apple calls its staff, nor a likely thing for Apple to offer. The Caller ID number didn’t say Apple on it: Caller ID can be faked (there’s no verification process), but the number displayed is from Milwaukie, Wisconsin. I also feel bad for the person whose number was impersonated. I found a real person’s name associated with the number via a reverse search and his address. The Caller ID number has a shady history: The 855 number provided, when I searched on it via Google, has been used for at least a week with “Apple Support” scams. They called back multiple times: If I wasn’t sure at first, the five additional calls throughout the day make it clear it wasn’t Apple. A common threat These scams are abundant in a lot of different ways, though they typically target Windows users, either through unsolicited calls or pop-up messages on sites of dubious quality, because of the sheer number of Windows users. They try to get you to let them connect to your computer via a reverse screen share using one of the many free sites that provide person-to-person screen sharing and control. Then, they claim to have scanned your computer, found malware, and ask for payment so they can “fix” your computer. In the process, they install adware and sometimes malware, as well as charge a high or recurring fee on your credit card or both. Try to help those you know train themselves to be alert for scams, whether they come from an unsolicited call or via a pop-up, and call or text you (or, with work, an IT support person) first before they provide any personal information or credit-card details. These scams rely on fear and plausibility. By teaching people what to look for and, most importantly, to confirm details and wait before acting, you can help subvert them.

One technology Apple has explored is ultrasonic imaging. A previous patent described this method as ‘the most accurate but least common finger-scanning technology,’ and another patent today further emphasizes this technology. Apple says that the new technology avoids two major issues with fingerprint sensors today, including the existing Touch ID sensors. Contaminants such as grease, lotion, dirt, sweat, and food particles on a finger can degrade a captured fingerprint image, which can prevent a fingerprint sensing device from matching the captured fingerprint image to a known fingerprint image. Alternatively, a finger contacting an input surface of the fingerprint sensing device with too much or too little pressure can reduce the quality of the captured fingerprint image and prevent the fingerprint sensing device from recognizing the user. The patent says that this method would benefit sensors both embedded into the display and traditional fingerprint sensors.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Patent points towards possible Apple Watch feature in which some notifications are suppressed while driving Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Friday, March 24th, 2017, 05:19 Category: Apple, Apple Watch, News, Patents This could be handy as well as increase your safety in the car. A recently published patent application that was filed last fall and awarded today shows that Apple might refocus the Apple Watch to determine when you’re driving based on motion detection, then change what alerts are sent, how many you can receive, and where you receive them. Apple even considers which alerts may be too important to hide while driving: In some embodiments, notifications are completely prevented while the user is controlling the vehicle. In other embodiments, high priority notifications such as emergency calls are permitted while low priority notifications such as incoming e-mails are suppressed. Apple’s description within the patent describes how the feature could be customized by either the user or the car manufacturer. As such, some amounts and types of notifications could be set by the user while the manufacturer controlled other alerts. In some embodiments, the wearable device may instead re-route notifications from the device display or speakers to interface elements within the vehicle, such as an in-dash or heads up display or vehicle speakers, rather than preventing notifications from reaching the user. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Hidden changes in iOS 10.3 will give your iPhone a speed boost Image Source: Oliur Rahman, Pexels Zach Epstein @zacharye March 28th, 2017 at 10:43 AM Share Tweet After releasing a few hundred different beta versions over the past month or so, Apple on Monday finally released iOS 10.3 to the public. Eager iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users rushed to download and install the update, and they were greeted with some nifty new features. In a post on Monday afternoon, we went through the eight best new features in iOS 10.3, including a new Find My AirPods feature, updates to the Maps app, Apple’s new file system and more. There was one feature in particular that we listed in the post that deserves more attention though, and not many people realize it’s even there. Don't Miss: It’s probably time to admit the Galaxy S8 design is better than Apple’s iPhone 7 design When Apple releases any new iOS software, hardcore Apple fans always rush to download and install it immediately, regardless of what new features Apple adds. This is a good thing for many reasons, not the least of which is the fact that new iOS software always includes security updates that are crucial. iOS 10.3 is no different — it’s packed full of security fixes that users should be eager to install immediately. Of course, the user-facing features are typically the main draw for new iOS updates, and iOS 10.3 has a few nice additions and changes. One set of changes in particular is worth noting, but it’s hiding in plain sight so most iPhone and iPad users won’t even notice it’s there. Apple engineer Renaud Lienhart‏ tweeted on Monday afternoon about something that we mentioned in passing in our post covering the best new features in iOS 10.3. “iOS 10.3 feels ‘snappier,'” he said, “because many animations were slightly tweaked & shortened, for the better.” iOS 10.3 feels “snappier” because many animations were slightly tweaked & shortened, for the better. — Renaud Lienhart (@NotoriousBUGS) March 28, 2017 Long story short, Apple has made a number of small adjustments to the animations that are played when the user does things like opening an app, closing an app, or switching from one app to another. Longtime iPhone users may recall that Apple did something similar back in 2014 with iOS 7.1. The speed difference back then was much more dramatic and noticeable, but the improvements in iOS 10.3 are still nothing to scoff at.

Cardiff Crown Court heard the incident occurred in St David’s shopping centre around 6.15pm on Friday, February 17. In his sentencing remarks Recorder Gregory Treverton-Jones QC said: “This was a smash-and-grab raid by this gang.” Prosecutors said six men travelled from London for the raid targeting the Apple Store but only one was caught – Florin Moise. Prosecutor Nuhu Gobir said a member of staff saw the men enter the store together and heard the security alarms go off about 30 seconds later. The court heard the men were seen “grabbing” iPhones from display tables and running off. Mr Gobir said the defendant was caught by a security guard and police officer and found to be carrying four iPhones worth about £3,000. Moise was arrested and immediately admitted the offence. Six men were involved in the raid in the Apple store in Cardiff's St David's Centre in February Read More A porn addict bar manager who sexually assaulted a woman at knifepoint was caught because of his distinctive trainers He told officers he had met the other men in a Paddy Power betting shop and they had asked him if he wanted to make some money. The defendant said he had travelled to Cardiff from London with the men and accepted entering the Apple store, grabbing the iPhones, and running away. Moise told police he had intended to hand the phones over to the men and was expecting to make about £400 in cash. Prosecutors said 14 phones worth a total of £10,626 were stolen. Four were recovered from the defendant including one with more than £800 worth of damage. (Photo: PA) Read More Double murderer's sentence won't be reviewed despite complaints it was too lenient The court heard Moise was convicted in January 2015 of stealing a mobile phone and was committed to prison for four weeks, suspended for a year. But that sentence was activated just days later following another theft offence. Prosecutors said Moise had a further conviction for theft after stealing items from the Apple Store at Cribbs Causeway in Bristol in April last year. The court heard he also had convictions from France and Spain. Moise, 20, from Cavendish Gardens in Barking, London, admitted joint theft from a shop. Father-of-three Florin Moise, 20, said he took part in the theft after losing his wages on a gambling machine (Photo: South Wales Police) Read More A man was crushed to death when a dumper truck driven by his brother accidentally reversed into him Jon Lewis, defending, said his client was born in Romania and moved to the UK with his family in 1998 when he was two. He said Moise was not educated and started working as a labourer as soon as he could. The court heard he has recently worked as a painter and decorator, earning £40 a day, to support his long-term partner and their three young children. Mr Lewis said: “He works extremely hard but a year ago he became addicted to roulette machines.” He said on the day of the incident Moise had put all his wages into a gambling machine and lost them. The court heard he did not want to tell his family about his gambling addiction so when he met the gang in the betting shop decided to join them in the theft. Mr Lewis stressed his client made “full and frank admissions” and has not used a gambling machine since. St David's shopping centre Read More Burglar targeted Swansea charity shops stealing hundreds of pounds and trashing offices Addressing the defendant, Recorder Treverton-Jones said: “You all grabbed as many mobile phones as you could get your hands on.” He noted Moise had a “bad criminal record” and had previously targeted Apple products. The judge said he was satisfied there was planning and premeditation and described the offending as “very serious”. He noted none of the other men involved were arrested but said they would all have been equally responsible. Moise was sentenced to 12 months in a young offender institution.

It lets you scroll through longs lists with ease and contains other user-facing features and under-the-hood improvements. For instance, rented iTunes movies can be finally enjoyed on other devices. And with the updated Remote app, you can control the set-top box via your iPad or other iOS device, browse your playlists and more. Be sure to watch Andrew’s hands-on video for everything new in tvOS 10.2 and share your favorite new feature in comments. Everything new in tvOS 10.2 According to the official tvOS 10.2 changelog and Apple’s documentation for developers, tvOS 10.2 includes the following features and enhancements. Fast scroll iTunes movie rentals across all devices Support for iPad-optimized Remote app with new features Apple File System Improvements to Apple’s Device Enrollment Program Expanded Mobile Device Management The VideoToolbox framework Here’s Andrew’s hands-on video. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube By the way, Apple File System is now the standard mass storage format across iOS 10.3, watchOS 3.2 and tvOS 10.2. It’s coming later this year to your Mac. Fast scroll This is a great time-saver. In tvOS 10.2, scrolling through long lists is now faster than ever before with several large swipes of your Siri Remote automatically invoking this mode. Simply swipe on the right edge on Siri Remote’s Touch surface to scroll rapidly through lists. If a list has an index such as your song collection in the Music app, you can quickly jump forward or backward, which is totally great. Remote control from iPad The Apple TV Remote app was updated yesterday with full support for iPad. On your tablet, you can now swipe to navigate the entirety of the tvOS user interface, interact with your Apple TV through Siri, control tvOS games with tilt controls and more. Aside from iPad compatibility, the Apple TV Remote app enhances interactions with your media with the ability to select movie chapters, audio tracks and closed captions. You can also see music lyrics and playlists in the app. Read more about this app in our article from yesterday. Grab the Apple TV Remote app on App Store. Owners of older-generation Apple TV models should use the old Remote app, now called iTunes Remote. Rent once, watch anywhere Now when you rent an iTunes movie, you can watch it across all your devices provided they use the same Apple ID. Previously, movie rentals were limited to specific devices and you couldn’t rent a movie on your iPhone and watch it on your Apple TV. Watching movies rented on one device on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch requires iOS 10.3. On desktop, iTunes 12.6 for Mac or Windows is needed to enable this functionality. Aside from the aforementioned features, tvOS 10.2 includes general performance and stability improvements and is packed with fixes that increase your security and privacy, outlined in Apple’s support document. So, what’s your favorite new feature in tvOS 10.2 so far?

Mike P The headphone jack is cool, the weakspot for atv remote is the touch pad. It’s either too sensitive or not responsive. Pos. rfr1 What it still doesn’t have is the ability for the TV App to go into your own movies under Computer. This I have never been able to understand. Maybe this new filing system will allow Apple to do this. It’s all in iTunes, so why has it not been done?

Josh Elliott, CTVNews.ca @joshelliott14 Published Tuesday, March 28, 2017 11:14AM EDT Time to load up on HD movies and games. Apple device owners may find they suddenly have a lot more storage space for music, videos, photos and apps, thanks to an iOS update that improves the way data is processed and stored on all Apple devices. Scroll down or click here to vote in our poll of the day  The new update, dubbed iOS 10.3, comes with a variety of storage and security improvements, as well as new functionalities for Siri, Apple's voice-activated digital assistant. Siri can now access a variety of apps, including Uber, photo streams, payment services and internet phone apps. But the feature most tech junkies are excited about is the new Apple File System, or APFS. APFS stores information differently from Apple's old Hierarchical File System, which the company has been using for its products since the 1980s. The differences are highly technical, but for the lay user, AFPS will mean more efficient file storage, better file encryption and an overall faster experience when using Apple devices. Computer program-savvy users hailed the new file system (and extra storage space) on Twitter. On iOS 10.2 I had 215GB and now on iOS 10.3 with APFS I have 220GB of free storage! That's amazing!!!!!! — Jonny (@jonnymmxvi) March 28, 2017 iPhone users latest iOS update 10.3 should Increase storage quite a bit with the new apple file management system,worth updating if your low — Cåthał (@Butlawr) March 28, 2017 Storage space before and after updating iOS 10.3 It's mandatory to back-up your phone before you update. pic.twitter.com/r8PWuqxwc5 — Edmarkson (@YumsNavs) March 28, 2017 IOS 10.3 adds a wide range of car-related functionality to Siri, including a "find my parked car" function, and the ability to interact with CarPlay. Through CarPlay, Siri can check the status of your vehicle's lights, locks and fuel levels, among other things, and toggle them if something is amiss (i.e. turn off your headlights if you forgot). The update also improves the Find My iPhone app so users can locate their fancy new AirPod earphones, which are tiny, wireless and extremely easy to lose. Other notable improvements include the ability to share podcast episodes through iMessage, unified settings for all devices using your Apple ID, and access to iTunes movie rentals across all devices.

In a new post shared on f.lux’s forum, a member of the team broke down why f.lux may be the better option over Apple’s similar offering. Both systems set out to enhance your sleep cycle by reducing blue light appearances on-screen, but f.lux may be the option that truly succeeds. Night Shift is Apple’s answer to the f.lux app. The general idea behind both systems is to alter the colors your display is outputting. Specifically, lowering the output of blue light from a digital display to help make it easier for your body to fall back into a natural circadian rhythm. While at first glance it appeared Apple’s take on adjusting the display’s color and lighting would ‘sherlock‘ f.lux, that doesn’t appear to be the case. In the post shared today, a member of the f.lux team shared some data to show why. From Apple’s Night Shift support page: Studies have shown that exposure to bright blue light in the evening can affect your circadian rhythms and make it harder to fall asleep. Night Shift uses your computer’s clock and geolocation to determine when it’s sunset in your location. It then automatically shifts the colors in your display to the warmer end of the spectrum. In the morning it returns the display to its regular settings. According to f.lux, the problem with Night Shift’s implementation is that they are not reducing the blue light levels enough. A color intensity chart shows that Night Shift barely reduces the blue light levels right before a user’s typical bedtime. Night Shift’s blue light reduction levels In Night Shift’s version of color adjustment, there is still a significant amount of blue light present. This looks different to f.lux’s own implementation which brings down the blue light levels dramatically. f.lux’s blue light reduction levels As the forum post notes, color alone isn’t enough to adjust the circadian system. Our circadian system is actually not reacting to small changes in “color”. Instead, it is mostly reacting to the “amount” of light. Our eyes are extremely good at distinguishing little shades of color from each other, but this is a different system than the one that drives circadian rhythms. The entire post is worth a read to learn more from the team that has spent the past few years getting their software just right. With this new information in mind, are you dropping f.lux in favor of Night Shift?

UBS sees Apple hitting $200 in two to three years if things go well, but this won't necessarily mean a $1 trillion market cap for the consumer tech giant. Rick Munarriz (TMFBreakerRick) Mar 28, 2017 at 10:27AM Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) hit another all-time high last week, and now an analyst is tossing out the nice round target of $200 as the consumer tech giant's next big goal. To be fair, Steven Milunovich at UBS isn't suggesting that Apple will hit that mark in the next few months or even a year from now. He sees that happening over the next two to three years if things play out well for Apple. We're still talking about a pretty big milestone for a stock that was trading in the double digits as recently as this past summer. Milunovich feels that the path to $200 will require Apple executing well through three important phases in the near future. The first is the "Supercyle" phase that should kick in when the iPhone 8 rolls out later this year. The hype is deafening for the bar-raising features that Apple will be incorporating for the smartphone update to commemorate the release of the original iPhone 10 summers ago. The next cycle will be a sustainable growth phase, as Apple leverages its growing installed base. We're already seeing Apple executing on that front with services revenue growing faster than its hardware segments. The final cycle is innovation, and that's naturally going to be a wild card. Many of the features rumored to be incorporated into the iPhone 8 are already available in high-end Android handsets. Apple will need to create a new product category, but history is on its side. This is, after all the company that got us to buy smartphones, tablets, and, more recently, smartwatches when the first wave of pioneers sputtered. Image source: Apple. The path to a $1 trillion market cap Hitting $200 in a couple of years may also mean that Apple will crack through the mystical market cap milestone of $1 trillion, but let's not set that hurdle in stone. Milunovich feels that innovation, execution, and accelerated share buybacks are the keys to getting to $200 by 2020. It's those stock repurchases that could get in the way of $200 translating into a 13-figure market cap. Apple is generating a lot of money, and it's returning a good chunk of that to investors through dividends and share buybacks. It had a weighted average of 5.328 billion fully diluted shares outstanding in its latest quarter, a tally that would translate into a market cap of nearly $1.07 trillion at the $200 price point. However, the iEverything company has been a voracious eater of its own cooking. You have to go all the way back to the final quarter of fiscal 2012 to find the last time that Apple's share count didn't decrease sequentially, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data.  The company's diluted share count has declined by more than 9% over the past two years and more than 15% over the past three years. All that Apple has to do is repurchase more than 7% of its current shares for $200 to amount to a market cap that is less than $1 trillion.  If you're an investor, you should be fine with that. It's a stock's price, not its market cap, that dictates your position's appreciation. Lowering its share count also makes Apple's earnings growth stronger on a per-share basis. Apple knows what it's doing, but if you own the stock, you already knew that.   Rick Munarriz owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Although an obvious challenger to Snapchat, Clips is different in that, rather than seeking to build a network of its own, it plans to work through the already existing platforms of Snapchat, Instagram and Messenger. _____________________________ Guest post by Karol Severin of Midia Yesterday Apple announced it will launch Clips in April, a video-making app that allows users to capture photos and videos, combine multiple videos and include a variety of features like Filters, Overlays, Posters and Live Titles. We can draw many similarities between Clips and the already existing features of Snapchat, Instagram and Messenger. However, the key difference is that Clips is not attempting to build a stand-alone network. Instead, it acts as a production tool and encourages sharing across all existing platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and even Snapchat. Although the main emphasis is to encourage sharing via iMessage, the option of social network freedom is nevertheless there. Until now, the mass-market video messaging features have been largely tied to the boundaries of their parent platforms. Users post Snaps on Snapchat, Stories on Instagram and Days on Messenger. To take part in advanced video messaging, users had to use at least one of these social networks, often multiple ones, as different social circles use different platforms. Users often tend to post content only on the one channel they find most relevant. With Clips, users can now make one Clip and share with their peers on Snapchat, their mother on Instagram and their grandfather on Facebook in one seamless session – or use iMessage to share it with their phone contacts. Apple encourages users to engage with the latter by deploying its face recognition technology that automatically suggests to share the clips with the people featured in the video. Why Is Apple Doing This? Apple rightly recognized that advanced video messaging features have grown so popular,that they have become a major product differentiator in the war of social networks. Apple has always been all about making consumers’ lives easier with user-friendly products. If mobile users have now evolved to expect a great photo/video messaging production experience as a standard, it is in Apple’s utmost interest to deliver it better than any non-Apple product can. Because of this, it is highly unlikely that we are going to see an Android version anytime soon (unless the uptake on iOS exceeds all expectations and a scalable opportunity emerges to drive potential new Apple users into the pipeline). Apple is joining the trend of making video messaging features a part of its own product differentiation, but it does it in a completely different, competitive landscape. While most companies use video messaging features to differentiate their social media platforms, no other smartphone manufacturers do so at scale. Implications Besides creating a new product differentiator for iOS that will help drive further brand loyalty, Clips may disrupt both Snap Inc. and Facebook Inc.. If consumers start using Clips to produce photo and video messages at scale, all social networks risk a decrease in their average session lengths as a result. Even worse however, is their risk of losing a portion of the high-value Apple users, who may simply choose to start sharing via the iMessage app. This in turn could threaten the value for advertisers and subsequently drive ad-inventory prices down. This is much more of an existential threat for Snapchat than Facebook, because the former is amidst figuring out its business model and it does not have a solid foothold globally. After losing its product differentiation in the social messaging space, it will now face additional competitive pressures from the most valuable company in the world.

Apple’s lawyers drop BIG hint about return of retro device Official documents suggest Apple could be working on a new device...but it's a blast from the past By Margi Murphy 28th March 2017, 4:00 pm Updated: 28th March 2017, 4:30 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments APPLE has filed a worldwide trademark for the word “PowerBook” in the UK and worldwide – sparking speculation that its bringing back its first ever laptop. The first PowerBook – with its signature trackball, floppy disc reader and colourful Apple logo – launched in 1991 and was replaced by the MacBook in 2006. macrumors 3 The MacBook is extremely popular Back in the early noughties, interim CEO Steve Jobs turned his efforts to the redesign of the PowerBook and produced the first laptop of its kind perfect for watching widescreen films. Lighter than most gadgets on the market, it was billed as the “first supercomputer you can actually take with on on an airplane”. In February Apple was granted an application to trademark PowerBook worldwide, suggesting that the Macintosh flagship might be making a comeback. Leaked Apple designs show what iPhone could have been DANASIBERA 3 The Apple PowerBook 150 was released in 1994 SERGED 3 The PowerBook 5300 were released in 1995 Thomas La Perle, Apple's legal director applied for the trademark, which is registered to the technology company's HQ at 1 Infinite Loop Cupertino, San Jose. Apple have not confirmed whether this is the case, and there are a number of reasons why lawyers are sending off applications to protect its property. But it follows a trend for stripping its new launches back to their original models. The iPad Air, for example, was last week replaced by the iPad, which first launched in 2010 by Steve Jobs. The iPhone 8, tipped to be released in September, could be simply called the iPhone, in commemoration of its tenth anniversary. A HUGE release is expected to mark the occasion. It'ss expected to boast some incredible new tech but ditch some familiar features. Only small crowds waited outside Apple stores to snap up the new iPhone 7 We pay for your stories!

That initial ruling was made last May by Beijing's Intellectual Property Office which claimed that the American tech giant had violated the design patent of smartphone startup Shenzhen Baili with its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, barring the phones from being sold in Beijing because they had "copied" the exterior design of the Baili 100C smartphone -- which is characterized by a curved edge and rounded corners. "Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus have minor differences from Baili's 100C. The differences are so tiny that the average customer could not notice. So, this case falls into the patent rights protection category," the office said. Can you tell the difference? For some bizarre reason, the judgement did not extend to the iPhone 6S or iPhone 6S Plus which have an identical appearance to the models affected by the ruling. Fortunately, sales of the iPhone 6 were not actually suspended in Beijing as Apple quickly appealed the order. Finally, the city's Intellectual Property Office overturned the initial decision last Friday, ruling that Apple had not violated Baili's patent after all. According to AFP, the court said that the iPhone 6 included features which "completely change the effect of the entire product ... and both phones are easily distinguishable in the eyes of consumers." Back in 2014, Shenhen Baili was a promising Chinese smartphone company with investment backing from Baidu. Since then however the company has become infamous among consumers for making shoddy phones, and has been squashed underneath the weight of its more successful domestic rivals. By the time that Baili filed its suit against Apple, the company "barely existed" and its 100C smartphones were impossible to actually find. But, to be fair to Baili, these Chinese companies, like Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo, have managed to best Apple as well in China, sending the California-based company's market share plummeting in the last few years. Of course, it also hasn't helped that Apple has been victimized by protective Chinese courts and laws. Last April, the company lost its fourth appeal in a bizarre copyright case against a Chinese technology company which markets its leather goods (such as mobile phone cases) with an "iPHONE" trademark. And yet, somehow, none of these is the most bizarre lawsuit filed against Apple in China over the past year.

While this tracking is purely done through an app at the moment, the firm's CEO has bold ambitions for Clue. In a new interview, Ida Tin, CEO of Clue, said that she hopes Apple will soon make a device that women can put inside their bodies to track their menstrual cycle. Scroll down for video  In a new interview, Ida Tin, CEO of Clue, said that she hopes Apple will soon make a device that women can put inside their bodies to track their menstrual cycle (stock image) WHAT IS CLUE?  Clue is a female health app that uses science and data to help women discover the unique patterns in their menstrual cycle. It reminds users about their period, PMS and their fertile window. Women can also track sex, pain, moods, cervical fluid, and birth control. A recent update also introduced the option to connect with partners, friends and family to open up the conversation about menstrual health.  Ms Tin was speaking to Business Insider about the Berlin startup scene, and where she sees the firm in the future. Clue is a tracking app to help women understand what is going on in their menstrual cycles and their bodies more broadly. Speaking to Business Insider, Ms Tin said: 'The core of Clue is really to enable people to understand what's going on with their body and I think you can provide that value through an app but it could also take many forms. 'But the core thing now and for the foreseeable future is the app.' Clue has previously worked with Apple, launching its app on both iOS and for the Apple Watch.

She said: 'There's much more we could explore with them which I feel we could do if we just got our act together.' In the short-term Ms Tin said that Clue and Apple could work together to create a standard for data collection.

'We could create that standard and we are not doing that yet.' But on a more ambitious scale, Ms Tin explained her idea for a sensor that Apple could develop that would sit within the body to track the menstrual cycle. Clue has previously worked with Apple, launching its app on both iOS and for the Apple Watch (pictured) In the short-term Ms Tin said that Clue and Apple could work together to create a standard for data collection She said: 'I feel there is so much potential with building sensors that can go into the body on a molecular level. 'I had an idea for such a sensor almost 10 years ago and I don't know how it's possible that it's not on the street yet as a product. 'I feel like some of the big diagnostic companies and pharmaceutical companies have been sleeping. 'If Apple is really serious about health can they build something that would make me look into the body? 'When the Apple Watch first came out I thought it would do blood monitoring through the skin and stuff like that. Like really cool stuff. That I would be very excited about. But it doesn't do that.'

Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant.

The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart.

(Reuters/Beck Diefenbach) Share Written by Mike Murphy March 27, 2017 Apple released the latest version of its computer operating system today, MacOS 10.12.4. One the new features included in the update is called “Night Shift,” which first appeared on iOS mobile devices in 2016. It allows users to adjust the color temperature of their device’s display, turning down the amount of blue light, and making the screen look warmer. This, theoretically, puts less strain on your eyes when looking at the screen in low light, or at night. While Apple has said it could potentially help you get “a better night’s sleep,” it’s not entirely clear whether that is the case. Activate Night Shift mode on your Mac and spare your eyes https://t.co/mWKlsdhMOK #apple #mac pic.twitter.com/CJ49k1PgSE — Jaime Gutiérrez  (@jaguti80) March 11, 2017 Either way, Night Shift definitely makes screens feel less harsh when viewed in low light, and users can now make the displays on their Mac laptops and desktops warmer at night. Mac owners can also set timers so that Night Shift comes on at specific times every day, gradually reducing the amount of blue light over the course of the evening. It’ll be interesting to see how the app will compare to the popular F.lux program, which has been doing the same thing for years, and was barred from launching an iOS app, months before Apple first released Night Shift for iOS.

More like this Copying the copier: The iPhone 8 is a total ripoff Stone tablets: Why do tablet sales keep sliding? Mythperceptions: No, Apple is actually pretty good at design Video Watch SwapBots spring to life thanks to augmented reality One thing it’s important to keep in mind in regards to technology is that not everyone has the same needs or preferences. And that’s… OK. Writing for Gizmodo, Alex Cranz declares “Samsung's New iPad Pro Is Just Fantastic.” (Tip o’ the antlers to @designheretic and 5cat.) Cranz is having a little fun at our expense by making a nod to Samsung repeatedly taking design inspiration from “the natural evolution of design” which is to say copying whatever Apple does. Technically, if you want to be “accurate”… Then please do not read jokey-titled articles. OK, we get that. …this is not an iPad Pro… Yes, when it comes to ripping off Apple, Samsung draws the line at the wholesale copying of the name! It’s about ethics in copyright infringement, people. The hardware, Cranz readily admits, is “Apple-inspired”. And the software? Android as an operating system really doesn’t work in a tablet form. Only a smattering of apps are actually optimized for the landscape mode we use tablets in. So, how many can we put you down for? A gross? Well, they’re all gross. Ha-ha. Also, we only sell them that way. Cranz seems like an odd choice to review a tablet since she doesn’t seem to think much of tablets in general, but maybe nobody else at Gizmodo does either and she drew the short straw. This isn’t for business use, or as a primary device for students, or a necessity for artists. Its a pure luxury item Samsung and Apple like to insist we need… We keep having this argument. Why do we keep having this argument? Is the Macalope slurring his words as he types them? How would he even do that? Look, some people are actually able to replace their laptops with tablets. The Macalope knows pundits have deliberately stuffed hamsters in their ears so they can’t hear that fact but it’s still a fact. That’s the thing about facts, they don’t go away if you just ignore them. Also, take the hamster out of your ears because PETA is on the phone. The Galaxy Tab S3 itself costs the same as the iPad Pro, but it comes with a stylus so the combination of stylus and tablet makes it cheaper than the comparable iPad offering. It’s a $100 less than an iPad Pro and Pencil and the only true downside is how tablet-unfriendly Android can occasionally be. That’s all?! Just having to deal with interfaces that are constantly fighting you?! Wow! Eternal aggravation is such a small price to pay. Is there some way the Macalope can get this tablet into his mouth right now? Because he can’t wait. That’s a pretty dang minor downside in my book. Is your book the Necronomicon? As iPad knock-offs go, the Galaxy Tab S3 reigns supreme. As far as Elvis impersonators go, not only is Gary Klonwitz of Reno, Nevada cheap, he is also excruciating to work with. OK, the Macalope can see how someone might think suffering quietly through a poor user experience might be worth a hundred bucks. He suspects, however, that he uses his tablet more than Cranz uses hers and therein lies the difference.

Authorities say that Rezakhani began reselling Apple products while he was an 18-year-old student at the University of Washington, acting as the middle man, to resell the tech on to distributors across America and the Middle East. Between 2009 and his eventual arrest, he moved millions of dollars worth of iPhones and other Apple products which he used to fund his playboy lifestyle, SeattlePi.com reports. Seattle playboy Maziar Rezakhani is being forced to hand over his Ferrari collection and high end penthouse after he conned Apple out of $3 million (Rezakhani was caught on camera buying tiles he would later claim that angry workers had used to replace iPhones in his order) The 27-year-old, who also failed to pay his taxes, drove expensive foreign cars including two Ferraris, a Mercedes and a Range Rover which each had a personalized number plate, leased a $26,265 a-month luxury penthouse and claimed he was earning a 7-figure income. His scheme even forced the Foundation Bank's sale last year after they lost $3 million - which was 'very significant to a small, local bank.' RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Tennessee couple are arrested after they tried to SELL their... Moscow police kick and punch protesters in violent footage... Share this article Share 'This is the familiar story of unrelenting greed and lies winning out over hard work,' U.S. Attorney for Western Washington Annette L. Hayes said following Rezakhani's sentencing hearing.  'This defendant could have had all the cars and fancy apartments he wanted by running an honest and successful business. Instead, he deceived everyone in his path resulting in more than $3 million dollars of loss and a lot of innocent bank employees losing their jobs.' The fraudster has now been forced to hand over much of the trappings of his luxury lifestyle including his cars and penthouse.  Between 2009 and his eventual arrest, he moved millions of dollars worth of iPhones and other Apple products which he used to fund his playboy lifestyle of luxury cars including two Ferraris, a Mercedes and a Range Rover) He also leased a $26,265 a-month luxury penthouse (pictured) and claimed he was earning a 7-figure income Rezakhani had been under investigation for almost two years before his October 2015 arrest. Prosecutors say that his schemes became increasingly bold over time.  One of his earliest plots was when he tried to steal $700,000 of iPhones by claiming they were lost in the mail - managing to steal $300,000. Rezakhani told FedEx investigators that almost iPhone 5s phones had been replaced with kitchen tiles. To make the scam more believable, investigators found anti-Apple leaflets reading 'iSlave' and named Foxconn, a Chinese electronics manufacturer notable for its poor treatment of workers. The scheme appears to have been concocted as to make it appear that it was disgruntled workers that had replaced the electronics - despite the fact that the iPhones were actually sent out from multiple locations making it impossible for them all to have come from the one site. Surveillance footage also captured Rezakhani buying the kitchen tiles days before he bought the phones. Yet, he was able to persuade his creditors to pay out $340,000 at Apple's expense. In one scheme, Rezakhani told FedEx investigators that almost iPhone 5s phones had been replaced with kitchen tiles To make the scam more believable, investigators found anti-Apple leaflets reading 'iSlave' and named Foxconn He went onto claim more iPhones were stolen in the mail in July 2015, staking a $5 million fake insurance claim that the tech was replaced with stone blocks - which he was again seen buying days before. Rezakhani also claimed a burglar had stolen 625 iPhones from his parents' home. However, by this time, agents were watching him and his home and were aware it had not been burgled. 'Over time, Mr. Rezakhani's fraud schemes grew in their audacity as Mr. Rezakhani increased the stakes' Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Werner said in court papers. 'Each offense preyed on the willingness of others to believe Rezakhani,' Werner continued. 'Of course, the victims were no match for Rezakhani's willingness to deceive.   Investigators say Rezakahani and a co-conspirator used 'runners' who would buy the phones from Apple retailers, before Rezakahani would repackage them at his parents' Seattle home and ship them to Dubai and the Middle East.  The fraudster used several companies to legitimize and manage his scheme, including NeoAce - a Dubai reseller - while Washington firm GTE Holdings, transferred about $50 million between itself and NeoAce between 2011 and 2013. In another, he claimed that more than $5 million worth of phones had been replaced by bricks Rezakhani eventually began using the new loans to pay off his old ones and was $2.8 million in debt by the time he was caught by the FBI He was also propping up the scheme by taking out huge loans by providing fake documents and tax returns to open huge lines of credit. Rezakhani eventually began using the new loans to pay off his old ones and was $2.8 million in debt by the time he was caught by the FBI. In August, the playboy pleaded guilty to mail fraud, bank fraud and filing a false tax return. He admitted faking the stolen mail, lying to obtain the $4 million Foundation Bank loan and hiding $355,000 in income from the IRS.  He has since agreed to pay the IRS and to repay Foundation Bank $3.1 million, and another $349,000 to Apple on top of the $3.3 million he has agreed to forfeit to the government.  Read more: Feds: Young millionaire¿s iPhone fraud broke a Seattle bank - seattlepi.com Share or comment on this article e-mail 6 shares Most watched News videos Dead man is cut out of the stomach of a seven metre long PYTHON Shocking moment a driver is punched through his car window Monkman gets the better of Seagull in University Challenge semi-final Maid caught on camera appearing to be POSSESSED by evil spirits Brazen man catches huge COBRA out of hole with his bare hands Mother films invasive TSA pat-down of her disabled teenage son Furious cyclist smashes driver's windscreen with his own bike New ISIS video shows child soldiers hunting and killing prisoners Shocking carer steals money out of dementia patient's handbag Medics fired after mocking patient on a surgery table Miraculous moment baby who was 'buried alive' is rescued in India Driver's hilarious attempt to squeeze car through tight gap Horrifying moment villagers cut open a giant python and...

 Apple just made a historic and risky change to all iPhones — and you probably didn't even notice Kif Leswing Mar. 28, 2017, 10:01 AM 291,103 facebook linkedin twitter email print Hollis Johnson/Business Insider Apple released a new update for iPhones and iPads on Monday with nifty features like Find My AirPods and Siri improvements, but most people won't even notice the biggest change. As part of the iOS 10.3 update, Apple changed a basic part of how every iPhone and iPad works — its file system, or the way the computer stores data and knows where and how to find it. With Monday's update, Apple updated iPhones and iPads to its new Apple File System, upgrading from HFS+, which was developed over 30 years ago. It was a smart move for the future. Apple File System "is optimized for Flash/SSD storage and features strong encryption ... and improved file system fundamentals" and should help iPhones and iPads run faster and more smoothly going forward, Apple says. It may even free up GBs of storage space once you update. But this was a risky move, too. Because a computer's file system is a fundamental part of the device, there was a chance, if something had gone wrong, that people's files could have been deleted, as Business Insider previously reported. The good news is that 12 hours after the update went out — and was downloaded by millions — there doesn't seem to be any major problems with the transition to Apple File System. That's a big achievement for the Apple employees working on it. If something had gone wrong, Apple would've heard about it, and it could've been bad if people actually lost their files. The one complaint is that the update takes a long time to install, and that's most likely because of the rewriting of the entire file system. Apple could've made a big deal about this achievement. I'm sure people at Microsoft and Google, which have to push similar major updates, took notice. But instead, it pulled it off without much fanfare, and most people won't even know their iPhones have changed in a big way.

By Oliver Cragg March 28, 2017 15:10 BST Apple's rumoured 'AR glasses' project could be held back until the 10th anniversary iPhone makes its debut.Reuters A new report claims that Apple has been working on a pair of augmented-reality glasses for over a year, but its secretive plan to transform AR into into tech's 'next big thing' may be kept under wraps until after the iPhone's 10th anniversary celebration later this year. With Apple's CEO Tim Cook talking up the technology in interviews as a more promising alternative to virtual reality, and growing evidence that a Cupertino-made pair of specs is on the way – potentially in collaboration with Carl Zeiss – Apple's rumoured goal of bringing AR to the masses seems all but certain. However, according to a Financial Times report, Apple is ensuring that its new project does not steal the spotlight away from the 2017 iPhone by holding off on showing its headgear until 2018 at the earliest. This lends credence to the idea that the "iPhone 8" could include AR capabilities via its rumoured new camera tech. Nevertheless, the report does state that the company's big augmented reality push will become the "top priority for its next big launch", ahead of Apple's automotive plans. "Apple first began to build a team to examine the feasibility of a head-worn device more than a year ago," claims FT. "Now, it is devoting more resources to its augmented-reality efforts, with the aim of taking it from a science project towards a consumer product." The report cites "people familiar with the company's plans," although Apple declined to comment on the claims. While a retail product is looking more and more likely to materialise from Apple's transparent interest in augmented reality, what exactly a Jony Ive-designed AR device would be like is another matter entirely. FT's report gives us a few more hints in this regard, noting that "[Apple's] engineers have become more adept at miniaturisation technology with products such as its AirPods wireless headphones and the iPad's Pencil," which it believes will result in a "light-field eyewear" with a smaller form factor and wider field of view than Microsoft's HoloLens, but "larger than a regular pair of glasses". As for price, the unnamed sources alleged that it could retail for "around $1,000" (£800, €920)when combined with the headgear's necessary accessories – reportedly a wearable pocket or belt attachment pack which provides battery and processing power. With the $3,000 Microsoft HoloLens aimed primarily at the business market, Google's Project Tango clawing the Silicon Valley giant back from the ignoble failure of Google Glass, mixed reality-championing start-up Magic Leap beset by legal troubles, and Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook waiting in the wings, Apple's entry into the nascent augmented reality landscape could define the technology's long-term future.

Apple rejected the app three times, calling it “excessively objectionable or crude content.” Over the years, I would occasionally resubmit the app, changing its name from Drones+ to Metadata+. I was curious to see if Apple might change its mind. The app didn’t include graphic images or video of any kind — it simply aggregated news about covert war. At its core was a question: do we want to be as connected to our foreign policy as we are to our smartphones? My hypothesis was no. Americans don’t care about the drone war because it is largely hidden from view. In 2014, after five rejections, Apple accepted the app. It remained in the App Store for about a year. According to Apple’s internal statistics, Metadata+ was downloaded by more than 50,000 people. But the following September, Apple decided to delete the app entirely. They claimed that the content, once again, was “excessively objectionable or crude.” Well, Apple’s position has evolved. Today, after 12 attempts, the Metadata app is back in the App Store.

Photo: Barkat Tareen/Getty Images As an artist who works with data, I think the story of this app is about more than a petty conflict with Apple. It is about what can be seen — or obscured — about the geography of our covert wars. For the past 15 years, journalists on the ground in Yemen, Pakistan, and Somalia have worked hard to uncover the contours of U.S. drone attacks — in some cases at their own peril. Filmmakers, academics, and attorneys have done important work documenting their ghastly aftermath. Websites like The Intercept have published whistleblower exposés about how the covert drone program clicks together. But buried in the details is a difficult truth: no one really knows who most of these missiles are killing. Because the particulars of the drone wars are scant, we only have ‘metadata’ about most of these strikes — perhaps a date, the name of a province, maybe a body count. Absent documentary evidence or first-person testimony, there isn’t much narrative to speak of. The name ‘Metadata’ has a double meaning: the app both contains metadata about English-language news reports, and it refers to the basis on which most drone strikes are carried out. (As Gen. Michael Hayden famously said, “we kill people based on metadata.”) Smartphones have connected us more intimately to all sorts of data. As Amitava Kumar put it recently, “The internet delivers ugly fragments of report and rumor throughout the day, and with them a sense of nearly constant intimacy with violence.” Yet information about drone strikes — in Apple’s universe — had somehow been deemed beyond the pale. What would it mean to be more connected to our wars? Might our phones allow us to think more constellationally? With a president who plans to lift the Obama-era constraints on drone strikes even further, declaring parts of Yemen and Somalia as “areas of active hostilities,” I’m glad that Apple has decided to stop blocking a news app. If anything about the app is “excessively objectionable or crude,” perhaps it’s the airstrikes themselves. —— Update: 2:32pm Apple has removed Metadata from the App Store. pic.twitter.com/sDDsKlFpSX — Josh Begley (@joshbegley) March 28, 2017 Related Contact the author: Josh Begley✉josh.begley@​theintercept.comt@joshbegley ˅ ⎕ 74 Comments The Intercept_ Newsletter D × ✓ Weekly Digest ✓ Breaking Stories and Exclusives ⟶ Email list managed by MailChimp Filters SVG

By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | March 23, 2017 -- 15:41 GMT (08:41 PDT) | Topic: Tablets iPad sales are awful. Truly awful. And while CEO Tim Cook may be bullish about the tablet's future, Apple desperately needed to do something to try to turn sales around. Well, we now have a price cut. You know things are desperate when Apple starts cutting prices, but the latest iPad price cut might have come too late to save it. Must read: How to get your iPhone or iPad ready for iOS 10.3 Before we look at why the price cut has come too late, let's consider the reasons for the price cut. OK, there's the obvious fact that sales suck, but there's more to the poor sales that meets the eye. see also ​Apple defends iPad, tablet turf with price cut The core 9.7-inch iPad will now start at $329. Apple isn't shy about trying to convince tech buyers to upgrade. Read More First off, iOS 10 rendered some 40 percent of iPads that were in use obsolete. That's a huge number of devices blown away overnight, and it's the sort of thing that you might expect to be the catalyst for an upgrade cycle. But so far there's no sign of an upgrade cycle. Another problem that Apple is facing is that schools are increasingly abandoning the iPad and turning to Chromebooks, and I'm hearing that one of the major reasons for this is price (another reason I hear for the shift is the ease of managing Chromebooks). So, with sales drying out, Apple has turned to the thing it hates doing the most -- cutting prices. Unlike other consumer electronics manufacturers, Apple understood early on in the game that cutting prices was a one-way street, and once you cut a price, there's no going back. That means you don't do it until you have to. But Apple might have left it too late to save the iPad. Here's why. First off, this intervention comes late in the iPad's decline. iPad sales began showing signs of slowing back in late 2012 and early 2013, with the slide getting into full swing in 2014, and only now is Apple addressing one of the main reasons for the fall in sales -- price. Apple is now in a position where it has to try to resurrect a dying product by turning around a steep decline, whereas a few years ago it would have had the smaller task of reinvigorating soggy sales. And Apple has had to do this at a time when much of the buzz that once surrounded the iPad has fizzled away. Another problem facing the iPad is that since the release of the Plus version of the iPhone with the larger 5.5-inch display, there's less of a need for the iPad. You can even see the effect that the iPhone 6 Plus had on the iPad in the sales data. iPhone and iPad quarterly sales And on top of all this, Apple is trying to fix iPad sales while also keeping one eye on softening iPhone sales and while generating as much hype as possible for the $1,000+ tenth-anniversary iPhone. We will have to wait and see what effect -- if any -- Apple's iPad price cut will have, but with the current state of play, combined with all the factors listed above that are generating headwind, I for one am not holding out much hope for sustained recovery. iPhone 8: Here's what we know SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 10 NEXT PREV See also: iPhone 8 may not have the killer feature we've been hoping for Activate your iPhone's hidden magnifying glass feature Your next iPhone could easily cost over $1,000 Kingston's 2TB 'world's highest capacity USB flash drive' costs almost as much as a MacBook Pro Intel should be very worried about AMD's Ryzen 7 processors Did you know your iPhone doubles as a magnifying glass?

Apple has now purchased Workflow and the team behind it. As you may recall, the Apple Design Award-winning Workflow is an automation app for iOS in the same vein as Automator on the Mac (see “Apple Announces 2015 Design Award Winners,” 10 June 2015). You can use it to perform actions in supported apps automatically. For instance, you can use Workflow to send your estimated time of arrival to a friend, upload photos, or shorten a URL. Apple usually pulls acquired apps from the App Store, but not this time. Instead, Workflow is now available for free. Unfortunately, Apple has dropped support within Workflow for Google Chrome, Google Maps, LINE, Pocket, Telegram, and Uber, and Workflow Gallery submissions are no longer being accepted. Developer Marco Arment points out that may be more because of legal issues than any particular strategy. Recent Automation News -- This acquisition is a plot twist in Apple’s ongoing automation saga. In November 2016, Apple eliminated the position of Product Manager of Automation Technologies (see “Understanding Apple’s Marginalization of the Mac,” 21 November 2016). The man who filled that position for two decades was Sal Soghoian, a legend in the Apple power user community who championed technologies such as AppleScript and Automator. Among other consulting projects, Sal is now helping the Omni Group with automation in their apps. Apple’s unceremonious elimination of Soghoian caused much concern in the Mac community, despite reassurances from Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering. It certainly did nothing to alleviate concerns that Apple no longer cares about professional users. Many of you made your concerns heard loud and clear in “73 Mac Automation Stories from TidBITS Readers” (19 January 2017), which collected amazing stories of how you’ve used the Mac’s automation technologies. And yes, Adam did send the collection to Craig Federighi and Tim Cook. No, he didn’t hear back. Our curiosity was piqued further when Soghoian publicly cautioned Apple to not replace existing automation tools with app extensions (see “Is Apple Planning to Replace Automation with App Extensions?,” 12 January 2017). So what does Apple’s purchase of Workflow mean for Apple’s professional and power users? Overall, the acquisition seems like a positive sign, but big questions remain. I don’t want to speculate about the future of Apple automation too broadly, but we can make some inferences based on what we know about the company. Apple Sees the iPad as the Future -- Despite declining sales growth, Apple appears committed to the iPad as the future of computing, releasing products like the iPad Pro, accessories like the Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard, and iPad-only apps like Swift Playgrounds. One big missing puzzle piece for the iPad’s professional future is system-wide automation. Tools like Workflow, Editorial, and Pythonista have existed for years on the iPad, but they lack the system integration, ease-of-use, and capabilities of Automator and AppleScript on the Mac. If Workflow were integrated into iOS with a system for third-party app integration, it could become a powerful, easy-to-use automation tool. However, Apple would have to build out the automation underpinnings in iOS before that could happen. Workflow currently uses a kludgy system called x-callback-url, developed by Greg Pierce and Marco Arment. It was a clever workaround when they introduced it in 2010, taking advantage of iOS’s URL schemes to let apps communicate with each other, but Apple could do much better. In a Twitter conversation with Pierce, Arment said, “The crazy thing is that URL-scheme bouncing between apps is still necessary for so many useful things on iOS. I always assumed that it’d be a few-years-long hack until iOS caught up and gave us something better. Maybe now it will.” Sal Soghoian has pointed out the difference between app extensions and true user automation; the question is if Apple sees app extensions as being sufficient for Workflow’s underpinnings. That would be better than nothing, of course, but app extensions are more akin to what Services provide in macOS (if you don’t remember Services, check out “OS X Hidden Treasures: Services,” 5 February 2016). One big question about an automation scheme based on app extensions and a Workflow front end is just how powerful it could be. Could it compare to what can be achieved with Automator and AppleScript on the Mac, or would it be closer to Workflow’s current limits? For a far more capable system, Apple could create something in iOS like the Apple event system that enables apps to communicate with one another on the Mac. In an ideal scenario for those who support Mac automation, Apple would bring actual Apple events to iOS. Then a developer would have to build on that by creating a terminology — a scripting dictionary containing commands and objects — and having the app listen for and respond to incoming Apple events. On the Mac, AppleScript is one of the main ways that users can interact with apps via Apple events, but I can’t see Apple porting AppleScript to iOS. The challenge Apple events face in iOS is the tension between scriptability and security — the kinds of hooks that are necessary for scriptability can be used as an attack vector unless the system has been designed carefully to limit that. The Apple event system on the Mac treads that line by operating at the user level; to avoid being exploited, any iOS approach would likely have to be similarly or even more restrictive. Apple Sees Swift as the One Language to Rule Them All -- Along with the iPad, Apple sees Swift as the future of development, going so far as to open-source it (see “Apple’s Swift Programming Language Is Now Open Source,” 3 December 2015) and build the friendly Swift Playgrounds iPad app to help kids learn how to use it (see “Playing Around with Swift on the iPad,” 13 June 2016). Beyond its role in developing traditional apps, what’s interesting about Swift is that it can be used as a scripting language. Developer Filip W proved this concept years ago — see “Using Swift as a Scripting Language” (6 August 2014), although we haven’t heard much about Swift’s use as a scripting language since. Of course, Swift can’t control Mac or iOS apps yet — it would need something like JavaScript for Automation (JXA), which is a set of special libraries that lets scripters use JavaScript instead of AppleScript for interapplication communication. I bet Apple would like to have Swift become the preferred scripting language across all its platforms. Then, people could start with scripting and move on to full-fledged app development without having to learn another language. By bridging the gap between scripters and developers, Apple could expand its ecosystem. Apple Wants macOS and iOS to Share Common Foundations -- Since the beginning, iOS has shared a common core with macOS. Over time, the two platforms have traded capabilities — usually new features developed on iOS going “back to the Mac.” In the case of scripting, it would make more sense for Apple to move the Apple event model to iOS, likely in a restricted way, than to come up with something completely new for iOS that would then need to be evangelized to all Mac developers in the other direction. The question is how closely the iOS system will match up with the Apple events that Mac automation relies on now. If Apple were to start supporting a subset of Apple events in iOS, giving users access in iOS via Workflow and Swift, it would be easy to imagine Workflow coming to the Mac to replace or supplement Automator (Swift is obviously already available for Mac users). It seems likely that Apple will announce something related to Workflow and iOS automation at WWDC in June 2017, with an eye toward it shipping in some form in iOS 11 in September. Or, if my excitement is getting the better of me, it might all have to wait until iOS 12 in 2018. Perhaps Apple will split the difference, and do what it did with Siri. At first, Siri could perform actions only with built-in iOS functionality and Apple apps. With iOS 10, though, Apple opened Siri up to a few types of apps, including apps for messaging, ride booking, payments, VoIP calling, workouts, and CarPlay. iOS automation might similarly be limited to a small subset of what’s possible on the Mac today, enabling Apple to feel out the security implications before making it more capable in future releases. How that would affect Workflow coming to the Mac is hard to guess. It might come with macOS 10.13 this September, or it may be an iOS-only feature for a year, and show its face on the Mac with macOS 10.14 in 2018. Beyond any speculation, we can see one thing for sure from Apple’s acquisition of Workflow: the company hasn’t lost interest in automation, which is good news. But the devil is in the details, especially in a system that has to balance user capabilities against security.   TextExpander: Communicate smarter. Accuracy and consistency wherever you type.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment BK  2017-03-28 18:30 Replacing AppleScript with a full-blown OO language is a bad idea. My scripts don't need classes, inheritance, object reuse, or data hiding. And requiring me to learn a completely obfuscated OO syntax and the complex rules that accompany OO development & debugging when I don't write scripts every day is simply user-hostile. I have no interest in "mov[ing] on to full-fledged app development without having to learn another language," and so, I disagree that "By bridging the gap between scripters and developers, Apple could expand its ecosystem." If Apple were to go down this path, it would be just another way of making Macs harder to use. AppleScript has its flaws, all right, but it is more accessible than Swift. But, for the reasons & assumptions you state, it is inevitable that one day AppleScript Editor, then osascript, will be discarded for Swift. (PS: I am a former Intel assembly language/C/VisualBasic system & application arch/dev who has always hated OO for the reasons above.) Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-28 19:14 Our hope is that AppleScript wouldn't disappear even if Swift were to become Apple's focus. I don't have a sense of whether Swift's OO features would get in the way when used for scripting. Did you see http://www.strathweb.com/2014/06/using-swift-general-purpose-scripting-language/ Reply has  2017-03-28 20:57 @Adam: AppleScript is well into the long tail of its lifecycle. It should've been replaced years ago, but with a much better *end-user* language. The real problem isn't the death of the AppleScript language, it's that the [now-ex] Automation team's repeated failure to make *App Automation* a success in ObjC/Python/Ruby/JavaScript/Swift/etc too, it has only thousands of users instead of millions, thus Apple has NO reason to fix, improve, or bother keeping the underlying Apple event IPC infrastructure and Apple Event Object Model. It's that IPC infrastructure and the thousands of AEOM-aware apps that support it (and the many more that could) which is the incredibly valuable bit, not the language(s) that use it. The irony is that the Apple Event Object Model's very-high-level QUERY-DRIVEN interface should be the perfect complement to Apple's new QUERY-ISSUING UI, Siri! But if Apple's ostensible Automation Product Manager failed to see and sell that vision, what chance anyone else will? Reply has  2017-03-28 20:34 Swift and AppleScript are both awful languages in their own rights. Swift is just C++ with rubberized corners. AppleScript to its credit was a genuine attempt to try something new; unfortunately its own excessive cleverness backfires something terrible. (BTW, given your background, surprised you don't prefer Perl or Bash, or even Tcl, for scripting?) A good end-user [AND pro-user] scripting language would be a modern Logo successor. Frankly all Algol/C-descended languages suck: "Ugg bang rock!" is the absolute limit of their expressiveness, and even then you're being eaten by raptors. (And yes, OOP is overrated and overapplied, though both Swift and AS support it and neither requires it unless you're writing, say, Cocoa apps. But if you ever used JavaScript or Smalltalk, you'd know the way that C* langs "do OO" is an abomination that hardly resembles the original concept. Blame the state of modern "CS education".) Reply has  2017-03-28 20:12 "Of course, Swift can’t control Mac or iOS apps yet" This is wrong: Swift *can* control Mac Apps via 1. macOS's crippled crappy ScriptingBridge framework (when it works, though it's even more awful in Swift than it is in ObjC), or 2. via the SwiftAutomation framework (https://bitbucket.org/hhas/swiftae/) I wrote a couple years ago which does provide *AppleScript-quality* application scripting support. (Apple previously considered appscript, SwiftAutomation's predecessor, for 10.5 but alas its internal bureaucracy nixed that.) I even offered Sal SwiftAutomation for free back in 2015 cos I knew how important this was, and the idiot blew me off with incredibly asinine NotInventedHere BS. THAT is the reason why Swift doesn't provide AppleScript-quality application scripting support as standard; why Mac Automation has totally failed to win hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic new App Automation users AND developers; and why Sal Soghoian (rightly) doesn't have a job at Apple any more.

As previously noted, iOS 10.3 is changing how reviews and feedback are handled within apps. Rather than inundate users with endless prompts seeking feedback, like before, developers now have a new StoreKit API on iOS 10.3 at their disposal. First and foremost, the StoreKit APIs allow users to provide ratings and reviews without leaving the app they’re in. Developers simply choose when they’d like to prompt the user and identify places in their app where it makes sense to ask for feedback, and the system takes care of the rest. In-app ratings and reviews With the new StoreKit in iOS 10.3, developers can streamline product feedback using standardized prompts that are consistent across the system. Apple advises that app makers use the new system-provided prompt rather than buttons and other controls. “The system’s rating prompt offers a familiar, efficient experience that’s designed to engage the user with minimal impact,” explains the firm. The new in-app prompt lets the user rate iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Mac apps, or post a written review, without being taken to App Store. Even better, these prompts take advantage of Touch ID to authenticate the user when they wish to review an app. Crucially, StoreKit limits each app to three such prompts per year. Devs should keep these considerations in mind when asking people to rate their app: Ask for a rating only after the user has demonstrated engagement with your app. For example, prompt the user upon the completion of a game level or productivity task. Never ask for a rating on first launch or during onboarding. Allow ample time to form an opinion. Don’t interrupt the user, especially when they’re performing a time-sensitive or stressful task. Look for logical pauses or stopping points, where a rating request makes the most sense. Don’t be a pest. Repeated rating prompts can be irritating and may even negatively influence the user’s opinion of your app. Allow at least a week or two between rating requests and only prompt again after the user has demonstrated additional engagement with your app. In Settings, users can opt out of receiving the new feedback prompts. Again, all developers need to do is tell iOS when and where to prompt users to rate their app and the system takes care of the rest. If the user hasn’t already given feedback and a request hasn’t been made too recently, the system displays an in-app prompt that asks for a rating and an optional written review. Like before, ratings are for the App Store territory where the app was originally purchased. Users can only leave ratings for Apple TV apps, not submit reviews. Responding to reviews on App Store iOS 10.3 brings about another major change for developers, who can now at long last post public responses of their own to customer reviews on App Store and Mac App Store. Developers can view, sort and respond to all reviews of their app via iTunes Connect, no matter when they were written. When a developer responds, the user is notified and can update their feedback. The Cupertino company says that the ideal response is concise and clearly addresses customer feedback. Developers should communicate in the tone of their brand and use terminology their target audience will appreciate and understand. According to Apple: Positive ratings and reviews can encourage customers to download or purchase your app. By delivering great responses to users’ comments and assisting those who have questions about your app, you can create a better user experience, drive increased engagement and improve your app’s rating. To foster deeper engagement, developers are permitted to ask users for feedback on future app updates as part of their public reply. If the user has indicated that a response has answered their question or fixed their technical issue, developers are free to ask them to kindly update their rating and review. Developers can edit their response at any time. However, only one response per review is displayed on a developer’s App Store product page. To time their responses perfectly, app makers can set up email alerts on iTunes Connect to get notified when the user edits a review a developer previously replied to. Filtering options in iTunes Connect can be used to find reviews with lower star ratings, reviews from users in specific territories, reviews lacking responses, reviews that users have updated since the last response from a developer and more. Developer responses should be topical and shouldn’t be used to advertise or offer promo codes for other apps, services or In-App Purchases. Responding to reviews with the lowest star ratings or those mentioning technical issues with an app’s most current version should be a priority. “You could also consider replying to all feedback immediately following a major release of your app,” says Apple.

By Zack Whittaker for Zero Day | March 23, 2017 -- 22:53 GMT (15:53 PDT) | Topic: Security (Image: file photo) Hackers are demanding Apple pay a ransom in bitcoin or they'll blow the lid off millions of iCloud account credentials. Beyond the primary headline, however, there are a bevy of loose ends and nuances to ponder. So far, we know that a London-based hacker group, calling itself the Turkish Crime Family, has claimed to have access to 250 million accounts (at the time of writing). The hackers are threatening to reset the passwords on those iCloud accounts and remotely wipe iPhones if Apple doesn't pay a ransom by April 7. Those demands have since changed and increased. Motherboard, which first reported the story, noted that the media-hungry group has approached multiple outlets, possibly to help its extortion efforts. More security news MIT: US cyber insecurity a 'disgrace' that Trump needs to take seriously Security? What security? Four million data records are stolen or lost every day Apple iCloud hack threat gets worse: Here's what we've learned Adware rewrites phone details for legitimate security software on Google search For its part, Apple has said it hasn't been hacked. In a brief statement to sister-site CNET, the company said the data came from "previously compromised third-party services," and that it is "actively monitoring to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts." That seems to tie in with what the hackers said in an email to some members of the press late on Wednesday. The hackers denied any direct breach of Apple systems. What muddies the water is that the hackers also appear in some cases to have passwords that have been only used for iCloud. Welcome to the wonderful world of security nuance. We have worked for the past few days to get to the bottom of this. Here's what we've learned. ZDNet obtained a set of 54 credentials from the hacker group for verification. All the 54 accounts were valid, based on a check using the site's password reset function. (You can learn more about how we verify data breaches here.) These accounts include "icloud.com," dating back to 2011, and legacy "me.com" and "mac.com" domains from as early as 2000. The list of credentials contained just email addresses and plain-text passwords, separated by a colon, which according to Troy Hunt, data breach expert and owner of notification site Have I Been Pwned, makes it likely that the data "could be aggregated from various sources." We started working to contact each person, one by one, to confirm their password. Most of the accounts are no longer registered with iMessage and could not be immediately reached. However, 10 people in total confirmed that their passwords were accurate, and have now changed them. Those 10 people we spoke to were based in the UK, and had UK cell phone numbers. All the people we spoke to were on different cell networks. (A person representing the hacker group, who is allegedly no longer a member, told me that the data is "handled in groups" but would not explain how or why. The hackers refused to hand over a US-based sample of accounts.) The same 10 people confirmed that they had used the same password since opening their iCloud accounts. According to the responses, most of the people had the same passwords on their accounts for "about four or five years" since iCloud's debut. One person said specifically that the password he confirmed with us was no longer in use as of about two years ago, which narrows down the possible date of a breach or multiple breaches to somewhere between 2011 and 2015. Some of the people we spoke to only own iPhones, while others own Macs and iPads but do not own an iPhone. That may rule out if an individual Apple product line was compromised in some way. We also asked if their accounts were used on other services to potentially verify if another site had been compromised. Most of the people we spoke to confirmed that they used their iCloud email address and password on other sites, such as Facebook and Twitter. However, three people said that their iCloud email address and password were unique to iCloud, and were not used on any other site -- a key anomaly that, if accurate, we can't explain. Two of the people we spoke to confirmed that someone had tried to reset their iCloud accounts in the past day. One of the people said that they had received login notifications on Twitter, which used the same iCloud email address and password. This seems fitting with the hackers' apparent desires to reset accounts as they claim. "All from London [where the hackers claim to be located], from different browsers at the same time," confirmed the iCloud account holder. Security 101 Tips for protecting your privacy from hackers and spies Take these simple steps to help protect yourself against hackers and government surveillance. Read More It's clear that there's something to the hackers' claims, given that they have some working iCloud account credentials. But it's not known exactly how many, or if the sample that was sent was representative of the wider pool or was carefully selected. Based on our experience and our interactions with the group and its members, it's evident that the group is naïve and inexperienced. Based on its grandiose claims and its cherry-picking media outlets to cover its claims, it's also clear that the group is gunning for publicity. When we began asking the group questions, the conversation quickly turned to whether or not CBS News (which like ZDNet is also owned by CBS), would also cover the group's claims. The group also appears disorganized, and unable to maintain order within its own ranks -- seen by the apparent "firing" of one of its members, who ran the Twitter account. It also can't seem to stay on message, as evidenced by the need to correct the record after reporters "misunderstood the situation." "A breach means nothing in 2017 when you can just pull the exact same user information in smaller scales through companies that aren't as secure," said the group in a Pastebin post. We can't be sure that this is something big, but based on our reporting, we can't say that it's nothing. Those using two-factor authentication or Apple's trusted device system should be protected. But concerned users should change their Apple iCloud password through this link. Look for the green padlock icon in the address bar and that the web address clearly says "iforgot.apple.com". Change your password to a long password with differently-cased letters and numbers with special characters. Using a password manager can considerably help in generating strong passwords, as well as storing them. We have more security advice here. Apple did not respond to questions we sent earlier on Thursday.

By Hardik SinghHardik Singh Published Date 28 - Mar - 2017 | Last Updated 28 - Mar - 2017 Tweet   Lenovo Z2 Plus (White, 32GB) 11999 Apple is rolling out iOS 10.3 update to its customers today. This is likely the last major release to iOS 10 before Apple announces iOS 11 later this year at WWDC. The new update is available for devices currently running iOS 10 or newer. The OTA update is about 640MB in size. There is nothing outright exciting in the new update, but there are some tweaks which are worth looking into.  APFS: a new file system in place This is a big update for your iPhone or iPad storage as Apple is finally shifting to a new internal file management system, called APFS. This is Apple File System (APFS) and it will replace the 31 year old Hierarchical File System (HFS) which was originally developed for Macs using hard drives. Apple did update the HFS system with HFS+ but that was still 18 years back. Hence, the HFS+ is still dated and not well equipped to handle the full potential of newer flash storage based devices to its fullest.  (L-R) Before and after the update So, when you update your device to 10.3, the OS will automatically shift all your data on your device to the new APFS system. According to the Apple, this should technically increase the read and write speeds on flash based storage. The update will also bring some storage optimizations, which means you may get some added free space. In terms of security, APFS offers full disk encryption along with individual file encryption.  Apple will be updating its other products like MacOS, TvOS, WtachOS to APFS in near future. Apple Pay is here: Not compatible though The latest update also extends support for Apple pay in India, but unfortunately none of the government or private sector banks support the payment method. However, this could be an indication that like Samsung Pay, Apple might also be looking to expand its cashless payments service globally.    Tweaks to Apple ID: Front and centre Your Apple ID is now at the top of the setting stack and incorporates your Apple ID, iCloud, family sharing settings and more. The password and security section sits right at the top, and will prompt you setup your two-factor authentication if you haven't already done so. Inside the Apple ID you also get a list of all the Apple products and serial numbers you own. If you have iTunes installed on a Windows machine that is also shown here. However, Android devices linked to Apple account using Apple Music app arent shown in this list. You can also check how much iCloud storage you are using and how much storage is being consumed by photos, docs, backups and email. Last chance for 32-bit apps Apple has been pushing the 64-bit app architecture since the last two years and it seems this might be the last year for 32-bit apps on iOS devices. You can check whether you have any 32-bit apps by going into the General tab in settings, then About, followed by Applications. Here you will have a list of all the applications which won’t be compatible with “future versions” of iOS.  Removing 32-bit apps will essentially clear all compatibility issues which may arise with iOS11, but at the same time may remove a large chunk of old applications which have not been updated in a while. Find My Air Pods If you are one of those people who bought the new AirPods then there is something for you as well on the new update. iOS 10.3 has a new feature “Find my Air Pods” which will give the user the last known location of their wireless earphones. Although, the feature only works if your AirPods are in their case and if your phone is connected to the internet when you are looking for them. Other features Siri now supports cricket scores, and statistics for Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council. New design tweaks in CarPlay such as easy access to last used apps and daily curated playlists. Rent and watch movies across all devices on iTunes. Hourly weather updates and support for 3D Touch Support for Searching parked cars in Maps 3D Touch support in Podcast app. Episodes and podcasts are now shareable on messages. Some Location and Privacy issues resolved. Stability improvements.  Hardik Singh  hardik.singh@digit.in Light at the top, this odd looking creature lives under the heavy medication of video games.

McIntyre March 28, 2017 6:25 am EDT Print Email Tweet The new Apple Watch may have the ability to connect to cellular networks. An analyst from research firm Susquehanna Financial Group took a trip through Asia in recently. The results of the trip were reported in Barron’s. Analyst Christopher Rolland wrote that the Apple Watch will have a new chip to give it cellular capability: We understand a model of the next Apple watch will include a SIM card, and therefore is likely to support LTE. We understand some issues remain, including battery life and form factor size, but significant progress has been made. Apple may be employing VOIP and data across a CAT-M1 connection for superior battery life. Apple will tout interoperability with the company’s AirPods (now on back order till May) to make and receive phone calls (perhaps a small win for Maxim with amps in each ear bud). Positive QCOM, MXIM. Research firm Canalys reported Apple Watch sales were modest last year despite its large global market share: Apple set a new quarterly shipment record in Q4 2016, contributing to total smartwatch shipments exceeding 9 million units. This global market figure was largely driven by Apple’s 6 million shipments, representing year-on-year growth of 12%. It was the Apple Watch’s best quarter despite being significantly handicapped by supply constraints, even though Apple simultaneously expanded its supply chain. … the Apple Watch generated more than US$2.6 billion in revenue for Apple in Q4 2016, making up nearly 80% of total smartwatch revenue.

We have urged users change their iCloud passwords. We also explained how you can turn on two-factor authentication (2FA), one of the most secure things you can do on any account. Once you enable 2FA, though, you might notice certain third-party apps asking for an App-Specific Password. Let’s walk through the process of getting one. Once you enable two-factor authentication, you might need to know how to generate an app-specific password (Image Credit: JanBaby) When Do I Need an App-Specific Password? Third-party macOS apps that require access to your iCloud account will likely need app-specific passwords. BusyCal, Fantastical 2, Airmail 3, and Newton Mail all require app-specific passwords to connect to iCloud accounts. Those are just a few examples. Any third-party app that doesn’t natively support two-step verification or two-factor authentication will need an app-specific password to connect to any of your iCloud services. Setting Up an App-Specific Password To establish an app-specific password, you’ll need to log into your Apple ID account page, preferably from Safari. Once signed in, look towards the bottom right of the page, in the Security section, for an option called App-Specific Passwords. Click Generate Password to get started. To begin creating an app-specific password, log into your Apple ID account page and click on Generate Password The web page will tell you what app-specific passwords are for, and allow you to enter a password label. Input whatever you want here, but my standard practice is to type in the name of the app the password is for. When you create an app-specific password, you need to give it a label – the app name, for example Next, Apple’s web page will provide you with an app-specific password. Highlight the entire password and copy it, either by pressing Command-C or right-clicking the highlighted password and choosing Copy. Next, you’ll be given your app-specific password to copy Now, return to the app needing the app-specific password. In the password field for your account information, paste the password you copied before. You can paste either by pressing Command-V or right-clicking inside the field and choosing Paste. Paste the app-specific password into the appropriate field in your app A Limited Number of App-Specific Passwords Apple allows you to maintain up to 25 app-specific passwords. In the unlikely event that you run out, you can review which apps you have credentials for and revoke those you aren’t using. To do this, go back to your Apple ID account page. To the right of the Security section, click Edit. Manage your app-specific passwords from the Security menu of your Apple ID account page On the next page, you’ll see another section labeled App-Specific Passwords, with an option to generate a new one. To the right of that option, find the link View History, and click it. Click View History to see a list of your app-specific passwords A pop-up menu listing all of your active app-specific passwords will appear. If you see one that you no longer use, you can revoke it by clicking the ‘X’ next to it. Choose an app-specific password you’d like to revoke Finally, Apple will ask you to confirm that you want to revoke the app-specific password. Click Revoke, and you’ll go back to the list of app-specific passwords. You can click Done and then close the browser window. Confirm that you want to revoke the app-specific password Safeguard Your App-Specific Passwords Apple doesn’t provide you with any way to recover your app-specific passwords, so it’s a good idea to use a password manager to store them. Alternatively, when you forget one, you can simply revoke it and issue a new one.

So you need to go around and do those all over again. March 28, 2017 at 12:45 EDT PM Lee Dronick March 28, 2017 Is there is a list of apps that can be password protected? March 28, 2017 at 1:44 EDT PM Graham McKay March 28, 2017 vpndev – I believe that invalidating app specific passwords when the primary password is changed is the right way to do it. In the same manner that all login tokens are invalidated. ie. after a password change every connection must be specifically re-authenticated. Some other services, like Dropbox I think, allow you to change the password and not affect existing connections which takes us to the security versus convenience balancing act.

You still get haptic alerts and can tap the display to see the the watch face. Unfortunately, enabling Theater Mode doesn’t mute your iPhone, which seems like a big oversight. SiriKit is a great addition to Apple Watch because it brings voice control to third party apps—a feature that was previously available only on iOS devices. Developers will need to update their apps to take advantage of Siri’s expanded voice control on our wrists. watchOS 3.2 is a free update. Launch the Watch app on your iPhone, tap My Watch, then go to General > Software Update to install the update on your Apple Watch.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Will Apple introduce Intel's new Optane Memory in Next-Gen Macs this year? | Main | Apple Granted a Liquid Metal Patent Covering Improved Molds for Creating Parts or Device Casings » March 28, 2017 Apple Granted 45 Patents Today Covering the Apple Watch Charger and Original iOS Virtual Elements & Multitouch   The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office officially published a series of 45 newly granted patents for Apple Inc. today. In this particular report we cover the wireless charger for Apple Watch and more importantly, two key original iOS inventions that helped to ignite the mobile revolution. The patents that seem ancient today were actually key to introducing iOS virtual elements that were needed to move elements on a display to support gaming, the iPhone keypad and more. Today we take it for granted but back then naysayers said such inventions were never going to happen. Ha! – how times change. Our report also covers a pair of design patents and we wrap up this week's granted patent report with our traditional listing of the remaining granted patents that were issued to Apple today.   Granted Patent: Wireless Charger   Apple's newly granted patent covers their invention relating to the Apple Watch's wireless charger.   Apple's granted patent 9,608,475 was originally filed in Q3 2015 and published today by the US Patent and Trademark Office.   Granted Patent: Mode-Based GUI for touch Displays   Apple's newly granted patent covers their invention relating to gesturing associated with touch sensitive devices. The invention relates, in one embodiment, to a user interface method. The method includes detecting a touch. The method also includes determining a user interface mode when a touch is detected. The method further includes activating one or more GUI elements based on the user interface mode and in response to the detected touch.   The granted patent covers in one embodiment, to a user interface method. The method includes displaying a group of media items. The method also includes detecting a touch over the group of media items that are displayed. The method further includes activating a virtual scroll wheel when a touch is detected over the displayed media items. The activation of the virtual scroll wheel includes displaying and enabling the functionality of the virtual scroll wheel, the virtual scroll wheel providing a touch region where a user swirls their finger in order to traverse through the group of media items. The method additionally includes determining if a touch event is performed relative to the touch region of the virtual scroll wheel. Moreover, the method includes scrolling through the group of media items when a scrolling touch event is performed.   Apple noted in 2012 that "Once knob #170 is displayed as shown in FIG. 6A, the user's fingers #176 can be positioned around the knob similar to if it were an actual knob or dial, and thereafter can be rotated around the knob in order to simulate turning the knob. Again, audible feedback in the form of a clicking sound or tactile feedback in the form of vibration, for example, may be provided as the knob is "rotated." Back then this was exciting stuff. Today it feels like learning about dinosaurs.   Apple's granted patent 9,606,668 was originally filed in Q4 2012 and published today by the US Patent and Trademark Office.   Granted Patent: Touch Screen Device, Method, and GUI for Moving On-Screen Objects without using a Cursor   Apple's newly granted patent covers their invention relating to electronic devices with touch screen displays, and more particularly, to electronic devices that use one or more finger contacts to move on-screen objects without using a cursor to move the objects.   In some embodiments, the user interacts with the GUI primarily through finger contacts and gestures on the touch-sensitive display. In some embodiments, the functions may include game playing, telephoning, video conferencing, e-mailing, instant messaging, blogging, digital photographing, digital videoing, web browsing, digital music playing, and/or digital video playing.   Apple's patent FIG. 13C illustrates simultaneously translating and rotating multiple on-screen objects in a graphical user interface on a touch screen display   Apple's granted patent 9,606,715 was filed in 2014. However, the history associated with this patent goes back to between 2002 and 2012.   Apple Granted Design Patents for Apple Watch and EarPod Packaging   The Remaining Patents granted to Apple Today   Note: In order to see a clearer image of the list above, simply click on the image above to enlarge it.

The Cupertino giant is now rolling out the update that brings changes to the operating system of Apple’s timepiece series since watchOS 3.1.3. On Monday, Apple released watchOS 3.2 to general users and owners of the Apple Watch and Apple Watch 2 smart devices. The release of the software update comes months after beta testing was launched in late January and following the launch of the seventh beta last week. It also comes months after watchOS 3 became public back in September last year.  Apple Watch owners can now update their device to watchOS 3.2. To do this, one should pair up the Apple Watch with an iOS 10-running iPhone to download the software update. From the phone, one should go to the dedicated Apple Watch app and head to General. Clicking Software Update from the menu options would launch the Download and Install button, and pressing this will start the download of the update. Once download is complete, the user should connect the Apple Watch to a charger and ensure that it has at least 50 percent battery before proceeding with the installation process. Throughout the installation, the Apple Watch should be in close proximity with the iPhone, as per MacRumors.  Popular Searches Wells Fargo & Co WFC ▲ 55.96 +0.57 +1.03% Dave & Buster's Entertainment Inc PLAY ▲ 62.19 +1.42 +2.34% Annaly Capital Management Inc NLY ▲ 11.31 +0.08 +0.71% 800 Super Holdings Ltd 5TG = 1.20 0.00 0.00% As expected, watchOS 3.2 brings Theater Mode to the Apple Watch. This display mode adjusts the screen of the device to a darker shade and puts the smartwatch to silent mode when the owner is inside cinemas. The mode also disables the screen from lighting up when the wrist is raised. Users should tap the watch face if they want to check for notifications and whatnot. These changes are done to ensure that the theater experience of the user is uninterrupted. MacWorld reports that watchOS 3.2 also comes with a Siri update that enables the AI assistant to worth with more apps. Should users need to send messages, make a call, make payments, start tracking of workouts, book rides and many more, they may now rely on Siri to do these. These changes are all part of SiriKit, which was previously made available to iOS devices ever since iOS 10 arrived.  Also part of the watchOS 3.2 is the update to Scribble. The feature that allows users to write text replies on the display now has support for French, Italian and Spanish. Finally, the Apple Watch app on the iPhone is updated to show music playlist sync progress. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

David Pierce Gear Date of Publication: 03.28.17. 03.28.17 Time of Publication: 8:00 am. 8:00 am Even Switzerland Is Obsessed With Smartwatches Now Movado's new Connect smartwatchMovado The Swiss watch market exists within a blissful parallel universe. In this magical place, people celebrate the contemplative beauty of a perpetual calendar complication, and happily pay five or six figures for mechanical timepieces that don’t actually keep time accurately. This universe arose during the Renaissance, and changes slowly. The heritage, the history, the—ahem—timelessness of it all remains precisely the point. That universe is unraveling. The watch industry is in a precipitous decline, one that started when people realized their smartphone does a pretty good job telling the time. Last year, Apple bragged about being the second-biggest watchmaker on the planet. Swiss watch exports, meanwhile, fell 16.1 percent in the first half of 2016, the fastest decline ever.  The industry faces intense competition from companies like Apple, Samsung, LG, and Huawei that don’t know much about complications but know everything about making the connected devices people love. You see smartwatches everywhere at Baselworld 2017, which you could call the Consumer Electronics Show of watchmaking. In fact, the first thing you see after walking in the door is the Tag Heuer Connected 45, a stylish modular smartwatch that costs $1,700. Depending who you ask, such timepieces represent a massive opportunity to woo a new generation of buyers, or a looming threat to everything that makes watches great. Either way, smartwatches are on everyone’s mind. Fossil’s Q Activist hybrid smartwatchFossil/Harper Ewing Not that anyone even agrees on what a smartwatch is. Some embrace the Apple and LG model of building big wrist-puters with big touchscreens. The idea is to complement, if not replace, your phone by letting you receive notifications, track your fitness, send email, and more. It doesn’t matter whether you buy a Movado, a Tag Heuer, or a Montblanc, because they all offer the same basic features. They’re probably made by the same company, too—Fossil, which has become a licensing giant. Prices vary only because you’re buying a brand, a look, a feeling. Read More David Pierce What If We Told You Smartwatches Are Actually Getting Good David Pierce Tag Heuer’s New $1,600 Smartwatch Is (Almost) Worth It Stephen Pulvirent 7 Zany Timepieces From the World’s Most Exclusive Watch Show David Pierce Android Wear 2.0 Has Landed—Here Are All the New Features On the other wrist, you find what you might call the smart-ish watch, or the hybrid. It looks like a conventional timepiece. You don’t charge it each day, or even each year. It collects fitness and sleep data, and vibrates when you get an important notification. But such things are secondary to its primary function: keeping time. Pretty soon you’ll be able to buy a watch like this from Fossil, Guess, Hugo Boss, and Tory Burch. Soon enough, you can easily imagine every reasonably priced watch featuring some measure of connectivity. The components needed to add, say, Bluetooth, to a watch are so small, so efficient, and so cheap that there’s little reason not to include them. But adding such things to a watch invariably calls into question what a watch is, and what it does. Watchmakers like Patek Philippe, Rolex, and Harry Winston craft timepieces you leave to your children, not trade in at the Verizon store when a new model arrives. They are heirlooms, not commodities, and more art than technology. As company reps showed me their Baselworld products, they talked about materials and movements and historical inspirations, not Wi-Fi specs or processor speeds. Rolex watches are notoriously bad at keeping accurate time, but this basic failing does not diminish its brand in the slightest. Because it’s not really about telling the time. Montblanc’s Summit smartwatchMontblanc And so the question isn’t whether a watchmaker like Rolex can make a smartwatch, but what a Rolex smartwatch would mean. When every Android Wear watch is the same—which is to say six months away from hopelessly obsolescence—how do you make something that lasts forever? In a world where everything is only exciting until the upgrade comes along, does such timelessness even matter? Some companies are diving into this new market eagerly. Michael Kors, for instance, says every men’s watch it sells will feature some measure of connectivity. But for others, particularly the truly luxurious brands, finding the right balance of past and future, heritage and innovation, remains a challenge.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / American Integrity Insurance Announces Its Customer and Agent Satisfaction Survey Results American Integrity Insurance Announces Its Customer and Agent Satisfaction Survey Results Posted on March 28, 2017 by Top News US Full Feed in Press Releases American Integrity recently completed its annual policyholder survey, and the results show that 94 percent of policyholders who responded said they were very or somewhat likely to refer the Company to a friend or loved one. When converted to the industry standard Net Promoter Score (NPS) measurement system, American Integrity Insurance’s NPS result would be a 64 – placing the Company among the upper echelon of customer loyalty torch bearers, such as USAA, Apple and Cadillac. Tampa, Fla. (PRWEB) March 28, 2017 American Integrity recently completed its annual policyholder survey, and the results show that 94 percent of policyholders who responded said they were very or somewhat likely to refer the Company to a friend or loved one. When converted to the industry standard Net Promoter® Score (NPS®) measurement system, American Integrity Insurance’s NPS® result would be a 64 – placing the Company among the upper echelon of customer loyalty torch bearers, such as USAA, Apple and Cadillac. The average NPS® score for insurance carriers is 37, per Temkin Group, a leading customer experience research, consulting, and training firm. “As a Florida-focused, Tampa-based company, we specifically design our products and service to address the unique insurance needs of our fellow Floridians,” said Bob Ritchie, President and CEO of American Integrity Insurance. “We strive to provide compassionate and timely service each day, and we humbly regard these survey results as a reflection of our efforts to place our policyholders and agents at the core of all that we do.” The Company achieved equally strong results from its agent satisfaction survey – 97 percent of respondents said they were satisfied or very satisfied with their partnership with American Integrity Insurance. In the comments section of both surveys, many agents and policyholders lauded American Integrity’s communication and prompt response to customers during Hurricane Matthew, which traversed its way northward along Florida’s east coast in October 2016. During a terrifying time, when Floridians were in distress after 10+ years without experiencing a major storm, American Integrity demonstrated that its #1 objective was quickly responding to its customers to get them on the road to recovery. The Company closed 97 percent of its 3,000 Hurricane Matthew claims within three weeks. But that customer-centric emphasis isn’t just evident during hurricane season; it’s a year round priority. "We don’t use traditional call center metrics like ‘average handle time,’ [which is] how long someone is on the phone," said Patrick Madigan, Vice President of Underwriting and Client Services. "Those types of metrics don’t speak to the quality of the experience, or help us determine if the customer is happy. Instead, we’re much more concerned with reducing wait times so that we can respond to our customers’ needs as quickly as possible. We also review calls to identify trends and opportunities for training and improvement.” Every day, customer service team members get a summary about customer service levels and the team shares a full report, including customer feedback and comments, periodically to the entire company. American Integrity honors its employees’ personalities and hires top-notch talent by asking unconventional questions during the interview process. Once hired, these associates don't use scripts with customers. "I think a lot of customer service teams fall into that trap of scripting everything out,” said Madigan. “From the customer’s perspective, that can sometimes feel like they’re speaking to a robot." Additionally, American Integrity is keenly focused on fostering a team-oriented, collaborative culture, where peer recognition is strongly encouraged. “At our quarterly all-employee meetings, employees often take time to acknowledge each other for a job well done in front of the rest of the Company,” says Ritchie. “That type of recognition is priceless, and helps deepen the bond between co-workers.” As a multiple “Best Workplace” award-winning organization, American Integrity understands the importance of cultivating a high-performing workplace. “We find people with a 'make it happen' spirit. In our staffing models we build in time for people to have some time off the phone to do things that are important to them and that they're passionate about and that ultimately contribute to the business and to our customers too," says Ritchie. By hiring people who are passionate about solving problems, we've had all different types of backgrounds but really it all comes back to this desire and passion for customers." Ultimately, American Integrity strives to empower its employees, equipping them with the tools and confidence to be productive. “Trust and inspire your employees. That sounds so basic, but I really think it's important to hire the very best people you can, invest in them with leadership and training, and then trust them to do a good job," Madigan stated. "I always tell my team that there's nothing that I can do that they can't do for a customer." American Integrity’s products include insurance for traditional and high value homes, condos, vacant homes, manufactured homes, and rental properties. Their newest products include umbrella coverage, standalone golf cart insurance and X-wind policies (robust coverage for sudden and accidental losses caused by all named perils excluding wind) to help address a broad range of needs facing today’s Florida home insurance customer. The Company constantly seeks to anticipate shifts in consumer preferences and utilizes emerging technologies to improve existing products, even as it develops and releases new products. For more information about the company, visit http://www.aiicfl.com or call 866-968-8390. “Net Promoter, Net Promoter Score and NPS are registered trademarks of Bain & Company, Inc., Satmetrix Systems, Inc., and Fred Reichheld.” ### About American Integrity Insurance Group (American Integrity) American Integrity Insurance, the fifth largest Florida domiciled residential property insurer, has in excess of 250,000 customers and is represented by more than 900 independent agents.

We’ve seen a steady stream of patents describing different ways to achieve this. Anker braided Lightning cables One of the technologies Apple has explored is ultrasonic imaging. A previous patent described this as ‘the most accurate but least common finger-scanning technology,’ and a further patent describing this approach has been granted today. Apple says that ultrasonic imaging avoids two common problems experienced with other fingerprint sensors, including its existing form of Touch ID. Contaminants such as grease, lotion, dirt, sweat, and food particles on a finger can degrade a captured fingerprint image, which can prevent a fingerprint sensing device from matching the captured fingerprint image to a known fingerprint image. Alternatively, a finger contacting an input surface of the fingerprint sensing device with too much or too little pressure can reduce the quality of the captured fingerprint image and prevent the fingerprint sensing device from recognizing the user. The patent notes that this technology could be used to provide more accurate readings both when embedded into a display, and when used with a conventional Touch ID style sensor. As we get ever closer to production of the new iPhone, we’ve been hearing an increasing number of reports, with a flurry of these supporting an expectation of a near-bezel-free OLED display with embedded fingerprint sensor, wireless charging and some form of augmented reality. Analysts are all predicting a ‘super cycle,’ aka a large increase in sales as the new design and features see many more iPhone owners upgrade from older models.

The Commission ordered that the Irish government must recover the "illegal aid." The Irish government and Apple have begun an appeal against the Commission's ruling and — according to a spokesman for the Luxembourg government quoted in the Irish Times — both are set to be supported by Luxembourg.  After the ruling, Apple issued a statement saying: "It's been clear since the start of this case there was a pre-determined outcome. "The Commission took unilateral action and retroactively changed the rules, disregarding decades of Irish tax law, US tax law, as well as global consensus on tax policy, that everyone has relied on. If their opinion is allowed to stand, Apple would pay 40 percent of all the corporate income tax collected in Ireland, which is unprecedented and, far from leveling the playing field, selectively targets Apple. This has no basis in fact or law and we're confident the ruling will be overturned," Apple said. 'Misunderstood' The Irish government, in its appeal, issued December 2016, said the Commission had "misunderstood the relevant facts and Irish law" and "misapplied state aid law." © AFP 2017/ Paul Faith A view of buildings on The Apple campus in Cork, southern Ireland The European Commission concluded that two tax rulings issued by Ireland to Apple "substantially and artificially lowered the tax paid by Apple in Ireland since 1991." The rulings allowed two Apple subsidiaries — Apple Sales International (ASI) and Apple Operations Europe (AOE) — to attribute almost all sales profits to a "head office." The Commission said "that these 'head offices' existed only on paper and could not have generated such profits. These profits allocated to the 'head offices' were not subject to tax in any country under specific provisions of the Irish tax law, which are no longer in force." © Photo: Pixabay Apple's Tax Bill in Ireland Out of EU Competency - Parliament SpeakerThe Irish government claims that the Commission decision "mischaracterizes the activities and responsibilities of the Irish branches of ASI and AOE. These branches carried out routine functions, but all important decisions within ASI and AOE were made in the USA, and the profits deriving from these decisions were not properly attributable to the Irish branches of ASI and AOE. "The Commission's attribution of Apple's intellectual property licenses to the Irish branches of AOE and ASI is not consistent with Irish law and, moreover, is inconsistent with the principles it claims to apply, as is its stated refusal to take into account the activities of Apple Inc.," the Irish government's legal papers stated. ...

According to the Korean tech giant, Monday (local time), more than 450,000 people have visited the center since its establishment on Feb. 22, 2016 -- 1,200 per day on weekdays and 1,700 on weekends. It is named after the location's address of 837 Washington Street in the middle of New York's Meatpacking District. A store run by its archrival Apple is placed less than 1 kilometer from the experience center of Samsung, which tries to outshine the Apple stores by its convergent approach involving culture, technology and humanity. "Samsung 837 provides an opportunity for the public to experience Samsung technology and signature services interacting with eight passion points through special events," said Choi Bo-rham, a director of Samsung Electronics America's corporate marketing team. The passion points are art, music, entertainment, sports, wellness, culinary, technology and fashion. "Such a strategy is more appealing to New Yorkers," she added. By building the 837, where visitors can try out Samsung products, the Seoul-based firm joins other global IT companies like Microsoft, Nintendo and Apple that have their own stores. But there is one difference: it is not a retail shop so visitors cannot buy any Samsung devices there. Instead, the Korean entity offers cooking classes and art exhibits as well as other cultural events targeting Samsung products users and prospective customers. "Instead of selling products and making profits, we offer our vision of setting up a digital playground, where innovation of cutting-edge goods blends well with culture and arts," Choi said. It has gained recognition as Forbes said in February that "if there is a place where this electronics behemoth not only gets it right but is truly taking a leadership position, it is in innovation around consumer engagement through one of the slickest retail spaces around, known simply as Samsung 837." Amid its growing recognition, celebrities including basketball player LeBron James, singers Gwen Stefani and John Legend, American chef Anthony Bourdain and photographer Nigel Barker have stopped by the marketing center. In addition, the New York Fashion Week in February was live-streamed through Gear VR and Gear 360 cameras, while about 1,600 people watched the 89th Academy Awards live on the main stage screen of the Samsung center in February. When visitors enter the center, they come across a three-story-tall screen made from 96 55-inch visual displays and controlled by video artists to display content ranging from live streams and demos to showcases. However, the biggest hit at 837 is the virtual reality tunnel, in which visitors can take a seat and put on Samsung Electronics' head-mounted Gear VR device for an immersive visual and audio experience of dynamic activities. The day after Samsung unveils the Galaxy S8 smartphone, it plans to come up with a new virtual reality program related to the new phone. In addition, it serves as a venue for unveiling new products and holds events for customers, while providing after-sales services to fix handsets, which takes only about two hours, much shorter than its rivals according to Samsung. ksw@ktimes.comMore articles by this reporter Prosecution seeks arrest warrant for Park Geun-hye Unidentified bones, shoes found in Sewol [Provincial News] Yangsan city wrestles with illegally littered trash by foreigners [K-Terminology] Tired workers turn to 'sibal expense' for satisfaction Elementary school punishes boy for asking classmate to show her genitals Koreans most depressed in world after spouse's death: survey Adidas, Philip Morris pay 'excessive' royalties Taejon Christian International School falls prey to $5.5 million scam Moon Jae-in wins first primary in landslide 1,000 reporters apply to cover Sewol's last voyage Hazy Seoul No sale to Chinese Fine dust blanket Random candidacy Ostensible friends Worries over Taegeukgi Surprise!

While none of the updates are too drastic, there are some handy add-ons for Apple users.  The feature that will probably attract the most amount of attention from users is the system for finding lost Airpods. iOS 10.3 brings the ability to locate missing pods using the "Find My iPhone" app. This will hopefully prevent the loss of the little earphones.   Filing: While it's not the sexiest of updates, the most interesting change from a technological point of view is the upgraded file system. This may not appear to be too drastic on the surface, but know that it's for the greater good.  iPhones running earlier versions of the software use a 31-year old Hierarchial File System (HFS), which was originally designed for Mac devices with floppy or hard disks. It was not built for modern mobile devices availing of solid state storage. The new 'Apple File System' was announced last year and will look to avail of flash or SSD storage. It is unlikely users will notice a huge impact from the new system, but it may free up a small amount of storage.  The old system is incompatible with the new one, so it's vitally important that users backup their content before upgrading.     12:03 28 Mar 2017 Jessica Kelly 20 hours ago 4 Related articles You can now use Apple Pay in Irish stores Apple unveil video editing app and RED iPhone How to turn off emoji text suggestions on iOS 10 Would you pay for YouTube shows? news cards CT Shirts Moncrieff's Meal Ticket with Mastercard most popular latest sport Meet Ireland's 10 Second Tan "genius" SimSimi: The chat app linked to cyberbullying Daryl Horgan was "immensely proud" after Ireland debut Horgan factor good for Ireland and Captain Brady?: What we learned from tonight's game site terms privacy advertise with us contact competitions apps appliancesdelivered.ie © Copyright 2015 - Newstalk Ltd.

With Oculus wanting to get into a better swing of things with its VR headset platform with the Rift, hiring an ex-Apple veteran who launched consumer products to run your VR division is a good idea.   Facebook has been acquiring key VR talent for a while, recently acquiring Hugo Barra from Xiaomi to oversee their VR division. Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that VR is the next big thing after smartphones, an interesting statement considering Rift sales haven't been too good yet - even though the hardware is actually quite high-end considering its a first-gen device.

But there was something missing in the announcement — the long-rumored 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2. According to a new report, the device has already entered production and might launch in April as previously rumored. “Indications are... 10.5-inch iPad production is commencing this month. An April launch still looks somewhat tentative but the necessary elements are starting to come together," IHS Markit analyst Rhoda Alexander told Forbes on Sunday. Read: iPad vs. iPad Pro 2 "The initial production is limited but Apple’s been known to do fairly fast ramp ups in the past. It’s also possible Apple could do a limited launch initially, adding countries as volume allows," she added. Since the new iPad is a budget device priced at $329 and does not have many high-end features, which were rumored for the iPad Pro 2, there is a high probability that Apple comes out with a premium tablet soon, having at least some, if not all, rumored features of iPad Pro 2. Whether the iPad Pro 2 releases on April 4 at Apple’s spaceship campus’ inaugural event is not known yet, but earlier rumors have pointed at the possibility repeatedly. A possible scenario is that Apple might show off the tablet at the event, but the device will hit store shelves later in the spring. Or as Alexander states, the company could produce the tablet in limited quantities and roll it out slowly in different countries. Read: iPad Pro 2 Might Launch On April 4 The iPad Pro 2 is expected to come with a high-end price tag of $799 and have features such as a MacBook Pro 2016 style Touch Bar, a rechargeable Apple Pencil 2, iOS 10.3 and Apple A10X processor.

Built on iOS 10, it's not a radical overhaul (we'll have to wait until at least WWDC in June for that), but does contain some notable new features. First up is an addition to Find My iPhone – Find my AirPods. Using the built-in app, owners of Apple's tiny, wireless earphones can view their current or last known location and play a sound on one or both of them to help locate the dinky devices. Siri has a number of new features too, including support for paying and checking the status of bills with payment apps, ride app support for help with scheduling, and cricket scores for Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council games. There's also Siri support for apps from car manufacturers to find out whether the car is locked or not, turning on the lights and checking the vehicle's fuel level. Speaking of cars, there are also a number of updates to CarPlay in iOS 10.3. These include shortcuts in the status bar to the most recently used apps for easy access, as well as two changes to Apple Music: the Now Playing screen gives access to both Up Next and the currently playing song's album, while a daily curated playlist and new music categories are also available. There are also a number of smaller tweaks to the Home and Calendar apps, as well as Podcasts. As is normal with an operating system update, iOS 10.3 also introduces a number of security patches, the details of which can be found here. iOS 10 release date iOS 10 was made available as a developer preview following the Apple WWDC keynote on 13th June, with a public beta launched in July. The final, or Golden Master, is available from 9 Septmber through Apple's Beta Program. The free upgrade for general users is released on 13 September 2016, following the iPhone 7's reveal on 7 September.  iOS 10 price When available as a free upgrade, it will work on iPhone 5 and later devices, all iPad Air and iPad Pro models, in addition to fourth generation iPad and later models, iPad mini 2 and later and iPod touch sixth generation onwards. More information is available at Apple's iOS 10 preview site.  iOS 10 features Apple spent a great deal of time going through key iOS 10 features during its WWDC keynote, covering a range of use cases and pleasing developers and end users alike. "iOS 10 is our biggest release ever, with delightful new ways to express yourself in Messages, a native app for home automation and beautifully redesigned apps for Music, Maps, and News that are more intuitive and more powerful, making everything you love about your iPhone and iPad even better," said Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of Software Engineering. "iOS 10 adds Siri intelligence into QuickType and Photos, automates your home with the new Home app and opens up Siri, Maps, Phone and Messages to developers -- while increasing security and privacy with powerful technologies like Differential Privacy." Messaging The most frequently used iOS app is messages, according to Apple. So it's no surprise it has gone to town in revamping this element in iOS 10. New elements here include powerful animations, features to better reflect tone and more extensive use of and support for Emojis.  Siri By opening Siri up to developers in iOS 10, Apple is ensuring that users will benefit from an even better experience. SiriKit means developers can work across a broad range of features, harnessing the intelligence and power Siri offers and making apps even better for the people who use them the most.  Maps reimagined Maps have been given more than a lick of paint in iOS 10. They are also much easier and more intuitive to use. OpenTable and Uber, to pick just two examples, become much more advanced apps with iOS 10 as users can book services directly from withing Maps rather than having to exit and return. Maps will then learn from that experience to proactively deliver guidance based on where you might want or need to go next.  Photos app AI will again be utilised heavily here to ensure the memories that matter most to users are at their fingertips. Memories will scan all the pics and videos you've taken and present them in a way that makes you think back to that time fondly. It can do this thanks to advanced computer vision, which connects the dots between people, places and things inside your device's albums.  Smarter home with HomeKit Users can more effectively control their home environments with advanced controls that add smart elements at the touch of a button or voice command. Almost 100 home automation products have already adopted HomeKit in 2016, proving the appeal of this kind of technological innovation.  Apple Music and News Music and News have also been given a makeover in iOS 10. Both are designed to offer the user more but without the need to get to grips with something new. In particular, Apple Music's Browse, For You and Library features are designed to connect users with the tunes that matter most and will most impact them.  Other features  There is also a range of other tweaks to excite users. These include: Ability to set a regular sleep schedule with the Bedtime Alarm Apple Pay support for purchases on select websites, which can be authenticated via Apple Watch or iPhone Integration for third-party VoIP calls, voicemail transcription and caller ID extension to avoid spam Safari split-view for iPad, Notes collaboration and Live Photos editing QuickType features such as contextual predictions that harness power of Siri's intelligence Pages 1 2 next › last » Read more about Mobile Apps Smartphones Apple IOS iOS 10 iPhone iPad WWDC iPhone 7 View the discussion thread.

(Computer History Museum/Maryanne Regal Hoburg) Share Written by Selina Cheng March 28, 2017 A 1983 picture map of Silicon Valley may be a goofy throwback, but it reveals how much the US tech landscape was once changed—to everybody’s surprise—by an outsider called Microsoft. Originally the work of artist Maryanne Regal Hoburg, the map below is now housed at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View. It was designed as a branding souvenir for Eaton, and isn’t geographically precise, but it does roughly indicate where tech companies and landmarks were once located: Cities include Mountain View, San Jose, Santa Clara, Sunnyvale, and Cupertino in Santa Clara county, and Fremont, in Alameda county. (Computer History Museum/Maryanne Regal Hoburg) Among hardware manufacturers of microprocessors and semiconductors, the big names we can recognize today include IBM, HP, Apple, Intel, and perhaps chip manufacturer Zilog, and Atari, one of the frontrunners of the gaming industry. The map also includes some cultural icons, such as Stanford University and Foothill College, and attractions like the Great America park. Some of the best-known tech brands today only joined the Valley in recent years and never made it on the map. Here’s where they would be today: Google Google was founded in 1998 in Menlo Park, but it has since found its home in Mountain View. Today, it would be marked on the top left of the map, roughly where Sytek, Activision and PFS used to be. (Computer History Museum/Maryanne Regal Hoburg) Apple On the 1983 map, Apple is marked with its old color-striped logo, right on top of the “Cupertino” label. The company is still there, but is now expanding its headquarters as Apple Park and would certainly occupy much more space than it once did. (Computer History Museum/Maryanne Regal Hoburg) Tesla Founded in 2003, the Tesla Factory currently occupies the far northeast, in Fremont, which used to be home of the General Motors plant. (Computer History Museum/Maryanne Regal Hoburg) Facebook Facebook, too, is missing from the map. Created in 2004, the social media network is now housed in Menlo Park, which barely makes it onto the west side of the map. (Computer History Museum/Maryanne Regal Hoburg) But what may be most astonishing is that many companies on this map can no longer be found at all. “Actually there’s an entire industry that’s gone,” says Chris Garcia, curator of the Computer History Museum and a Santa Clara native. “Before the IBM PC concept took off, everyone—and I mean everyone—was banking on CP/M being the dominant force, and it didn’t happen,” he says, referring to companies that produced hardware for CP/M, an operating system for microcomputers at the time. Then a Silicon Valley outsider appeared. Founded not in California, but in Washington state, in 1975, a company called Microsoft sold its operating system MS-DOS to IBM in 1980. IBM used MS-DOS in its personal computers, which became the standard for home computers. And although CP/M is still considered to have marked the “beginning of the personal computer revolution,” leading manufacturers like Cromemco and Sperry Univac that depended on the system disappeared within a few years time, says Garcia, “largely because the PC just took off so hard, which is weird because the PC has no direct connection to Silicon Valley.” Other microcomputer producers like Onyx Systems, RAIR, and System Plus Inc, also phased out. Microsoft’s main campus is in Redmond, east of Seattle. But in 2001, perhaps in a nod to all the companies it buried, it opened a relatively small Silicon Valley location near Google. Correction: An earlier version of this story stated Fremont was a city in Santa Clara county. It is in Alameda County. It also stated Menlo Park as part of Palo Alto. They are neighboring cities.

The iOS 10.3 update has been in the pipeline for the last three months - but users haven't yet been able to download it. As with other Apple updates, you'll receive a notification on your iOS device and will have the option to install in then and there - or wait for a more convenient time. Read More Android O: Google claims next version of Android will make your smartphone's battery last longer (Photo: Apple) (Photo: VHX) Although the iOS 10.3 update isn't a major release, it'll still bring a couple of useful extras for some of us. Mainly it includes a way to find lost AirPod headphones. Apple's standard issue Find My iPhone app will be updated to include an additional option to Find My Airpods. There are a couple of caveats though, the headphones need to be within Bluetooth range - roughly five meters. When activated, the feature will make the AirPods play a sound loud enough to locate them within a room. Read More What is Apple Clips? App offers a new way to share videos on Snapchat and Instagram If you've lose them outside, then the app will tell you their last known location when they were connected. It's up to you to retrace your steps and hopefully stumble across the Bluetooth connection - providing the £159 wireless buds are fully charged. Great, so what are the other new features? Aside from tracking the AirPods, iOS 10.3 brings in a few smaller features that some users may find useful. They include: Siri support for cricket scores from the ICC and Indian Premier League; 3D Touch support for Apple's Weather app; A new Podcast widget similar to the one available for Apple's Music app; A new security section within the Apple ID Settings and the ability for developers to reply directly to reviews.

It's estimated that 76% of iOS users are running iOS 10, which was introduced in September 2016. Conversely, less than 1% of Android users are currently running Google's latest version of the software (Nougat) - although admittedly it is only available on a limited number of phones. poll loading Which operating system is better? 0+ VOTES SO FAR iOS Android Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @MirrorTech Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On Apple Apps iOS iOS 10 iPhone Technology all Most Read Most Recent Samsung Galaxy S8Samsung Galaxy S8: Price, UK release date, screen, specs and all the news on the imminent launch The new Samsung Galaxy S8 is set to be revealed on March 29, but we already know a lot about it iPhone 8iPhone 8: Release date, price, rumours and news about Apple's 2017 iPhone Apple only just launched its iPhone 7 a few months ago, but many eyes are already turning to next year's model, the iPhone 8, which is expected to be Apple's biggest launch in years iOSApple iOS 10.3 released: Here are the new features coming to YOUR iPhone You'll now be able to track down lost headphones and find out the cricket score TechnologyThis is how to find out which of your friends have deleted you on Facebook Check at your own peril RobotsRevolutionary 3D-printed robot that moves like a worm could be shrunk and sent into your intestine Scientists hope it could replace colonoscopies in the future RobotsRevolutionary 3D-printed robot that moves like a worm could be shrunk and sent into your intestine Scientists hope it could replace colonoscopies in the future Samsung Galaxy S8Samsung Galaxy S8: Price, UK release date, screen, specs and all the news on the imminent launch The new Samsung Galaxy S8 is set to be revealed on March 29, but we already know a lot about it Samsung Inc.Samsung plans to sell 'refurbished' Galaxy Note 7s with new batteries that DEFINITELY won't explode this time Samsung claims the objective of introducing refurbished devices is to minimise any environmental impact iOSApple iOS 10.3 released: Here are the new features coming to YOUR iPhone You'll now be able to track down lost headphones and find out the cricket score GoogleGoogle Home hands-on review: First impressions of Google's new smart speaker After a few months on sale in the US, the Google Home speaker is coming to the UK Most Read Most Recent SnakesBody of man swallowed whole by monster 7m-long python is cut from its stomach by horrified villagers WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT.

Dennis Crowley, co-founder and Executive Chairman of Foursquare Image credit: Getty Images/Noam Galai / Stringer Nancy Miller Current Issue Subscribe now ---Shares March 28, 2017 This story appears in the April 2017 issue of Entrepreneur. Subscribe » In the spring of 2016, Foursquare CEO Jeff Glueck went on CNBC to make a bold prediction: Chipotle comparable sales would fall by 29 percent in its first quarter. The network’s anchor seemed skeptical. The fast-food chain was reacting to some health scares at the time, but no one was predicting nearly as steep a drop in revenue. “What is the technology here? What have you got that enables you to do this?” the anchor asked. Related: Patience and Faith Built S'Well Into a $100 Million-Dollar Brand Glueck was basically fishing for this question. Foursquare had reinvented itself as a location intelligence company for business, but it was in the painstaking process of shaking off its image as a forgotten consumer app. Glueck had been making the rounds for less than a year, seeding the market with all kinds of predictions based on his company’s data -- how many new iPhones Apple would sell, or how well McDonald’s all-day breakfast launch was going. The Chipotle forecast was the boldest yet, and it held true. Two weeks after Glueck’s appearance on CNBC, the Mexican eatery reported sales had fallen 29.7 percent from a year earlier. Boom. Foursquare for the win. Glueck’s Nostradamus act was a long time in the making -- the result of a process that was set in motion four years earlier, in 2012, when Foursquare cofounder Dennis Crowley began looking for help in turning his company around. The startup had accumulated mountains of data about where people shopped and traveled but hadn’t figured out how to monetize it. Today, that puzzle seems to have been solved: Foursquare is on the path to $100 million in revenue, and profits are within sight for the first time. But a shift like this wasn’t easy -- because as Crowley and his new leadership team discovered, it takes more than just a good insight to jump-start a company’s growth. First, the entire company and its culture must be reshaped to fit a new vision. Foursquare had launched in 2009 with enough hyperbole to buoy an aircraft carrier. It was essentially a digital layer atop the real world -- encouraging people to “check in” wherever they went, announcing their movements throughout the day. Someone is at Dunkin’ Donuts. Now the gym. Now their favorite brunch place. The reward for sharing? Stickers. Badges. Friendly competition to become the mayor of a favorite bar. And, critically, being part of a community of people sharing recommendations on the best of everything around them. But despite its cultural domination, the app just couldn’t translate into a lasting business. Its tens of millions of users never became hundreds of millions. After a few years, engineers were leaving for other startups. Users became less active, and Foursquare began to feel like the mess left behind from a really great party. Employee morale was low. Nonetheless, investors stood by patiently, pouring money into the app again and again -- perhaps, as one wag put it, because everyone thought you’d have to be a moron to fumble the business. In 2012, Crowley turned to Steven Rosenblatt, a startup warrior and advertising executive from Apple, to solve the puzzle. He’d run the tech giant’s advertising platform, iAd, and was looking forward to a long summer break with his wife and young kids. He figured he’d spend a few months as a part-time Foursquare adviser, and that would be that. “Day one, I walk in and Dennis is like, ‘Why don’t you come hang out at the executive meeting?’” Rosenblatt was taken aback; at a secretive company like Apple, those kinds of invitations were never casually extended. Then Rosenblatt discovered that, also very much unlike Apple, he could peek under the hood of every part of the business. “Product road maps -- every product map -- across the company are an open book. You can go over to anyone: ‘What are you doing? What are you working on?’” Related: How This Once-Dismissed Fitness Brand Found the Secret to Scale Rosenblatt was smitten. And thanks to all this access, he was able to help Crowley see the business opportunities that had eluded him until then. Crowley had been working on the assumption that Foursquare should follow the local business advertising route of Yelp, which had leapfrogged Foursquare in its revenue growth. “He initially thought this company would build a local Yellow Pages-type business,” Rosenblatt says. No. First and foremost, Rosenblatt decided, Foursquare is a technology company, not a run-of-the-mill sales-and-marketing operation. It needed to capitalize on what made it special.  Over the next few years, the company’s leadership roles evolved. Rosenblatt became chief revenue officer. Glueck joined in 2014 as chief operating officer; he’d been known as an experienced startup hand who had been a turnaround doctor at Travelocity. Then in January 2016, Crowley, who had been CEO, stepped aside to focus on big, futuristic ideas and handed the title to Glueck, while Rosenblatt became president. Then the two new leaders began diving further into all the valuable data Foursquare wasn’t putting to use. There was plenty. Asset number one: The more than 11 billion check-ins tracking people in real life since 2009. Asset number two: The four million monthly updates to its Places database -- changes in address, phone number, a Japanese restaurant that was now a spaghetti joint. And then there was the sleeper, asset number three: 100,000 developers tapping into the Foursquare API -- its location technology -- for free. Enormous companies like Yahoo and Pinterest were using it a billion times a year; for example, when you pin a photo in Pinterest and tag its location, that’s using Foursquare’s data. But Foursquare had never asked these companies to pay.  Foursquare had always thought of itself as an app for consumers, but this treasure trove suggested something else to Glueck and Rosenblatt: The company needed to think of itself as a location data company. Based on GPS and other location signals, Foursquare could tell what business a user was visiting -- something no other company could do as reliably. That was a powerful tool, and it could be used to serve other businesses. First, Foursquare decided to start treating its data like the valuable property it is. It asked those big companies to start paying for its API; the developers on the other end of the line basically laughed and said, “Yeah, we were wondering when you were going to start charging.” Crowley was amazed. “I had never had that experience in extracting dollars from big enterprise customers, but thankfully we had people here who knew how to do that,” he says. (Small companies and startups can still access the API free of charge.) The next steps were a bit trickier, as both Glueck and Rosenblatt began driving the company to develop new ways to sell its data. Foursquare’s culture wasn’t set up for that. When Rosenblatt joined in 2012, there were only two or three business-development people on a staff of roughly 110, and 100 percent of the engineering team was dedicated to consumer apps. At first, some of the team balked at diverting resources away from the app and toward enterprise products. “This wasn’t a company that was saying, ‘We don’t want to make money,’” Rosenblatt says. “Dennis knew at the time, and the board obviously knew, we were ready to grow up and build and turn this into a real business.” But still, Foursquare’s people had taken their jobs to work on a fun consumer app. They believed in it and vigorously debated the coming changes. Related: How This Founder Turned Surplus Razors into a Billion-Dollar Company That Changed the Industry Glueck sought inspiration for how to evolve the company’s culture, and referred to Good to Great, a book by Jim Collins about how 11 companies shook off mediocrity to become market leaders. Here, Glueck learned about the flywheel concept, a visual metaphor for business. When first pushed, a flywheel moves slowly and with great effort. With every successive revolution, the pace quickens. To the outsider, it appears the momentum is sudden, but, in fact, it’s the product of a steady grind. This was what Foursquare would do, Glueck decided: It would move slowly and deliberately, until every part of it eventually churned.  From 2014 to 2016, Foursquare began rolling out changes. In mid 2014, it split its consumer apps in two -- Swarm became the check-in app, and Foursquare City Guide recommended activities based on user interests. Critics scoffed, but the team continued with its plan. They launched Place Insights, a product that analyzes foot traffic trends from 93 million locations globally -- information that can help a retailer decide where to set up a new store, say, or help a marketer know who is likely to use its brand. In April 2015, Foursquare added Pinpoint, a digital advertising system that helps brands target consumers based on where people go in real life. (So, for example, Pinpoint could help an athletic-wear maker show ads to anyone who goes to the gym three times a week.) And in February 2016, it created Attribution, which helps advertisers answer their most pressing question: After someone sees a digital message, do they take action in the real world? After two years of pushing on the flywheel, Foursquare has new momentum and a new identity. Its executives push back against that last part; they say Foursquare’s core as a data company was always there, just waiting for the right technology to make it possible. Whether that’s true or just semantics doesn’t really matter. The numbers prove it’s working. Enterprise products power virtually all the revenue growth at Foursquare -- up 74 percent in 2016 from a year earlier. That’s tens of millions of dollars. Back in 2009, when Crowley was first shopping around his idea for Foursquare, investors told him it would take eight to 10 years to make the business work. Now here we are, coming up on that time. They seem to have been right. But Crowley did not anticipate his own path -- giving up the job of CEO and, in some way, his vision for what the core of Foursquare was. “Hard isn’t the right word,” he says of the change. “There is no second-guessing that now. It was very clearly the right thing for the company, and I am still here every single day. I get to work on the things I want to, and I can let them execute.” Today, Foursquare’s growth potential is huge, says Glueck. Ninety-two percent of commerce takes place in real life, not online. That means Google can tell you about only 8 percent of what everyone is doing with their spending habits. Foursquare aims to tell you about the other 92 percent. According to Asif Khan, founder of the Location Based Marketing Association, there are 5,000 businesses angling to profit from location intelligence; by 2019, total technology spend will reach $43 billion and advertisers will shell out $21 billion on location-based strategies. Looming large in this sector are Facebook and Google, each with its own armies of engineers working to compete. Glueck shrugs off these threats: The market is plenty big. Related: Data Helped a Creative Agency Hack its Way to 30,000 Percent Growth The flywheel is spinning with increasing speed. Foursquare has signed deals with Snapchat to improve its geo-filtering. More than one million users have agreed to leave location sharing on all the time so Foursquare can track and analyze their movements; through a partnership with Nielsen, that data is then being connected to consumers' purchasing data, so that marketers can understand how ads people see directly relate to purchases they make. Now when he goes on CNBC, nobody questions Glueck’s technology. Rather, he gets to say, “Three of the top five hedge funds are using Foursquare data to give them an investing edge.” And inside Foursquare, Glueck has effectively redefined how to measure its own success. The company managed to raise $45 million in 2016, reportedly at half the $650 million valuation it commanded in 2013. Glueck won’t comment on that. He simply says the company was misunderstood, and now investors recognize that it’s a location intelligence company -- something that should be measured the same way as a services-as-a-software or programmatic advertising firm, which command a fraction of the multiples of sexy social media companies. With the new funding round, Glueck crafted a fresh “cap table,” which means the distribution of ownership was reconstituted. (That’s often the case when a company raises money in a “down round.”) Glueck says the details of the deal were completely transparent to employees, who got new shares and on better terms. Preferred shareholders even gave up some of their advantages in this latest round, he says. But now they are in a position to likely triple or quadruple their investment, he says. Will it be through an IPO or a buyout? The team waves off the question. They are focused on growth. The exit will come when it comes. Foursquare is on the path to $100 million in revenue, a goal Glueck set last year. Profits are within sight, he says. Talent was once fleeing Foursquare, but now it’s pounding on the door. Most recently, the former CEO of the Advertising Research Foundation asked to join. The company created a new position for her. Glueck is even telling investors that Foursquare is destined to become a billion-dollar company -- a unicorn. That might excite some people. Others might see it as hype. The valuation isn’t a concern for Albert Wenger, managing partner at Union Square Ventures, one of the first investors in Foursquare. Wenger invested again in 2016, even though the valuation had dropped. What’s really central to any venture capitalist is growth. “If real sustainable value is being created,” he says, “we will continue to support it.”  Growth Strategies Foursquare Inspiration How to Run a Small Business Get the Magazine Limited-Time Offer: 1 Year Print + Digital Edition and 2 Gifts only $9.99 Subscribe Now Company Advertise Brand Licensing Contact Us Staff Contribute Upcoming Events Customer Care Strategies Webinar Ask Entrepreneur With Dan Bova Entrepreneur 360™ Livestream Products Business Books Reprints & Licensing Classifieds Editions United States Middle East India Español Albanian Philippines South Africa China Connect Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Flickr Tumblr RSS Feedly Subscribe Now Gift Subscriptions Subscriber Services Digital Editions iOSAndroidKindle Copyright © 2017 Entrepreneur Media, Inc.

Siri Rumored to Get iMessage and iCloud Integration in iOS 11 GO The new iOS version will be released later this year Mar 28, 2017 10:39 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Apple just recently introduced iOS 10.3, but information about the upcoming iOS 11 continues to surface online. The latest reveals that the Cupertino company may be preparing to bring iMessage integration into Siri, to adapt to user habits. A new report shows that Apple will update Siri in iOS 11 with features like adaptive AI and integration with iMessage and iCloud. Information should be taken with a grain of salt at this point, as nothing is certain until the new version arrives later this year. Nonetheless, the report mentions that Apple’s virtual assistant will have the capacity to learn the user’s habits and provide different options based on context. Users have been rather displeased with Siri’s lack of contextual awareness, seeing how Google Assistant does offer some options in this direction. Siri to get iMessage and iCloud integration Google’s AI assistant can find data on the Internet and a number of services and applications, and also respond to follow-up questions without forcing users to speak out a specific command. iMessage integration in iOS 11 will apparently allow Siri to perform actions based on conversations and suggest restaurants when users type in a certain dish or offer to book a reservation. Moreover, iCloud integration could identify connections between devices to offer relevant actions. There’s also talk of deeper integration of Siri in tvOS and watchOS. Aside from this, Apple is also rumored to bring dark mode to iOS 11, a feature that many iPhone users have been awaiting for quite a while. Group video calls in FaceTime is also said to debut in iOS 11. Apple is expected to introduce the new iOS 11 during the Worldwide Developers Conference in June, and the new version is said to make close to 200,000 apps obsolete with the elimination of 32-bit support. Whether these claims are true and further Siri integration will be provided is unknown at this point, we’ll just have to wait and see until this June. #Apple#Siri#iOS 11#iMessage#iCloud subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Releases macOS 10.12.4 Sierra Update with Night Shift, Siri Improvements Police Warn Against Dangerous “Siri 108” Prank on iPhones Apple’s 64-bit Only iOS 11 Could Make 187,000 Apps Obsolete iOS Sees Notable Increase in the US, While Android Grows in Europe The Best Antivirus Software for Windows 7 Phishing Campaign Promises Free In-Game Pets to World of Warcraft Players Mozilla Firefox 52.0.2 Released to Fix Linux Crash on Startup, Other Issues HTC U Flagship With Touch-Sensitive Frame to Launch in April Samsung Galaxy S8 User Guide Leaks Hours before Official Unveiling Microsoft Releases a New Windows 10 Build for Mobile but It’s Not What You Think The Best Antivirus Software for Windows 7 Oracle Linux 6.9 Released with Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel 4.1.12, TLS 1.2    Apple animation for Siri New Mac Apps WhatRoute: Straightforward Mac app that enables you to monitor your internet traffic and allows you to perform Ping, Trace, Query, Whois, and other queries.

Michael Hillman, who joined Apple in March 2000, was initially lead designer on the iMac, before moving on to be manager of iMac product design. He spent seven years of his 15 at the company as chief architect for all of Apple's consumer desktop products, and his final four involved a "confidential" hardware project - per Linkedin. Hillman joins Oculus after a year at the robotics company Zoox Inc.. According to Bloomberg, he will work closely with COO Hans Hartmann, who joined Oculus from Fitbit in May last year. "We're excited to have him leading the hardware organization," an Oculus spokesperson told Fortune. "We have a world-class hardware team that led the development of Rift and Touch, and we're going to keep investing in hardware as we push the boundaries of VR technology and build next generation consumer VR products." By any measure, this is a significant hire for Oculus, and it arrives shortly after another. In January, Facebook appointed a new head of VR for the entire organisation: Hugo Barra, who was the lead international executive at the Chinese company Xiaomi. According to Facebook, Barra has yet to officially start at the company.

Tech Apple Science Cars Baselworld 2017 Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     2017 IPhone SE With Twice The Storage Aims At Indian Market Posted: Mar 28 2017, 5:42am CDT | by Shane McGlaun, in News | Apple     Apple is ready to build the iPhone SE in India with Wistron Yesterday morning when many of us woke, the Apple Store was down and we all know that means new products are inbound. One of the products thought to be the least likely to get an update was the iPhone SE, but update those cheaper smartphones Apple certainly did. Sadly no red color is available on the iPhone SE as you can get on the higher-end iPhone models. Don't Miss: Today's Electronics Bargains at Woot.com The updates for the iPhone SE are very mild and amount to nothing other than increased storage capacity. Previously the iPhone SE was offered in 16GB or 64GB versions. The upgrade brings those models to either 32GB or 128GB of storage. The 32GB version will maintain the same $399 starting price while the 128GB version will sell for $499. Both of these new iPhone SE models will be available starting on Friday. The storage capacity is the only hardware change made to the 2017 iPhone SE, but if you are unfamiliar with the model I will run down the other tech specs here. Apple offers the iPhone SE in silver, gold, space gray, and rose gold. All colors have white trim except the space grey which has black trim. iPhone SE models measure 4.87" x 2.31" x 0.30" and weigh in at 3.99 ounces. The 4-inch LED backlit retina display has a native resolution of 1136 x 640 and 326 ppi. The contrast ratio is 800:1 and the screen has a maximum of 500 cd/m2 brightness. The screen is also coated with a fingerprint resistant oleophobic coating. The processor is an A9 64-bit chip with an embedded M9 motion coprocessor. The rear camera is a 12MP unit with f2.2 aperture. The camera also supports live photos with stabilization and is covered with a sapphire crystal lens cover and uses a backside illumination sensor. iPhone SE models will record 4K video at 30fps and full HD video at up to 60 fps. Slo-motion support is up to 240 fps in 720p mode. Touch ID fingerprint sensor is integrated. While the updates to the iPhone SE were announced not long ago, Apple plans to build the iPhone SE and a couple other iPhone models in India. Apple will start off making iPhone SE models with the upgraded storage in india and will then move some of its manufacturing for the iPhone 6 and 6S in the country as well reports Mashable. Apple will be bringing production of the iPhone SE and other models to India with Taiwanese maker Wistron doing the actual assembly. Reports indicate production will kick off in four to six weeks. One reason Apple is building smartphones in India is that devices made there aren't subject to steep import duties and the manufacturing move will make iPhones cheaper domestically. Wistron has received its certification from the BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards), which is something that the manufacturer needs to be able to build the iPhone SE in India. The BIS certification or A 1723 model or the iPhone SE. The assembly facility is located in Bengaluru and the number for the brand is R-62000612 and is certified under IS 13252. The iPhone SE was recently priced at Rs 19,999 in India, which is about $307 US.

The report covered the ongoing race to create a pair of augmented reality glasses that could one day replace the smartphone as consumers' primary computing device. While Facebook is clearly ahead of Apple on creating a headset for VR experiences, Facebook hired an Apple hardware veteran to assist and expedite next-generation features for their headset.   According to Bloomberg, "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants the company to own the future of virtual reality, and in the short term that means putting a lot of VR headsets on a lot of faces. Even for a company with nearly 2 billion monthly active users, hardware is still an incredibly difficult beast to master. To do so, the company is hiring Michael Hillman, a 15-year veteran of Apple, to lead the VR product roadmap for Oculus as head of VR hardware.   An Oculus spokesperson tells Bloomberg that Hillman will work closely alongside Oculus COO Hans Hartmann in his role.   Earlier this year Facebook hired Xiaomi's Hugo Barra to lead their Virtual Reality business which includes the Oculus unit. Facebook is obviously wanting to step up their headset development and get it to market in full force knowing that Microsoft's HoloLens is rapidly advancing while Apple is in the wings working on a device that could really challenge all competitors in this space.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

With USB-C slowly becoming the universal standard for Android smartphones, Apple might include a charging port in iPhone 8 that would combine the company’s Lightning port and USB-C, according to a report. Analyst Christopher Rolland told Phone Arena on Tuesday that the 2017 iPhone would include a hybrid USB-C and Lightning port. The two connectors would be inter-operable, which means that iPhone users would be able to charge the phone with both Lightning and USB-C chargers. Simply put, you might be able to charge your iPhone with an Android charger in case your iPhone charger is not around. Read: iPhone 8: 6 Expected Features Rolland also revealed two more findings about Apple products, based on his discussions with suppliers and tech companies based in Asia: all three 2017 iPhone models could feature long-range wireless charging and the Apple Watch 3 would be LTE capable.  The company is expected to launch three models — an iPhone 8 priced at $1,000 and two iPhone 7S models priced lower — in Fall 2017. Long-range wireless charging for iPhone 8 has been long rumored, but it was earlier expected to be an exclusive iPhone 8 feature. The fact that all three models could feature wireless charging would add to the appeal of the other two iPhones and help them compete with rival Samsung Galaxy S8, which is expected to launch Wednesday at $899, lower than the iPhone 8’s $1,000 expected price. Also, Rolland’s findings indicate that Apple Watch 3 might have a model with a SIM card slot and LTE connectivity. The device could also have a CAT-M1 chipset and would let users make voice-over internet protocol (VoIP) calls. Read: iPhone 8, iPhone 7s Or iPhone Pro?

Repeated problems with an Apple iPad led one frustrated reader to ask Ellen Roseman for help in dealing with the company's customer service.  (TNS FILE PHOTO)   By Ellen Roseman On Your Side Columnist Tues., March 28, 2017 When a consumer product is defective and the manufacturer won’t help, I ask the retailer to step in. This did the trick for Verna Harrison and Don Dolson, whose Oreck air purifier stopped working after two years. The Truman Cell, the air purifier’s key component, had a three-year warranty. So, when the cell started to arc constantly, they shipped it to the manufacturer’s Winnipeg office. “We have not heard from Oreck since we sent it on Dec. 5,” Harrison told me in February. “We made 12 to 15 calls and all we got was a message that says ‘All our operators are busy with other customers. Please leave your phone number and we’ll get back to you as soon as possible.’ There was no response.” Article Continued Below When I didn’t get around to reaching Oreck Manufacturing Co., she sent me a reminder and said she had bought the product at a Canadian Tire store northeast of Toronto. Stephanie Nadalin, a spokeperson for the chain, reached out to the dealer in Uxbridge (northeast of Toronto). “He wanted to make things right for the customer, even though the issue lies with the manufacturer,” Nadalin said. “It turns out that the product is discontinued. He would like to offer a new unit (comparable) absolutely free.” The couple visited their local Canadian Tire store to pick up their new air purifier two days later. “After months of not being able to connect with Oreck, our last resort was to email you,” Harrison said. “We appreciate your help. The store made sure we were satisfied.” While I rarely hear from Apple customers, I received a recent complaint about Jacob Thielmann’s tablet problems. “Four years ago, Dad purchased an iPad Mini, 64 GB model, from Best Buy,” said his son-in-law Bob Romanuk. “No one is disputing that the device was out of warranty.” Last August, Thielmann found the unit would not hold a charge for 24 hours, even when not in use. Then, it wouldn’t start. His son-in-law took the iPad to an Apple repair centre, which processed a replacement order. It cost $260 to send the iPad back and get a new model within three days. Things were great until October, when the problem recurred. This time, the repair centre charged $33 to test the battery and charging system, only to insist that nothing was wrong. “I took it to our nearest Apple store,” Romanuk said. “The rep performed some diagnostics and immediately provided me with a replacement.” The second replacement had a 90-day warranty. After 75 days, the iPad again was failing to hold a charge. Romanuk drove back to the Apple store, where another rep advised doing a complete reset. It didn’t work. “The iPad continues to be unable to hold a charge. We even removed the mail app, as we were told that Gmail might be sucking juice in the background.” The warranty ended Jan. 14, but Apple said Thielmann would be covered because he had reported the problem during the 90-day period. Relief was followed by disappointment when Apple requested payment for a third replacement. In a live chat, an Apple senior adviser promised to send a refurbished unit to Thielmann once he returned his faulty iPad. “Nothing has been received,” Romanuk said three weeks later. “It is not easy for my father-in-law to get around and typing is a challenge. Being without an iPad is also a great inconvenience.” Apple Canada spokesperson Tara Hendela thanked me for sending the complaint. Within days, Apple called from San Jose, Calif., and sent a new iPad. “The actions of Apple’s representatives restored our faith in the company,” Romanuk said. “Jacob and I received what can only be described as exemplary treatment.” Apple, a manufacturer, started its chain of stores in 2001. Founder Steve Jobs was inspired by the service provided by a Canadian company, Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts. I’m keen to hear from readers. Have you tried Apple’s customer service? Where does it excel? Where does it slip up? I’ll report on your views in an upcoming column. Ellen Roseman appears in Smart Money. You can reach her at eroseman@thestar.ca .

Apple released seven betas of iOS 10.3 to developers and the public before rolling out the final version. The first beta was released back on January 26, Forbes magazine reported on Monday. Since Apple's new Bluetooth earbuds, AirPods, are small they can be easy to lose. The update lets a user find the misplaced AirPods using the "Find My iPhone" app. Using the "Find My iPhone" app a user can command the AirPods to make a noise so they could be found. The other way to find the AirPods is you can mute audio playback on each of the individual AirPods in case one of them went missing and the "Find My iPhone" app would show a user where it is located on the map. With the update, a user can now make and receive Wi-Fi calls through iCloud connected devices such as iMac, Mac mini, MacBook, iPad, iPod Touch and Apple Watch. This feature is useful if the battery on iPhone is low. The 10.3 update adds a new Apple Podcasts app that looks similar to the Music app widget. Moreover, Apple adjusted the app animations when one opens and closes apps. A new "Apple ID" menu has been added in the Settings app. This menu shows Apple ID information and all the devices that a user is logged into. Apple has also updated SiriKit so that developers can build apps that allows Siri to pay bills, check payment statuses and schedule future rides with Uber. Other minor updates include new security features and a new iCloud section under the Apple ID Settings menu. The new section shows a breakdown of cloud storage usage. This feature also shows which apps use iCloud.

While the premium iPhone 8 is expected to offer a variety of features that won’t be available on the iPhone 7s models, all three iPhones will reportedly share the same powerful new A11 chip. Don't Miss: It’s probably time to admit the Galaxy S8 design is better than Apple’s iPhone 7 design After some reports indicated that chipmakers were experiencing low yields with 10nm CPUs that will power the Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8, a new report from China indicates that TSMC is ready to start A11 production in April. Quoting Chinese-language site Economic Daily News, Digitimes says that A11 volume production will start in April. The company is preparing to mass-produce 50 million units before July and maintain capacity to manufacture 100 million A11 chips before the end of the year. This detail indicates that Apple will use the faster, more energy-efficient A11 chip in all of its 2017 iPhones, not just the iPhone 8. History shows that Apple has upgraded the processors in its new iPhones every year. However, the iPhone 5c that launched alongside the iPhone 5s in 2013 packed the same A6 chip found inside the previous-generation iPhone 5. The first benchmark results for the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 and Exynos 8895, the 10nm chips that power the Galaxy S8, are already out, revealing massive performance gains for the upcoming Samsung handset. It’s likely the A11 chip will offer a similar, if not better, performance. The report also notes that the A11 chips are built on a 10nm FinFET process, packing wafer-level integrated fan-out (InFO) packaging technology. That sounds complicated, but the bottom line is that it will result is a smaller chip ready to offer better performance while utilizing less energy.
