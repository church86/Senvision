That's a solid performance for a product line introduced less than two years ago. By any commercial standard it is a success. Rolex remains the leading watchmaker and is likely to stay on top for now. In Apple's recent Q1 financial report, Tim Cook said the Watch had its best ever quarter. He says Apple struggled to meet demand. The rest of the so-called 'smartwatch' market doesn't come close. Android Wear watchmakers have been slow to update their models. Lenovo abandoned the market. Pebble sold its watch business. There have been stories saying the smartwatch market is dead. Away from the Apple Watch that's a fair description. I stopped wearing the first Apple Watch after a traumatic introduction. More recently I've tried newer models; one with a nylon strap1 another with leather. Whenever I write about the Apple Watch I hear from people who love them or love other smartwatches. I'm not keen. For the most part I find them annoying and difficult to live with. They don't add anything to my productivity or make life more fun. Watch fans tell me they like the notifications. If anything they are what I like least of all. They are a distraction. They interrupt my concentration with constant incoming wrist taps or bleeps2. But that's me and how I work. You may feel otherwise. My other gripe is the frequent charging. A Watch lasts about a day. That means it needs recharging overnight. On a few occasions I found I placed on the charger in a way that meant there was no charge the next day. If I left the Watch at home, it didn't make a difference to me. The one area where the Apple Watch shines is fitness tracking. I found it useful when the Watch told to get off my chair every hour. Getting those activity bars all the way around the clock face became a daily goal. It made me walk more and be more aware of exercise. Despite that, I'm not going to buy a Watch. Much of the time I wear a scruffy old Swatch on my left wrist. It needs a new strap and does nothing other than let me know the time. Sure, I can get that from my phone which is never more than a metre or two away. But I've 50 years of muscle memory looking at the wrist. By a curious coincidence Mac NZ's Mark Webster has written a similar blog post. Apple Watch a winner but not for me was first posted at billbennett.co.nz. Apple calls them bands. You can, of course, disable notifications. It's possible to turn some or all off. Yet that undermines the point of a smartwatch. If you don't use notifications, what is the reason for having one? © Scoop Media Bill Bennett New Zealand technology news Bill Bennett publishes technology news and features that are directly relevant to New Zealand readers.

The report shows a major shift in the market, Apple has become the top global smartphone vendor after 8 years. The last time when Apple held this position was in Q4 2014, when its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus managed to generate massive sales for the company. It seems that the latest iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were the flagships that drove Apple’s market share up to 17.9%, compared to Samsung’s 17.8% in Q4 last year. Apple’s phones saw high demand in most mature markets like Korea, North America and Western Europe, where sales of Samsung devices were greatly affected by the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco. Apple managed to sell by just 256,000 units more than Samsung and it would be interesting to see if the Cupertino company will hold its leading position in this year’s last quarter after both companies ... » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Ingraham Media Group - Affiliate - 1 week ago< > Embed Apple Reclaims Smartphone Market 00:48 For the first time since 2011, Apple rose to the top of the smartphone industry — here's why.

Shows Good Morning America Good Morning America World News Tonight World News Tonight Nightline Nightline 20/20 20/20 This Week This Week Live Watch iPhone App Starts Your Car Remotely By KI MAE HEUSSNER NED POTTER LIAM BERKOWITZ Oct. 15, 2009 0 Shares Email Star Directed Electronics/ABC News Photo Illustration Like something out of a James Bond movie, a new iPhone application promises to remotely unlock, start and warm your car. 0 Shares Email Just when you thought developers had exhausted the iPhone's potential to impress, here comes another: An application that promises to remotely unlock, start and warm your car from almost anywhere in the world. Called Viper SmartStart, the app was launched earlier this week by Directed Electronics, a vehicle security and remote start systems designer, and can be downloaded for free from Apple's App store. Using an existing remote car starting system from Viper, with a tap of a few buttons on your iPhone, your car can be started, warmed up and humming, just waiting for you to hit the road. Although remote starting systems for cars usually have a limited line-of-sight range, Viper says its system has "virtually unlimited range" since your iPhone, not the original remote, communicates over cell networks with your car. "We think customers will find all sorts of unique and personal value in Viper SmartStart," Mike Simmons, EVP of Directed Electronics' parent company, DEI Holdings, said in a statement. "Whether helping out her husband, who's locked his keys in the car, or securely locking her keys and purse in the car while she takes a jog with some music on her iPhone, we expect to hear about some uses we never anticipated." Once the Viper SmartStart hardware is professionally installed in the car, the iPhone can also be used to defrost windows, cool down the vehicle in warmer weather, unlock the trunk or activate a panic alarm. But though the app is free, the hardware that will actually make it work with your car is quite pricey. The system will only work if paired with one of two Viper SmartStart systems that go for $499 (for those who don't already have a remote start system) and $299 (for those who do have remote start). The first year of service is free but, subsequently, service is $29.99 a year. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. There are thousands of applications -- from the silly to the serious -- for wireless handheld devices. Here is a sampling: App Turns iPhone Into 'Sleaze Detector' Sleaze ball or sweetheart? A new iPhone app claims it can help singles tell the difference. Launched in September by information commerce firm Intelius, Date Check lets users perform instant background checks on potential dates from their mobile phones. Once it's downloaded on an iPhone, the application only needs a name or cell phone number to search publicly available records. If you activate the app's Sleaze Detector, it scans criminal records to determine if anyone with that name has been charged with drug possession, assault and battery, sex crimes, DUI and other offenses. If you click Net Worth, it looks for information about home ownership and property value. It can also check social networking sites, such as LinkedIn to provide employment and education information. "Date Check is like having a private investigator in your purse," John Arnold, co-founder of Intelius and executive vice president of business development, said in a statement. "Letting a stranger into your life is a huge risk, and in the age of Internet anonymity, a simple online search isn't enough to tell you everything you need to know. " This application, the company said, "gives singles a safer way to mingle." But though the app itself is free, the services can cost up to $40, depending on the kind of searches that are selected. Date Check is available for download in Apple's App store and will be available soon in Android and BlackBerry versions. PUMA Index Tracks Stocks With Stripping Models You've probably heard of the Dow, the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ 100. But try this financial index on for size: The PUMA. To celebrate its new line of bodywear, sports clothing company PUMA launched an iPhone application earlier this month that tracks global stocks, but not in the way you might think. As stocks on the Dow Jones industrial average go up and down, so does one key element on the PUMA models: their clothes. "Think of it as an entertaining antidote to Wall Street woes," the company said in a statement. "So now if you lose your shirt, at least our models do too." Though the application might make Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke blush, the models only undress down to their new PUMA threads. As the Dow climbs, the clothes come back on. The PUMA application is free in Apple's App store, and the company says it can even help save consumers money. Showing the downloaded application to a PUMA sales associate can get you a 20 percent discount. That offer lasts until Nov. 8, 2009. App Find Medicinal Marijuana Providers Smoking marijuana is known to have an adverse effect on memory and concentration, but now, thanks to a new iPhone application, even the foggiest of users should be able to locate their connection -- make that medicinal marijuana provider -- with relative ease. Launched by AJNAG (Activists Justifying the Natural Agriculture of Ganja), a Web-based community advocating for medical marijuana, the Cannabis app takes those seeking medicinal marijuana through the entire process of obtaining it. The app is downloadable from Apple's store for $2.99. "Our goal is to put the power of cannabis change in your pocket while you enjoy the most sticky and potent iPhone application available!" the founders say in a statement on their Web site. Here's how it works. The application displays an interactive map dotted with doctors who can prescribe medicinal marijuana treatment for their patients. It also shows -- after, presumably, users have procured prescriptions -- the medicinal marijuana suppliers within the users' vicinity. And, what's more, the application includes a database of lawyers who specialize in marijuana-related cases, in should users encounter skeptical local authorities. To help with grassroots media campaigning, the developers also say they will donate 50 cents for every "Cannabis" purchase to a non-profit reform fund, which they say will be set up once the application reaches 1,000 subscriptions. Just remember -- Cannabis only works in states where marijuana has been legalized, so if you've scored tickets to a Grateful Dead show in, say, Alabama, don't expect Cannabis to help you score anything else. Craving Pizza? Just Download the App In a move sure to thrill its laziest customers, Pizza Hut unveiled recently its new iPhone application that allows users to order pizza without so much as dialing a number. Simply type in your order, then sit back and wait until it arrives. For those bored with the traditional methods of ordering pizza, the app also has some unconventional tools. If you want extra sauce on your wings, for instance, you shake the phone like a bottle. And, for those who find ordering pizza too sober a task, the app comes with a racing game named "Hut Racer." Pizza Hut hopes the app will appeal to customers who rely on their iPhones, said Brian Niccol, Pizza Hut's chief marketing officer. "As more of our customers are integrating the iPhone and iPod touch into their everyday lives, Pizza Hut wants to be right there with them," Niccol said in a statement. "As a longtime category leader in innovation, creating an App Store application is just one more way we are helping customers place orders in a way that best fits their mobile lifestyle." Hard of Hearing? Just Grab Your iPhone People don't normally equate the iPhone with medical innovation, but with the June release of an application that doubles as a hearing aid, they may have to reconsider. The application, which is called soundAMP, is made by Ginger Labs, a California-based software applications developer, and is available in the iTunes store for $9.99. Though it's not an actual hearing aid, soundAMP achieves a similar effect. Users just launch the application and then plug in a pair of earphones. The application takes in sound from a microphone (be it built-in, in a headset or from elsewhere) and then amplifies and filters it. Then you can adjust the volume to your liking with a slider on the touchscreen. You also can replay five or 30 seconds by tapping the appropriate button on the screen. Hearing aids often may be associated with the more mature, but soundAMP's developers insist their product is age neutral -- of equal value to the octogenarian hard of hearing and the college student stuck in the back of a large lecture class. (As a caveat, if you really are losing your hearing, you should probably visit a doctor -- soundAMP may be novel, but medically certified it is not.) RunPee Helps Moviegoers With Bathroom Breaks Soda. Coffee. Water. Next time to you go to the movies, chug 'em all down. As long as you have a new iPhone app by your side, you'll know when you can escape to the bathroom without missing the best parts. Approved by Apple's App store in early July, RunPee (yes, really) promises to be the small-bladdered moviegoer's best friend. The application features all the movies currently playing in theaters and tells users approximately how far into the movie each "pee time" begins, the cue line to listen for and even what they've missed. (When you're on your way back to your seat, you can hit a button to unscramble text that provides a short synopsis.) "The idea came from watching King Kong the re-make in 2005," said Dan Florio, RunPee's creator, referring to Peter Jackson's marathon three-hour blockbuster. Throughout much of the movie, he said, he was desperate to relieve himself. "I kept thinking, I wish they would just kill this ape so that I could get to the men's room," he said. Like a good fan, he waited until the end, but not without noting a good three-minute sequence he could have done without. "I just could have gone to the men's room during the scene and I could have enjoyed the end of the movie and the movie would have been better," the Orlando, Fla. developer said. When he walked out of the theater and saw the lines of people waiting to get into the theater, he wanted to share his secret. But being a bit bashful, he kept it to himself. The idea stayed in remission until August 2008, when he launched RunPee.com. He said he's watched about 80 percent of the movies to scout out the best "pee times," but added his family has helped. And anyone who's interested can submit ideas to the site. In January of this year, he partnered with brothers John and Sam Shahidi, and Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Jordan Palmer, to work on the iPhone app. Download figures aren't available yet, but Florio said traffic to the site has jumped from about 30 unique visitors a day last year to about 3,500 visitors a day. Although the app is only available for iPhone owners in the U.S., John Shahidi said the plan is to expand to India, China and Australia. Dunkin' Donuts Goes High-Tech Thanks to the iPhone, coffee runs are now easier than ever. In June, Dunkin' Donuts launched an application for the iPhone and Web that helps organize and automate group orders. Using their computers and mobile devices, customers can initiate orders through 'Dunkin' Run' and alert friends and colleagues that they are willing to be the "Runner." Each member of the group can add their order to the list and then the Runner can print the choices or use the iPhone to create a checklist so that when they get to the store, they don't miss anyone's order. The app doesn't yet transmit the order to the local donut shop. "We conceived of Dunkin' Run as a social application that helps hard-working Americans stay slightly more productive," said Baba Shetty, Hill Holliday's Chief Media Officer. "It's based on the idea of reciprocity -- I'll get your coffee today and hopefully you'll get mine tomorrow -- in a way that perfectly complements the 'we're in it together' ethos of the Dunkin' Donuts brand." Smart Phone Applications Keep You in Check Booty Caller So you're late again. You're a woman with a busy career but you're newly married and you have hopes for a family, too. You're trying to get to a meeting when you hear the familiar ping of your cell phone, telling you a text message has arrived. You open it: "Your fertile window opens today and lasts five more days," it says. "Stress can get in the way of conception, so relax and get a massage, meditate or take a yoga class." The text you just received is from -- yes, this is its real name -- Booty Caller. The app is free, offered by a parenting Web site called BabyCenter.com. Do you really want a text to remind you this might be a good time for sex? It may not be your idea of spontaneous fun, but its makers say it may well help you squeeze some fun -- and a new baby as well -- into an overscheduled life. "Booty Caller is definitely a sign of the times," Linda Murray, the editor-in-chief of BabyCenter.com, wrote in an e-mail. Her site, she said, "set out to create a tool that would provide fertility information as well as tips on getting pregnant in fun, digestible text messages." ScanLife Look around -- through magazines, at store displays, on kids' T-shirts -- and you may see small, square black-and-white patches that remind you of bar codes. They serve much the same purpose. The idea comes from Scanbuy, a New York firm that hopes the little so-called EZcodes will become ubiquitous. "We've been at it for a while," said Jonathan Bulkeley, the CEO of Scanbuy Inc., "and the idea's been the same: making it easier for you to navigate using the camera on your phone, instead of the keypad on your phone." Point your camera phone at, say, an ad for running shoes, and your phone's screen will quickly show you a Web site with specs and user reviews. Point the phone at the code on a kid's shirt, and you're directed straight to his or her Facebook page. Bulkeley said he can see countless other uses: How about a marker, for instance, on the wrapper for a head of lettuce that tells you how long ago it was picked from the field? He has even seen a code on a grave marker that lets you read about the life of the person to whom you're paying respects. Financer Picture yourself in the store, intrigued by the pair of running shoes you checked out via Scanbuy. But can you afford them? Financer is a portable electronic ledger, a way for you to keep track of your money, no matter where you are. "Financer is one of our most popular applications; and we've seen an increase in demand since the recession," said David Becker, CEO of its maker, dBelement. The screen of your iPhone takes on the look of a checkbook ledger, the same thing you used a generation ago, except that it does the math for you. Your account's a bit thin; maybe you'd better hold off on the shoes. And ... Here's to Your Health iFitness So you can't afford those Nikes? For $1.99 (a lot of these programs have similar prices at the Apple App Store), iFitness will suggest workout routines to keep you in shape. Flabby arms? Touch "arms" on the menu and find the best exercises. Worried about your abs? The program will suggest a routine. It will also keep you honest. You can keep a log of what you've done, get an idea of your progress and, if you don't like it, you can try Fit Phone. Or, if you're like so many of us when it comes to New Year's resolutions, you can stop and feel guilty. In which case, you may want to download ... Fast-Food Calorie Counter This is an app for those of us who choose to drown our sorrows with a burger and fries. Tap in any of 4,700 items from 41 chains and it will tell you the calorie count, amount of fat, number of carbs and everything else you need to know to go back and buy those running shoes. It's $2.99 via Apple from Concrete Software. And last but not least... Thousands of Apps Make Hectic Life a Whole Lot Easier Breath-Test Device for your iPod, iPhone Perhaps one of the more ambitious app/devices out there, iBreath is a breath-test device that attaches to your iPhone or iPod. Users blow into the iBreath and a readout of their blood-alcohol content appears on the phone's screen. "All kinds of people are using it," said developer Don Bassler, CEO of David Steele, the iBreath's manufacturer. "Parents of kids, college students, wives for husbands, boyfriends for girlfriends. The demographic starts dubiously as low as 16, but is basically the 18 to 50 crowd." The iBreath debuted at Christmas and, according to Bassler, the company has sold thousands of the $79.99 devices. Of course, even though we think these seven apps can go a long way in terms of making a hectic life a bit easier, mentioning these particular apps does not necessarily constitute an endorsement of them. Each has many competitors, and you're invited to weigh in with suggestions in our comments section. Many apps have features you will love or hate, and the only way to find out for sure is to try them for yourself.

Apple’s iPhone 8 to Ditch Home Button in Favor of Virtual Capacitive Buttons GO The next-generation iPhone will use virtual buttons Feb 16, 2017 08:19 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Apple is expected to make major design changes to its iPhone 8 or X, the phone that will mark the ten-year anniversary since the first iPhone was launched. A report by KGI Securities analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo reveals that Apple might go so far as to ditch the home button. The analyst believes that the 2017 iPhone will have an OLED 5.8-inch display with 5.15 inches of usable screen space, some of it will be reserved to virtual capacitive buttons, according to the report. This would mean that Apple plans to remove the home button completely, thus reducing the bezel size on the new phone. The Touch ID fingerprint recognition technology embedded in the home button will also be ditched, there are many rumors that say Apple will employ a new technology that places the fingerprint sensor into the display. The iPhone 8 will have the same display size the 5.5-inch iPhone The analyst also says that Apple’s iPhone 8 with OLED display will be similar in measurements as the 4.7-inch iPhone. This will reportedly be possible by eliminating the home button, usually placed on the front panel. The actual display will be similar in size to the 5.5-inch iPhone, but come in a 4.7-inch body. The analyst is confident that Apple will also launch a standard 4.7-inch and a 5.5-inch LED iPhone, but it remains to be seen what features they will hold. Previous report stated that the iPhone 8 will come with a glass body and wireless charging, while the two other iPhones to be launched this year won’t employ major improvements. Aside from the new fingerprint scanning technology, the iPhone 8 might also come with an iris scanner and facial recognition. Apple is also rumored to incorporate a stacked logic board design in the iPhone 8, one that would support a longer battery life and a bigger battery with a size comparable to the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus. Rumors say that the price of the new iPhone 8 might surpass $1,000. #Apple#iPhone 8#OLED display#Touch ID#iPhone 7 Plus subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Edges Out Samsung to Become Top Global Smartphone Vendor in Q4 Apple to Contract Chinese Supplier of Flexible OLED Displays for Upcoming iPhone Apple iPhone 8 to Feature Reinforced Glass Back, Stainless Steel Frame Apple iPhone 8 Could Feature a Fingerprint Sensor Embedded into the Display Apple Edges Out Samsung to Become Top Global Smartphone Vendor in Q4 Microsoft Extends Support for Original Windows 10 Version DebConf18 Will Be Hosted in Hsinchu, Taiwan, as First Debian Conference in Asia Moto G5 and G5 Plus Press Renders and Specs Revealed by Spanish Retailer Apple’s iPhone 8 to Ditch Home Button in Favor of Virtual Capacitive Buttons No New Windows 10 Cumulative Updates Coming This Month After All Apple Edges Out Samsung to Become Top Global Smartphone Vendor in Q4 Microsoft’s February Security Updates to Launch in March    iPhone 8 concept new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Apple Music to Host Planet of the Apps and Carpool Karaoke Spin-Off Shows more on: Apple Music i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

By: Prajith Sabbani Published: Thursday, February 16, 2017, 13:15 [IST] If the latest report from Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, KGI Securities is anything to go by, the next iPhone aka the iPhone 8 will not have a home button. Instead, there will be "virtual buttons" at the bottom of the screen. As you may already know, the Apple iPhone 8 is rumored to come with a near bezel-less display curved on both the sides. To achieve this Apple could get rid of both the home button and Touch ID believes Kuo. He further adds that the iPhone 8 will come with a 5.8-inch OLED display. However, only 5.15-inches of the screen will be usable, and the rest called the "function area" will be reserved for the virtual buttons. SEE ALSO: Apple regains its top position after eight quarters: Gartner As per the Touch ID aka fingerprint scanner, Kuo believes that the next iPhone "will come with other biometric technologies that replace the current fingerprint recognition technology." However, it's not clear what "other technologies" refer to as of now. What's interesting though is that all of this will be included in a 4.7-inch footprint akin to the current iPhone 7. Also, the iPhone 8 is speculated to pack a better battery similar to what the current Plus variants pack. Apple has been recently granted a patent which allows the company to embed a Touch ID-enabled fingerprint scanner right into the display. It seems like Kuo's reports are going to be true, after all. So, how's the "function area" going to look like? Touch Bar? Perhaps!

It may need to address that, and soon. By Alex Webb and Alex Sherman. Added by Agency Staff on 16 February 2017. Saved under In-depth, Top Tags: Apple, Beats, Google, Larry Page, McLaren, McLaren Technology Group, Microsoft, Netflix, Nokia, Sergey Brin, Tim Cook Tweet Apple CEO Tim Cook “We are always looking at acquisitions,” Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts last month. “There’s not a size that we would not do.” It’s a message he’s increasingly stressed over the past year as investors question how the world’s most valuable technology company plans to use its US$246bn (R3,2 trillion) cash pile to meet ambitious sales targets and expand into new markets, such as transportation. But Apple has struggled for years to pull off bigger deals because of a series of quirks: an aversion to risk, reluctance to work with external advisers like investment banks, and inexperience in closing and integrating large takeovers, said people who have worked on acquisitions with the company. They asked not to be identified speaking about private merger and acquisition deliberations. “The first step in M&A is having some conviction about what it is you want to do,” said Eric Risley, managing partner at Architect Partners who has negotiated deals with Apple. “Apple probably more than most feels that they’re very capable of building things” rather than buying them, he added. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. Apple’s biggest deal in its 41-year history was the $3bn purchase Beats Electronics in 2014, followed by the $400m acquisition of NeXT Computer in 1996. In Facebook’s 13 years, it has made three acquisitions of at least $1bn, including its $22bn WhatsApp purchase. Google, founded in 1998, has done four such deals, while Microsoft has completed at least 10. Instead of closing big deals, Cook has so far focused on growing Apple’s services businesses, including Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud. That’s beginning to work, with the company recently forecasting that annual revenue from those operations will top $50bn by 2021. But even here, some analysts and investors argue for a big acquisition, especially in online video streaming. Apple has started distributing videos through the Music service, and pooling other providers’ video in its mobile TV app, but it has no service akin to Netflix or Amazon.com’s Prime Video. On Friday, Sanford C Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said Apple needs at least one big acquisition in online video. To reach its $50bn target, the company must find an extra $13bn in services revenue over the next four years — beyond what it can generate itself. Netflix ended 2016 with sales of less than $9bn, so even buying that business may not be enough, the analyst said. Other potential blockbuster Apple acquisition targets include Walt Disney and electric car maker Tesla, Baird analyst William Power wrote in a recent note to clients. “They’re going to have to pursue something bigger than a Beats-like acquisition,” said Erick Maronak, chief investment officer at Victory Capital Management, which holds Apple stock among its $55bn under management. The US presidency of Donald Trump may spark tax reforms that free up more Apple cash to spend on takeovers. But so far, the company has tiptoed around the edges of some of the biggest transactions reshaping the technology industry. There’s a swagger — you may call it arrogance — about the culture there. They’re used to being able to muscle their way in and get attractive economics. When AT&T agreed to purchase Time Warner for $85bn in October, the telecommunications company was concerned Apple might make a competing bid, people familiar with AT&T’s thinking said at the time. Apple had held tentative talks about a year earlier, but when the AT&T deal emerged, a person familiar with the technology giant’s thinking said it wouldn’t be able to pull together a competing proposal quickly enough. Last year, the company considered buying luxury car maker McLaren Technology Group, people familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg at the time. Apple also had takeover talks with chip designer Imagination Technologies Group, but said last year it wouldn’t make an offer. Apple’s deals team is composed of about a dozen people under former Goldman Sachs banker Adrian Perica, and most acquisitions take place at the behest of the company’s engineers. Product managers usually meet every month with Perica’s team members to identify targets with attractive technology or talented engineers, according to a person familiar with the process. Microsoft’s deals team is not significantly bigger, and it still hired investment bank Morgan Stanley for its $26bn acquisition of LinkedIn last year, beating rival bidders including Salesforce.com and Facebook. At Google, the corporate development team is led by Don Harrison and sometimes works on potential acquisitions with strategy experts working under chief business officer Philipp Schindler, not just technical staff. Other deals are carried out at the behest of founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Apple often refuses to work with investment bankers appointed by the seller, preferring to deal directly with company management, according to people who have been involved in such negotiations. Apple also dictates terms and tells targets to take it or leave it, betting that the promise of product development support later and the chance of appearing in future iPhones are alluring enough, the people said. The FBI wants in… That was the case when Apple acquired Metaio in 2015. Bankers appointed by the augmented-reality firm to negotiate weren’t allowed in the room, and while Metaio executives felt the offer was low, Apple’s vision for the technology convinced them to sell, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Apple’s current M&A strategy works well for acquiring start-ups developing new technology that can be added to existing Apple products. It bought 15 to 20 companies per year over the last four years. But buying larger companies presents a different challenge, particularly if there are rival bids. Bankers often diffuse tension between bidders and targets, but Apple’s approach can make that process difficult. “There’s a swagger — you may call it arrogance — about the culture there,” said Risley of Architect Partners. “They’re used to being able to muscle their way in and get attractive economics.” For Apple’s acquisition of Beats, neither party used an investment bank. Apple struggled to integrate the team, and when the initial Apple Music offering emerged from the combination, it got lukewarm reviews. Later versions of the service improved. However, Apple’s lack of a successful track record integrating big acquisitions puts off sellers, according to a person who has negotiated with Apple’s deals team. There are certain opportunities that they should probably be pursuing and if they wait too long they risk ceding ground to the first movers Large acquisitions can also go wrong in big ways. After buying Nokia’s handset business for $9,5bn, Microsoft had to write down $7,6bn of that value in 2015. Failures like that helped forge Apple’s caution on larger deals, according to one of the people familiar with its thinking. That attitude may need to change, according to some investors. After the AT&T-Time Warner deal, analysts’ focus shifted to Netflix as the next target, even as the video streaming service says it’s not up for sale. However, that company’s shares are up about 60% in the past year, giving it a market value of more than $60bn — 20 times the cost of Apple’s biggest deal. “There are certain opportunities that they should probably be pursuing and if they wait too long they risk ceding ground to the first movers,” Victory Capital’s Maronak said.  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 26‘Please call me’ man hits back at Vodacom 10Big four banks’ dominance must end: Zuma 8Set-top box dispute goes to arbitration 7This is how we’re going to fix ICT 7Liquid Telecom’s big plans for Neotel Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

Apple Edges Out Samsung to Become Top Global Smartphone Vendor in Q4 GO But Samsung sold more smartphones in the whole 2016 year Feb 16, 2017 07:39 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Research and advisory firm, Gartner has just released a report on smartphone sales and mobile OS market share for Q4 2016. The report shows a major shift in the market, Apple has become the top global smartphone vendor after 8 years. The last time when Apple held this position was in Q4 2014, when its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus managed to generate massive sales for the company. It seems that the latest iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were the flagships that drove Apple’s market share up to 17.9%, compared to Samsung’s 17.8% in Q4 last year. Apple sold the most smartphones in Q4/2016 Apple’s phones saw high demand in most mature markets like Korea, North America and Western Europe, where sales of Samsung devices were greatly affected by the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco. Apple managed to sell by just 256,000 units more than Samsung and it would be interesting to see if the Cupertino company will hold its leading position in this year’s last quarter after both companies will have launched new flagships. Android OS still holds more than 80% of the market 432 million smartphones were sold globally in Q4 2016, by 7% more compared to the same quarter of 2015. For the whole year of 2016, 1.5 billion phones were sold to end users, up 5% compared to the previous year. Samsung still sold more phones during the whole 2016 year, compared to Apple, but the company has started to face some difficulties. Samsung still sold the most phones during 2016 overall Samsung sales started to drop in the third quarter and continued their decline to an 8% rate in the fourth, while its market share dropped by 2.9% year-on-year. In the premium segment, Samsung was greatly affected by the discontinuation of its Galaxy Note 7 flagship, while mid-range and entry-level Samsung phones saw fierce competition from Huawei, Oppo and BlackBerry, which holds the fifth position globally. Android continues to be the top mobile OS When it comes to mobile operating systems, Google’s Android held 82% of the market in Q4 2016, while its share grew by 3.2% to 84.8% during last year. It was the only mobile OS to grow its market share year-on-year. Apple’s iOS is second on the market with 17.9% in the last quarter of 2016, Windows is third with 0.3%, while BlackBerry’s OS dropped 0.2% to 0.0% of the market in Q4 2016.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (4 Images) #Apple#Samsung#Huawei#Android#iOS subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Garner's smartphone sales report (4 Images) 01 02 03 04 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Reportedly Paid Samsung $4.3 Billion for More iPhone OLED Displays Apple Dominated the Smartphone Market in the US and GB in 2016 Apple Sees Its First Annual Shipment Drop in China Apple Wants to Sell Used iPhones in India Despite Building New Phones Locally Apple Edges Out Samsung to Become Top Global Smartphone Vendor in Q4 Microsoft Extends Support for Original Windows 10 Version DebConf18 Will Be Hosted in Hsinchu, Taiwan, as First Debian Conference in Asia Moto G5 and G5 Plus Press Renders and Specs Revealed by Spanish Retailer Apple’s iPhone 8 to Ditch Home Button in Favor of Virtual Capacitive Buttons No New Windows 10 Cumulative Updates Coming This Month After All Apple Edges Out Samsung to Become Top Global Smartphone Vendor in Q4 Microsoft’s February Security Updates to Launch in March 4 photos    Apple iPhone 7 Plus New Mac Apps Dripcap: Packet analyzer tool that offers you the option to capture and analyze your network traffic or simply open and review the content of PCAP files Big Business: Provides a complete and multi-platform solution for managing various details related to your business, customers, inventory and more Refly Editor: Word editor designed for content creators that integrates search engine optimization tools and can help you publish posts on multiple accounts Flock: A small and straightforward cross-platform application that enables you to chat with your team mates or co-workers via a stylish GUI Swift: Open Source programming language developed and maintained by Apple that aims to provide a cleaner syntax that is easier write and read Head Basketball: Man to man basketball game that features intuitive controls and allows you to play against your friends on the same machine, or in multiplayer mode Gpass: Password management solution that includes support for storing various types of records and syncs the data to all devices by using the associated cloud service Reader comments Apple Music to Host Planet of the Apps and Carpool Karaoke Spin-Off Shows more on: Apple Music i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

A survey by investment bank Baird found that US consumers want Apple to focus its resources on making a car, while a Baird analyst says acquiring electric-car maker Tesla (TSLA) is another, albeit unlikely, option, Investors.com reports. Baird asked 3,000 US respondents in an online poll what they would like to see Apple develop over the next five years. The largest percentage (21.6%) said they want Apple to make a car. Apple has been rumored for several years to be working on a car or technologies for self-driving vehicles. Coming in a close second in the poll (19.5%) was for Apple to develop a Netflix-like streaming video service, with a Baird analyst again suggesting that an acquisition of Netflix also remains an option. The third-largest group (16.1%) want Apple to make a virtual reality headset, followed closely (16%) by a more advanced health care wearable. Further down the list were a smart home device like the Amazon Echo (11.7%) and a live internet video cable TV replacement (9.9%).

Rumoured to feature a curved screen December 20th 2016 2 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ Expert claims there will be three different models of iPhone and they will all come with the cool new charging technology. Jasper Hamill and Guy BirchallThe Sun APPLE’S iPhone 8 is definitely set to feature wireless charging, a top analyst has claimed. Ming-Chi Kuo has said the upcoming iPhone will come in three different forms, but every one of them will let users charge their phone without having to plug it in. In a briefing note obtained by Mac Rumours, he said the phones would use a sheet of graphite to stop them overheating while charging wirelessly. He wrote: “While we don’t expect general users to notice any difference, lamination of an additional graphite sheet is needed for better thermal control and, thus, steady operation.” It has also been rumoured that the smartphone will feature an edge to edge display in the top of the range model alongside two standard versions. Foxconn Technology in Taiwan is making wireless modules to go with their next model according to Nikkei.com. An industry source told the Asian publication: “Whether the feature can eventually make it into Apple’s updated devices will depend on whether Foxconn can boost the yield rate to a satisfactory level later on.” It is currently not obvious whether the California firm would offer a wireless charging plate, similar to Samsung’s offering or something different. But one of the patents filed by Apple in the US shows images of a charger similar to that used by the Apple Watch. The patent itself is mainly focused on a metal brushing technique but also refers to and “inductive charging station”. This patent appears to show a wireless charging plate, which will charge the phone up when it’s placed on top.Source:Supplied According to Mac Rumours: “In describing how the tools would work, the application includes multiple illustrations of a charging station used to provide electrical current to another device via inductive power transmission. “An inductive transmitter coil wraps around a metal core and is designed to pair with a receiver coil and charge the battery in the electronic device.” It was also revealed last year that Apple had a patent for a foldable version of the iconic handset. Sketches in the patent application show a iPhone with a fold down the middle of the screen, with carbon nanotubes giving strength to the structure. In the patent application, Apple says the housing for the phone could be aluminium, glass, ceramic or even plastic for the bendable screen. Apple is granted about 2000 patents a year, and just because it patents something it does not mean that it will result in a product. But chief design officer Jony Ive gave an insight into the time involved in going from an idea to implementation last week in an interview about the new MacBook Pro Touch Bar, saying the design of the Touch Bar came after two years of trying a range of designs. Apple is expected to majorly revamp the iPhone design next year although if it does develop a fordable iPhone that is likely to be something several years down the track.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 16 February 2017 | MYT 1:19 PM Apple struggles to make big deals, hampering strategy shifts by alex webbandalex sherman Unique challenges: Apple has struggled for years to pull off bigger deals because of a series of quirks: an aversion to risk, reluctance to work with external advisers like investment banks and inexperience in closing and integrating large takeovers, said people who have worked on acquisitions with the company. — Reuters “We are always looking at acquisitions,” Apple Inc chief executive officer Tim Cook told analysts last month. “There’s not a size that we would not do.”  It’s a message he’s increasingly stressed over the past year as investors question how the world’s most valuable technology company plans to use its US$246bil (RM1.09tril) cash pile to meet ambitions sales targets and expand into new markets, such as transportation.  But Apple has struggled for years to pull off bigger deals because of a series of quirks: an aversion to risk, reluctance to work with external advisers like investment banks and inexperience in closing and integrating large takeovers, said people who have worked on acquisitions with the company. They asked not to be identified speaking about private merger and acquisition deliberations.  “The first step in M&A is having some conviction about what it is you want to do,” said Eric Risley, managing partner at Architect Partners LLC who has negotiated deals with Apple. “Apple probably more than most feels that they’re very capable of building things” rather than buying them, he added. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.  Apple’s biggest deal in its 41-year history was the US$3bil (RM13.37bil) purchase Beats Electronics in 2014, followed by the US$400mil (RM1.78bil) acquisition of NeXT Computer in 1996. In Facebook Inc’s 13 years, it has made three acquisitions of at least US$1bil (RM4.44bil), including its US$22bil (RM98.05bil) WhatsApp purchase. Google, founded in 1998, has done four such deals, while Microsoft Corp has completed at least 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Instead of closing big deals, Cook has so far focused on growing Apple’s services businesses, including Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud. That’s beginning to work, with the company recently forecasting that annual revenue from those operations will top US$50bil (RM222.85bil) by 2021.  But even here, some analysts and investors argue for a big acquisition, especially in online video streaming. Apple has started distributing videos through the Music service, and pooling other providers’ video in its mobile TV app, but it has no service akin to Netflix or Amazon.com Inc’s Prime Video.  On Friday, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said Apple needs at least one big acquisition in online video. To reach its US$50bil (RM222.85bil) target, the company must find an extra US$13bil (RM57.94bil) in services revenue over the next four years – beyond what it can generate itself. Netflix Inc ended 2016 with sales of less than US$9bil (RM40.11bil), so even buying that business may not be enough, the analyst said.  Other potential blockbuster Apple acquisition targets include Walt Disney Co and electric carmaker Tesla Inc, Baird analyst William Power wrote in a recent note to clients.  “They’re going to have to pursue something bigger than a Beats-like acquisition,” said Erick Maronak, chief investment officer at Victory Capital Management, which holds Apple stock among its US$55bil (RM245.13bil) under management.  The presidency of Donald Trump may spark tax reforms that free up more Apple cash to spend on takeovers. But so far, the company has tip-toed around the edges of some of the biggest transactions re-shaping the technology industry.   When AT&T Inc agreed to purchase Time Warner Inc for US$85bil (RM378.84bil) in October, the telecom company was concerned Apple might make a competing bid, people familiar with AT&T’s thinking said at the time. Apple had held tentative talks about a year earlier, but when the AT&T deal emerged, a person familiar with the technology giant’s thinking said it wouldn’t be able to pull together a competing proposal quickly enough.  Last year, the company considered buying luxury carmaker McLaren Technology Group Ltd, people familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg at the time. Apple also had takeover talks with chip designer Imagination Technologies Group Plc, but said last year it wouldn’t make an offer.  Apple’s deals team is composed of about a dozen people under former Goldman Sachs banker Adrian Perica, and most acquisitions take place at the behest of the company’s engineers. Product managers usually meet every month with Perica’s team members to identify targets with attractive technology or talented engineers, according to a person familiar with the process.  Microsoft’s deals team is not significantly bigger, and it still hired investment bank Morgan Stanley for its US$26bil (RM115.88bil) acquisition of LinkedIn last year, beating rival bidders including Salesforce.com Inc and Facebook.  At Google, the corporate development team is led by Don Harrison and sometimes works on potential acquisitions with strategy experts working under chief business officer Philipp Schindler, not just technical staff. Other deals are carried out at the behest of founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.  Apple often refuses to work with investment bankers appointed by the seller, preferring to deal directly with company management, according to people who have been involved in such negotiations. Apple also dictates terms and tells targets to take it or leave it, betting that the promise of product development support later and the chance of appearing in future iPhones are alluring enough, the people said.  That was the case when Apple acquired Metaio GmbH in 2015. Bankers appointed by the augmented-reality firm to negotiate weren’t allowed in the room, and while Metaio executives felt the offer was low, Apple’s vision for the technology convinced them to sell, according to a person familiar with the discussions.  Apple’s current M&A strategy works well for acquiring startups developing new technology that can be added to existing Apple products. It bought 15 to 20 companies per year over the last four years. But buying larger companies presents a different challenge, particularly if there are rival bids. Bankers often diffuse tension between bidders and targets, but Apple’s approach can make that process difficult.  “There’s a swagger – you may call it arrogance – about the culture there,” said Risley of Architect Partners. “They’re used to being able to muscle their way in and get attractive economics.”  For Apple’s acquisition of Beats, neither party used an investment bank. Apple struggled to integrate the team, and when the initial Apple Music offering emerged from the combination, it got lukewarm reviews. Later versions of the service improved. However, Apple’s lack of a successful track record integrating big acquisitions puts off sellers, according to a person who has negotiated with Apple’s deals team.  Large acquisitions can also go wrong in big ways. After buying Nokia Oyj’s handset business for US$9.5bil (RM42.34bil), Microsoft had to write down US$7.6bil (RM33.87bil) of that value in 2015. Failures like that helped forge Apple’s caution on larger deals, according to one of the people familiar with its thinking.  That attitude may need to change, according to some investors. After the AT&T-Time Warner deal, analysts’ focus shifted to Netflix as the next target, even as the video streaming service says it’s not up for sale. However, that company’s shares are up about 60% in the past year, giving it a market value of more than US$60bil (RM267.42bil) – 20 times the cost of Apple’s biggest deal.  ”There are certain opportunities that they should probably be pursuing and if they wait too long they risk ceding ground to the first movers,” Victory Capital’s Maronak said. — Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: M&A , Foreign News , Corporate News , Analyst Reports , Technology Related Stories You May Be Interested Brazil judge rules Uber drivers are employees, deserve benefits Clash of Clans maker profit up despite Pokemon challenge Stand up to cancer Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra ‘Zelda: Breath of the Wild’ introduces series-first Season Pass Gartner: Spend your limited IT budget wisely Others Also Read No soft-pedalling from Team NZ in radical yacht design South Korea's military on high level of readiness after news of Kim Jong Nam's death Najib: New KL ATCC will enable improved air traffic control facilities advertisement Latest News DBS profit slumps to two-year low on oil and gas bad debts Maybank Indonesia posts record earnings in FY16 Ukraine says Russian state hackers using new viruses for attacks Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Pokémon Go: The universe expands Most Viewed in Tech Pokémon Go: The universe expands Nokia 3310 on the comeback trail: report Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra Stand up to cancer Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Huawei said to plan its own voice assistant for smartphones Lenovo’s profit misses estimates after PC rivals erode lead Smartphone maker Huawei catching up on Samsung, Apple: study China’s Huawei, Philippine telco join forces in 5G deal Yahoo notifies users of sophisticated breach methods Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Kuo also believes the iPhone 8 will use a 5.8-inch OLED display of which 5.15 inches will be used for screen content while the rest is being reserved for a “function area” at the bottom that will house virtual buttons. Kuo also added that Apple is working on an alternative for Touch ID with new biometric technologies. A separate report yesterday said that Apple will ditch the home button and the fingerprint reader will be built into iPhone display. iPhone debuted in 2007 with the iconic home button which was simply used to get back to the home screen in iOS. However in 2013, Apple unveiled Touch ID fingerprint sensor that was used to unlock the device and authenticate mobile payments via Apple Pay. As per previous reports, the next generation iPhones will sport edge-to-edge to display with narrow bezels thereby offering more screen space. The new iPhones are expected to feature iris scanner, wireless charging and come with other major changes as it is Apple’s 10th Anniversary Via Author: Sneha Bokil Sneha Bokil is a tech enthusiast and is currently using Nexus 5X but she still treasures her Nokia N70 (M).

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

By: Tech Desk | Updated: February 16, 2017 11:19 am The patent uses LuxVue technology, a company Apple acquired in 2014. The next-generation of iPhone could have no home button and a screen that scans the fingerprints, a newly published patent has revealed. A newly granted patent, first discovered by Apple Insider, reveals Apple is working on a new technique to embed a fingerprint scanner beneath the screen of the iPhone. The patent uses LuxVue technology, a company Apple acquired in 2014. The patent details how the smartphone could use infrared emitters and sensors placed alongside the RGB LEDs to scan and detect the position of the finger on the screen. Such light emitters can be integrated inside the touch display, reducing the overall dimensions of the device. However, there is no guarantee whether Apple will develop the technology and if it will introduce it in the next iPhone. Watch all our videos from Express Technology Apple’s  iPhones have continued to have large symmetrical bezels at the bottom and top of the screens, with a fingerprint scanner integrated into the home button. Due to the large bezels, the current-generation iPhones look relatively large compared to the likes of the Galaxy S7 edge and LG G5. Also read: Apple patent hints a foldable, bendable iPhone: Report At present, the technology for fingerprint requires users to touch the ring to proceed. The timing of the patent, however, shouldn’t be seen as a mere coincidence. There have been reports in the past which claim Apple would remove the home button from next iPhone. The iPhone 8 or “iPhone X” will mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. The smartphone is said to come with major design changes, tiny bezels, and even a curved OLED display. The latest research note from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claims the upcoming iPhone 8 will have a 5-inch display that fits into a body with roughly the dimensions of the 4.7-inch iPhone 7. If Apple is planning to redesign the iPhone, then this new technology will help the company to deliver the best experience on a mobile device. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: Apple iPhone 8 Election 2017 Live updates: PM Modi to address rallies at Hardoi, Barabanki today Uttar Pradesh elections: For Aparna Yadav, Netaji and Congress come together Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections 2017: Campaign and contrast Best of Express Tamil Nadu crisis LIVE updates: Palanisami gets invite to form govt, Panneerselvam camp to move EC EntertainmentPhillauri song Dum Dum: Anushka Sharma, Diljit Dosanjh song celebrates innocent love, watch video EntertainmentKareena, Saif's son Taimur rings in Randhir's 70th birthday.

Thank you Reply Bryan January 13, 2009 at 7:58 pm This is exactly the type of list you'd expect from someone who "switched to the Mac a couple years ago." There are a few good choices (joyoftech, osxhints, macrumors), but the rest (like TUAW) exist mainly to hawk accessories and bland, uninformative analysis. That Daring Fireball didn't make this list is criminal. Anyone who's serious about Macs or Apple reads Daring Fireball. In fact, just scratch this entire list and replace it with John Gruber's Linked List. Seriously, once you start reading all the high-class content that he covers, TUAW pieces seem like amateurish drivel.

I've overlooked a rule in BrokenStones about mentioning their site on a public space and also regarding invitation protocol. As a result, my invites have been revoked and they have requested that I remove BS from this list of websites. The problem is, even if the mention of BS is removed, the cat is already out of the bag. And because this is an error on my part, I will respectfully accept any action taken unto my BS account. The hardest part is disappointing the MUO readers here expecting an invite. My most sincere apologies. Reply Jash Sayani January 13, 2009 at 10:23 am Thats ok! BTW, I dont understand why everyone is after a Broken stones invite... What does the community offer??

Your site, brokenstones, and several others on the list are absolutely definitely not on the top 20 Mac sites "every fan must bookmark."

Reply Bobby January 12, 2009 at 12:16 am I would really enjoy an invite to the brokenstones website. Why? No reason, really... I'm just your average, normal, everyday Mac user. I'm not the greatest, but I'm not the least, either! Do I really deserve it? I don't know - that's for you to decide! If it were up to me, I'd certainly give myself an invite to brokenstones.me. But, if it were up to me, I also wouldn't be typing here, right now. I'd have already invited myself and be on to some other thing, having taken care of said invite. But, then, I wouldn't be here, typing away with the rest of the fine people here, so I'm glad in at least one way, that it's up to you, and not up to me. If I do wind up with an invite, I will indeed use it to advance to good, and not evil - or something like that... OK, well, I best go, so you can go decide who's worthy of such an invite. May you have a lovely day. Thank You. Reply Jackson Chung January 12, 2009 at 12:24 am You forgot to leave your email address, Bobby.

I would like an invite to brokenstones. Unfortunately I don't have an account on any of the other sites linked from the invite site. So here is why you should give me the invite: I've only just switched to a Mac (purchased an iMac), so I'm wanting to explore all that's on offer :-) Also, if you're interested in British TV, I can swap an invite to thebox.bz.

Reply Jackson January 12, 2009 at 8:43 am Sorry. I didn't actually get into the details of explaining it because it's kind of a gray area.

The update makes Ticketmaster one of the few apps to take advantage of the Apple Music API. Once the update is downloaded, users can allow the app to scan their Apple Music library for their favorite artists. Users will then receive ticket alerts when those artists announce new concerts. If users enable notifications and location services, the app can also notify a user when and where they can watch an artist perform. Apple introduced the Apple Music API with iOS 9.3, and soon began promoting the API in April 2016. Two of the most well known apps to take advantage of the API are Nike and Shazam. Nike's Run Club app allows users to import Apple Music playlists while Shazam allows users to add identified songs to their library. Unlike Nike and Shazam's apps, which is focused on directly impacting someone's music library, the primary goal of Ticketmaster's utilization is to use Apple Music user data to improve its app experience.

Now, a new report seems to put more credence to the earlier rumours that the iPhone 8 will indeed have a facial recognition feature. According to JP Morgan, Apple could be using a LIDAR sensor for the iPhone 8’s facial recognition feature. In addition to this, the same sensor can be used not only for facial recognition but also for augmented reality. What is LIDAR? LIDAR is an acronym for Light Detection and Ranging. Basically, LIDAR is the optical version to the well known navigation tool, the RADAR. Instead of using radio signals, LIDAR uses laser light to detect obstacles along its radiation path. At the moment, LIDAR is mainly used in mapping and laser guidance. However, new advancements in technology made it possible to make use of LIDAR in a number of different applications. iPhone 8 and LIDAR Current LIDAR sensors are extremely bulky as they are used on more rugged applications like satellites and laser guided missiles. However, advancement in miniaturization has made it possible to produce sensors that are small enough for mobile applications. Example of a LIDAR sensor (via sparkfun.com) Back in 2013, Apple acquired PrimeSense, an Israeli company that specializes in 3D sensing. It would seem that the same company will be one spearheading the facial recognition and AR features of the iPhone 8. Apart from facial recognition and AR, the iPhone 8 is also rumored to finally sport an OLED display. In fact, there are reports that the Cupertino tech giant has already placed an order for around 150 million OLED panel from Samsung Display. Additionally, Apple is looking into sourcing OLED panels from China as it sees the requirements for the iPhone 8 will be quite substantial. Right now, these reports are mere speculations of what the iPhone 8 features would be. There is no solid evidence that Apple would apply this technology on its next flagship phone. Nevertheless,  these acquisitions are not done on a whim. Instead, they are a product of careful planning and strategizing. Whether or not Apple chose to use 3D facial recognition or AR on the iPhone 8, it is still too soon to tell. For more updates in the iPhone 8, be sure to check us out on TheBitbag.

Banks accept this in most countries. But not in Australia and, by extension, New Zealand.1 Wrangling over the issue slowed Apple Pay's progress in both countries. Three of Australia's four big banks asked that country's regulator for permission to negotiate with Apple as a group.2 The fourth bank, ANZ, has its own agreement with Apple. On Monday Westpac, Commonwealth Bank and National Australia Bank took fees off the table. In return they want Apple to open up the NFC chip in iPhone. That will allow them to run their digital wallets in direct competition to Apple Pay. The dispute is almost academic. Digital wallet take-up rates are miniscule. For now digital wallets are a rounding error in transaction statistics. Yet everyone involved thinks they will soon be huge. The Australian reports ANZ completed 10 million Apple Pay transactions since launching nine months ago. This compares to seven billion credit and debit card transactions in a year. Banks and phone makers expect digital wallets to take off when they add other features. Driver's licences, loyalty cards and membership schemes are at the front of the list. So are public transport cards. Both Apple and the Australian banks hope people will one day no longer carry conventional wallets. Both want the game to play out their way. The key to understanding the dispute is that both sides are big, powerful semi-monopolies. Both want control and both want to clip the ticket on every transaction. It can mean rivers of gold. The Australian banks argue that opening up the iPhone NFC chip will allow innovation to flourish. Apple argues customers will get a better digital wallet experience if it retains control. Among other things it means customers can run cards issued by different banks from a single app. Banks elsewhere might be as uneasy with Apple Pay, but few banking markets are as tight-held as Australia and New Zealand. This gives the local big banks a clout that, say, US banks don't have. Customers want them all to get on with it. A handful of geeks have swapped to ANZ to use Apple Pay. If that trickle was a flood, the other banks would soon change their tune. That's because Australia's dominant big four banks are also New Zealand's largest banks. Good question. I'm glad you asked. In normal times it is illegal for competitors to collude with each other. Regulators fear this can lead to bad things for customers.

Over the year as a whole, the Chinese maker saw its sales leap by 26.7 per cent, while the South Korean and US rivals both saw their sales decline by 4.3 per cent, Gartner said in a study. As result, Huawei was able to increase its share of the smartphone sector to 8.9 per cent in 2016 from 7.3 per cent a year earlier, while Samsung saw its market share shrink by two full percentage points to 20.5 per cent and Apple’s contracted to 14.4 per cent from 15.9 per cent. “Chinese makers succeeded in winning market share over last year and Huawei now seems to be the main rival to the two giants, even if the gap remains large,” Annette Zimmermann, a Gartner analyst,  told AFP. Among the other Chinese smartphone makers are OPPO, BBK Communication Equipment (with its One Plus and Vivo brands), ZTE, Xiaomi and Lenovo. “We’re seeing a very real progression compared with earlier years, when the number three maker and the others had struggled to hold on to a market share of more than four per cent,” Zimmermann said. “Huawei looks likely to strengthen its position again this year,” she added. In the fourth quarter of 2016 alone, the launch of the iPhone 7 and Samsung’s difficulties with its Note 7 model enabled Apple to take top slot in the market with a share of 17.9 per cent or 77 million units sold. Samsung sold 76.8 million smartphones in the October to December period, giving it a market share of 17.8 per cent, while Huawei sold 40.8 million phones or a market share of 9.5 per cent. “Preliminary data for the current quarter suggest that Samsung will overtake Apple again. But it’s remarkable that Apple can hold on to that sort of share of the market with a closed eco-system,” the analyst said. With regard to the different operating systems, Android, which is used by the large majority of smartphone makers, commands a market share of 81.7 per cent, while Apple’s iOS operating system of its iPhones and iPads accounts for 17.9 per cent of the market.

Twitter Apple smartphones outsold Samsung's in Q4 Apple outsold Samsung by the narrowest of margins in Q4, but both are pursued by a pack of determined Chinese manufacturers Peter Sayer (IDG News Service) 16 February, 2017 10:36 - - - - print email Comments Apple has overtaken Samsung Electronics in smartphone sales for the first time in two years -- but don't count on it staying ahead for long. Samsung sold 76.8 million smartphones in the fourth quarter, giving it a market share of 17.8 percent, but it was just beaten by Apple, which sold 77 million iPhones for a 17.9 percent share, according to figures from Gartner. The fourth quarter is usually a strong one for Apple, boosted by holiday sales of the new generation of iPhones it releases each September, said Anshul Gupta, a research director at Gartner. For Samsung, though, 2016 ended particularly badly, dominated by the fiasco around the recall of its incendiary Galaxy Note7. Super-phones like the Note7 could have accounted for 10 to 15 percent of Samsung's smartphone sales in the period before its recall, said Gupta, but Samsung lost more than that: There was also the damage to its brand. It could bounce back sooner rather than later, though, as it has a new flagship phone coming out at the end of March. Apple, meanwhile, is expected to wait until September before unveiling new iPhones. This year will mark the iPhone's 10th anniversary, and the next model is widely expected to be something special, so Apple fans may delay replacing phones until then, said Gupta. That would leave the way clear for Samsung to move back into the lead from this quarter. That pattern showed up last year too: Although it dominated the fourth quarter, Apple was a distant second over the full year, with market share of just 14.4 percent over the year, far behind Samsung's 20.5 percent, and the situation was similar the previous year. While the giants slug it out, a more interesting battle is going on just beneath them, as the next three companies in the fourth-quarter smartphone rankings are all Chinese. Huawei Technologies is in third place with a worldwide smartphone market share of 9.5 percent, with fourth and fifth taken by Oppo (6.2 percent) and BBK Communication Equipment (5.6 percent), two companies that many consider to be part of the same conglomerate. Gartner treats them separately because, whatever their shareholding structure, they operate independently, each with their own product team, Gupta said. BBK, almost unknown in the West, is now the number one smartphone brand in China, he said. A year ago, though, that honor went to Oppo, and the year before that, Huawei. Previous years saw the Chinese market topped by Xiaomi and Samsung. These Chinese companies have pushed Apple and Samsung aside in their home market, and are expanding across South Asia. "Even in their current expansion, Oppo is not focusing just on emerging markets, but also on developed markets like Australia," said Gupta, so we may soon see them climbing up the rankings in Europe and the U.S too. The key ingredients for that are already in their products, he said. "Oppo and BBK make great phones in terms of feature set. They have integrated high-end features like dual cameras and fast charge." Join the TechWorld newsletter! Join Error: Please check your email address.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 16 February 2017 | MYT 10:30 AM One bot to rule them all? Not likely, with Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft virtual assistants by ethan baron No dominant player yet: Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft are all jostling for the biggest piece of the virtual assistant pie. — Bay Area News Group/TNS It's no wonder titans of tech are locked in an epic battle of the bots, racing furiously to produce the best virtual assistant.  Their respective help-bots – Apple's Siri, Google's Assistant, Amazon's Alexa and Microsoft's Cortana – promise consumers one of the most valuable commodities in the world: free time.  Thanks to the sudden acceleration of artificial intelligence and advancements in speech recognition and big-data storage, the technology behind virtual assistants is rapidly spreading from phones to cars and homes, and the truly useful helper is approaching fast. The four giants are fighting for the biggest share of a market expected to grow to US$12bil (RM53.38bil) by 2024.  "There's a tremendous amount of promise for these agents to help and assist with many different tasks that we face every day," said Ross Rubin, principal analyst at Reticle Research. "The more the agent can help you with, the more value it holds."  The ultimate goal is our own personal genie in a bottle that awakens with a word or touch to liberate us from all our mundane tasks, organize our days and nights, and free us from the stress of lives that have become so terribly busy. But that's not going to happen quite yet.  Today, the aid these virtual assistants provide remains limited. Most users of Google Home and Amazon Echo devices – which host Assistant and Alexa, respectively – stream music, play audio books, and control smart-home devices, according to surveys by San Francisco analytics firm VoiceLabs.  Still, the virtual agent's foundation in AI means the more it learns about a user's preferences and behaviours, the better job it can do. So while experts predict a handful of firms will dominate in this field – most agree Apple, Google and Amazon will be major players, with Microsoft in a lesser role – they're split on whether consumers will be served best by one bot, or more.  "People want one assistant, they don't want two," said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research in San Jose. "You want one assistant, to be very readily available wherever you are."  However, the various assistants will likely end up somewhat specialized in their expertise, with Google's Assistant, for example, excelling in providing knowledge and managing schedules, and Microsoft's Cortana leading on gaming, said VoiceLabs CEO Adam Marchick. In a few years, many people will use two or three different assistants, Marchick predicted.  The industry stands at a critical moment, because the first highly effective help-bot to get a foothold in a consumer's home, phone or car will likely stay, creating a barrier to competitors, Marchick said.  In order for a virtual helpmate to run your life, it needs to engage with the providers of all the services you rely on, from your calendar app to your Uber ride. Those providers must either partner with the company operating the assistant, or design their app to integrate with the assistant. So Spotify will stream music upon request via Alexa, and Honeywell's smart-home thermostat, via Assistant, will bump up the temperature 15 minutes before Grandma's expected arrival.  For providers, "if there is a competitive advantage to be gained, then absolutely they will do it," said Brett Sappington, senior director of research at market research firm Parks Associates.  For all the major players, virtual assistants provide important data that fuels the AI that powers and improves them, making both the assistants and the products they live in ever more marketable. For Amazon, Alexa is an enthusiastic purchasing agent for the e-commerce that drives the firm. For Google, Assistant is a turbocharged vacuum for the data the company collects to sell ads targeted directly at users.  Underlying the projected expansion of virtual assistants is the "voice first" approach to personal technology, said Brian Roemmele, a Los Angeles tech entrepreneur and expert in voice computing. Voice operation keeps hands free and it's faster, he noted, because speaking conveys information more quickly than typing.  So far, both Google and Amazon have focused largely on home-based assistants. Google's new Pixel phones host Assistant, but it has an uphill battle because Apple has far more phones equipped with Siri on the market, said Tim Bajarin, an analyst with San Jose market research firm Creative Strategies.  The popularity of Amazon's Echo and Alexa notwithstanding – the company has sold more than 8 million Echo devices since rolling them out in late 2014, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners – most people want their virtual assistant on their phones, Bajarin said.  "When you're driving, that's critical, or if your hands are busy," Bajarin said. "The phone will continue to dominate as the vehicle for delivering the virtual assistant."  Putting these robo-helpers into cars' onboard systems has become a priority for major firms, including Microsoft, which seeks to extend the reach of its PC-based Cortana through the "connected-vehicle" platform it announced this year.  In January, Nissan announced it would integrate Microsoft's platform into its cars. Siri already can be used in a car via a phone or Apple's CarPlay system, or in cars sold with Siri integration built in. Hyundai is bringing Alexa and Google's Assistant into some of its cars so, for example, an owner could start their car from their living room.  While building the supreme help-bot is clearly a priority for many major tech firms, experts say the software today lacks the knowledge base to take the next big leap: to enable virtual assistants that can predict our needs to serve us better.  "Some of it is just raw amounts of data and understanding about how the world works and what humans expect," Reticle's Rubin said.  Which companies rise to dominance depends both on the capability of their bots and the draw of the gadgets that house them.  "The story has not been written on what success is going to be in this space," Sappington said. — The Mercury News/Tribune News Service Related Stories You May Be Interested Apple struggles to make big deals, hampering strategy shifts Clash of Clans maker profit up despite Pokemon challenge Stand up to cancer Apple hunts for the app stars of the future with new show Spotify expands with World Trade Centre move Yahoo notifies users of sophisticated breach methods Others Also Read Embassy tight-lipped on death of Jong-nam Only hard work can save Foxes from drop, says Pearson advertisement Latest News Ukraine says Russian state hackers using new viruses for attacks Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Pokémon Go: The universe expands Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra Huawei said to plan its own voice assistant for smartphones Most Viewed in Tech Pokémon Go: The universe expands Nokia 3310 on the comeback trail: report Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra Stand up to cancer Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Huawei said to plan its own voice assistant for smartphones Lenovo’s profit misses estimates after PC rivals erode lead Smartphone maker Huawei catching up on Samsung, Apple: study Apple struggles to make big deals, hampering strategy shifts China’s Huawei, Philippine telco join forces in 5G deal Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

The update pushes the app 1.10.2 and makes it significantly easier to quickly know when an artist you love is touring. Once you’ve downloaded the latest version of Ticketmaster from the App Store, you’ll be prompted to give the app access to your Apple Music library. If you choose to do so, Ticketmaster will scan your library for artists: Be the first to know about upcoming events: Import your favorites and your music library and we’ll find events for you. Ticketmaster explains that once you give the app access, you can receive push notifications about when your favorite artists tour. If you choose to go a step farther and give Ticketmaster access to location services, you’ll get more details such as where your favorite artists will be stopping on their tour, as well. The full change log for the update is below: Integration with Apple Music! Scan your Apple music library and receive ticket alerts about your favorite artists. And when you enable notification and location services we can give you details – like where you can see them play next. Integration with Apple Music is a notable update for Ticketmaster as it makes it easier for users to know when their favorite artists are touring. Ticketmaster isn’t the first app to add Apple Music integration, though. Nike+ Run Club, for instance gained Apple Music integration last October, while Shazam sports integration for easily adding identified songs to your library. To allow apps to integrate Apple Music, Apple released official Apple Music API documentation last spring highlighting what developers could do with the service. This API is what’s used by apps like Ticketmaster, Shazam, and Nike+ Run Club. The latest version of Ticketmaster is available on the App Store now.

Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook told analysts last month. “There’s not a size that we would not do." It’s a message he’s increasingly stressed over the past year as investors question how the world’s most valuable technology company plans to use its $246 billion cash pile to meet ambitions sales targets and expand into new markets, such as transportation. But Apple has struggled for years to pull off bigger deals because of a series of quirks: an aversion to risk, reluctance to work with external advisers like investment banks and inexperience in closing and integrating large takeovers, said people who have worked on acquisitions with the company. They asked not to be identified speaking about private merger and acquisition deliberations. “The first step in M&A is having some conviction about what it is you want to do,” said Eric Risley, managing partner at Architect Partners LLC who has negotiated deals with Apple. “Apple probably more than most feels that they’re very capable of building things" rather than buying them, he added. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. Apple’s biggest deal in its 41-year history was the $3 billion purchase Beats Electronics in 2014, followed by the $400 million acquisition of NeXT Computer in 1996. In Facebook Inc.’s 13 years, it has made three acquisitions of at least $1 billion, including its $22 billion WhatsApp purchase. Google, founded in 1998, has done four such deals, while Microsoft Corp. has completed at least 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Instead of closing big deals, Cook has so far focused on growing Apple’s services businesses, including Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud. That’s beginning to work, with the company recently forecasting that annual revenue from those operations will top $50 billion by 2021. But even here, some analysts and investors argue for a big acquisition, especially in online video streaming. Apple has started distributing videos through the Music service, and pooling other providers’ video in its mobile TV app, but it has no service akin to Netflix or Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime Video. On Friday, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said Apple needs at least one big acquisition in online video. To reach its $50 billion target, the company must find an extra $13 billion in services revenue over the next four years -- beyond what it can generate itself. Netflix Inc. ended 2016 with sales of less than $9 billion, so even buying that business may not be enough, the analyst said. Other potential blockbuster Apple acquisition targets include Walt Disney Co. and electric carmaker Tesla Inc., Baird analyst William Power wrote in a recent note to clients. “They’re going to have to pursue something bigger than a Beats-like acquisition," said Erick Maronak, chief investment officer at Victory Capital Management, which holds Apple stock among its $55 billion under management. The presidency of Donald Trump may spark tax reforms that free up more Apple cash to spend on takeovers. But so far, the company has tip-toed around the edges of some of the biggest transactions re-shaping the technology industry.  When AT&T Inc. agreed to purchase Time Warner Inc. for $85 billion in October, the telecom company was concerned Apple might make a competing bid, people familiar with AT&T’s thinking said at the time. Apple had held tentative talks about a year earlier, but when the AT&T deal emerged, a person familiar with the technology giant’s thinking said it wouldn’t be able to pull together a competing proposal quickly enough. Last year, the company considered buying luxury carmaker McLaren Technology Group Ltd., people familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg at the time. Apple also had takeover talks with chip designer Imagination Technologies Group Plc, but said last year it wouldn’t make an offer. Apple’s deals team is composed of about a dozen people under former Goldman Sachs banker Adrian Perica, and most acquisitions take place at the behest of the company’s engineers. Product managers usually meet every month with Perica’s team members to identify targets with attractive technology or talented engineers, according to a person familiar with the process. Microsoft’s deals team is not significantly bigger, and it still hired investment bank Morgan Stanley for its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn last year, beating rival bidders including Salesforce.com Inc. and Facebook. At Google, the corporate development team is led by Don Harrison and sometimes works on potential acquisitions with strategy experts working under Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler, not just technical staff. Other deals are carried out at the behest of founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Apple often refuses to work with investment bankers appointed by the seller, preferring to deal directly with company management, according to people who have been involved in such negotiations. Apple also dictates terms and tells targets to take it or leave it, betting that the promise of product development support later and the chance of appearing in future iPhones are alluring enough, the people said. That was the case when Apple acquired Metaio GmbH in 2015. Bankers appointed by the augmented-reality firm to negotiate weren’t allowed in the room, and while Metaio executives felt the offer was low, Apple’s vision for the technology convinced them to sell, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Apple’s current M&A strategy works well for acquiring startups developing new technology that can be added to existing Apple products. It bought 15 to 20 companies per year over the last four years. But buying larger companies presents a different challenge, particularly if there are rival bids. Bankers often diffuse tension between bidders and targets, but Apple’s approach can make that process difficult. “There’s a swagger -- you may call it arrogance -- about the culture there,” said Risley of  Architect Partners. “They’re used to being able to muscle their way in and get attractive economics.” For Apple’s acquisition of Beats, neither party used an investment bank. Apple struggled to integrate the team, and when the initial Apple Music offering emerged from the combination, it got lukewarm reviews. Later versions of the service improved. However, Apple’s lack of a successful track record integrating big acquisitions puts off sellers, according to a person who has negotiated with Apple’s deals team. Large acquisitions can also go wrong in big ways. After buying Nokia Oyj’s handset business for $9.5 billion, Microsoft had to write down $7.6 billion of that value in 2015. Failures like that helped forge Apple’s caution on larger deals, according to one of the people familiar with its thinking. That attitude may need to change, according to some investors. After the AT&T-Time Warner deal, analysts’ focus shifted to Netflix as the next target, even as the video streaming service says it’s not up for sale. However, that company’s shares are up about 60 percent in the past year, giving it a market value of more than $60 billion -- 20 times the cost of Apple’s biggest deal.

Courtney raved about Sam being a great babysitter, and she was right! From the moment Sam texted Stacy and asked if she should bring her own (paleo) food or if there was enough in the house for her to cook for the children, we knew it was going to work out! When Stacy & Matt got home to find a clean kitchen as well as a house full of well-fed and happy boys we wondered how we could convince Sam to hang around more often. When she started PaleoSitter.com the opportunity for Sam to learn more about cooking, blogging, book writing and more came up and we’re thrilled to have her as our Local Assistant interning to learn more about how to turn your passion into a business! So often we get the question, “If I can’t feed my paleo toddler Cheerios or rice puffs, what on earth can I feed them for a snack?” Who better to answer this question than a Paleo Baby Sitter? Sam has put together an awesome round-up with 20 ideas for how to feed a paleo toddler. Take it away Sam!  ♥♥♥ Hi guys! PaleoSitter here! Or my legal name Samantha. I have received questions on my blog about what I give the toddlers I babysit as snacks. These are things that have worked for me. I view toddlers as being 1-3 years old, but many of these things work for older kids as well. NOTE: Not all kids I babysit eat paleo. 1. Apple squeezes, they have apple sauce and apple juice in a pouch. I personally love these! 2. Grapes! If you are concerned about these being a choking hazard, just cut the grapes in half. 3. Eggs, hard-boiled eggs are an easy on the go snack. You can add sesame seed eyes and a carrot nose to turn them into fun chicks! Check out this post from Nom Nom Paleo for the perfect boiled egg.   4. Lara Bars, I have found the blueberry muffin is popular, or my recipe for Sam Bars. Need an inexpensive nut-free version? Try Toasted (Not) PB & J Katybars. Paleo Parents also have recipes for Nut Free Blueberry Muffin LaraBar Wannabes, Mango Snack Balls, and Banana Bread Balls (vegan, paleo and AIP friendly!)   5. Fruit Kabobs: put different chunks of fruit on a Popsicle stick (no sharp points!), perfect for on the go. 6. Pudding! What kiddo doesn’t like pudding? I will be uploading a paleo friendly chocolate pudding recipe soon, but in the mean time, The Paleo Parents have a great recipe for Cinnamon Raisin (not) Rice Pudding by their oldest son, Cole! 7. Avocados, remember once you cut them, put a little lime/lemon juice on them to prevent them from turning brown. 8. Pure Wraps, for sandwich replacement we use these. You can put almond butter with bananas, lunch meats, chicken salad with paleo mayo or whatever you like! They’re not terrific by themselves, but delicious when filled with things. 9. Apple Gate Farms  deli meat, they are a little expensive, but delicious! We buy them in bulk at BJ’s Whole Club but you can find them at Trader Joe’s too. 10. Fruit with almond butter. These pouches work very well for car rides. They also come with different flavors, the honey and maple syrup flavors are my personal favorites. 11. Banana bread! We use the book Against All Grain for our recipe. Our last two loafs lasted a day. There is also a great recipe in Eat Like a Dinosaur. 12. Blueberry muffins, I use this recipe. It has the consistency of a normal muffin. I add double the amount of blueberries. 13. Pork rinds. (Probably a bit controversial but my family loves them.) US Wellness Meats has great quality pork rinds that are made from pastured pork and fried in their own lard! Their seasonings also don’t have any yucky stuff (chemicals, sugar, MSG) – yay! 14. Paleo Girl Scout cookies. I found multiple AMAZING recipes. Tagalongs, Samoas, and Thin Mints. (Elana Amsterdam from Elana’s Pantry is the bomb! She wrote the forward to Eat Like a Dinosaur for Matt and Stacy!)   On Thursday, we asked our Facebook followers for their favorite things to feed paleo toddlers, and we got some great responses! Our last six suggestions come straight from those paleo mommies who answered:  15. TONS of you suggested OLIVES! We agree – Olives are packed with healthy fats, and great for little ones to practice their “pincer” skills. Just like grapes, you can cut these in half too! The best part about olives is that they are easily portable and mess free! Just make sure you get ones that are pitted, of course! 16. Tricia H. had a WONDERFUL suggestion: She buys these “Little Green Pouches” (which, by the way, are reusable, dishwasher/freezer safe AND BPA, PVC, and phythalate free!) – she makes her own blends of cooked veggies and fruits. Tricia says, ” I make 8 pouches at a time and freeze a few. His favorite is a sweet potato, apple, carrot with cinnamon!”  GREAT idea Tricia! Thanks for sharing this adorable picture of your son!   17. Pretty in Paleo commented and said, “Mine loves a mixture of Cashews, Raisins, Unsweetened Coconut Flakes and Enjoy Life Chocolate Chips” – we love this idea too, and in fact we have an area in our pantry that has the different ingredients for paleo trail mix in jars where they can reach them so they can make their own mixes for themselves! (see more about Our Paleo Pantry here) 18. SUPERFOOD ideas: Canned wild caught Sardines, salmon, and tuna. While it may seem weird to you to feed a toddler a can of sardines, don’t let your preconceptions about these foods transfer to your little ones! Lots of our Facebook followers commented that their toddlers love sardines, and even The Paleo Mom has said many times before how her youngest daughter loves them! They are incredibly nutrient dense, and just what little ones need to grow strong. If you are worried about them choking on the bones, you can always buy them boneless and skinless. Don’t knock it ’til you try it! Your toddler may surprise you. Toddlers and babies are also known to LOVE liver, and a great easy option is US Wellness Meats liverwurst. It’s soft and delicious, and incredibly nutrient dense.   19. Gelatin Snacks – lots of you suggested this one, and we TOTALLY agree! We love gelatin snacks – so much so that we did a MEGA round up with 60+ recipes using grassfed gelatin. Photo by Against All Grain 20. Last but not least, lots of you suggested organic fruit leathers! Danielle, from Against All Grain has a great recipe for Homemade Fruit by the Foot that her own toddler, Asher, just loves! Isn’t he adorable? We hope these 20 ideas help with your toddler, and we are so glad that you got to meet our PaleoSitter, Sam. We are looking forward to working with her on the weekends as she interns for us, and also mentoring her in her blogging skills. Do you have any more great suggestions for Paleo Toddler Snacks? Leave a comment and let us know!    All about Sam: Hello! I am Sam. I am the newest and youngest member of the Paleo Parents team. Before eating paleo, I had skin allergies, acid reflux, acne, frequent bronchitis, and I was overweight. My Stepmom and I are avid CrossFitters, and both hit a plateau with weight loss. When our family decided to switch to paleo, it changed our lives. We have collectively lost 99 pounds. Not only did I lose weight, all of my medical issues disappeared. I am a full time college student, a government contractor, and trying to become an avid blogger. I love to cook and bake. Oh, yeah, and eat. I have been cooking ever since I can remember. What really encouraged me to cook more, was when my Dad sent me to a cooking boot camp. I have transformed my cooking to paleo, with an abundance of trial and error. I am very excited to be working with Paleo Parents and their team! Connect with Sam on Facebook!

First off, processed fruit and fruit juice has very little nutritional value, and second, what a waste of packaging. Food packaged in plastic, especially acidic foods, causes the plastic to leach into the food. Make your own applesauce or buy it in a large glass jar that you can reuse or recycle. Stacy & Matt Bre, I would you suggest you check out the linked post. Although probably filled with the best of intentions, your tone comes across very judgmental and harsh – which can turn off those people who are interested in making better choices for their families. Certainly homemade is best (see our recipe on the blog and our book Eat Like a Dinosaur for a recipe), the items linked are better alternatives for busy families who can’t always do so. Try to remember everyone is at different phases of their paleo journey and we were all just starting once… http://balancedbites.com/2012/06/paleo-perfectionism.html Cheryl I get these types of things (#1) for my kids occasionally for those days when my fresh fruit/veggies have already been eaten for the week and(or) I need something quick and easy to send to school for a snack. We couldn’t afford to eat them every day/all the time but for snack 1-2 times a week its a lifesaver! I also buy applesauce in large jars at Costco but for an on the go snack it doesn’t work well. I love all the ideas posted here!!!! Sometimes I just need to be reminded of some other options!!! Joe Walsh Yes I does not I so agree with you bre Michelle These are really helpful suggestions! I will check out your blog! My three year old has multiple food sensitivities (gi and skin related). We did a very basic paleo diet with him for two weeks, and he was so much happier, more energetic, and problems started dismissing. As we added back in more food to see if he can handle some gluten free packaged snacks (concerned for the emotional aspect), he has really resisted real food.:(. He snacks a lot, he is borderline anemic. We are trying very hard to do mostly primal, slowly adding foods to check for sensitivities (although gi wise no symptoms with hard cheese/yogurt, skin is always flaring). He is often hungry within 15 min of a meal. We get frustrated…and for a solid hour before bed he eats and eats. :(. I want him mostly off grains, but my husband isn’t there yet although supportive. My big question is about getting kids to eat real meals–real food…do you use the no thank you portion concept??? Or do you just set out meals and not push..let them eat what he naturally goes for (with a good quality meal?). I am starting to give him a salad like ours at lunch, and let him pick out what he’ll eat, hoping he’ll eventually improve. He resists that so majorly, it can become a true battle. The old fashioned “clean your plate” my husband grew up with doesn’t work at all, and doesn’t fit us. I do not want food to become such a negative….Looking for any posts or ideas! I follow your work and Sarah’s, starting on AIP myself. God bless you both…and my son LOVES your kids story in eat like a dinosaur. Your podcasts I want him to hear your little jingle too! :). I am hoping to turn us both around in positive ways! Stacy & Matt It sounds like you might need to focus on trying to add more healthy fats to your little one’s diet to help keep him full. Fats keep you satiated longer than any other food, and especially grains. Grains act like sugar in the body, and are metabolized quickly, leaving you hungry. We like to add coconut milk to our kids fruit smoothies (like this one: http://paleoparents.com/2011/blueberry-coconut-milk-smoothie/ and this one: http://paleoparents.com/featured/coles-mango-madness/ ) because it helps keep them full for longer. You can also make smoothies and add avocado to them like this one: http://againstallgrain.com/2012/07/24/creamy-chocolate-avocado-smoothie/ – usually if a child is continually hungry, the fat is what they are missing. When trying to get little ones to eat veggies, cook them in a healthy dose of fat too, like lard, grassfed ghee, or butter if he tolerates dairy ok. Keep presenting the foods and keep trying. It usually takes a person (child or adult) to have a food presented 10 times before they will even try it. It will happen over time, and get easier, but you just have to be patient. You might also want to check out our ebook, 3 Phase Paleo for tips on transitioning your family to a paleo lifestyle if they are hesitant at first. http://3phasepaleo.com – it took us two years to fully transition, and this is how we did it. <3 best of luck ~ The Paleo Parents Michelle Thank you so much for your prompt reply Stacy, I think you hit a very key concept for his diet, and those are awesome suggestions. I’m excited to implement them and will check out your book when finances allow, keep up the awesome work, you and your husband are an inspiration! Anne Thank you for this post! I have been Paleo for 3 years and trying to slowly (very slowly) transition my kids ( 5 and 3) to paleo (they are GF). I am going to give the wraps a try because my oldest loves his sandwiches and he hates roll up made with lettuce. Thanks for the ideas! Esp the “rice” pudding. Joe Walsh I loved the blue berry muffins I ate them here with my 2 year old daughter Sharon Oaks Our grandson is almost 6 and has been brought up with horrible eating habits. These snack ideas are wonderful and I can’t wait to begin trying many of them out on him! Coby This is such a helpful post. I’m trying to move my family to a more whole foods lifestyle approach – fewer Goldfish and more, well, real fish! We’re expecting our second so anything that I can do to be proactive with our health is definitely welcome. Grab me and kiss me I’m paleo but I don’t count nuts as paleo. I think they are just as bad as grains. If you feed nuts atleast make sure they’re soaked in water for a few hours first (like beans), then drain and rinse. Even so I’d still worry that it would cause too much inflammation in their delicate digestive system. Gelatin: what a great tip! So tasty and good for their digestion. For dairy-eating paleos, try custards. You could even freeze them in ice cube trays and pop a couple of them before going out. I use a lot more egg yolks than recipes usually ask for. Oh and cheesecake bites! It’s tasty even without sugar and you can freeze it too. Danielle F I absolutely love these ideas! We are new to the paleo lifestyle and struggle with our children ages 4,3, and 1 and finding good snack variety. I like the idea of creating their own trail mix. I’m definitely going to stock up on ingredients and then give them little muffin liners to fill with their choice of ingredients! Amanda Do you know of a place I can find some recipes for making my own food pouches? My 15 month old son is not a big eater but he will eat from the pouches occasionally. I have reusable ones with cute little animals on it, but I don’t really know what to put in them and how to maximize the calories (and I struggle to do much of anything without a recipe or instructions!) Amanda Oh, and as a response to people who might say how terrible it is to serve a child something in plastic, until you have a child that literally will starve themselves, you have no idea. You will let your child eat anything they want.Ice cream for dinner? OK. Food in a pouch? Yes! It’s that or a feeding tube and we really don’t want to go down that road if it can be avoided. Stacy & Matt While we have never personally tested, there are a number of sites that offer some suggestions (like this one http://www.littlegreenpouch.com/pages/paleo-food-pouch-recipes). If you son can tolerate coconut milk and/or yogurt, I am thinking that would be a good base for a number of creations, with broth making for an excellent base for other meals. Good luck! Nancy D.

Samsung sold 76.8 million smartphones in the fourth quarter, giving it a market share of 17.8 percent, but it was just beaten by Apple, which sold 77 million iPhones for a 17.9 percent share, according to figures from Gartner. The fourth quarter is usually a strong one for Apple, boosted by holiday sales of the new generation of iPhones it releases each September, said Anshul Gupta, a research director at Gartner. For Samsung, though, 2016 ended particularly badly, dominated by the fiasco around the recall of its incendiary Galaxy Note7. Super-phones like the Note7 could have accounted for 10 to 15 percent of Samsung's smartphone sales in the period before its recall, said Gupta, but Samsung lost more than that: There was also the damage to its brand. It could bounce back sooner rather than later, though, as it has a new flagship phone coming out at the end of March. Apple, meanwhile, is expected to wait until September before unveiling new iPhones. This year will mark the iPhone's 10th anniversary, and the next model is widely expected to be something special, so Apple fans may delay replacing phones until then, said Gupta. That would leave the way clear for Samsung to move back into the lead from this quarter. That pattern showed up last year too: Although it dominated the fourth quarter, Apple was a distant second over the full year, with market share of just 14.4 percent over the year, far behind Samsung's 20.5 percent, and the situation was similar the previous year. While the giants slug it out, a more interesting battle is going on just beneath them, as the next three companies in the fourth-quarter smartphone rankings are all Chinese. Huawei Technologies is in third place with a worldwide smartphone market share of 9.5 percent, with fourth and fifth taken by Oppo (6.2 percent) and BBK Communication Equipment (5.6 percent), two companies that many consider to be part of the same conglomerate. Gartner treats them separately because, whatever their shareholding structure, they operate independently, each with their own product team, Gupta said. BBK, almost unknown in the West, is now the number one smartphone brand in China, he said. A year ago, though, that honor went to Oppo, and the year before that, Huawei. Previous years saw the Chinese market topped by Xiaomi and Samsung. These Chinese companies have pushed Apple and Samsung aside in their home market, and are expanding across South Asia. "Even in their current expansion, Oppo is not focusing just on emerging markets, but also on developed markets like Australia," said Gupta, so we may soon see them climbing up the rankings in Europe and the U.S too. The key ingredients for that are already in their products, he said. "Oppo and BBK make great phones in terms of feature set. They have integrated high-end features like dual cameras and fast charge."

Opinion | 06 Feb 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (41) What Apple Can Learn from Airwalk by Josh Centers When I was a teenager in the 1990s, Airwalk shoes were all the rage. They were a mandatory accessory for grunge-oriented youths, along with plaid shirts and corduroy pants. The company was founded in 1986, and in its heyday in the 1990s, it had grown to be the third-largest sneaker brand, behind only Nike and Adidas. Today’s teens have undoubtedly never even heard of Airwalk sneakers, which are now found on the bargain rack at Payless Shoesource. What happened? Wait, this is TidBITS, not a fashion magazine, so why am I talking about shoes? Keep reading. I’m about to tell you a story that may sound chillingly familiar. Airwalk began as a niche shoe for professional skateboarders. Skating legend Tony Hawk (who starred in an eponymous video game that ran on the Mac, along with many other platforms) was one of their first customers, and actually suggested the name. Much of Airwalk’s early popularity was due to getting input from skaters to create superior skateboarding shoes that wouldn’t cause blisters or crashes. Airwalk had a healthy business, but it didn’t hit the big time until it hired advertising firm Lambesis to run an ultra-chic, counter-cultural ad campaign. As Malcolm Gladwell wrote in “The Tipping Point,” Airwalk was a $16 million company in 1993. In 1994, it was a $44 million company. In 1995, it was a $150 million company. To satisfy the vast influx of teenage customers while keeping skateboarders and boutique shops happy, Airwalk developed a two-tier strategy. It sold cheaper, consumer-grade shoes to mainstream retailers like Footlocker while continuing to provide pricier, professional-grade shoes to boutique shops. But Airwalk’s success didn’t last. The company’s troubles began in 1997 as production problems led to limited back-to-school supplies. Meanwhile, its lineup had become stale, with few new models. Worst of all, Airwalk abandoned its professional line of shoes. Serious skaters dropped Airwalk, causing the brand to lose its cachet with teens, and it wasn’t long before Airwalk’s time in the sun was over. A smallish company exploding due to quality products and a hip ad campaign. A product line that split into both consumer and professional tiers to provide different price points and features. A company that was later plagued by production problems, stagnant product designs, and ignoring its professional market. Does that sound like another company you can think of? Airwalk might have skated along for a while with its old designs and made peace with retailers, but abandoning its key market of hardcore skaters was what drove it into market irrelevance. In terms of managing supply chains and industrial design, Apple has a pair of superstars in Tim Cook and Jony Ive (to the extent Ive is still involved in product design, anyway). And Apple no longer worries about disappointing retailers, having opened hundreds of its own stores. More concerning is how Apple is treating its professional users. Let’s itemize a few of the ways Apple has moved away from the professional market over the past five years: Killing the Xserve Dumbing down Final Cut Pro with Final Cut Pro X Replacing the pro app Aperture with the consumer-level Photos Increasing burdensome restrictions on Mac App Store apps Releasing a new Mac Pro without internal expandability Failing to update that Mac Pro for over 3 years Delaying updates to the MacBook Pro line for nearly 18 months Releasing a new MacBook Pro that has drawn criticism from professionals Showing a lack of support for automation by eliminating the position of Product Manager of Automation Technologies We’re not alone in saying that Apple is now the iPhone company (see “Understanding Apple’s Marginalization of the Mac,” 21 November 2016). That’s where most of its profit comes from, and so that’s where most of its resources go. Fair enough. But, here’s the thing: the Mac and the capabilities it provides to professionals are the foundation of that iPhone business. Die-hard Mac users kept Apple afloat in the dark years before the iPod and then iPhone. And even now, regardless of all other professional uses of the Mac, developers need Xcode on the Mac to create iOS apps. Apple still has many things in its favor: $241 billion in cash, massive profits every quarter, one of the most popular brands in the world, and nearly 500 successful retail stores. And it might seem odd to criticize Apple now, especially when the company just broke a quarterly record with the most iPhone and Mac sales ever (helped by new iPhone and MacBook Pro models, plus the holiday shopping season, see “Apple Sees Apparent Return to Growth with Q1 2017’s Record Results,” 31 January 2017). But as we saw with Airwalk, things could go downhill fast if professional users were to leave the platform, taking with them all the people and organizations they currently keep loyal to Apple products. I don’t want to be too hard on Apple. The company is still incredibly strong and is doing better in some areas where it has been weak. By many accounts, Final Cut Pro X has improved greatly since its initial release, and some professional movie makers are giving it a chance. App Store review times are plummeting, and Apple is planning to allow developers to respond directly to App Store reviews. Swift is an exciting new programming language with a bright future, and it’s suitable for both compiled apps and scripts. You might argue that Apple and Airwalk aren’t comparable. For instance, although it may have gotten its start providing athletic shoes, Airwalk ultimately became a fashion company. But isn’t Apple similar in many respects? Apple opened its doors with the Apple I hobby kit, and by the mid-2000s, the iPod and its white earbuds were fashion mainstays. The Apple Watch is clearly intended to be a fashion item today. Even the MacBook, with its prominent usage in coffee shops, airports, and other public places, makes its own fashion statement. Despite these similarities, Apple is a much, much larger company than Airwalk ever was. Plus, Apple is making so much money and has so much cash that it can afford many more missteps than a plucky young footwear company. Perhaps most important, Apple can learn from the example of companies like Airwalk that fell from grace after losing sight of their most influential users. Here’s hoping Apple realizes the danger of diverting too much attention away from the Mac and its professional users.   Smile makes tools so you can have a productive day.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Peter Meyer  2017-02-06 10:37 Josh, I was thinking about this over the weekend, but came to a different conclusion. Relying on fashion is not the winning strategy for a company that is this large. Nor is relying on what used to sell - gizmos. I am an Apple computer/phone/watch/TV user. I'll probably buy AirPods. But as a stock holder, I don't want Apple to stay there. I want Apple to move into healthcare and financial services and be willing to abandon computer power users along the way. Shoes are a great analogy, they move to a diminishing market. I want Apple to thrive, and I think it is time to move out of the diminishing phone and computers business and into services. If I could delegate Apple resources, I'd put some of the best folks they have on healthcare and finance. What does that make the phone and Mac? Loss leaders in 2020. Important to have but not the future of the company. So I guess that I am hoping Apple does the reverse of your last paragraph. Thanks for letting me think aloud, Peter Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-06 13:46 There's a lot to be said for Apple and services, but it's a matter of convincing the right people to write up their thoughts for us. :-) I think Apple is making some smart moves in the healthcare and IT spaces, especially with its IBM partnership. But as someone who uses Apple computers professionally, I don't want to see Apple become like IBM, moving entirely out of the end-user market to focus on back-end stuff. The iPhone is still by far Apple's largest revenue source, and the Mac users who create things for it are the backbone of that market. Reply David   2017-02-06 10:38 The day that a teen puts a poster of Marco Arment on the wall of their bedroom is the day that I will believe that the professionals you're talking about with regards to Apple are comparable to Tony Hawk. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-06 13:46 Ha! Teens may not idolize developers, but they certainly enjoy the apps they produce, including maybe some of Marco's. You could argue that Snapchat today is what skateboarding was 20+ years ago, though that's sort of a lousy analogy. Another way to think about this is: imagine walking into a coffee shop and instead of MacBooks, everyone was working on Surface Pro tablets. Given enough scale, that'd certainly have a network effect. Something Gladwell describes in his book, which I didn't go into in the article, is how trends develop. You first have what he calls innovators, oddballs who do new things. Then you have other groups who translate those things for the masses, like mavens and connectors. My point is, to put it in Gladwell speak, if those innovators drop Apple for another platform, over time that could trickle down to the masses and quickly eat away Apple's bottom line. Reply David   2017-02-06 17:54 They may enjoy the apps, but I doubt that 1 in 100 of them know the name of the developer who wrote it. And that breaks the link between "I have to wear what Tony Hawk is wearing" and "I have to code on what Marco Arment is coding on." I can equally imagine -- in the coffee shop analogy -- the teens being horrified that the "old people" are using the same thing they are, and fleeing Apple en masse. Finally, I don't find Gladwell's arguments particularly convincing. He seems to me to regularly take a small part of a social science finding (10,000 hours of practice, eg) and blow it up into a much larger and simpler conclusion, one that makes a good pop-sci headline but doesn't really tells us much about the real world. The narrative at the moment seems to be that Apple is neglecting pros and that's going to cost them, but what I've mostly seen is a range of strained arguments about why it's going to cost them, ranging from possibly plausible to pretty outlandish. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:34 I agree about Gladwell, which is why I didn't go too much into his theories in the article. However, outside of the linked interview, his book was the best source for the Airwalk story. The problem with arguments in favor of the professional markets is that there are a lot of intangibles there. In the case of Airwalk, it likely made total sense to dump the pro skater market for consumers — I'm sure they made far, far more money from Foot Locker than local skate shops. However, that turned out to be an enormous mistake, one that wouldn't appear on any spreadsheet. Reply David   2017-02-07 10:44 I think I'd like to see more than an anecdote before I buy into a narrative that is highly convenient for the people telling and reading it. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 22:44 One might say the same thing about your arguments. There's a whole truckload of wishful thinking there. Just from a local perspective, the predominant healthcare provider in my area, Palo Alto Medical Foundation, has excellent computerized records and services. They work on Windows PCs, not Macs. Other medical professionals use tablets, though they're not iPads, because they have to link with their non-Apple computer systems. Which is to say, without a Mac backbone, medical providers are not going to be using Apple products and services. Sure there are some highly visible Macs on some popular medical TV shows, but again, those are the Macs you so blithely dismiss. Great product placement, by the way. As Josh says, Macs are at the core of Apple's business. Without the Mac, the iPhone is just another gadget, here today, gone tomorrow. You know, like the iPad. And without the Mac, there will be no Apple products in medicine. As for financial whatever, all Apple does now is provide an access point via Apple Pay for consumers to the real financial service providers. They don't actually provide any of those financial services, nor are they likely to do so. Though they make a tidy profit with every Apple Pay transaction. You want to buy a Mac on credit through Apple you'll be using a Barclaycard, one of the highest interest rate charge cards on the planet, to whom Apple is only an intermediate business. In other words, I don't think your ambitions for Apple growth are grounded in anything like reality. As for shoes being a diminishing market, what planet are you living on? As large third-world countries like China, Mexico and India grow more prosperous, shoes will continue to be a growth industry. Just like iPhones. Which is why Apple is working so hard to break into the Indian market with lower price, recycled iPhones. That's where the growth is for them—and for Nike. The iPhone is the primary driver for the App Store, Apple's most prosperous service niche. And the App Store sells apps. And apps for the App Store are developed on Macs. Without the Mac there would be no apps and no App Store and, for all practical purposes, no iPhone. And no Apple. While Microsoft's Surface PCs are not yet a dominant product, Microsoft is clearly thinking long term, hence their huge investment in product placement in the NFL. The Surface Studio is coming out this year and will eventually, I presume to predict, make a significant dent in Apple's base among design professionals. Unless, as Josh hopes, Apple begins to take their professional base seriously once again. If I were twenty years younger I would certainly take the Surface Pro seriously. I share Josh's hope, but I don't share his optimism. If the new MacBook Pro is Apple's idea of a professional computer, with only 16GB of RAM, they've lost their way big time. They've taken their obsession with thin well past the point of diminishing returns. In the meantime, Tim Cook is good at blowing smoke at financial analysts, but as has been pointed out elsewhere in this issue of TidBITS, Apple's record first quarter was a week longer than the same quarter last year. In other words, Cook is using accounting gimmicks to draw a false equivalency between the two. Adjusted for that extra week, Apple's sales and profits are far less rosy than Cook would have us believe. At best they are flat, year over year. Is Apple making lots of money right now? Sure. Even with no growth they're still a rich company with money to burn. But they don't appear to be burning any of it on serious R&D. Like, perhaps, a touch interface for the macOS that can compete with Microsoft. iOS does touch just fine. But Cook refuses to acknowledge the need for it in OS X. Apple is riding high right now. But there's an old expression, what goes up must come down. Put another way, in business if you're not growing, you're dying. Implicit in Josh's argument is the proposition that Apple may have reached the peak of it's growth and success. They won't fail overnight, but that doesn't mean they're not failing. If Tim Cook is not aware of that, as he seems not to be, then Apple will be going downhill from now on. There may be a blip of success here and there, but that won't halt the downward momentum. Tim Cook is a nice guy and Steve Jobs was a jerk. Still, some might say the biggest difference between them is the vision thing. Steve had it. Tim does not. But I think the biggest difference between them is that Steve Jobs would not tolerate mediocrity. Time Cook seems to tolerate it all to well. Thanks David for giving me a jumping off point for my rant. I would have made it anyway, but you gave me a convenient place to start. I agree with Josh's premise, but I'm more skeptical than he is. Josh is politely suggesting that Apple needs to return it's attention to the Mac and the wide range of professional users who depend on it. Unlike Josh, however, I feel no need to be polite. Tim Cook needs to wake the f*ck up. Reply David   2017-02-07 22:37 You're certainly welcome. None of what you said was in response to my actual points, enough that I was wondering if there was another David in the thread. Apparently not. If you'd like to engage with my actual arguments, you're welcome to do that, too. Reply Nicholas Croft  2017-02-14 02:50 The PC 'enthusiast' market (broad term, basically power users of yore) is the only growth/margin market in the PC business. Apple are leaving money on the table by not addressing the enthusiast. and... they are not mutually exclusive. But Timmah! has other priorities... Reply Zac Imboden   2017-02-06 15:06 What a thoughtful and well-written analysis. Regarding Peter Meyer's comments, I understand that Apple has it's own unique needs. What I would add is that what may be good for Apple (i.e. corporate expansion, diversification) may not be good for end users, specifically Mac users. I wish Apple to succeed as a company only as far as it concerns how they can continue to meet my needs and not theirs, my needs, not as a content revenue stream, an iPhone user, an iPad user, but as a MAC user. It appears to me that there is no longer any strong financial incentive for Apple to support and innovate their computer hardware and software as that segment continues to shrink in comparison to phone and content revenue. Continuing to complain about ridiculous mistakes in design and implementation and continuing to beg Apple to innovate and improve in the areas which matter the most to Mac users are losing propositions in the long run. If Apple wanted to do a great service to its various "niches", in my un-expert opinion, it would spin off the Mac and its system software and core apps into a separate company and let that company focus and innovate to meet the needs of its "niche" of Mac computer users at its own pace and peril. I'm not a investment guru, so I leave the financial merits of spin-offs for others. From an end-user endpoint, it seems to be the only way to get someone to pay closer attention to the very specific needs of computer users. Reply Travis Butler  2017-02-06 18:39 I think that would be courting the death of the Mac, honestly. As I argued in my other comment, the halo effect runs the other way - more people are buying Macs because they have used and liked Apple's consumer products. I think the main reason Macs have been bucking the overall decline in the computer industry is because they have Apple's strength in the consumer market to support them. If you cut the link there, you cut the main driving force for Mac market growth. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:19 Thanks for the kind words, Zac. However, I disagree with Apple spinning off the Mac. Tight integration with other Apple devices is still one of the Mac's strengths, and a spin-off would threaten that. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:20 I agree that the popularity of the iPhone and other Apple products helps drive Mac adoption. No argument there, and I think that's also still an important market for Apple. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 22:49 If Apple could value the Mac well enough to spin it off, they could value it enough to develop it internally. The problem is Apple doesn't seem to care one way or the other. Reply Derek Roff   2017-02-06 18:17 While Peter's suggestion that Apple get out of the hardware business strikes fear into my heart, I think it also misses Josh's key message. Why should a prudent investor like Peter assume that Apple can compete effectively in Services? This is an area where Apple has no particular expertise, and no intrinsic advantages. There are dozens of companies who understand Services better than Apple, and have both a deeper background and more agility. Airwalk survived as a fashion company, barely, and Apple might survive as an also-ran Services company, but as Josh indicates, this looks like the path to obscurity. Apple is a significant force in Services at the moment, because they are rich from hardware sales, and incredibly well known, from their integrated hardware, software, and lifestyle sales. Tossing all that out is, as Josh says, a losing strategy. Apple will not make its investors richer by proclaiming, "Think Conventionally". Reply Travis Butler  2017-02-06 18:30 Sigh. Another day, another 'Apple is doomed because they aren't catering to Important Users Like Me' article. The glaring flaw in this example is that it argues that people are drawn to Apple's consumer products because of the popularity of their computers among the elite - the halo effect. But if anything, the halo effect has run in the opposite direction, and has since the heyday of the iPod. People are buying Apple's consumer products, like the experience, and buying Macs to go with them. I've argued this before: Apple has, from the very first Apple ][, *always* catered to the ordinary user above the elite. When 'personal' computers were bulky S100 boxes that needed a separate dumb terminal and the arcane C/PM OS, Apple released a cute, streamlined all-in-one that hooked to a TV and booted into BASIC. When IBM introduced the designed-for-cubicles PC, Apple introduced the novice-user-friendly Mac. When smartphones were geeky tools, Apple released the iPhone. That's who they are. Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-06 18:44 So you're saying that none of your less-technical family, friends, or clients buy Apple hardware because of your recommendations? In my experience, most people who know they don't have the technical chops to make an informed decision buy based on social influence. Reply David   2017-02-06 21:27 Are his family & friends a sufficient sample to generalize? Reply Travis Butler  2017-02-07 04:51 Actually, seriously, yes. I've been asked for advice on *which* Mac to buy, but everyone I know who bought Mac in the last year decided to go that route on their own. Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-07 10:11 This is a discussion, not a research study. :-) Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-07 10:10 I obviously don't know the specifics, but unless you're well known for being platform agnostic, I doubt people would ask you for advice on other platforms. Your social influence to recommend Apple products is likely well known. Lots of people ask me for my opinions about what to buy, but they're always aware that I know Apple technology. But the article's point is that if you'd said, "Apple's hardware is stagnating and you'd be throwing money away if you didn't look at an Android phone or Windows PC" would those people ignore you and still buy Apple gear? In other words, if you as a tech influencer switched away from Apple gear, how many people would go with you eventually, purely because of your influence? Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:22 I'm not arguing that Apple is doomed. I can't count how many times I've written here something to the effect of "Apple is far from doomed." However, I do think shirking the professional market is an enormous mistake. Nor would I want Apple to drop or lose focus of its massively successful consumer line. The professional and consumer sides of Apple help build its strong ecosystem. Reply David   2017-02-07 10:50 2 people would go with me. Which would reduce Apple customers for the last quarter from 96 million people to 95,999,998. Even if there were 50,000 tech influencers who took 2 people with them, it would reduce Apple's customers from 96 million to 95,900,000 last quarter. (all numbers either approximate (customer numbers, people I influence) or made up (number of tech influencers)). Math done badly and on the fly. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 23:26 I'm not arguing that Apple is doomed, either, though I'm more cynical on the subject that Josh is. For one thing, doomed is a vague and melodramatic term. If Apple fails to innovate and improve the Mac, then their base of support will be eroded over time because, as I said before, the Mac is the core of Apple's business. Without it Apple's other business interests would fail to flourish. And that's putting it mildly. In my opinion, without the Mac there is no Apple. But I don't see Apple killing the Mac. After all, it's still making money. What I see happening, as Josh points out in more polite terms, is that the Mac appears to be declining in importance for Apple. This doesn't spell doom, but it does spell stagnation. Meanwhile, Apple competitors continue to innovate. As an artist, the Surface Studio is the first Windows PC that has ever piqued my interest. If Apple continues to rest on it's laurels Microsoft is going to eat their lunch. Now that they are making good hardware, Microsoft is playing in the same ballpark with Apple. And, like macOS X 10.12.x, Windows 10 is a solid and accessible OS. And there are areas, like cloud services, where Microsoft far exceeds Apple's success. So do Google and Amazon. Services aren't going to save Apple's bacon. The Mac is the only thing that can do that, not because it makes the most money, but because it's central to the success of every other Apple venture. What I don't understand is why Tim Cook doesn't seem to know this. His desultory remarks about the future of the Mac are not encouraging. Another incremental update to the iMac or the Mac mini isn't going to get the job done. Nor are incremental improvements to the macOS. As I've said before, at the top of my wish list is a touch screen interface for the macOS. Without this it's very hard to see how Apple is going to keep up with the competition. Reply has  2017-02-14 17:15 So glad I'm not the *only* [25-year Mac] user who can see this! HALF-A-BILLION people bought iPhones because they *wanted iPhones*! Not because some Mac fan told them to. The entire world's Macs could be raptured to silicon heaven tonight, and 95% of iPhone users wouldn't even notice the difference tomorrow. It is astonishingly egotistical, not to mention excruciatingly self-deluding/dishonest, for Mac fanboys to say that they and their beloved Macs are what sell iPhones, not the other way around. Next to such folks, even Toddler-in-Chief "The Donald" looks like Buddha by comparison. Reply Christian Kaatmann   2017-02-06 19:21 The thing that Apple is certainly doing right now - seen from a user perspective - is that _all_ of their systems are much more reliable now than they used to be. I very rarely have to reboot, if one app crashes the rest of the system carries on unperturbed, I can go seamlessly from my Mac to my iPhone to iCloud on a windows machine without ever loosing a comma in the text I'm working on. It's like magic compared to not so many years ago. And Apple has got us all happily hooked on its services with iCloud at the centre. And I mean happily, thinking of the days back with Excel 1.04, swapping disks on my Mac SE or more recently trying to keep my iMac from crashing every time I switched from Mail to Word to Excel to ... Apple keeps a lot of customers happy and deeply dependent. Reply Peter Meyer  2017-02-06 19:31 That is a great point. Thank you! Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:23 Apple does enjoy tremendous lock-in, which certainly gives it staying power. iCloud is one of the weaker service bundles, but it's bolstered by the popularity of the hardware, which in turn benefits from iCloud lock-in. Not to mention dependence on iMessage. Reply Peter Meyer  2017-02-06 19:30 A quick addition if you don't mind. I am going to express my opinion, not fact. I don't think that Apple will abandon the larger Mac and phone and iPod markets (or TV or iPads.) I am looking at these devices as critically important. Not important as computing devices, but highly valuable as data devices. What is the difference? Computing takes place in a small fairly closed environment. Data is fed by and then feeds a larger system. (I think of the Mac Pro as being about computing, the iPad and Apple TV as being about data.) If I look at this as an investor, I see that data system as services with end point devices. The devices are either commodity products or are really sophisticated at handling data to and from the user. That data is the core of the future services. (Again, this is me as businessman, not as the guy who is really enjoying this MBP right now). Apple should, absolutely should, stay in the end point market and make exceptionally exciting devices like an iPhone so light that you need a lanyard to hold it in place. Those devices are data portals, and the real economic engine for what might be the most valuable company on the planet will be the data services. They actually might subsidize the hardware experiments that many of us love. For those hardware experiments, my credit card vibrates in anticipation. My business mind is looking for services in healthcare and automobiles. The hardware is what we know, the services that we do not yet know will be our future, just as the pocket computer once was. So much for me being quick. Josh, Adam, thank you! Reply Herb Bowie  2017-02-06 20:16 The analogy seems a bit contrived, and the conclusions a bit overblown. Part of what we have always loved and respected about Apple is its intent and ability to skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it is. If we think about these issues from that perspective, we might make the following observations: 1. As device buses get increasingly powerful, and as the pace of technology change quickens, and as the desire for smaller computers increases, it will make sense for users to do "upgrades" by adding or swapping out peripherals, not through changes to the internals of their computers. 2. As SSD, memory, networks and microprocessors all get faster, the simple desire for ever bigger numbers -- faster chips, more RAM, etc. -- becomes less and less relevant for most users. 3. While Apple needs to provide core apps and services to make the average consumer happy, Apple's primary contribution to the larger app ecosystem is to make better tools for developers, not to make "Pro" level applications themselves. 4. As security becomes more and more of an issue, tight controls on the App store become increasingly important; however, third-party software suppliers still have the ability to deliver apps to their customers outside of the App store, so customers can have the best of both worlds. 5. As it becomes easier and easier to develop Mac applications, and as the Mac development tools grow stronger, and as the number of specialized apps continues to grow, it becomes ever harder to see why the Mac would need a special department for "Automation Technologies" for those few users who cannot find already developed solutions to their problems, yet who are also unable to develop new solutions themselves. So, yes, in all these cases, there are some short-term bumps in the road for many of us, and some more difficult issues for a few of us, but isn't this what we've always expected from Apple? Reply mike sanders  2017-02-06 21:53 Excellent response and a much more focussed overview, great respect to Josh but like so many "old" Apple users you still expect them to be a computer company which they no longer are. I have been a user since 1987 and an investor since the 2000s and have to say I am completely satisfied on both accounts. A very well run company which clearly knows where it is going just that it doesn't share it with us until the time is right. Have you seen the stock price today? Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:25 Per your point on automation — I think Apple sees Swift as eventually overtaking AppleScript. That's fine with me, but Apple also needs to continue to create automation tools for professionals who aren't programmers. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 23:47 I agree. Unfortunately, Apple has a habit of dropping the ball on good ideas and technologies. For example, iWeb was overtaken by the competition because Apple lost interest in developing it. The same goes for Aperture. Now Apple Script and Automator are threatened with extinction, with no accessible replacement in sight. Apple Script and Automator enable the user to plug right into the OS and their applications. They are essentially programmable apps. Swift, on the other hand, is a programming language not an application. It's hard to imagine a third party developing a program with Swift that will have the broad capabilities of Apple's native apps. If history is any guide, apprehension is called for. Reply has  2017-02-14 16:48 No, Apple sees *Siri* as the future of Automation for the billions of users who aren't programmers. The problem with this is that Siri-based Automation will be limited only to those capabilities Apple and App developers add to Siri. Which means that instead of a BILLION USERS adding their own Siri vocabulary for doing what what they want to do, there's only a million programmers adding what they *think* we users should have. Yet we ALREADY KNOW programmers can't be trusted to add everything we need—else we wouldn't have to learn Automation just to work around the endless limitations and stupidities in the Apps those programmers gave us in the first place! … All that said, AppleScript is just as *utterly useless* as Swift at making Automation accessible to the TWO BILLION users in the world today. So it's a failed design too. But at least it's one from which Apple could learn huge lessons in order to create NEW languages that finally do deliver TRUE USER AUTOMATION FOR ALL. Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-02-07 00:35 You forgot bonehead moves like killing Apple Displays, AirPort, and now it looks like the iPad lines will be next. Possibly even the desktop Macs. Tim Cook needs to be canned. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:26 Indeed, I should have mentioned the loss of Apple displays and the apparent abandonment of AirPort routers. The latter is a thorn in my side at the moment, since my Express is on its last legs, and I'm distrustful of others on the market. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-08 01:06 Right you are. Both Apple Displays and Airport routers have been overtaken by the competition because Apple has apparently lost interest in supporting and improving them. This has the look of a tradition at Apple. Or a disability, like ADD. There was a time when third-party routers did not support the Mac with decent setup software. Airport routers solved that problem, though they tended to be less capable than the competition. They had the virtue of being simple. That time is past. Though various routers handle the matter differently, their setup software has improved. For instance, I can get into a Comcast router's built-in setup software with a simple URL, as I did with Linksys routers in the past. AT&T has always bumped me to a web site where I entered the appropriate information and the web site passed it to the router. This was particularly useful in the old days when routers and modem settings often got corrupted. If something went wrong, pop, there I was at the AT&T setup page. Nowadays routers are more reliable and such problems are rare—though not unheard of. Apple eventually improved the simple Airport Base Station by including a hard drive that interfaced easily with Time Machine—the Airport Time Capsule, an appropriate name at the time. And the Time Capsule has improved over the years with a space saving tower configuration and larger hard drives. Though you can still get the Airport Extreme which is a simple router without the hard drive. It's comparably priced with similar routers, except that you still need an external modem, which might be a disadvantage, unless you're used to setting up modems. That said, I don't know why Apple is apparently dropping their WiFi product line. They work perfectly well. Perhaps sales have declined as service providers now so often provide their own routers and independent modems are less common. Airport routers still require an external modem, which puts them behind the curve. I used to like a separate modem because they tended to fail more often that routers. But now I rent my router from Comcast and if it fails for any reason I just pop down to the Xfinity store and get a replacement. The same goes for AT&T. I haven't had occasion to set up an Airport router in years. Still, I don't think it's a good reason not to get a replacement Airport Express if your Airport Extreme orTime Capsule is still working OK. Current models have the fastest WiFi, 802.11ac, and they are still for sale on the Apple web site, as is the Airport Express. Replacing the Express seems to me to be simpler than regigering your entire system with a new router and a new repeater. But then if your router is also having issues, there are less expensive alternatives to the Airport, depending on your setup. Reply Jean-Pierre SMITH  2017-02-07 04:37 Great analogy and thinking, for the Mac platform. I liked the idea the combination of (1) techical brilliance, as seen by the recognised "experts" and (2) some hype (better call it "intelligent design") is a key factor of success for the Mac. Remove one of the two pillars and the structure collapses. To remember, I still have on my LC-475's screen saver (not used any more) the picture of a snail carrying on its back a rival PC's Intel CISC processor. These old macs used Motorola RISC processors, deemed faster by the "experts". You may have called to the bar Michelin, whose tyres for trucks (trucking fleets are the tyre equivalent to the Mac's "expert" users) are in demand for their durability (mileage), while car drivers don't measure mileage but simply benefit from it without knowing. Car tyres benefit directly from R&D invested in truck tyres just as the Mac for me [ordinary Joe] directly benefits from the Mac used, misused and challenged by its professional users (the "experts"). I am not so sure, though, the above analogy works for the iPhone, iPad and iWatch lines (is it still true that the iPhone for the Presidents is called "Blackberry"?). Thanks for the brain teaser. Reply Nicholas Croft  2017-02-12 23:04 The PC 'enthusiast' (segment of the PC) market stands alone with growth and high margins. As Apple are, effectively out of the pro market... Why not... Sell the macOS for $500 - restricted to 6 core+ (ie X99) motherboards, only from (a few) vetted vendors. This is NOT suggesting that 'clones' get in. Its a way for Pro's to Roll Their Own - yeah, its similar (to clones) but not quite the same. Upsides: No manufacturing costs. Pure profit once initial outlay of programming is covered. This is a very different time to when Apple ONLY made good money on their desktop lines ie the Scully/Spindler/Amelio years. Reply has  2017-02-14 16:13 "Die-hard Mac users kept Apple afloat in the dark years" This is such a non-justification, it's embarrassing. SO WHAT? Apple owes all those die-hard Mac users ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. If Apple can win new 1Bn-user iDevice markets by dumping its old 10M-user Mac market, that's exactly what it *should do*. A small company chases chickenfeed markets because that's the MOST it can hope to win. If it wants to become a large company, it uses that initial income to expand the company to the point it can now tackle big markets. Big markets provide economies of scale, and in e.g. personal computing generates massive network effects too—which in turn creates more sales, more revenue, more profits. To then squander significant time and manpower by still chasing all those little old chickenfood markets is HOW NOT TO DO BUSINESS! It's a free invitation to all their more focused, less sentimental, competitors to steal those big markets for themselves. Just as Google and Amazon are now doing!

Samsung sold 76.8 million smartphones in the fourth quarter, giving it a market share of 17.8 percent, but it was just beaten by Apple, which sold 77 million iPhones for a 17.9 percent share, according to figures from Gartner. The fourth quarter is usually a strong one for Apple, boosted by holiday sales of the new generation of iPhones it releases each September, said Anshul Gupta, a research director at Gartner. For Samsung, though, 2016 ended particularly badly, dominated by the fiasco around the recall of its incendiary Galaxy Note7. Super-phones like the Note7 could have accounted for 10 to 15 percent of Samsung's smartphone sales in the period before its recall, said Gupta, but Samsung lost more than that: There was also the damage to its brand. It could bounce back sooner rather than later, though, as it has a new flagship phone coming out at the end of March. Apple, meanwhile, is expected to wait until September before unveiling new iPhones. This year will mark the iPhone's 10th anniversary, and the next model is widely expected to be something special, so Apple fans may delay replacing phones until then, said Gupta. That would leave the way clear for Samsung to move back into the lead from this quarter. That pattern showed up last year too: Although it dominated the fourth quarter, Apple was a distant second over the full year, with market share of just 14.4 percent over the year, far behind Samsung's 20.5 percent, and the situation was similar the previous year. While the giants slug it out, a more interesting battle is going on just beneath them, as the next three companies in the fourth-quarter smartphone rankings are all Chinese. Huawei Technologies is in third place with a worldwide smartphone market share of 9.5 percent, with fourth and fifth taken by Oppo (6.2 percent) and BBK Communication Equipment (5.6 percent), two companies that many consider to be part of the same conglomerate. Gartner treats them separately because, whatever their shareholding structure, they operate independently, each with their own product team, Gupta said. BBK, almost unknown in the West, is now the number one smartphone brand in China, he said. A year ago, though, that honor went to Oppo, and the year before that, Huawei. Previous years saw the Chinese market topped by Xiaomi and Samsung. These Chinese companies have pushed Apple and Samsung aside in their home market, and are expanding across South Asia. "Even in their current expansion, Oppo is not focusing just on emerging markets, but also on developed markets like Australia," said Gupta, so we may soon see them climbing up the rankings in Europe and the U.S too. The key ingredients for that are already in their products, he said. "Oppo and BBK make great phones in terms of feature set. They have integrated high-end features like dual cameras and fast charge." Win one of 3x HP OfficeJet Pro 8720 All-in-One Printers this month* More from HP Inc Join the PC World newsletter!

In light of the rise of emerging technologies, partners that can add unique layers of value are gaining greater prominence. Whether vertical or technology specific, forward-thinking partners now realise that staying vanilla seldom brings success, as customers place a premium on niche experts. Yet in parallel to the changing role of the partner, new influencers of IT are emerging across the business, with 72 per cent of IT buying decisions now made outside of the IT department. This exclusive ARN roundtable, in association with Telstra, discussed the changing dynamics of the channel in 2017, outlining how partners can specialise in a digital world, while attracting a new breed of buyer.

 A $20 billion investment firm dumped its huge trade in Apple — and bet on Alphabet and Microsoft Rachael Levy Feb. 14, 2017, 4:02 PM 11,093 facebook linkedin twitter email print Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Getty Images/Stephen Brashear Billionaire Chase Coleman's Tiger Global exited its big Apple bet last quarter while making a $148 million bet on Alphabet and investing $132 million in Microsoft. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the firm made a $1.1 billion bet on Apple, and over the course of 2016 started shedding the shares, regulatory filings show. Tiger dropped $407 million in remaining shares of Apple in the fourth quarter of last year, filings show. According to the 13F, Tiger made the following moves during the fourth quarter: It increased its stake in Priceline by 36%, holding a $1.84 billion stake at the end of the quarter It increased its stake in JD.com by 37%, holding a stake worth $1.16 billion It took a new position in Fiat valued at $481 million It took a new position in Alphabet valued at $147.5 million It took a new position in Microsoft valued at $131.6 million Bloomberg analyzed the data based off of a regulatory filing that the $20 billion investment firm filed February 14. The quarterly filing, called a 13F, lists the long stock positions of investment firms. The positions are current as of 45 days prior, so it is possible that Tiger Global has since changed its positions.  Tiger Global Management invests in private and public markets and manages about $20 billion firmwide. The firm managed $5.9 billion in hedge fund assets as of mid-year 2016, according to the Hedge Fund Intelligence Billion Dollar Club ranking.  SEE ALSO: A partner at $20 billion investment firm Tiger Global has left NOW WATCH: This behavior could kill your chances in a Goldman Sachs interview Loading video...

Break♦ing 9♦1♦1 (noun): Newly Received Information About an Event That Is Currently Occurring or Developing. Home contact us News Tips Video Viral news Politics Entertainment Crime Tech Weather Terrorism HOME CONTACT US NEWS TIPS February 15, 2017 | 10:30 PM Apple said to mull China supplier for next-gen iPhone screen February 15, 2017 | 10:30 PM Home » politics » Apple said to mull China supplier for next-gen iPhone screen Tech, U.S. February 15, 2017 Apple is in discussions with China’s BOE Technology Group Co. to supply next-generation displays for future iPhones, a key component that’s being provided by a Samsung Electronics Co. unit, people familiar with the matter said. Apple’s been testing BOE’s active-matrix organic light-emitting diode screens for months but hasn’t decided if it’ll add the Chinese company to its roster of suppliers, one of the people said, asking not to be named talking about private negotiations. BOE, one of the country’s largest screen makers, is spending close to 100 billion yuan ($14.5 billion) building two AMOLED plants in the southwestern province of Sichuan in anticipation of future business. Talks are at an early stage and it’s unlikely to supply the next iPhone, but BOE is banking on outfitting the one in 2018 or later, the person said. If BOE is selected for OLED, it will become the first known future supplier of the next-generation screens to Apple outside of South Korea and Japan — a triumph for a Beijing-based company best known for computer and TV displays. The U.S. company is exploring alternatives to address a global shortage of OLED displays as it prepares to adopt the sharper, more power-efficient technology for its next iPhones, catching up with rivals such as Samsung and Huawei Technologies Co. Apple declined to comment, and BOE declined to comment on talks with customers. The display is one of the most expensive components of a smartphone. OLED screens are more difficult to produce, making Apple beholden to suppliers still working to manufacture the displays in mass quantities. The world’s four biggest suppliers of smartphone displays — Samsung Display Co., Sharp Corp., LG Display Co. and Japan Display Inc. — are said to have insufficient capacity to equip all new iPhones this year, a constraint that may persist into 2018. That means Apple may be forced to adopt OLED in just a single version of its device this year, the 10th anniversary of the smartphone’s debut. “It’s an opportunity for BOE as Apple is known to seek multiple suppliers for one component,” said James Yan, research director for Counterpoint Research in Beijing. “But it’s unlikely to challenge Samsung because it is able to roll out high-quality screens at a steady capacity.” BOE’s shares had climbed 1.3 percent in Shenzhen by midday, outperforming a mostly unchanged benchmark A-share index. Universal Display Corp., which licenses and sells technology to makers of OLED screens, rose as much as 9.7 percent, the most since November. Founded in 1993 after employees took over an ailing producer of electron tubes, Beijing-based BOE is the world’s largest manufacturer of LCD panels by market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. BOE, which started out as Beijing Orient and enjoyed the support of a government keen to champion local technology players, is now building a 46.5 billion-yuan flexible AMOLED plant in Chengdu. While it’s ramping up capacity, it’s likely to miss the next iPhone. That sixth-generation factory won’t crank out a single screen till the summer, while new iPhones typically go on sale in the fall. When that plant is up to full capacity, it’ll be able to put out 48,000 glass substrates a month, BOE said in an e-mailed statement, referring to the thin surfaces from which screens are carved out. Another plant in Mianyang with the same capacity and investment is expected to start production only about two years later. The company currently operates only a small OLED factory in remote Inner Mongolia. Eventually, when its two plants are up and running, it expects to be able to manufacture 1.6 million square-meters of flexible AMOLED glass substrates a year, slightly more than researcher IHS’ estimate for total global production in 2016. Apple typically introduces new technologies for its iPhones across all models when they’re unveiled, usually in September, as it did with 3D Touch and Apple Pay. Using different core, user-facing technology in the same iPhone generation would be an unusual step. All iPhone 7 models have liquid-crystal display screens. The U.S. company and Samsung have an exclusive OLED supply deal covering 2017, people with knowledge of the agreement have said. Yet that doesn’t guarantee the South Korean technology giant can make enough displays to sate iPhone demand, particularly given Samsung needs to outfit its own slate of upcoming gadgets. Some analysts estimate that Apple could sell as many as 90 million iPhones in the last three months of 2017 alone.

You can fix a frozen iPhone in 10 seconds without a computer or any other accessories so that you can get back with your day. You can also use this to fix a frozen iPad. Advertisement Sometimes a frozen iPhone will not let you do any type of activity, and often you are stuck on-screen in an app or on a home screen. This can also help if your iPhone is stuck off and won’t turn on, but mainly you will use this when the iPhone is stuck on with an app or something on-screen. This is a hard-reboot, but some people will call it a hard-reset. Don’t worry about the reset part of this name. You are not resetting the iPhone like you would with a factory reset that wipes all the data clean. Fix your frozen iPhone in seconds. This may not solve all of your problems. If the iPhone freezes regularly you may need to remove an app or perform an actual factory reset on your iPhone and start from scratch. It’s normal for an iPhone to freeze once or twice in a year after you install a bad app or run into a problem. If things continue to freeze or go bad, there may be a hardware problem that requires a trip to an Apple Store. Advertisement Fix a Frozen iPhone in 10 Seconds You can fix a frozen iPhone in about ten seconds by pressing and holding the power and home button at the same time until the iPhone restarts. Once the iPhone screen changes from the frozen state to showing an Apple logo or just a blank screen you can let go. This is a hard reboot. By pressing and holding the home button and power button you force the iPhone to restart. This is similar to holding the power button on a Macbook or laptop or just unplugging a device from power. You’ll see this screen when you fix a frozen iPhone. You don’t need to hold the power buttons after the phone restarts. You should not lose any data doing this, but if you were typing a message, document or working on something inside of an app you may lose that small bit of work depending on when it saved. You don’t need to be plugged in to power or connected to a computer to use this method of fixing a frozen iPhone. If the battery is low, it may help to plug-in to power, but otherwise you are good to do this anytime the iPhone is frozen. Advertisement This works on any iPhone, iPad or iPod touch on any version of Apple’s software including iOS 5, iOS 6, iOS 7, iOS 8, iOS 9 and the upcoming iOS 10. Read: iOS 9 Tips and Tricks For users who consistently have this problem, it may be good to uninstall a problem app or make sure it is up to date. If you never restart your iPhone or iPad and you have this happen once or twice a year you can often avoid it by restarting you iPhone once every other week. If this is a continual problem you should consider backing up the iPhone to iCloud or your computer and then performing a factory reset. This takes longer to complete, but it can resolve problems. If you choose to to restore from an iPhone backup and the problem continues you may need to hard reset the iPhone and then set it up as a new device.

Carpool Karaoke: The Series, based on the popular segment from The Late Late Show with James Corden, will feature 16 celebrity pairings "riding along in a car together as they sing tunes from their personal playlists" and "surprise fans who don't expect to see big stars belting out tunes one lane over." Apple said the series will feature James Corden, Will Smith, Billy Eichner, Metallica, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Ariana Grande, Seth MacFarlane, Chelsea Handler, Blake Shelton, Michael Strahan, John Cena, Shaquille O’Neal, and many more. The series is expected to have a different host every episode. Apple purchased the rights to Carpool Karaoke, produced by James Corden, Ben Winston, and Eric Pankowski, in July 2016 in an effort to drive users towards Apple Music. The series will consist of 16 half-hour episodes, and Apple's version will reportedly feature a format "that is more of an interview series."Tags: Apple Music, Carpool Karaoke Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: ETonline - 2 days ago< > Embed 'Carpool Karaoke: The Series' Gets Its First Trailer -- Your First Look at the Celeb Pairings! 00:59 'Carpool Karaoke: The Series' is Apple Music's first show, and it's is jam-packed with stars.

By Zack Whittaker for London Calling | July 4, 2012 -- 14:03 GMT (07:03 PDT) | Topic: Apple HTC has won a U.K. High Court case after a judge said that the Taiwanese smartphone maker has not infringed four of Apple's European-held patents. However, Judge Christopher Floyd said that three of the four patents were invalid, according to Bloomberg.  The only patent that was ruled to be valid relates to Apple's photo-management software, but HTC did not infringe on it. The other three invalid patents relate to Apple's multi-touch software, alphabet-changing software, and the iPhone and iPad's slide-to-unlock feature. The same four patents are to be tested in a German court later this year.  Apple is fighting HTC, and Korea-based Samsung on four continents in more than a dozen countries, including the United States. As The Verge reports, the U.K. High Court ruling does not have any direct affect any other ongoing case outside the country.  The ruling comes on an ordinary working day in Britain, despite our American cousins enjoying a day off to celebrate more than 230 years away from the cruel, heartless rule of the British monarchy. It also comes only a few days after Apple saw an emergency request to U.S. International Trade Commission, which has the power to ban the import of phones to the country, to seek a U.S. Customs ban on HTC smartphones. A HTC spokesperson said: "We remain disappointed that Apple continues to favour competition in the courtroom over competition in the marketplace," but was pleased with the ruling. Apple had no additional statement beyond: "We think competition is healthy, but competitors should create their own original technology, not steal ours." Apple did not say whether or not it would appeal the decision at the U.K. Court of Appeal.

According to the data, global sales of smartphones to users totaled 432 million units during the quarter, an increase of 7 percent compared to the year before. Perhaps most notably, Q4 2016 saw Apple leapfrog Samsung to become the number 1 global smartphone vendor…. In Q4 2016, Apple sold roughly 77 million iPhones, up from 71.5 million compared to the year before. That growth pushed Apple to 17.9 percent of the smartphone market, a 2 percent increase year-over-year. Samsung, on the other hand, saw shipments fall from 83.4 million to 76.7 million, thus causing its market share to slide from 20.7 percent to 17.8 percent. It has taken eight quarters for Apple to regain the No. 1 global smartphone vendor ranking, but the positions of the two leaders have never been so close, with only 256,000 units difference. “The last time Apple was in the leading position was in the fourth quarter of 2014, when its sales were driven by its first ever large-screen iPhone 6 and 6 Plus,” said Anshul Gupta, research director at Gartner. With that in mind, here’s how the smartphone industry looks in terms of Q4 2016 market share: Apple – 17.9 percent Samsung – 17.8 percent Huawei – 9.5 percent Oppo – 6.2 percent BBK Communication Equipment – 5.6 percent For 2016 as a whole, smartphone sales totaled nearly 1.5 billion, up around 5 percent from the year before. In terms of vendors, however, Samsung reigned supreme. The company shipped 306.4 million smartphones, giving it 20.5 percent of the market. Apple shipped 216.06 million smartphones for 14.4 percent of the market. Samsung’s share is down 2 percent year-over-year, while its shipments were down roughly 14 million. Apple saw its share fall from 15.9 percent to 14.4 percent, while shipments were down 9 million units. Samsung and Apple both lost market share to up and coming Chinese manufacturers such as Huawei and Oppo, both of which saw an increase in their share year-over-year. This is a trend that has taking shape for several recent quarters. Finally, as far as operating systems are concerned, Android obviously has the lead here. Google’s operating system holds 81.7 percent of the market, down 1 percent year-over-year. iOS, however, holds 17.9 percent, which is up .2 percent compared to the year before. Read the full report below: Gartner Says Worldwide Sales of Smartphones Grew 7 Percent in the Fourth Quarter of 2016 Fierce Battle Between Apple and Samsung to Hold the No. 1 Global Smartphone Ranking Global sales of smartphones to end users totaled 432 million units in the fourth quarter of 2016, a 7 percent increase over the fourth quarter of 2015, according to Gartner, Inc. The fourth quarter of 2016 saw Apple leapfrog past Samsung to secure the No. 1 global smartphone vendor position (see Table 1). In 2016 overall, smartphone sales to end users totaled nearly 1.5 billion units, an increase of 5 percent from 2015 (see Table 2). “This is the second consecutive quarter in which Samsung has delivered falling quarterly smartphone sales,” said Anshul Gupta, research director at Gartner. “Samsung’s smartphone sales declined 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 and its share dropped by 2.9 percentage points year on year.” “Samsung’s smartphone sales started to drop in the third quarter of 2016, and the decision to discontinue the Galaxy Note 7 slowed down sales of its smartphone portfolio in the fourth quarter,” added Mr. Gupta. “The withdrawal of the Galaxy Note 7 left a gap in its large-screen phone range.” Samsung also faced growing competition in the midtier and entry-level smartphone segments from Huawei, Oppo, BBK and Gionee, which all grew their sales each quarter. Closest Quarter Ever Between Samsung and Apple It has taken eight quarters for Apple to regain the No. 1 global smartphone vendor ranking, but the positions of the two leaders have never been so close, with only 256,000 units difference. “The last time Apple was in the leading position was in the fourth quarter of 2014, when its sales were driven by its first ever large-screen iPhone 6 and 6 Plus,” said Mr. Gupta. “This time it achieved it thanks to strong sales of its flagship phones — the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus; it also benefited from the weakened demand for Samsung’s smartphones in mature markets such as North America and Western Europe, and in some mature markets in Asia such as Australia and South Korea.

Huawei’s premium smartphone offering has helped it to reduce the gap with Samsung during the fourth quarter of 2016, with a difference of 36 million units. In the same period last year, the gap between the two vendors was more than 50 million units. “Huawei is poised to reduce the gap further with the No. 2 global smartphone vendor,” said Mr. Gupta. “Mate 9 with Alexa will start shipping into the U.S. in the first quarter of 2017.” Offering high-performance, front-facing cameras and fast charging smartphones led Oppo to maintain the No. 1 positon in China during the fourth quarter of 2016. Its strong position in China and continued growth of sales in the markets outside China have helped Oppo position itself as the No. 4 smartphone vendor worldwide. BBK’s focus on quality, design and strong branding initiatives has positioned it as a strong mobile phone brand in China and India. BBK continued its hold on the No. 2 position in China and was marginally ahead of Huawei during the fourth quarter of 2016. BBK’s strong performance in India, where its sales grew by 278 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, and more than 363 percent in 2016 overall, allowed it to emerge as the No. 5 smartphone vendor worldwide. Top Chinese brands such as Oppo, BBK, Huawei, ZTE, Xiaomi and Lenovo are aggressively expanding into markets outside China, where they will continue to disrupt the top smartphone players in 2017. “Samsung needs to successfully launch the next Galaxy flagship phone in order to continue the momentum Galaxy S7 generated, and win back lost customers by launching a new large screen and stylus-equipped smartphone,” said Mr. Gupta.

In 2016 overall, Android also grew its market share by 3.2 percentage points to reach an 84.8 percent share, and was the only OS to grow market share year on year. “The entry of Google’s Pixel phone has made the premium Android smartphone offering more competitive, while the re-entry of HMD (Nokia) in the basic (midtier) smartphone category, is set to further increase the competition in emerging markets,” said Mr. Gupta.

Trump seems keen on bullying Tim Cook to open a factory in the USA without actually detailing specifics, and while Apple has stayed out of the fray so far, new comments from Apple CFO Luca Maestri indicate that Apple won’t be shutting up shop in China any time soon. Don't Miss: T-Mobile just fixed the worst problem with its unlimited plans As The Verge spotted, Maestri was speaking to a Goldman Sachs conference yesterday when he answered a question about overseas manufacturing: “One of the points that we are making in Washington is the fact that we have been a very large contributor to the US economy during the last decade,” Maestri said. “We made billions of investments in the United States. In the last 10 years, we created about 2 million jobs in this country — in the developer community in our retail stores in our call centers and through the supplier chain.” Maestri went on to talk more about Apple’s US-located call centers, and how it is “very, very difficult to speculate” on Apple’s manufacturing plans given that Trump has outlined no specific policies yet. He did, however, point out that a border tax on imported goods “would end up burdening the end consumer.” Reading between the lines, it looks like another attempt by Apple to take iPhone manufacturing off the table for discussions with Trump. Apple seems willing to move ancillary services, like support centers, back to the US, but moving the entire iPhone supply chain would be orders of magnitude more difficult. This is far from the first time that iPhone manufacturing has been in the news. Shortly after Trump’s electoral victory, Apple reportedly asked its subsidiaries to examine the feasibility of iPhone manufacturing — which caused Breitbart to run with the (untrue) story “Silicon Valley Bows to Trump: Apple to Build iPhones in America.” Trending right now: Pioneer’s new headphones solve the iPhone 7’s dumbest problem The biggest caveats in Verizon’s new ‘unlimited’ plan This tiny box lets Alexa control anything that plugs into a wall See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next The LG G6 might beat the Galaxy S8 where it matters most BGR News Unlimited Data Talk and Text Sprint®Sponsored Wristband monitors your blood alcohol content while you drink Yahoo Tech You should be excited about the iPhone 8 even if you hate the iPhone BGR News Yahoo notifies users of sophisticated breach methods AFP Make The Switch Now SpectrumSponsored The biggest caveats in Verizon’s new ‘unlimited’ plan BGR News Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo Finance

Q. Is it possible to talk with Siri on non-Apple devices? The short answer is no, Siri is a feature only available from Apple. It is the voice-controlled Intelligent Personal Assistant installed on Apple devices. Controlling devices with voice commands are hot right now, and Apple Siri has plenty of company. Microsoft has Cortana. Google has Google Voice. Samsung has Viv. Amazon has Alexa. Each has a common set of abilities, along with capabilities unique to that assistant. For example, any of them can tell you the weather, but only Siri can play content on AppleTV, and only Alexa can order products from Amazon. There is also a wide variety of devices to support these assistants. In addition to laptops, tablets, and phones, a new category of desktop device has appeared in the last year. The only one so far to get much traction is Amazon Echo, which is a line of devices ranging from $50 to $150. We are still in the early-adopter stage of desktop voice assistants, but there is an abundance of interesting developments to explore. Note that while Siri is Apple-only, most of the other assistants are available on multiple models via an app. Q. I have a small room inside my house where the light switch is in an inconvenient place. I have to awkwardly fumble around to reach it. Can home automation help? Because you mentioned “home automation,” I need to start with a warning. Home automation is a loosely defined term that includes a mix of products and services. Many of them show great promise, but they are not fully baked yet. There are incompatible standards, a device from company A is unlikely to work with a device from company B. Some vendors have gone out of business, stranding users. Often a device will solve one problem only to create two new problems. I will write about home automation in the coming months, but at the moment, my advice is to steer clear. Wait until the products mature. Now back to your light switch. When I was very young, my grandmother fell down the cellar steps because the switch inside the cellar door was in an odd place. Fortunately, she escaped with only a few bruises. It may seem like overkill for some, but I think switch placement is about safety as much as convenience, especially in homes built before modern electrical codes. I had a similar safety issue in my garage, and I solved it with the help of a licensed electrician and a wall switch with a built-in occupancy sensor. These switches sense movement in the room and turn on the power when needed. Better models include two sensors, one for motion and one for ambient light, so the light only turns on when the room is both occupied and dark. In the right situation, sensor switches are a worthwhile investment. Q. My phone’s battery no long-er lasts an entire day. The battery seems to go from 20% to empty very quickly. What can I do besides replace the phone? Try restarting the phone. A simple off-on cycle never hurts and often helps. If the problem remains, the next step is to look for an app that consumes too much power. Newer phones have a Battery Setting screen that lists which apps use the most power. With this information, you may be able to put your phone’s power consumption on a diet. When these software fixes do not work, it is time to look at hardware. Is the phone still under warranty? If the phone is old enough to be out of warranty, the battery is probably near the end of its life. Generally when a battery ages, the battery meter becomes less dependable. There are apps that reveal a phone’s battery cycle count, which is a good indicator to determine if the battery has developed a fault, or has merely been used up . If you work though the steps above and still do not have enough power, the solution is to add a bigger battery. Mophie (mophie.com) makes a line of “Juice Pack” phone cases that incorporate a battery. They come in different sizes, everything from small enough to add just a few hours to very large multi-day workhorses. A good battery case will add a few hours of usability each day, and it will add many months to the overall lifetime of the phone itself.

More videos James Packer returns to Crown board A management shake-up at Crown Resorts, after a horror run in 2016, could leave investors a little confused. Crown Resorts shares slumped 14 per cent in a single day last October when it emerged 18 of its employees were detained in a police sting covering several Chinese cities targeting allegedly illegal marketing of gambling junkets. It later revealed that VIP turnover had plunged by 45 per cent over the first 23 weeks of the December half.  The Star managed to post an incredibly strong result for the December half year, but only because it got lucky against the VIP high rollers that did show up to its gaming tables.  Related Content Packer returns to Crown board after company's horror year James Packer's annus horribilis is now complete with Crown's global retreat The Star boss, Matt Bekier, spoke of how the gaming operator went from a "freakishly bad" win rate against its high rollers previous to year to a freakishly good one last year. But after normalising its financial performance - to remove the effect of its good luck against its gambling clients - revenue and earnings were both down. This includes gambling volumes from its VIP business "following the detention of Crown Resorts employees in China in October 2016." Advertisement Bekier said it is driving the group strategy to diversify its client base away from the North Asia market.  "We are executing against our strategy of diversifying our international revenues, including the south-east Asia VIP and Asian premium mass (market). We continue to assess the north Asian VIP business as the China situation develops," said Bekier.  SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Matt Bekier, spoke of how the gaming operator went from a "freakishly bad" win rate against its high rollers previous to year to a freakishly good one last year. Photo: Dan Peled He emphasised to analysts how careful the company has become when it comes to the Chinese high rollers.  "We obviously want to be cautious because we don't have all the facts on the table now."  SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link James Packer would not have been pleased with The Star's results.  Photo: Justin Chin "At this point we are not taking any risks" and said the casino operator is "not responding to customers we don't know."  The stock rose after the market warmed to the strong top line numbers and another increase in its dividend. Group revenue increased 11 per cent to $1.23 billion, and statutory net profit was up more than 135 per cent to $141.8 million, driven largely by a near doubling in The Star's win rate against its VIP gamblers from 0.88 per cent to 1.62 per cent. It's not the sort of luck which will hold, but Bekier assured analysts the results so far this year indicate the "satisfactory growth" so far this year despite continuing disruption from its multi billion dollar refurbishment and development pipeline in Sydney and Queensland.  And while volumes from its VIP business continue to be impacted from the "trends" from late last year, the company said, but gross revenue from the remaining business increased by double digit levels compared to the prior December half.  Follow CBD on Twitter.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish iPhone 8 To Replace Touch ID With ‘Function Area’ By Tyler Lee on 02/15/2017 17:22 PST The introduction of Touch ID to the iPhone was probably one of the better ideas that Apple has had in recent years. It also kicked off a trend which saw many OEMs start to introduce similar security features as well. However it seems that Touch ID could soon be replaced on the iPhone, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. According to the latest investor note from Kuo, he claims that Apple will remove Touch ID from the bottom part of the iPhone 8. Instead Apple is expected to replace it with what he is calling a “Function area”. It is unclear as to what this function area will be for, but it has been speculated that maybe it could end up being similar to the Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pros. As to what could replace Touch ID, Kuo suggested that biometric security will still be present, but he did not detail what it could be. However previously we have heard rumors that facial/iris scanning tech could be a possibility, but do take it with a grain of salt for now. According to Kuo, the removal of Touch ID and the inclusion of the function area is expected to give the phone about 5.15-inches of usable display real estate, but the overall face of the device is apparently 5.8-inches. Kuo also claims that the iPhone 8 will pack a larger battery thanks to Apple adopting a stacked “substrate-like” PCB mainboard. Kuo has been pretty accurate with his predictions in the past, but this does seem like a pretty huge departure for Apple in terms of function and design, so like we said maybe it’s a good idea to take it with a grain of salt for now.

Reuters/Beck Diefenbach Apple MacBook Pro 2016 buyers were more or less happy with the device’s performance. However, when it came to battery performance, they were thoroughly disappointed. Consumer reports even suspended its recommendation after testing the device. The MacBook Pro 2017 device is expected to get major upgrades to its battery. Apple is said to be making a proprietary chip that can take away some of the load off the device’s Intel processor. Moreover, the macOS Sierra 10.12.3 has reportedly removes bugs that drain the battery away. According to Tech Times, there are certain MacBook Pro 2016 tips and tricks that can significantly enhance the device’s battery life. Users should use Safari, instead of any other browser, even Chrome. This is because Safari performs the best for the MacBook Pro 2016 when it comes to power usage as the program has been designed specifically to not use the AMD graphics processor. Thus, even when a user is using graphics-heavy pages such as Google Maps, it won’t drain much of the battery. Most people already know that background applications drain away a lot of battery. Background has to be cleaned at intervals to remove apps that are not being used currently. All browser tabs must be closed when not in use. If users want to extract 45-60 minutes extra usage from their Apple MacBook Pro 2016, they should watch videos only in full screen mode and also deactivate the closed captioning. Within this state, the laptop draws significantly less power. While these are the main tips to decrease Apple MacBook Pro 2016 battery drainage, CNET has also advised users to dim the screen even though the new screens are 30 percent more power efficient. Apple has shrunk the battery size from 95.5 watt-hours of capacity for the 2015 15-inch MacBook Pro to 76 watt-hours for the 2016 15-inch MacBook Pro. Users must also be aware of the USB devices they are using. These devices fire up the laptop’s communication system that otherwise snooze in a low-power state. Apple MacBook Pro 2016 users should always unplug dongles once they are done with their work. The new USB-C ports are amazing only when one has the right cables and peripherals. The Apple MacBook Pro 2017 is a highly-anticipated device that may come with an Intel Kaby Lake processor and QHD+ Display that may significantly improve battery life.

"Facebook could easily become the world's largest entertainment company, one that is worthy of a far higher multiple than it gets," the "Mad Money" host said. The same goes for Apple, Cramer said. Analysts who tell the story of Apple are looking at it as if it is some sort of dead end of innovation. Yet they are forgetting that the iPhone device has a steady built-in stream of revenue that continues to grow. Cramer found this to be reminiscent of Gillette, with users paying a fortune for razors over the span of their lifetime. Hence, Trian, the investment firm run by Nelson Peltz, announced a hefty stake in Proctor & Gamble. "If we looked at Apple through the same lens as Gillette, it might very well be the best stock a man can get," Cramer said. Rafael Marchante | Reuters Cramer is sick and tired of investors doubting that the stock market could really power higher. It is the real deal, he said, and he decided to prove it. "It is one of the oldest theories when it comes to stocks that the transports have to confirm the strength in the Dow industrials before you can trust a rally … that is exactly what is happening," Cramer said. The theory of transports pertains to the notion that the transports group must make a new high at the same time as the Dow for the market to have solid grounding. Copper is often used as a barometer for the health of the global economy. Naturally, Jim Cramer's interest was naturally piqued when the red metal made a big breakout to the upside recently. "Copper's strength is part of the traditional metrics that define economic growth and it can be a part of the rational justification for what so many believe is an irrational rally," Cramer said. When demand for copper increases, that means industrial activity is on the rise because copper is used to make a wide array of things from new factories, to new houses and automobiles. However, Cramer did note that he doesn't know if demand has increased because there have been major production cuts, which could signal the jump is supply driven rather than due to stronger demand. Most investors probably don't associate General Electric with technology, but CEO Jeff Immelt is now wagering a bet that it can become a top 10 software company by 2020. "The proof of the pudding is reality. Our orders are growing 25 percent a year. We are kind of first among equals in the industrial internet. We can play. We can do this," Immelt said. When GE began investing in technology, Immelt said he didn't do so with the notion that it had to become a software company. Instead, the industrial assets that the company sells are surrounded by sensors and produce a massive amount of data. It was simply an investment to protect its installed base. Cramer also got the take of the future of digital from Adobe Systems' CEO Shantanu Narayen. Adobe is the leading maker of digital media and marketing software. Adobe has steadily transformed itself in the last few years into more of a cloud computing play. The company also made strides to enter the red-hot field of artificial intelligence with Sensei, its AI platform that uses machine learning to help computers match images and understand both the meaning and sentiment of documents. Narayen told Cramer that the future of video also could mean more monetization of the content. "There is more content that is out there than there has ever been before, and this revival of content when coupled with the appropriate advertising — that is going to be the business model that evolves on the web," Narayan said.

The 3D sensor that’s expected to be on the iPhone 8 may actually be for facial scanning, not augmented reality. By Emily Bary Feb. 15, 2017 5:31 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large When the iPhone 8 comes out in the fall, TouchID may go the way of the headphone jack. Illustration: Getty Images Apple shares keep heading higher, and that’s brought the iPhone rumor mill out in full force. The buzz lately is that Apple will make augmented reality the big selling point of its next iPhone. But one analyst thinks the masses have been misinterpreting signs from supply channels -- the collection of companies that make parts for the iPhone. The rationale behind the AR theory is that supplier hubbub indicates Apple will introduce 3D laser scanning on one or more of its upcoming phones. 3D sensing can be used to enable AR, a technology that allows people to overlay virtual items over their real-life surroundings. That might be the goal for Apple down the line, but JPMorgan’s Rod Hall thinks 3D sensing will serve an arguably less exciting role in the iPhone 8: facial recognition. The new iPhone is expected to have an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen from edge to edge, meaning there would be no place for the current TouchID home button. Instead, you’d unlock your phone just by looking at it, he predicts. More from Barron’s Next Apple Takes a Page from Amazon’s Playbook What’s Apple to Do with $246 Billion in Cash? Under Armour’s Worst Days Could Be Behind It When to Buy Airline Tickets to Get The Cheapest Fare Facial recognition would make it easier to unlock your phone in the rain, since TouchID fails with wet fingers. And it might get more people to use Apple Pay, Hall wrote in a research note Tuesday. (It’s not clear to us, though, that security or ease of use are really what’s holding people back from using Apple Pay). While CEO Tim Cook spoke exuberantly about the merits of AR earlier this week, he did say that the technology has a bit of a ways to go before it’s ready for everyone. While there’s some speculation that not all of Apple’s new phones will have every new feature, Hall thinks that facial scanning could come to everyone. Many analysts predict that Apple will come out with three iPhones this fall: slightly better versions of the current 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models, plus a fancier phone that’s even larger. That supersized phone may be the only one to feature an OLED screen, but the facial scanning could get broader use. Hall wrote that “supplier indications suggest more unit volume than inclusion on just the 5.85-inch OLED phone.” Big Picture: While AR is rumored to be the big new iPhone feature this year, one analyst says we may get facial recognition instead.

From regulations, to taxation policy, to international posturing, to the fact that Apple is worth almost US$700 billion, Apple can’t avoid politics. More importantly, the broader tech world itself that it increasingly intersects with tech. I think I spewed off about getting older and struggling to understand Millennials, too. It’s all kind of hazy, but that didn’t stop Chuck from making that part of his title…oh, and check out that key frame he picked.

Fretting that the general public will explode themselves by puncturing batteries is ridiculous. This is about greed and forcing customers to buy new hardware. Even if right to repair is enacted, anyone who wants to can still take their broken device to an Apple Store and have it done right – assuming the device is supported. All right to repair will do is allow alternatives to people who may not live within 15 minutes of an Apple store. If others might wish to try the repair themselves or take the device to a different tech, what business is it of yours? None. Thanks for looking out for our safety, but we all already have a mommy. Apple would probably sell the parts at a price so inflated that repair will be impractical. February 15, 2017 at 7:15 EST PM Hagen February 15, 2017 Apple would seem rather peripheral to this fight, since the core appears to be the American Farm Bureau Federation vs. John Deere over the right to repair farm tractors and harvesters. It’s true, though, that such legislation would likely sweep across many different sectors, including cars, phones, computers, and other consumer items. If Apple (and others) end up being required to supply parts and service manuals, will there also be requirements that they be sold at a fair price?

Apple has been testing BOE’s active-matrix organic light-emitting diode screens for months but hasn’t decided if it will add the Chinese company to its roster of suppliers, one of the people said, asking not to be named talking about private negotiations. BOE, one of the country’s largest screen makers, is spending close to $14.5 billion building two plants in the southwestern province of Sichuan in anticipation of future business. Talks are at an early stage and it’s unlikely to supply the next iPhone, but BOE is banking on outfitting the one in 2018 or later, the person said. If BOE is selected for OLED, it will become the first known future supplier of the next-generation screens to Apple outside of South Korea and Japan — a triumph for a Beijing company best known for computer and TV displays. The U.S. company is exploring alternatives to address a global shortage of OLED displays as it prepares to adopt the sharper, more power-efficient technology for its next iPhones, catching up with rivals such as Samsung and Huawei Technologies. Apple declined to comment, and BOE declined to comment on talks with customers. The display is one of the most expensive components of a smartphone. OLED screens are more difficult to produce, making Apple beholden to suppliers still working to manufacture the displays in mass quantities. The world’s four biggest suppliers of smartphone displays — Samsung Display Co., Sharp Corp., LG Display Co. and Japan Display Inc. — are said to have insufficient capacity to equip all new iPhones this year, a constraint that may persist into 2018. That means Apple may be forced to adopt OLED in just a single version of its device this year, the 10th anniversary of the phone’s debut.

The cash deal was announced Wednesday. Walmart says Moosejaw, which is largely online and sells more than 400 brands, will keep operating its site and stores. Its 350-plus employees will stay in Michigan. Walmart, which is trying to better compete with Amazon.com, says buying Moosejaw gives it the experience of another well-established e-commerce company with strong industry relationships. Walmart also purchased marketplace Jet.com last year for $3 billion in cash plus $300 million in stock. Walmart’s online sales had been slowing over the past two years but notably accelerated during last year’s third quarter. It reports its fourth-quarter results next week. Economy Consumer prices jump U.S. consumer prices rose in January at the fastest pace in nearly four years, strengthening the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. The Labor Department said Wednesday that consumer prices rose 0.6 percent last month, the most since February 2013 and twice what economists were expecting. A 7.8 percent jump in gasoline prices accounted for almost half the increase. Stripping out volatile food and energy prices, consumer inflation rose 0.3 percent. Food prices rose in January for the first time in seven months. Grocery prices were unchanged, but the cost of eating out rose 0.4 percent. The price of clothing, new cars, auto insurance and air fares all rose by 0.8 percent or more in January. Overall, consumer prices rose 2.5 percent from a year earlier, the most since March 2012. Core inflation rose 2.3 percent over the last 12 months. Construction Home builders less confident Home builders are feeling a bit less confident this month, reflecting a dimmer outlook on sales in the months ahead and fewer would-be buyers dropping by builders’ sales offices. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo builder sentiment index released Wednesday fell to 65 this month. That’s down two points from a revised reading of 67 in January. Readings above 50 indicate more builders view sales conditions as good rather than poor. The index has been above 60 since September and reached the highest level in 11 years in December.

This feature is possible due to the near bezel-less design of the iPhone 8 and subsequent bump in screen size to 5.8-inch. The function area is said to be located in the same area as the current Home button and will thus replace Touch ID. Kuo notes, however, that Apple plans to make up for the lack of Touch ID with new biometric technologies that will be able to securely offer similar functionalities as Touch ID. While Kuo doesn’t dive into specifics, features such as facial recognition have been rumored before. Kuo’s latest report also offers more details on size. With the new function area housing virtual buttons and other actions, Kuo says that the usable display real estate will be around 5.15-inches. The overall face of the device is expected to be 5.8-inches, though. It’s unclear what exact will be housed in the “function area,” but it is likely that it will be some sort of virtual buttons and quick actions, perhaps similar to the Touch Bar on the MacBook Pro. The most apparent change of the OLED iPhone will be a full-screen design, along with the elimination of the Home button and current fingerprint recognition technology. Of particular note is that we expect the OLED iPhone will adopt a 5.8” physical OLED panel. But the actual display area will be around 5.15”, and the rest will be an area for functions (e.g. allocation of virtual buttons). Earlier this week, Kuo issued a note claiming that the 5.8-inch OLED iPhone 8 would be similar in size to the current 4.7-inch model, while also including a much bigger battery. From our report on Monday: KGI says the dramatic increase in battery capacity is made possible by Apple adopting a stacked ‘substrate-like’ PCB mainboard. By making the board smaller, more space inside the device is available for battery chemistry. This is shown by the larger blue area in the diagram, provided by KGI research. It has been rumored that the iPhone 8 will cost as much as $1000, a price that is higher than the current top of the line iPhone 7 Plus, but isn’t as crazy as it may sound on the surface. Other rumored features include an all-glass design, ‘wireless’ charging, and much more. In another report today, KGI also explained that the iPhone 8 will be “the only bright spot among the new iPhone lineup” this year. Kuo predicts that momentum form the refresh will continue into Chinese New Year of 2018. For all of the details concerning the new iPhone 8, head to our continuously updated guide.

Exactly how Apple plans on implementing the technology into their products still remains something of a mystery, although recent rumors have suggested that it could find its way into the iPhone 8. Now thanks to Rod Hall from investment firm J.P. Morgan, he is backing up those rumors with a report of his own. According to Hall, he claims that Apple is expected to introduce a 3D laser scanning module to the iPhone 8. This module is expected to be used for facial scanning, as well possible AR use in the future. The 3D laser scanner is said to possibly replace Touch ID as a security tool for logging into one’s iPhone. Touch ID at the moment is said to have a 1 in 50,000 error rate, but apparently this laser scanning module will be far more accurate even at its earliest implementations. This is actually not the first time that we’ve heard that Apple could be looking to replace Touch ID with a different security tool, although previously we had heard that it might be an iris scanner, not a facial scanner. In any case take it with a grain of salt for now, but this year’s iPhone rumors are certainly all over the place, more so than usual. It’s hard to tell which will be the real deal and which are simply guesses/predictions, so maybe try not to get your hopes up just yet. Filed in Apple >Cellphones >Rumors.

But Carlos Santana, 69, revealed he was fully behind The Recording Academy's decision, as he reasoned that Adele was a far better singer, and that Beyoncé was more like a 'model', the Daily Mail reports. Carlos - who has won 10 Grammy Awards in his time - was forced to apologize for his claim on Wednesday, reiterating that he had the “utmost respect” for the pregnant star.  Issuing his retraction via Facebook, Carlos wrote: “I would like to clarify a comment that was reported when I was doing an interview for some upcoming shows in Australia & New Zealand.  “My intent was to congratulate Adele on her amazing night at the Grammies. My comment about Beyoncé was regretfully taken out of context. “I have the utmost respect for her as an artist and a person. She deserves all the accolades that come her way. I wish Beyoncé and her family all the best.” His comments were originally made to the Australian Associated Press,  when the Maria Maria singer said: “I think that Adele won because she can sing, sing. With all respect to our sister Beyoncé.”   He added: “Beyoncé is very beautiful to look at and it’s more like modeling kind of music—music to model a dress—she’s not a singer, singer, with all respect to her.”   Tweet LATEST NEWS • All Today news 12:56 • 16/02 Government embarks on Clean Armenia project 12:48 • 16/02 Catholic Church paid A$276m to abuse victims in Australia 12:23 • 16/02 Turkish-Armenian photographer to open 2017 Nuremberg festival 11:54 • 16/02 Armenian cabinet approves date of Yerevan municipality election   11:42 • 16/02 Apple car tops consumer wish list for iPhone maker 11:26 • 16/02 'I have the utmost respect for her': Carlos Santana apologises after claiming Adele scooped Grammy because Beyonce is 'beautiful to look at but not a singer' 11:13 • 16/02 Armenian civil society concerned over OSCE mission’s possible closure 10:35 • 16/02 Armenian Caucus urges Trump to properly commemorate Genocide 10:11 • 16/02 FBI documents detail 1970 ‘racial discrimination’ by Trump 09:56 • 16/02 Verizon close to $250-350 m Yahoo deal 09:51 • 16/02 Nagorno-Karabakh reports more Azerbaijani ceasefire violations 09:42 • 16/02 Greece backs Karabakh settlement – ambassador 09:03 • 16/02 Azerbaijan unlikely to repeat April war scenario – Armenian analyst 08:30 • 16/02 Venezuela bans CNN after Iraq passport fraud report 08:13 • 16/02 Trump relaxes policy on Middle East two-state solution 19:47 • 15/02 Armenian-German economic forum presents Armenia’s economic environment to German companies 19:26 • 15/02 Kurdish conference takes place in Moscow 19:00 • 15/02 Lufthansa agrees pay deal with pilot union 18:14 • 15/02 Russia denies breaking treaty after alleged missile deployment 18:02 • 15/02 Armenia’s defense minister, Bulgarian ambassador discuss military cooperation 17:19 • 15/02 Eurovision 2017: Organising team quits en masse 16:44 • 15/02 Situation relatively calm in border zone – Defense Ministry spokesperson 16:30 • 15/02 Azerbaijan sends Talysh boys to slaughterhouse -

McIntyre February 15, 2017 6:35 am EST Print Email Tweet Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares were not supposed to pass the all-time high they hit in May 2015, when the stock traded just above $136. Monday, it topped that figure, due to good earnings and excitement about the iPhone 8. If Apple can have a spectacular launch of the new smartphone, and it can pick up its critical market share in China, it could surge beyond its current market cap of over $708 billion. The move from $700 billion to $1 trillion would be smaller on a percentage basis than the move Apple’s shares made from last May, when they dropped to a 52-week low of less than $90. It took several rounds of earnings for the stock to rise 52% over the period to its current level. And, if anything, worries about China have dragged on the shares over that entire period. That has to change. CEO Tim Cook has said repeatedly that China is one of the most critical keys to the company’s fortunes. To offset troubled sales, Cook has made visits to senior Chinese officials. He has pledged to reduce carbon emissions from factories that build iPhone parts there. Apple even has invested in the Chinese version of Uber, a $1 billion commitment to Didi Chuxing. Cook also has said that China will one day pass the United States as Apple’s largest market. However, the latest data from the carefully followed IDC Quarterly Smartphone Tracker shows a drop in Apple’s China market share in the fourth quarter of 2016: 2016 was the first time that Apple saw a year-over-year decline in the China market. Even though the new black-colored iPhones caught the attention of consumers, overall, the new iPhone 7 did not create as much of a frenzy compared to the past. Despite the decline, IDC does not believe Chinese vendors have actually eaten away Apple’s market share. Most Apple users are expected to be holding out for the new iPhone that will be launched this year, and that will help the brand to see growth in 2017. Apple’s 10-year anniversary iPhone will also likely attract some of the high-end Android users in China to convert to an iPhone. Apple needs to take sales from local companies, particularly OPPO, Huawei and Vivo. That will be hard. In its most recently reported quarter, Apple’s Greater China sales dropped 12% from the same quarter the year before to $16.2 billion. Sales in the Americas, mostly the United States, were $32 billion, up 9% over the same period. The China trouble may indeed be cured by the iPhone 8, which is the only catalyst that could drive Apple shares much higher. And many of the legion of people and organizations that watch Apple every minute say that the iPhone 8 will be a quantum leap over the iPhone 7. In the past, new versions of the iPhone have been considered modest upgrades to their predecessors. One of the most well-known Apple-centric websites, MacRumors, posted its rumors about the iPhone 8: Rumors suggest it’s going to be a radical redesign, with an edge-to-edge display that does away with the top and bottom bezels where features like the Touch ID fingerprint sensor and the front-facing camera are housed. Instead, Touch ID and the camera may be built directly into the display, meaning there will be no Home button. Jony Ive has wanted to introduce an iPhone that looks like a single sheet of glass for several years, and glass is also necessary if Apple wants to introduce wireless charging. Ive is Apple’s design chief and a long-time partner to founder Steve Jobs. The last time there was wild excitement about an iPhone version is when Jobs launched the first one 10 years ago. It was a major relaunch of what was then a modest-sized consumer electronics company. If Cook can come close to that with the iPhone 8, Apple’s shares may well surge enough to reach a market cap of $1 trillion.

The Beijing-based company remains the world's largest PC maker, but has been trying to broaden its smartphone business as the market for personal computers fizzles. But it has struggled to keep pace with Apple and Android rivals. Shares in Lenovo Group were down more than five percent at HK$4.95 ($0.64) in early afternoon trading. Net profits fell by 67 percent year-on-year to US$98 million in the third quarter, the company said in a statement. That came in well short of analysts' estimates by Bloomberg which on average predicted profits of $145.9million. Revenues were also down six percent compared with a year earlier. "Lenovo faced sizeable challenges in its three main lines of business, namely data centre, mobile devices, and PCs and smart devices," the firm said. The company is battling as consumers opt for smartphones instead of PCs. Rising component prices are also weighing on profits. Sales of the firm's Moto and Lenovo branded phones slipped 23 percent year-on-year in the three months to December. Its data centre business, which includes servers, storage, software and services also took a 20 percent dive in sales compared with the previous year. However, Lenovo's PC and smart device business, which includes tablets, still saw sales gains of two percent year on year. That was spurred by strong growth in North America, the company said. US firms HP and Dell follow Lenovo as leaders in the global PC market. All three increased their share of the market in the final quarter of last year, according to industry trackers. Lenovo announced in January that it is launching a "Smart Assistant" which recognises user's voices to conduct tasks including web searches and playing music. The firm is also in talks over a potential merger with Japan's struggling PC maker Fujitsu. 16 Feb 2017 Previous Back to summary Next Newsletter AFP Subscribe to our newsletter AFP's worldwide network The global network of Agence France Presse covers 150 countries Find out more Find out more Contact us If you have news to share or a question, comment or suggestion, contact us via...

Philip Hammond, the chancellor, announced that British government would take an active role in supporting research and development, a departure from the stance taken by his more laissez-faire predecessors. In November’s Autumn Statement, Mr Hammond provided more detail: a new National Productivity Investment Fund will inject £4.7bn extra into R&D between 2017 and 2021. It is the largest increase in R&D investment since the Labour government of the late 1970s. The UK government is no longer the outlier among European nations in keeping its market interventions minimal and its regulations as light touch as possible. The government has also included this investment in its broader industrial strategy, which is being designed to help businesses cope after Britain’s departure from the EU. The change is a positive step after years of real-terms reductions in government R&D spending, says Professor Sir Keith Burnett, vice-chancellor of Sheffield university and president of the UK Science Council. He wants the government to articulate an even stronger sense of “national purpose” for research, otherwise “you’re never going to get citizens wanting to pay for it”. The importance of governments in driving a nation’s scientific and technological achievements were outlined most clearly in the 2013 book The Entrepreneurial State by Mariana Mazzucato of Sussex university. In it, Prof Mazzucato traced the role the US government had played in creating Apple’s iPhone. Without undermining the creative genius of Steve Jobs or the supply chain mastery of his successor Tim Cook, Prof Mazzucato found that almost every piece of technology in the ubiquitous smartphone had its origin in a government programme, dispelling the myth that the success of Silicon Valley was largely the work of eccentric entrepreneurs tinkering in their garages and savvy investments made by venture capitalists. Apple’s voice-activated personal assistant software Siri, the microprocessor and the micro hard-drive all had their origins in research by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa), run by the Department of Defense; the multi-touch screen was developed by the CIA and Darpa; GPS, found on most smartphones, was a technology originally created by Darpa and the US Navy. It was the patient investment of government that made today’s digital revolution reality. Prof Mazzucato says: “In almost every sector from IT to biotech, nano tech and clean tech, it has been the US government that has led the way investing in key areas across the innovation chain.” The UK has had its own science successes over the decades — from the discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA to genetic fingerprinting and to the sophisticated lasers that made CDs and DVDs play. But when it comes to government funding, the UK lags behind peers almost everywhere. Government spending on research and development in the UK has been on a downward trend, falling from 0.56 per cent of GDP in 2009 to 0.49 per cent of GDP in 2013, according to figures compiled by the Campaign for Science & Engineering (Case). The average in OECD countries in 2012 was 0.7 per cent of GDP, while the EU average was 0.64 per cent. Mr Hammond’s promise to increase funding was welcomed by the scientific community. However, Naomi Weir, deputy director of Case, says that many questions remain about access to EU programmes and networks after Brexit and the extra cash “takes us about a quarter of the way” towards the 3 per cent of GDP Case believes the government should be devoting to R&D. Jonathan Haskel, a professor of economics at Imperial College Business School in London, says UK science has been “pretty cheap”, and has resulted not only in taking research out of the lab and into the market, but in lifting overall productivity in the private sector. Related article Brexit: An experiment full of risk for British science Can the UK craft new policies to keep its lead in research and development? Thursday, 16 February, 2017 Despite some fears in the business world that such public investments might “crowd out” private ones, Prof Haskel says that the opposite tends to happen, with public money attracting further investment from companies. One place where the government and academia work closely with the private sector is at Sheffield university’s Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre, where Boeing, Rolls-Royce and other companies have clustered to develop sophisticated materials and manufacturing processes. It is one of seven such centres in the UK which, Sheffield university’s Sir Keith says, “create an intimate relationship” between government and business. At the same time, Sir Keith says that another form of state-driven strategic investment has been lost, as the sale of state-owned businesses — such as airports and the nuclear industry — has made co-ordinated national R&D investments more difficult. “We have broken up our strategic resources so it is tricky to build back a strategic plan.” Sample the FT’s top stories for a week You select the topic, we deliver the news.

According to The Wall Street Journal, the upcoming and highly anticipated iPhone 8 is rumored to sport a 5.8-inch (2800x1241) OLED screen. Unfortunately, as far as concrete evidence goes, there is not much else to go on. With a reportedly new form factor and design, how exactly will Apple compensate for such a radical diversion from previous iterations, especially if the company is to ditch the home button and Touch ID? Well, we may finally have a potential answer, one that several designers and concept artists have been clambering for since the launch of the 2016 MacBook Pro, such as the above concept video. According to reputable Apple analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple's upcoming iPhone 8 will adopt a new "function area" at the bottom of the display, made possible by the bump in the display size. The feature will operate similarly to virtual onscreen buttons but could be much more dynamic and adaptive. Additionally, Kuo believes Touch ID will be incorporated into the area using new biometric technologies, though it is not clear what those technologies may be. While you should take the new report with a grain of salt, perhaps two grains, it is not a far cry from, and perhaps reminiscent of the Touch Bar introduced in the 2016 MacBook Pro. If not to bring familiarity and implement design consistency, how would you like to see this feature utilized within iOS?

But unlike those cables, the phones are worth money. If you’re buying a new smartphone, the best thing to do with the old one could be to sell it or trade it in. If you have an iPhone, you can do this through the Apple website. And you can trade in any type of used smartphone at retailers, including Best Buy, or through the carrier where you’re buying a new phone. Here’s what you need to know. (Check out our advice on buying a used smartphone.) Popular Searches Ralph Lauren Corp RL ▼ 79.17 -0.32 -0.40% Michael Kors Holdings Ltd KORS ▼ 38.05 -0.05 -0.13% Sanderson Farms Inc SAFM ▲ 93.83 +0.82 +0.88% Tyson Foods Inc TSN ▲ 65.33 +0.33 +0.51% Selling to a Retailer A number of retailers and websites buy used phones, with the price you'll get varying widely.  For instance, Gazelle.com quoted me $160 for my iPhone 6 Plus, and BestBuy.com’s Trade-In program estimated I'd get $200. In the end, it costs nothing to price a phone, and it’s certainly educational, so approach a few potential buyers. Other retailers with trade-in programs include Amazon and Apple. Additionally, ecoATM kiosks around the country will scan your used smartphone and buy it on the spot.  Finding an Individual Buyer You might be able to squeeze an additional $50 or $100 out of a used smartphone by selling it yourself on eBay or a similar site. But a smartphone is more complicated to list for sale than most of the other used items you see on such sites. You’ll have to post quite a bit of information. In addition to the model name, list the carrier you used the phone with, storage capacities, camera resolution, display size, and other common specs. Also include the manufacturer part number (usually a string of letters and numbers, such as MG4W2LL/A for an AT&T iPhone 6). Also, make sure the phone is unlocked. Most phones are locked to the carrier’s network and to the account of the first owner. The carrier needs to unlock the phone, but it will do that only if you've met the terms of the contract or paid off the phone. Carriers won't unlock any phone that has been reported lost or stolen. Deleting Your Data It's important to wipe the slate clean. Whether you're selling a used smartphone or trading it in, you should first clear off all your personal information. A factory data reset should remove photos, email, apps, and so on that you don’t want to fall into other hands. On Android phones, you'll usually find the Reset option under Backup in the Settings menu. (Android features vary somewhat from one phone brand and carrier to the next.) On an iPhone, open Settings, then General to find the Reset control. You'll also have an additional task. Most iPhones (those running iOS 7 or later) have an anti-theft feature called Activation Lock that ties the phone to a specific Apple ID. To release your iPhone so that another person can use it, log into your iCloud account, select All Devices, then choose the phone to be removed. From there, simply follow the prompts. Trading In Your Phone Cellular providers often take trade-ins to lure phone customers away from one another. Just don’t expect to get anything close to what you originally paid. For example, Verizon recently offered me $165 toward a new phone in exchange for my gold-colored, 64GB iPhone 6 Plus from AT&T, which originally cost me $700. Sprint offered just $75.

By Ariel Elkin February 15, 2017 Using Android Studio? Download our Handy Cheat Sheet of Keyboard Shortcuts!Send Me This Cheat Sheet! If you haven’t heard that Apple is launching a TV show about app-making, then, I wonder… which planet you’re living on? The trailer for the new show promises the following: In every episode, app developers work to earn millions of dollars in venture capital investment. It begins with a pitch to four of the world’s most culturally influential entrepreneurs. […]. It all leads to a final pitch with one of the hottest venture capital firms on the planet. The developer community’s reception, so far, has been negative. Rock Star Developer and maker of Instaper Marco Arment tweeted: I’m sure Planet of the Apps will be a great show for all of those people who bug developers with their awful ideas. But actual developers… Well, this likely has about as much relevance to reality as most “reality” shows. Aside from the fact that judging a show purely by its trailer is, shall we say, unwordly, I say: Think different, content-creation is an avenue that Apple has much exploration to do in, and they have the resources required for it (visibility, money, domain knowledge, and talent). Consider this an experiment. Worst case scenario; mobile apps gain more visibility. Best case scenario? The perceived value of apps and your job becomes higher. You’d be automatically promoted from Rock Star to Rock Legend. There is indeed a gap for TV shows that portray the daily life of app-makers. As a result, we’ve all encountered those myths about app-making: everyone is a millionaire, apps can be made in just 2 days, by a one-man-army, by someone with a 5-foot long beard and a punk rock t-shirt. Just as Dragons’ Den gave the public a glimpse into the life and tasks of entrepreneurs, or Gordon Ramsay’s Hell’s Kitchen told stories of what goes on inside restaurants’ kitchens, Planet of the Apps will show people a path to making apps. The reality show path to making apps. Agreed, it’s not a typical path. So what? It’ll be interesting to hear the judges’ criteria for judging pitches and developers. It’ll be interesting to see how different contestants handle stress. It’ll be valuable to compare our tribulations to theirs. I’m betting that the producers will be clever enough to prevent making it look like what it definitely is not: a walk in the park. Pitches will be rejected. Contestants will be rejected. There will be a handful of winners and a pile of losers, and it won’t be fair. Just like in the App Store. So don’t judge Planet of the Apps with the criteria you’d judge a WWDC session video. This is a reality show that intends to entertain you while showing you how apps can be made. And I’m looking forward to it!

Join For Free If you’ve made a resolution list for your business this year, localization should be on it. More specifically, mobile app localization. Why? Because the app market is experiencing explosive growth. The number of mobile subscribers globally is close to 4.77 billion in 2017 — and they’re becoming more demanding. With millions of apps available, users won’t bother downloading your English app if there’s a local version available. Android localization or iOS localization have become essential. Faced with so many different choices, mobile users are no longer held hostage to the few apps that came with their operating system. They don’t need to book a regular flight, stay in a standard hotel, or call a taxi to take them to the airport. There’s an app that pretty much covers everything and customizes the experience for them. According to KPCB mobile technology trends, we’re now way beyond the tipping point of internet usage. That means that people spend more time on their mobile devices than their desktops. Significantly more, in fact, at 51% and 42% respectively. Add to that statistic that 90% of that surfing time is spent within apps, and it’s pretty clear. Apps are shaping the future, and it’s a worldwide tendency. The majority of anyone old enough to hold a mobile device has one in their hands. But how do you make your app popular around the world in different markets with varying tastes? Mobile App Localization Is Essential Recent data shows that there are currently 2.2 million apps available for iOS operating systems and the number is even higher for Android. But remember, not all apps are created equal. If you have a successful app in your home market, you’ll already know about the importance of user experience. You’ll know how to select your icon, interfaces, colors, popup messages and payment platform. And then optimize your titles and descriptions for the app store with strategic ASO. And if you want your app to be a global success, you’re going to have to localize it for different audiences worldwide. Which means you’ll need to study the market you want to launch in and ask yourself a few questions. How big is the potential demand? What are consumer purchasing preferences like? What language do they speak and what currency do they use? Does their geographic region affect buying behavior? Is their culture similar to yours? Do they have different legislation? Ideals and beliefs? The Common Sense Advisory found that 75% of foreign language speakers prefer to buy products online and in apps in their own language. So, if your idea is to roll out your mobile app across the world in English, let me stop you in your tracks. Not only will it not be the raging hit you’re hoping for, but it will also not get seen in the App Store. Why? Because even if you make the (incorrect) sweeping assumption that most of the world speaks English, they won’t be searching for an app in English. Local Language for Local People Let me explain. If a French lady wants to lose weight, she’ll be searching for weight loss apps in French, not English. If a Russian man wants to buy a hat, he won’t search the same way as your home market users. Optimizing your texts for app stores is all part of the app localization process. It’s essential if you want to get seen. But before you think you can get away with merely optimizing your app description and meta data – think again. If your app fails to meet expectations, it will be deleted faster than it was downloaded. 90% of apps, in fact, are deleted within 30 days of download. And only 16% of consumers will try an app again — which means you never get a second chance to create a first impression. (Well, not much of one.) Why iOS Localization? Now let’s get down to the nitty-gritty. If you’re ready to start the app localization process, how do you decide whether to localize for Android or iOS? Why should focus on iOS localization? In an ideal world, you’ll carry out your mobile app localization for both platforms. You’ll share data between iOS and Android and corner the market of smartphone users globally. But since we don’t live in an ideal world, you may find yourself faced with a little stumbling block called a budget. Sometimes you’ll have a team of developers who prefer iOS to Android. Maybe you have a personal preference for it, or your research tells you that more of your customer base uses iOS devices. Whatever the situation, there are several good arguments for focusing on iOS localization. Let’s check them out… iOS Localization Is Easier If you’re on a budget or time crunch, iOS localization is a lot easier. OK, so it’s always wise to prepare your app for localization for both platforms from the start, to avoid unnecessary hassles later on. If you create your strings only for your iOS app, all your careful preparation will be useless later on, when you want to use the files for Android. So, localize for iOS, but don’t close the door on Android. But, Apple’s latest update, iOS 10, was practically designed with localization in mind. With at least five massive updates that make localizing for iOS even easier: The Keyboard Is Multilingual This is awesome news for developers and users alike, as iOS 10 lets you use a multilingual keyboard. Instead of having to change languages using the globe icon, you can type straight into the keyboard in any of the languages you selected in your settings. You will automatically get the relevant autocorrect function for the language you type in. Pretty neat, hey? Localized Number Pads As you know by now, mobile app localization goes way beyond just words. Units of measurements and numbers are important too. With iOS 10, the number pads are now localized as well. This is great for phone numbers, credit card numbers, and IP addresses. Just use UIKeyboardTypeASCIICapableNumberPad as the keyboard type and the rest is easy. iOS 10 Loads the Right Language for the Right User Localization is a complex process. If you only had to deal with the major different languages, like Spanish, French and German, it would be a piece of cake. But languages vary from region to region. British English is not the same as American English. Castilian Spanish varies from the Colombian dialect. They have different spellings, grammar and vocabulary. But, thanks to Apple’s latest update, you don’t have to worry about localizing your app into hundreds of thousands of languages variations. The latest preferredLocalizations bundle from iOS helps ensure that you deliver the best possible localized version to your users. How? Imagine you have an English-Speaking user in India and your app isn’t localized into Indian English. Apple’s bundle will recognize that your user prefers Indian English but that you don’t have it available. It will then deliver the next best option, which in this case, would be British English. Not only does this speed up your iOS localization process, but it reduces the cost of localizing for thousands of different regional variations. XCode 8 Updates The latest updates to XCode 8 work like a safety net to catch you from making errors during your iOS localization. There are two new settings in XCode 8, called static analyzer settings. You can work more easily and be notified if any information is missing. Turn on the “Missing Localizability” setting, and if you forget to use your NSLocalizedString, you’ll be alerted with a warning. Similarly, as the name suggests, with the “Missing Localization Context Comment,” you’ll be notified if any comments are missing. Any better and Apple will do the job for you! Improved Formatters Oftentimes, formatters like date, weights, times, etc. can cause the greatest problems when localizing. For example, the Chinese date format is year-month-day. So, when you have your formatters correct in your base language, using a fixed format, this can cause hiccups when it comes to another language. This will result in measurements and dates looking strange and being displayed incorrectly. Fortunately, with the iOS 10 update, their formatters allow for automatic adjustments so that your iOS localization won’t mess up your user interface. Use the setLocalizedDate format for times and dates. It will localize your formats according to the language you are converting to. You can also use the NSMeasurementFormatter to cover your bases with weights and measurements, from kilometers to energy and pressure. iOS Users Spend More Money Beyond the new updates for iOS 10, if you want further reasons to focus on iOS localization, your users have more purchasing power. Of course, you’ll need to analyze the market for the countries you plan on launching in. Just as you spend time researching your buyer personas at home, find out who your international ones are. Correctly targeting your iOS localization campaign is essential. If you’ve identified a potential demand for your product or service and know how to craft a message to your audience, your chances of engagement will be higher. When you get higher engagement and positive reviews, your downloads will increase and your ranking in the App Store will rise. Think about it this way. If your app requires a fee to download or an ongoing subscription payment, studies have proven that iOS users have greater purchasing power in general. There may be more Android mobile devices globally, but Apple users are very loyal and more willing to spend money on your services. iOS Apps Earn More Revenue You only have to glance at the Android and iOS revenue models to know which one belongs to Google and which is Apple’s. In the Android platform, there is a much greater percentage of apps that are supported by advertising. In contrast, it’s much more common for users to pay for apps on iOS. There have been abundant studies proving that iOS apps earn more revenue. So, if you’re looking for greater localization ROI, focusing on iOS is your best bet. Entering the Chinese Market Is Less Complicated Don’t just look at the numbers before you make your app localization decision – make sure you understand what they mean to you. Last year, for example, less than 25% of all Chinese people who owned a smartphone had an iOS based operating system. But that 25% was made up of a loyal fan base, giving Apple a consistent audience. In 2016, in fact, China became Apple’s number one market, outdoing the US by 15% in sales. On top of that, entering the Chinese app market through the Apple App Store is much easier than taking the Android route. How so? Because the rules for App Store Optimization are the same all over the world and there is only one app store to localize your product for. Android localization, in contrast, can be extremely difficult in this country. With Google’s infamous troubles within the Chinese market, the absence of Google Play translates into a fragmented market. There are currently over 200 different app stores in China. And each one has its own rules and regulations. If you’re planning to be successful in this part of the world, you’ll be glad you focused on iOS localization. Just imagine having to strike up a new relationship each time you want to launch with a different app store! Going through stringent QA processes and negotiating rates with each different one. This is a headache you can spare for yourself and your company by opting for iOS. It’s Better For Beginners iOS localization is better for when you’re starting out and most developers will advise you to go down this route first. iOS apps have a faster speed to market than Android apps. They cost less to develop and localize with iOS 10, and will yield a faster localization ROI. When you’re starting out on your app localization project, you’ll be learning a lot on the fly. You’ll need to make adjustments according to your audiences’ reactions. Try new things, add new features, fix some bugs. All that is easier when you’re focusing on one platform, particularly when it’s iOS. It’s the best environment for beginning your localization project as it’s less challenging than Android. Not to mention that you won’t have to figure out how to make changes and apply your learning on two platforms at once! You can always localize your app for Android afterwards, in fact, it’s highly recommended that you do. But start with iOS localization and move onwards and upwards from there! Like This Article?

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Town will return $798K to Wastewater Fund after Prop 218 settlement Wednesday Feb 15, 2017 at 8:39 PM Feb 15, 2017 at 9:14 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — A lawsuit filed last year alleging town officials violated Proposition 218 by illegally transferring nearly $7 million from its Wastewater to its General Fund to bankroll expenses unrelated to sewer service has been settled. The suit — filed March 28, 2016, by town resident Christina Lopez-Burton — also claimed Prop 218 violations related to flawed sewer rate increases that exceeded the cost of providing service, disproportionate rates among customers and failure to provide proper notice of rate increases. Per the settlement, the town will pay Lopez-Burton’s attorney fees totaling $75,000 and transfer $798,000 into a reserve account within the Wastewater Fund for capital improvement projects to the sewer system. The town will also conduct a periodic wastewater rate study — Lopez-Burton alleged a study had not been done in “at least two decades” — to develop user fees and charges, as well as reset the monthly wastewater rate for some 22,000 customers to $31.43 from the current $35.04. The reset is effective March 1, according to the settlement. In March 2013, according to the suit, the Town Council approved raising the sewer rate by more than 15 percent. Then, in June 2014, another approval raised the rate by a total of 48 percent through Fiscal Year 2018-19. The increases came after Victor Valley Wastewater Reclamation Authority, which treats the town’s wastewater, increased treatment costs by 14.9 percent in 2012, according to the suit. Town attorneys told the Daily Press on Wednesday the town was “simply imposing the charges set forth by VVWRA,” but the suit alleged violations due to the lack of a rate study. An additional term stipulated the Council’s announcement of the settlement, which was made by Mayor Scott Nassif during Tuesday’s regular meeting following closed session. “The Town Council, in order to avoid costs and expenses of protracted litigation, has unanimously approved a settlement agreement resolving (the lawsuit),” Nassif said before stating the terms. According to the suit, the town’s alleged illegal transfer of wastewater funds began in FY 2012-13 when officials moved $1,668,538 to the General Fund. That was followed by a $1,563,943 transfer in 2013-14, an estimated $1,707,400 in 2014-15 and a budgeted $1,896,510 for 2015-16. Town officials said the transfers were justified as they represented reimbursement of expenses the General Fund incurred on behalf of the “wastewater enterprise,” court documents show. Lopez-Burton’s suit, however, stated that “many of the reimbursements do not make sense.” Eric Benink — Lopez-Burton’s attorney — said the transfers were made, in part, to supplement the Parks & Recreation and the Apple Valley Golf Course funds. “Returning some of these funds was important because they were never supposed to be used for these General Fund purposes,” Benink told the Daily Press. In FY 2015-16 — by way of example, according to the suit — a transfer totaling $1,072,660 was made to the Parks & Recreation Fund while $349,968 went into the Golf Course Fund. “Neither the Parks and Recreation Department nor the Town’s golf course support wastewater operations,” the suit read. “These transfers violate (Prop 218).” Attorneys for the town declined to comment on the allegations, but Thomas Rice called the Council’s unanimous approval of the settlement a show of the town “taking the high road” in order to “move forward.” “Even if we’re successful,” Rice said, “the town would be spending far more should (the case) go to trial.” The town now has 10 days to pay the attorney fees and may deduct payment from the transfer amount, according to the settlement. The transfer itself must be made no later than June 30, and two declarations must be provided to Benink within five days of the transfer, the settlement shows. For her part, Lopez-Burton must file a request for dismissal of the suit within two court days. Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254.

The remaining space is reserved for a 'function area'. The most apparent change of the OLED iPhone will be a full-screen design, along with the elimination of the Home button and current fingerprint recognition technology. Of particular note is that we expect the OLED iPhone will adopt a 5.8” physical OLED panel. But the actual display area will be around 5.15”, and the rest will be an area for functions (e.g. allocation of virtual buttons). The 5.8-inch iPhone is expected to be similar in size to the current 4.7-inch iPhone and will feature a bezel-less design to make the larger 5.8-inch display possible. The function area will replace the Home button and Touch ID. Kuo says Apple is planning to replace Touch ID with new biometric technologies that offer similar functionality. A recent report suggested that Apple could equip the device with an iris scanner. Recently Kuo also revealed that the iPhone 8 is expected to feature a stacked logic board freeing up space for a larger battery pack. More details on that here.

The October-December quarter of last year – which clocked 7% year-on-year growth in overall sales to 432 million units – saw Samsung finish second with a market share of 17.8%. For 2016 overall, smartphone sales to end users totalled nearly 1.5 billion units, an increase of 5% from 2015. “This is the second consecutive quarter in which Samsung has delivered falling quarterly smartphone sales. Samsung’s smartphone sales declined 8% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and its share dropped by 2.9 percentage points year on year,” Gartner Research Director Anshul Gupta said. Samsung’s smartphone sales started to drop in the third quarter of 2016, and the decision to discontinue the Galaxy Note 7 slowed down sales of its smartphone portfolio in the fourth quarter, he added. “The withdrawal of the Galaxy Note 7 left a gap in its large-screen phone range,” he said. Besides, Samsung is also facing growing competition in the mid-tier and entry-level smartphone segments from Huawei, Oppo, BBK and Gionee, which all saw their sales growing. According to Gartner, it has taken eight quarters for Apple to regain the No 1 global smartphone vendor ranking, but the positions of the two leaders have never been so close, with a difference of only 256,000 units. “The last time Apple was in the leading position was in the fourth quarter of 2014, when its sales were driven by its first ever large-screen iPhone 6 and 6 Plus,” Gupta said. This time it achieved it thanks to strong sales of its flagship phones – the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. It also benefited from the weakened demand for Samsung’s smartphones in mature markets such as North America and Western Europe, and in some mature markets in Asia such as Australia and South Korea. Huawei, Oppo and BBK accounted for 9.5%, 6.2% and 6.2% of smartphones sold to end users worldwide during the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.

The company's AI assistant will soon be competing with Apple’s Siri, Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa. Huawei has formed a team with over 100 engineers in Shenzhen, China which is currently in early stages of development for the new digital smart assistant, according to one of Bloomberg. Huawei’s digital assistant will be aimed at Chinese customers meaning it will communicate in Chinese languages. One of Bloomberg's sources claimed that Huawei will continue to work with Google and Amazon when it comes to providing other services to its phones internationally. The company's own assistant will mostly rival Apple’s Siri on iPhones as most of Google’s services in China are blocked off despite majority smartphone users  are using Android OS. Related Stories Apple iPhone 8 To Face Tough Android Competitors This Year Huawei Watch 2 To Launch At MWC 2017 Although Huawei intends to continue working with Google, the company’s endeavor to build its own AI assistant clashes with Google’s plan in convincing other manufacturers to pre-install its own assistant on their devices. Currently, Google Assistant is only available on the Pixel phones, Google Home and Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches. As for Huawei’s commitment with Amazon, the Chinese phone maker previously just released its Mate 9 smartphone in the U.S. last month and it comes with Alexa already pre-installed. The Huawei Mate 9 first launch in China and other Asian markets back in November 2016. Huawei new digital assistant for its smartphones in China will be the company’s second investment in artificial intelligence. Back in October, the company announced that it plans to fund UC Berkeley in a partnership to research deep learning, natural language processing and computer vision, according to TechCrunch. Huawei has proven to be quite ambitious with its future plans. One of he company’s top executives, Richard Yu, stated last month during CES 2017 that Huawei wants to be the number one smartphone manufacturer by 2021.

Alex WebbAlex Sherman Apple’s current M&A strategy works well for acquiring start-ups developing new technology that can be added to existing Apple products. Photo: Reuters San Francisco/New York: “We are always looking at acquisitions,” Apple Inc. chief executive officer Tim Cook told analysts last month. “There’s not a size that we would not do.” It’s a message he’s increasingly stressed over the past year as investors question how the world’s most valuable technology company plans to use its $246 billion cash pile to meet ambitious sales targets and expand into new markets, such as transportation. But Apple has struggled for years to pull off bigger deals because of a series of quirks: an aversion to risk, reluctance to work with external advisers like investment banks and inexperience in closing and integrating large takeovers, said people who have worked on acquisitions with the company. They asked not to be identified speaking about private merger and acquisition deliberations. “The first step in M&A is having some conviction about what it is you want to do,” said Eric Risley, managing partner at Architect Partners LLC who has negotiated deals with Apple. “Apple probably more than most feels that they’re very capable of building things” rather than buying them, he added. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. Apple’s biggest deal in its 41-year history was the $3 billion purchase of Beats Electronics in 2014, followed by the $400 million acquisition of NeXT Computer in 1996. In Facebook Inc.’s 13 years, it has made three acquisitions of at least $1 billion, including its $22 billion WhatsApp purchase. Google, founded in 1998, has done four such deals, while Microsoft Corp. has completed at least 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Instead of closing big deals, Cook has so far focused on growing Apple’s services businesses, including Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud. That’s beginning to work, with the company recently forecasting that annual revenue from those operations will top $50 billion by 2021. But even here, some analysts and investors argue for a big acquisition, especially in online video streaming. Apple has started distributing videos through the Music service, and pooling other providers’ video in its mobile TV app, but it has no service akin to Netflix or Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime Video. On Friday, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said Apple needs at least one big acquisition in online video. To reach its $50 billion target, the company must find an extra $13 billion in services revenue over the next four years—beyond what it can generate itself. Netflix Inc. ended 2016 with sales of less than $9 billion, so even buying that business may not be enough, the analyst said. Other potential blockbuster Apple acquisition targets include Walt Disney Co. and electric carmaker Tesla Inc., Baird analyst William Power wrote in a recent note to clients. “They’re going to have to pursue something bigger than a Beats-like acquisition,” said Erick Maronak, chief investment officer at Victory Capital Management, which holds Apple stock among its $55 billion under management. The presidency of Donald Trump may spark tax reforms that free up more Apple cash to spend on takeovers. But so far, the company has tip-toed around the edges of some of the biggest transactions re-shaping the technology industry. When AT&T Inc. agreed to purchase Time Warner Inc. for $85 billion in October, the telecom company was concerned Apple might make a competing bid, people familiar with AT&T’s thinking said at the time. Apple had held tentative talks about a year earlier, but when the AT&T deal emerged, a person familiar with the technology giant’s thinking said it wouldn’t be able to pull together a competing proposal quickly enough. Last year, the company considered buying luxury carmaker McLaren Technology Group Ltd, people familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg at the time. Apple also had takeover talks with chip designer Imagination Technologies Group Plc, but said last year it wouldn’t make an offer. Apple’s deals team is composed of about a dozen people under former Goldman Sachs banker Adrian Perica, and most acquisitions take place at the behest of the company’s engineers. Product managers usually meet every month with Perica’s team members to identify targets with attractive technology or talented engineers, according to a person familiar with the process. Microsoft’s deals team is not significantly bigger, and it still hired investment bank Morgan Stanley for its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn last year, beating rival bidders including Salesforce.com Inc. and Facebook. At Google, the corporate development team is led by Don Harrison and sometimes works on potential acquisitions with strategy experts working under chief business officer Philipp Schindler, not just technical staff. Other deals are carried out at the behest of founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Apple often refuses to work with investment bankers appointed by the seller, preferring to deal directly with company management, according to people who have been involved in such negotiations. Apple also dictates terms and tells targets to take it or leave it, betting that the promise of product development support later and the chance of appearing in future iPhones are alluring enough, the people said. That was the case when Apple acquired Metaio GmbH in 2015. Bankers appointed by the augmented-reality firm to negotiate weren’t allowed in the room, and while Metaio executives felt the offer was low, Apple’s vision for the technology convinced them to sell, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Apple’s current M&A strategy works well for acquiring start-ups developing new technology that can be added to existing Apple products. It bought 15 to 20 companies per year over the last four years. But buying larger companies presents a different challenge, particularly if there are rival bids. Bankers often diffuse tension between bidders and targets, but Apple’s approach can make that process difficult. “There’s a swagger—you may call it arrogance—about the culture there,” said Risley of Architect Partners. “They’re used to being able to muscle their way in and get attractive economics.” For Apple’s acquisition of Beats, neither party used an investment bank. Apple struggled to integrate the team, and when the initial Apple Music offering emerged from the combination, it got lukewarm reviews. Later versions of the service improved. However, Apple’s lack of a successful track record integrating big acquisitions puts off sellers, according to a person who has negotiated with Apple’s deals team. Large acquisitions can also go wrong in big ways. After buying Nokia Oyj’s handset business for $9.5 billion, Microsoft had to write down $7.6 billion of that value in 2015. Failures like that helped forge Apple’s caution on larger deals, according to one of the people familiar with its thinking. That attitude may need to change, according to some investors. After the AT&T-Time Warner deal, analysts’ focus shifted to Netflix as the next target, even as the video streaming service says it’s not up for sale. However, that company’s shares are up about 60 percent in the past year, giving it a market value of more than $60 billion—20 times the cost of Apple’s biggest deal. “There are certain opportunities that they should probably be pursuing and if they wait too long they risk ceding ground to the first movers,” Victory Capital’s Maronak said.

Reuters/Beck Diefenbach When the HDR modes of Apple iPhone 7, Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy S7 were put to test, they produced different results. It will be wrong to suggest which one has the best camera as it depend entirely on personal choice. Here, the differences between the cameras, focusing more on HDR, have been put forth. In HDR mode, all three takes brilliant photos where iPhone 7 tries more to keep the natural look in its images, even when the image is darker than expected. iOS’ advanced photo-editing software is a bonus to make the darkened spots pop out. According to PhoneArena, the Google Pixel’s HDR mode successfully balances light and shadow and produces some really impressive photos. However, at times, some of the images are heavily doctored and may look cartoonish despite simple photo edits. Samsung Galaxy S7’s HDR mode favours boosting the brightness of images, including the bright spots. At times, it sacrifices finer details to produce well-lit images. While this is a bonus for many, some professional photographers may not want to sacrifice details in favour of brightness. According to GSMArena, the Apple iPhone 7 has a 12MP primary camera with f/1.8, 28mm, phase detection autofocus, OIS and quad-LED (dual tone) flash. Other features include 1/3" sensor size, geo-tagging, simultaneous 4K video and 8MP image recording, touch focus, face/smile detection and HDR (photo/panorama). The camera supports videos at 2160p@30fps, 1080p@30/60/120fps and 720p@240fps. The secondary camera is of 7MP with f/2.2, 32mm, 1080p@30fps, 720p@240fps, face detection, HDR and panorama. The Google Pixel primary camera is of 12.3MP with f/2.0, EIS (gyro), phase detection & laser autofocus and dual-LED (dual tone) flash. Other features include 1/2.3" sensor size, 1.55µm pixel size, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, HDR and panorama. It supports videos at 2160p@30fps, 1080p@30/60/120fps and 720p@240fps. The secondary camera is of 8MP and comes with f/2.4, 1/3.2" sensor size, 1.4 µm pixel size and 1080p video recording. The Samsung Galaxy S7 primary camera is of 12MP with f/1.7, 26mm, phase detection autofocus, OIS and LED flash. Galaxy S7’s features include 1/2.5" sensor size, 1.4 µm pixel size, geo-tagging, simultaneous 4K video and 9MP image recording, touch focus, face/smile detection, Auto HDR and panorama. Videos are recorded at 2160p@30fps, 1080p@60fps, 720p@240fps, HDR and dual-video rec. The secondary camera is of 5MP with 1/4.1" sensor size, 1.34 µm pixel size, f/1.7, 22mm, dual video call and Auto HDR.

And that's good for MSFT stock By Chris Fraley, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Feb 15, 2017, 12:46 pm EST     Popular Posts: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Could Win Big With ‘Windows Cloud’ Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Stock’s Q4 Earnings Miss Was Priced In Recent Posts: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Could Win Big With ‘Windows Cloud’ Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Stock’s Q4 Earnings Miss Was Priced In Biogen Inc (BIIB) Stock Needs a Biotech Bounceback View All Posts Not long ago, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) perfected the art of the big reveal. New Apple product announcements would be shrouded in mystery for weeks, and then the late Steve Jobs would get up on a stage and wow consumers and investors alike with the first-ever iPhone, the first-ever iPad or the first-ever iPod. AAPL stock would get an automatic 10% to 15% bump in the days that followed. Could Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have a similarly secretive catalyst in its so-called Windows Cloud product? Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified) Windows Cloud is a mysterious operating system that was revealed via leaks, prompting a “nothing to share” response from Microsoft last week. What Is the Windows Cloud? A couple websites posted screen shots of Microsoft’s yet-to-be-announced operating system, which would only run Windows Store apps designed to run on both desktop computers and mobile devices. The thought is that the Windows Cloud would supplement, not replace, the company’s Windows 10 platform, which is only 18 months old. The Windows Cloud is already being viewed as Microsoft’s answer to Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Chrome OS. And by utilizing only its own apps, the platform could have a security advantage over Chrome, which uses non-native apps. That could position Windows 10 as a more appealing option to public institutions like schools, where protecting students’ computers from outside apps or games can be difficult. Not much else is known about the Windows Cloud platform. And that’s probably how Microsoft likes it. Although Wall Street didn’t immediately embrace the top-secret new product by snatching up MSFT stock in droves, the real test will be when the company actually does its big Windows Cloud reveal. Will the platform impress enough to have an AAPL-like effect on Microsoft stock? Click to Enlarge First, let’s look at how MSFT stock has been behaving lately. There was  big spike in MSFT stock last month has since been followed by a sharp retreat; however, the stock is still hovering above its 25- and 50-day moving averages, as well as two-month support in the $62-range. What you don’t see is any kind of Microsoft stock price movement in the days since the Windows Cloud leak occurred. That means investors aren’t quite sure exactly what the Windows Cloud is and how it could affect MSFT’s business, which is why there has been no sudden rush to buy MSFT. If more details leak out, that could potentially move the needle. For now, though, the Windows Cloud remains a relative mystery that likely has Wall Street more confused than excited. MSFT Stock Is Strong Even Without the ‘Cloud’ In the meantime, Microsoft looks good on its own merits. MSFT stock is up nearly 30% in the last year, nearly 50% in the last two years, still trades at less than 20 times forward earnings estimates, and is expected to grow earnings-per-share by more than 6% this year and more than 9% next year. Sprinkle in a potential game changer in the Windows Cloud, and there’s no reason to suspect Microsoft stock is going to suddenly backtrack. On the contrary, the recent mini-dip is a prime buying opportunity, so long as it holds above those short-term moving averages. I’d buy MSFT stock right here, with the hope that a future Windows Cloud unveiling could spark a quick run-up the way Apple’s secret product launches used to. As of this writing, Chris Fraley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Pioneer's new Rayz Plus earbuds include a simple solution to that problem, but they're still far from perfect. Wireless headphones are probably the future of music, like it or not. More and more mobile devices are ditching the headphone jack to make room for other technologies, despite the inconveniences of having yet another electronic accessory to keep charged, and the risk of losing a pricey set of wireless earbuds. But for those who still aren't ready to go wireless, Pioneer's Rayz Plus earbuds seem like a better alternative than connecting a bunch of bulky dongles to your phone — and it's not like the company had to re-invent the wheel. All Pioneer did was add a compact inline dongle to the cable with an additional Lightning pass-through port that allows users to keep charging an iPhone or iPad while listening to music or movies. It's an upgrade Apple could have, and should have, added to the headphones it bundles with the iPhone 7, instead of just bundling an annoying Lightning adaptor. Because the Rayz Plus can only connect to a device with a Lightning port, it means they will always have a source of power, which Pioneer is taking advantage of to include noise cancelling functionality. The inclusion of multiple microphones in each ear does add weight and bulk to each earbud, but without the need for batteries the Rayz Plus, like JBL's Reflect Aware headphones, appear to be some one of the smallest noise cancelling solutions available right now. To further entice you to drop $US150 on the Rayz Plus which include the extra charging port, and the $US100 Rayz which don't, Pioneer has also added an additional programmable button to the headphone's inline remote that can be customised through a free accompanying iOS app for quickly launching apps while your phone is still buried in your pocket. It's unknown how genuinely useful that will be, but as an alternative to going wireless, Pioneer's Rayz still seem like the least annoying way to deal with the death of the headphone jack.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Huawei Reportedly Planning Their Own Voice Assistant For Smartphones By Tyler Lee on 02/15/2017 18:18 PST In the voice assistant market, Apple has Siri, Google has Google Assistant, Microsoft has Cortana. There are also voice assistants that aren’t natively integrated into phones or computers, such as SoundHound’s Hound and Amazon’s Alexa. We have also heard that Samsung is planning their own voice assistant called “Bixby”. This is why it doesn’t really come as a complete surprise to learn that Huawei could be working on their own voice assistant platform as well. This comes from a report from Bloomberg in which people familiar with the matter told the publication about Huawei’s plans. According to the report, Huawei has a team of more than 100 engineers who are in the early stages of developing the technology at their Shenzhen offices in China. This is particularly interesting because last we heard, Huawei was expected to bundle Amazon’s Alexa into its smartphones, so for Huawei to turn to their own platform would suggest that maybe Alexa could be a temporary measure until their own AI is up to scratch. However according to the report, Huawei’s voice assistant is meant more for the Chinese market and will communicate in Chinese. The company is expected to continue working with Google and Amazon for devices that are sold outside of China. Take it with a grain of salt for now, but it wouldn’t be a stretch to think that companies are seeing the benefits of having their own voice assistant as opposed to having to rely on third-party software, but whether or not Huawei’s efforts will be successful remains to be seen.

According to the Shanghai office of the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency, Chinese smartphone maker Jinli unveiled a new model late last year wrapped in alligator leather that fetches roughly $2,480. The same model in cow skin carries a price tag of some $1,020. Chinese smartphone maker Jinli's new alligator skin model. (Baidu) Jinli had been considered a low-end brand as it mainly sold models costing $145 and less, but the company is seen as trying to burnish its image with new devices targeting movers and shakers in politics and the business world. It also marks a far cry from Chinese smartphone manufacturers' focus on winning the hearts and minds of local customers with relatively cheap models. Prices of smartphones made by Chinese companies averaged about $437 in the second half of last year, roughly double the level from a year earlier. A KOTRA official said that in a sharp departure from the past, Chinese smartphone makers are pushing to expand their presence in the upper-end market in line with Chinese consumers' growing demand to replace their phones with better-functioning models. "In the past, Chinese consumers' top choice was the iPhone," he said. "However, the iPhone 7 and 6S have failed to attract many Chinese buyers, fueling demand for high-end, homegrown models." The new trend comes as the market for smartphones in the world's most populous country is maturing, he added. Last year, Apple and Samsung ranked first and second each in the Chinese market for smartphones valued at $584 and higher. The official also said a weak Chinese currency against the US dollar has led to higher prices of Chinese smartphones by making displays and other components more expensive. He, meanwhile, said Huawei and other leading Chinese smartphone makers are expected to further strengthen their brand power this year, putting pressure on industry leaders Apple and Samsung. In the fourth quarter of last year, Apple's smartphone sales soared 18 percent on-year to 78.3 million devices. It took up 17.8 percent of the global market, unseating Samsung as the top seller. Samsung shipped 77.5 million units, down 5 percent from a year earlier with its market share reaching a six-year low of 17.17 percent for the October-December period, according to Strategy Analytics.

Though the company's traction is gaining outside of China, Huawei's assistant may wind up exclusive for its phones used in China as the company focuses on using Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant - the search giant take on a voice-controlled assistant - for devices it releases internationally. This isn't Huawei's first rodeo with phone-integrated assistants, however, as the company's first full-on introduction to the US - the Huawei Mate 9 - is releasing a second version later this year that comes packed-in with Amazon Alexa support. Once a standout feature, competitors to Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant could soon become a crowded market, with companies such as Adobe, Samsung, and potentially even Nokia all planning a hat of their own to throw in the digital assistant ring.  Siri vs Cortana - which digital assistant rules the desktop?

Tech Industry by Steven Musil February 12, 2017 10:00 AM PST @stevenmusil Apple CEO Tim Cook sees big potential in augmented reality. Sarah Tew/CNET For Apple, augmented reality is the next big thing. How big? How about as big as the iPhone? Tim Cook has expressed his interest in AR before, but now the Apple CEO is likening the technology to the revolutionary impact that the smartphone has had on the world's population. "I regard it as a big idea, like the smartphone," Cook said during an interview with The Independent. "The smartphone is for everyone, we don't have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it's for everyone. I think AR is that big, it's huge. I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives." Unlike virtual reality, which promises to immerse goggle-wearing users in new and exciting digital worlds, AR overlays images and data atop the real world. The best-known example of AR today is Pokemon Go, in which Pokemon characters appear on players' phone screens amid the streets or parks they're exploring. The tech titan is also reportedly working with the German optics manufacturer Carl Zeiss on a pair of lightweight AR/mixed reality glasses. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. Life, disrupted: In Europe, millions of refugees are still searching for a safe place to settle. Tech should be part of the solution. But is it? CNET investigates. Does the Mac still matter? Apple execs tell why the MacBook Pro was over four years in the making, and why we should care.

Not only did the watchmaker miss analyst estimates for Q4 2016, its outlook for 2017 is fairly bleak. CNBC reports that the stock is down nearly 20 per cent. The good news for Fossil is that people actually did buy some of its smartwatches, particularly from its Fossil and Michael Kors brand. The bad news is that in order to get those sales, Fossil had to cut prices, which means lower profits. When Fossil relaunches its smartwatch and wearable line, currently aimed at third-quarter 2017, its executives said that low prices will be a big target. Back in 2015, Fossil spent $US260 million ($337 million) on the wearable maker Misfit as a way to compete against up and coming watch brands like Apple and Samsung. Since then, Fossil has released 100 different wearables across eight brands — including Fossil and Michael Kors — that use some of Misfit's technology. It was the company's hope that a shift into tech would help it compete against a world of smartwatches. But as we've seen with the demise of Pebble, layoffs at Fitbit and the delayed Android Wear 2.0, it's rough going for anyone interested in wearables or smartwatches. Apple reportedly sold six million Apple Watches, but the hard truth for most companies is that no one is buying smartwatches and the value of the product category itself is tenuous. Smartwatches Are Dying Because They Are Worthless Back in April, I dropped $US230 ($313) on a gadget that had me feeling that gadget love again. You're familiar with the feeling too; the thrill you get walking into a Sharper Image store or thumbing through a Hammacher Schlemmer catalogue. It's that sense that you're seeing a small glimpse of the future neatly packaged and commoditized for the present. Read more While Fossil CEO Kosta Kartsotis remains optimistic about wearables and smartwatches in general, making money off of the category is proving to be difficult. A cheap watch might be enough to get some customers to bite, but that isn't necessarily good for Fossil's bottom line. It also says a lot about the general wearable category if cheap prices are the only thing that can keep customers interested. [CNBC] Comments feroshious @feroshious Feb 16, 2017, 11:47am When these watches came out they were around $250. That was my max price, and still is (at least until it can replace my phone with some kind of curved folding screen). Reply 0 hamish77 @hamish77 Feb 16, 2017, 12:17pm Those hands..... Reply 1 nogood @nogood Feb 16, 2017, 2:34pm I think the problem is the brand. People may love the brand for a traditional watch but would you trust them with technology? Regardless of whether it is third party or not, most of their customers probably aren't thinking that. Same for most designer based products. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

 The new iPhone may ditch the Home button in favor of 'virtual buttons' Matt Weinberger Feb. 15, 2017, 7:20 PM 3,706 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Apple iPhone 8 could go edge-to-edge, packing more screen real estate into a similarly-sized package...at the cost of the famous Home button.Steve Kovach Renowned Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities says that the next iPhone will ditch the home button entirely, in favor of 'virtual buttons,' MacRumors reports. That would mean the demise of a piece of iPhone design that's been with us since the first model launched in 2007. Kuo expects this year's iPhone, which might be called either the iPhone X or the iPhone 8, to sport a 5.8-inch screen. But only 5.16 inches of that screen will be directly usable, with the lower portion of the screen dedicated to a "function area" with buttons that could change usage depending on the active app. Previous reports had held that the Home button would be built straight into the screen. Notably, Kuo says, the next iPhone will be able to fit all of that screen real estate into a phone the same physical size as the standard iPhone 7. As indicated by earlier reports, the next iPhone's screen will go edge-to-edge, lacking a bezel, meaning more screen space in the same physical form factor. But because of the lack of a Home button, Kuo says that Apple is preparing some still-mysterious alternatives to the TouchID fingerprint lock common to current iPhone models.  Otherwise, new features expected in the next iPhone include an energy-efficient high-resolution OLED screen, a bigger battery, and wireless charging. All of those features will carry a hefty price tag, as the new iPhone could cost as much as $1,000. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Video courtesy ABC News 24. The stock dived 23 per cent to close at 20¢ - it's lowest price since listing in 2007 - as its advisers scrambled to save the group which has debts exceeding the value of the business.   BusinessDay understands the initial recapitalisation deal put forward by legal adviser Arnold Bloch Leibler and investment bank Moelis has not yet won over the group's bankers, but talks are continuing.  Related Content Slater & Gordon sued for unfair dismissal Slater & Gordon forced to raise cash Slater and Gordon has been in financial trouble since midway through 2015, when accounting issues were discovered shortly after its $1.3 billion purchase of the professional services arm Quindell, causing its shares tumble from more than $8 in April 2015.  Slater and Gordon had gross debt of $764.8 million and net debt of $682.3 million at the end of June 2016. Advertisement A key sticking point of the deal pitched on Wednesday night appears to be the reluctance of its biggest lenders, Westpac and National Australia Bank, to take up major stakes in the left-leaning, union-supporting law firm. Both banks are believed to have around $300 million exposure each to the company and have already written down the loans, potentially paving the way for them to on-sell the debt.  SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Slater and Gordon said billed revenue from its UK business was lower than anticipated but expected to be stronger in the second half, Photo: Lee Besford Another of Slater and Gordon's lenders, Citi, has already offloaded its debt to distressed debt buyers. Those buyers are keen to push for a debt for equity swap. Sources said the deal had been structured in a way to snuff out the impact of a $100 million-plus class action brought by Maurice Blackburn by restricting the assets that can been called upon in a settlement or court-awarded damages claims to the company's insurance. Last year the Federal Court approved Atlas Iron's restructure which in effect ring-fenced the company's assets from claims from subordinated creditors. Despite the potential impact of the recapitalisation deal on its case, a spokesman for Maurice Blackburn said it would continue to hold Slater and Gordon to account,  "But this is a complex case with multiple avenues of recovery, particularly in light of the fact that Slater and Gordon itself plans cross-claims against other parties, which may include some of its advisers on the PSD (professional services division) acquisition," the spokesman said.  Slater and Gordon has until 27 April to file its defence and will have to file any cross claim by then. On Thursday Slater and Gordon also said revenue from its Australian business, previously the highlight of its weakening results, was lower than expected for the first half of 2017.  "Slater and Gordon's Australian business has more recently started to show signs of being impacted by negative sentiment about the business and increased competition in key segments," the company said in a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange. It also said earnings from its UK business were lower than expected. Still, the company said its first-half normalised earnings and cash from operations from its UK arm would be an improvement on the prior corresponding half. "The company is projecting stronger billed revenue results in the second half of 2017 as it continues its UK performance transformation program," the company said.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > App Attack: Flipboard’s big update tailors… App Attack: Flipboard’s big update tailors magazines just for you By Julian Chokkattu — February 12, 2017 9:00 AM Subscribe Share Please enable Javascript to watch this video Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you Flipboard is one of the most popular news-reading apps, and Version 4.0 makes it easy to find content tailored to your interests. Pre-installed apps like Apple News and Google’s multiple news-aggregating apps may enjoy a large base of users, but for a long time Flipboard was the default news reader on most smart devices. Now vying for the spotlight again, the app making a comeback with a revamp that uses machine learning to personalize and improve reader experience. Version 4.0 focuses on Smart Magazines, which let you create a personalized magazine with more granular preferences. You’ve been able to create magazines before — in fact, Flipboard said more than 28 million magazines were created by users last March — but Smart Magazines go a step further thanks to human curation, machine learning, and more. More: Google is fighting fake news in France with a new project called CrossCheck Because of these granular controls and options, it’s unlikely your Flipboard will match someone else’s — even if they’re interested in similar categories. For example, if you click on “Photography,” you get the option to narrow your interest even further down to “Canon” or “Nikon,” and more. These magazines are automatically updated. You can create up to nine smart magazines that will appear on the home screen, and any others will show up as tiles on another screen.  Furthermore, the more you use and interact with the app — by liking or sharing an article, for example — the better Flipboard gets at offering up content you’ll enjoy reading. Here’s how you can create a Smart Magazine: Scroll to the right where you’ll see “What’s your passion?” in big, bold text. Here you can either type a category in, or choose one from the list below — like “Travel,” “Technology,” or “Business.” You’ll then see a “Personalize” page come up — choose hashtags that you want to see in your magazine, like #SiliconValley, or #Wearables. More: Tinder for moms? Peanut app helps get gang together for friendship, playdates These options help hone in on your passion, so that you’ll get a unique feed that’s tailored to you. You can add or remove hashtags at any time by tapping on the three dots on the top right corner of the magazine, and then hitting “Personalize.” You can also move around magazines on the home screen by tapping “Edit Home,” which sits below. The version 4.0 update is available for iOS and Android, and you can grab it on the App Store and the Google Play Store.

The Nasdaq-listed Baidu said on Thursday it had created the Duer Business Unit, as it heightens its development focus on “Duer”, the company’s AI-powered digital assistant that can connect people with services through conversational user interface. Functioning similar to Apple’s personal assistant “Siri”, Duer – first unveiled in September 2015 as an conversational AI system – has become the cornerstone of Baidu’s innovation in various voice-activated products, including a voice-activated TV assistant and a family robot with video chat and streaming capabilities. As well the new business unit, Baidu also announced its acquisition on Thursday of the Beijing startup Raven Tech, a specialist in applying voice-controlled artificial intelligence to smart home systems. Neither party revealed the value of the takeover, but Baidu said Raven Tech’s 27-year-old founder Lu Cheng will now lead the company’s smart home devices business, working with its Duer team. He will report directly to the tech giant’s newly appointed chief operating officer, Lu Qi, who leads the company’s products, technology, sales, and marketing and operations divisions. Raven Tech is Baidu’s latest acquisition of an AI-focused company, underlining a shift in the firm’s overall business model towards AI, under former Microsoft global executive vice president Lu Qi, who joined in January. It (the Raven acquisition) is key for Baidu to have a leading position in human/machine interaction and built up core strength in software and hardware integration,” he said in an internal statement to staff on the acquisition Lu Qi, chief operating officer, Baidu “It (the Raven acquisition) is key for Baidu to have a leading position in human/machine interaction and built up core strength in software and hardware integration,” he said in an internal statement to staff on the acquisition. Founded in 2014, Raven Tech has already made a strong name for itself in the field of human/mobile interaction with a string of products including a voice-enabled music search app called Music Flow, which has millions of users. Embedded with an AI assistant, Flow is described by the company as the world’s first “IM+AI Chatbot”. Voice or text massages can activate Chatbot, and Flow can also be ordered to help in services, including hailing a taxi or offering navigation services. Raven’s H-1, a smart home controlling system, is the company’s latest product to enable people control over their home appliances via voice or text commands.

Cherrayil, Staff Reporter   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Dubai Huawei’s sub-brand Honor, which has sold 120 million smartphones since entering the market in 2014, doesn’t want to sit on the laurels it has achieved in the last three years and is hungry for more. When Huawei sold 139 million units globally in 2016, Honor contributed 60 million devices. In an exclusive chat with Gulf News, Chris Sun Baigong, vice-president, of Huawei Honor Middle East, said: “2017 will be a challenging year but we see a positive impact as it will give an alternate window for Honor to grow as many more brands are expected to disappear from the market.” The year started on a positive note for the Chinese manufacturer with the launch of an affordable dual-camera phone — 6X — and Baigong said that it is well appreciated in the market and doing very good sales. “Our last year’s flagship Honor 8 is still witnessing good sales globally and Honor Magic in China. In the Middle East, it was Honor 5X and Honor 8. It is difficult to compare 2016 sales to 2015 as we had cut some models,” he said. In 2014, Honor launched three models and in 2015, it was two models — Honor 5X and Honor 8. Comparing 5X to 4X, he said that the company registered more than 800 per cent growth and the flagship Honor 8 grew 300 per cent compared to Honor 7. “Overall, the growth for 2016 was 20 per cent in the region (GCC, Iran, Iraq and Pakistan). We sold more than one million devices in 2016 and expect to sell two million units this year,” he said. Huawei wants to surpass Apple and become the second largest brand within a year or two, according to Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei’s consumer business group. According to data released by Counterpoint, global smartphone shipments grew three per cent on year to 1.512 billion units in 2016. Smartphone shipments in the China market expanded six per cent year on year to an all-time high of 465 million in 2016. Chinese brands such as Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, Meizu and Gionee drove the majority of the volume, capturing a combined 58 per cent of China’s smartphone market in 2016. A per the IDC report, the Honor sub-brand and Huawei’s flagship P series got in the majority of sales in markets like China and parts of Asia. Baigong said that it is good that Chinese players are stealing the limelight globally and they will play a very big role in the smartphone industry. “We are looking at breaking norms and showing our users that premium quality is now within their reach. This is particularly so due to the predominance of digital natives and high incidence of early adopters that impact the way in which we approach this highly sophisticated market. “For 2017, we are looking forward to bringing more devices that meet and exceed users’ expectations,” he said. With heavy saturation in many mature smartphone markets such as the US, Europe, and China, Anthony Scarsella, research manager at IDC, said that many vendors have placed a renewed focus on pushing “premium-looking mid-tier” devices as a new value proposition to consumers in both developed and emerging markets. And that is what Honor brand is focusing on with its premium-looking mid-range devices at an affordable price point. “We are not going to sell devices in the low end and will focus on mid-range devices between $200 and $350. We found out that our target audience is looking at not just a price competitive nice phone but one that demonstrates best in class quality and a premium experience,” Baigong said. He said that mid-range devices are occupying more market share but we are not considering the entry of other Chinese brands seriously. “Our focus is to change the smartphone game and we know the market much better than other vendors and we localise it,” he said.

Oppo R9s XZ at a glance For: Value 16 megapixel cameras front and rear Battery life Against: Rough edges Clumsy software overlay No NFC chip Maybe: Performance Verdict: Lots of phone for less money Price: New Zealand price not yet announced, expected to be around $750 Website Oppo R9s At first sight the Oppo R9s looks like it might be yet another premium Android phone. The physical design goes a step beyond paying homage to the iPhone. At the launch Oppo execs showed and Apple-like Rose Gold model. The review model has a matt black finish, but still looks like a slimmer iPhone 7 with a wider Touch ID button. There's even an iPhone-like bump for the camera lens on the back of the phone. Oppo goes further down the Apple path than most phone makers. The R9s uses Oppo's ColorOS 3.0 software. It's based on Android 6.0, but Oppo tweaked the home screen to look more like iOS 7. In the hand You only have to hold the R9s to realise it is not an iPhone, Galaxy or an Xperia. It doesn't feel as polished. There are, quite literally, rough edges. They are noticeable every time you touch the phone. This serves as a metaphor for everything else about the Oppo R9s. It lacks the fine attention to detail you'll find if you spend twice as much on your phone. During the review I found myself yearning to get back to a better feeling device. Rough edges aside, the effect is still classy for a phone at this price. The R9s is thin, yet still solid. The screen gets near to the edge or as phone makers say, it has a thin bezel. It's made of aluminium. This means it is light and doesn't have that plastic feel found elsewhere. Yet there is no getting away from the uncomfortable feel of those rough edges. Color me crazy Android phone makers have this crazy idea they can add value with software. They never do. Nothing beats the pure Android experience you'll find on a Nexus or Pixel except, perhaps, iOS. 1 Oppo uses its own ColorOS 3.0 software. This is based on Android 6.0. That is now a year behind other Android versions. ColorOS has been tricked out in places to look like iOS, but don't be deceived. It is nothing like iOS in practice. Nor is it as silky smooth as stock Android. In places the ColorOS user interface is misleading to anyone experienced with other versions of Android. It doesn't make sense to screw with basic conventions such as swiping down to get notifications. Many Android fans like to tinker with their software. Oppo seems to have gone out of its way to make this difficult. That will lose it friends in the geek community. Camera give and take Every modern phone maker highlights camera technology in their marketing. Oppo is no different. One of the best reasons to choose an Oppo that it has front and rear 16 megapixel cameras. Oppo has used Sony camera technology, arguably the best in the phone business. In practice you get great camera performance considering the price of the R9s. It's often as good as most premium phones. Advertised highlights are the fast shutter speed and decent low-light performance. In practice the shutter speed isn't so great... maybe half a second delay. Low-light performance is far more impressive. You get automatic sharpening and smoothing, but the exposure is long, so pictures are ruined if the subjects move. Nearly all the camera features you find on more expensive phones are here and some odd ones too. Oppo includes a selfie filter called Beauty Mode. It did nothing for me, make what you will of that. Battery life When it comes to battery life the R9s is outstanding. You'd need to be a heavy user not to get at least two days use from a single charge. This is as good as any performance I've seen on a modern phone at any price. Oppo sweetens the battery life problem by including fast charging. You can give the battery a two-thirds boost in 30 minutes. While I didn't need this during testing, it's ideal if you are travelling and need a quick top-up between appointments. Price Everything about the Oppo R9s has to take the price into consideration. Oppo has yet to announce the New Zealand price, but promises it will be competitive. Looking across the Tasman, the phone sells for A$600. Converting that and adjusting for higher GST means it could sell here for NZ$700 to NZ$750. Given the price, you get a lot of phone. The cameras are equal or close to the cameras on phones costing twice that price. The display is also as good. The build quality is a tad behind that on premium phones. Oppo's ColorOS software overlay is more disappointing that those found on Sony or Samsung phones. The R9s doesn't have a NFC chip for making payments, this could be a deal breaker for some users but a lot of people won't care. Oppo saved a few pennies on the phone's eight core powerplant. You'll get more grunt on more expensive phones. In everyday use this is unlikely to worry all but the most demanding users. If you are someone who does everything on your phone, then you may need more power. The flip side of this is that the processor is less energy hungry and that's one reason the battery lasts longer than many other phones. Verdict Oppo's R9s story is all about the price. We don't know for sure but if it lands in New Zealand at NZ$750 it'll be competitive. For that money you get most of what you'll find in premium phones selling for twice the price. While there are rough edges and compromises, the only weak spot is the software. And that's something a lot of users don't care about. The R9s looks good and has a great feature set. You'll struggle to find better value. Let's not argue about the merits of Android versus iOS here.

The Beijing-based company remains the world’s largest PC maker, but has been trying to broaden its smartphone business as the market for personal computers fizzles. But it has struggled to keep pace with Apple and Android rivals. Shares in Lenovo Group were down more than five per cent at HK$4.95 (RM2.84) in early afternoon trading. Net profits fell by 67 per cent year-on-year to US$98 million (RM436.8 million) in the third quarter, the company said in a statement. That came in well short of analysts’ estimates by Bloomberg which on average predicted profits of US$145.9 million (RM650.3 million). Revenues were also down six per cent compared with a year earlier. “Lenovo faced sizeable challenges in its three main lines of business, namely data centre, mobile devices, and PCs and smart devices,” the firm said. The company is battling as consumers opt for smartphones instead of PCs. Rising component prices are also weighing on profits. Sales of the firm’s Moto and Lenovo-branded phones slipped 23 per cent year-on-year in the three months to December. Its data centre business, which includes servers, storage, software and services also took a 20 per cent dive in sales compared with the previous year. However, Lenovo’s PC and smart device business, which includes tablets, still saw sales gains of two per cent year on year. That was spurred by strong growth in North America, the company said. US firms HP and Dell follow Lenovo as leaders in the global PC market. All three increased their share of the market in the final quarter of last year, according to industry trackers. Lenovo announced in January that it is launching a “Smart Assistant” which recognises user’s voices to conduct tasks including web searches and playing music. The firm is also in talks over a potential merger with Japan’s struggling PC maker Fujitsu. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Petronas Canada LNG plant buoyed by incentives to native groups Weaker ringgit dampens travel to Singapore Bank Negara: Ringgit began to stabilise towards end 4Q2016 Malaysia’s economy expands 4.2pc in 2016 Didi Chuxing faces new hurdles in China (VIDEO) Weaker ringgit dampens travel to Singapore Swedish company invests RM100m in Penang Another day, another mall: How KL Gateway Mall hopes to succeed in a crowded market Osram says gets US government approval for lamps unit sale Greece says will not accept ‘illogical’ demands in bailout review Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Related Articles Lenovo revenue plummets 19pc as Motorola woes weigh on profit Lenovo sees end of ‘hypergrowth’ in China smartphone market Hong Kong telco stocks climb as property counters decline Lenovo’s upcoming wearable tracker leaked Lenovo reports 1Q profit, beating estimates Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

News Business Business News High-end lingerie brand Agent Provocateur could be heading for administration The brand, which was founded by Vivienne Westwood’s son and is popular with celebrities including the Kardashians, has suffered weak sales in recent years Josie Cox Business Editor Thursday 16 February 2017 07:59 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online Restructuring firm AlixPartners has reportedly been appointed to lead a sale process of Agent Provocateur AFP/Getty High-end lingerie firm Agent Provocateur could be heading for administration. The brand, which was founded by Vivienne Westwood’s son and is popular with celebrities including the Kardashians, has suffered weak sales in recent years, hit by a slow-down in luxury high street spending. It is currently majority owned by private equity firm 3i, which has reportedly been trying to sell the company. Read more How luxury brands are planning to take your money in 2017 The Guardian on Thursday reported that restructuring firm AlixPartners has now been appointed to lead a sale process. The paper reported that bids for the company were tabled late last week with about five bidders thought to include Lion Capital, the former private equity owner of La Senza and American Apparel, and Alteri. The Guardian said that advisers were looking for sums in excess of the £30m Agent Provocateur owes to its lenders, and that 3i is looking to finalise a deal ahead of a deadline for rent and rate payments which falls around late February or early March. Agent Provocateur’s manufacturing operations includes suppliers in Britain, Asia, continental Europe and North Africa, according to Reuters.

According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target.

Eight aquariums run by the company Sea Life are calling on visitors to spare lettuce or broccoli for their shelled inhabitants who, as a result of a shortage of some vegetables in the UK, are missing out on their favourite meals.

Getty 4/32 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

The company denied those allegations.

Tesco 8/32 Tobacco giant Imperial Brands scraps chief executive pay rise - Thursday January 26 The chief executive of Imperial Brands, the maker of Gauloises and Winston cigarettes, is unlikely to get a pay rise this year in what seems to be another battle over boardroom greed. Alison Cooper received a total pay package of £5.5m in the last financial year, up from £3.6m the year before. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads READ MORE Link between high executive pay and performance ‘negligible’ A new pay policy that would have had the effect of taking Ms Cooper’s remuneration to £8.5m in 2017 was expected to be put to a shareholders’ vote on 1 February.

Here are the major smartphone innovations which will set the trends in terms of hardware-based features for the year and beyond: Edge-to-edge displays: Major smartphone companies, it seems, are ditching bezels and even the traditional home buttons and embracing edge-to-edge displays. These displays cover the entire front of the device and have components such as front camera, front-facing speakers and fingerprint sensors built into the display itself rather than placed alongside it. The industry trendsetters — Samsung and Apple — are expected to feature edge-to–edge displays in their 2017 flagship devices. 10nm processors: Samsung has shared its 10nm processor-based FinFET technology with Qualcomm, which produces processors for leading smartphone companies using Android OS such as LG, HTC, Xiaomi and others. 10nm is the buzzword for improved processors since processors made using this technology come with more transistors in a small area leading to better processing power and battery life. Since Qualcomm already has its hands on the technology, it is expected to create the next top-of-the-line processors based on it. Such processors could feature in many flagships releasing throughout the year. Pressure-sensitive buttons: Physical buttons on smartphones are passé. Many smartphone makers have already switched to software or touch-based buttons for the home, back and open tabs. This year, even the volume rocker and power button, apart from the traditional home button placed on Samsung and Apple devices, might give way to touch-based buttons. Devices such as the iPhone 8 are expected to have 3D-touch pressure-sensing buttons placed inside the display and body of the device. Related Stories 5 Expected Features Of Samsung Galaxy X Smartphone Technologies To Look Out For In 2017 Increased RAM: As smartphone processing needs change, the amount of RAM inside them also needs to increase. The current average RAM in smartphones is currently 2/3GB, 4GB on high-end devices, placing them at par with RAM on average PCs. But as major software and hardware features are added to devices, leading smartphones, such as the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Note 8 are expected to have 6GB RAM at least. 5G and Bluetooth 5.0: Fifth-generation mobile networks having data speeds up to 1GB per second are expected to be rolled out by the end of the year. To be compatible with such networks, smartphones will have to come with bands which work on such speeds. Leading flagships coming out in 2017 are expected to be 5G-compatible. Bluetooth is also expected to evolve further, with the introduction of Bluetooth 5.0. Bluetooth SIG claims that Bluetooth 5.0 would have four times longer range and twice the speed of the current Bluetooth standard.

ROB VARELA/Acorn Newspapers Thousand Oaks Rotary Club’s annual Economic Outlook Forecast Breakfast at Cal Lutheran University, traditionally a subdued event, got a shot in the arm last week courtesy of Bill Dallas, CEO of Skyline Home Loans. Bouncing among the roles of historian, self-promoter and motivational speaker, the Oaks Christian School founder told a crowd of over 100 inside CLU’s Lundring Events Center that the nation was approaching a point of no return. A return from what? It wasn’t clear. “We are right now cresting on that point, we are emotionally out of control as a country and as a people. We’re scared. We don’t want to admit it, and we are being led by somebody totally different,” he said. “What Uber did to taxis and Apple did to smartphones is what Donald Trump has done to the Republican Party, presidential elections, polling, global governance and maybe even the financial global markets: He’s disrupted it; he’s changed it forever.” CRYSTAL BALL—Matthew Fienup of CLU’s Center for Economic Forecasting lays out CERF’s predictions for the coming year. ROB VARELA/Acorn Newspapers Unlike most speakers at the long-running economic breakfast, who opt to stay on the dais and stick to statistical analysis, Dallas grabbed the microphone and headed out into the audience for his portion of the keynote address. When he finished speaking, the successful attorney and businessman dropped the mic to the ground in a symbolic move, leaving master of ceremonies Susan Murata of Hospice of the Conejo to rush to pick it up. Event organizer Patrick McCoy said Dallas’ performance was “a reflection of his strong passion and remarkable acumen in business matters.” “Bill’s ability to leave his chair and deliver up close a flamboyant and provocative speech really dazzled that early-morning audience,” McCoy said. Rotary, CLU tradition The brainchild of former Rotarians Merv Kopp, Dennis Gillette and Martin Anderson, the economic breakfast at CLU is a 25-year tradition. The event brings together CLU’s Center for Economic Research and Forecasting and local leaders in the fields of public policy, finance and real estate to predict what’s in store for the regional economy. Speaking at the breakfast for the second time, Matthew Fienup, new executive director of CERF, said his organization predicted no major economic shift this year resulting from a Trump presidency (it’s prediction was the same for a Hillary Clinton victory). CERF has historically been one of the more pessimistic forecasting outlets. “We’re the only economic forecast I’m aware of that’s saying no change,” Fienup said. “There are some saying positive change, there are some saying negative change . . . we’re saying no change. We expect that slow growth (of the past eight years) to continue.” He said CERF, which produces regular federal, state and regional forecasts, doesn’t believe Trump will be able to institute the major policy changes that could kick-start the economy, like corporate tax and regulatory reform. If Trump were able to lower the corporate tax rate, for example, that change alone would force CERF to revise its forecast upward, Fienup said. “High rates not only reduce investment, they put American companies at a disadvantage in relation to their foreign counterparts,” the economist said. “Lowering federal corporate tax rates and, in particular, allowing the repatriation of foreign earnings, would have a big positive impact.” State, local economy Regarding Trump’s impact on the California economy, Fienup said even a minor change to the Affordable Care Act could have major consequences in a state where one-third of residents receive subsidized healthcare coverage via Medi-Cal. But looming larger for the California economy is last year’s minimum wage hike. Fienup said CERF agrees with research that suggests an increase to a $15-an-hour minimum wage will lead to massive job losses among lower-skilled workers. “We find evidence for very strong increases in the unemployment rate among that group,” he said. “Our research also suggests that the impact may actually be larger than previously predicted.” Shifting to the topic of Ventura County, Fienup shared a string of statistics to demonstrate how the local economy is failing to keep pace with neighboring counties. Ventura County, the economist said, is the only county in Southern California that has not returned to pre-recession (2008) job levels. “There were fewer people with jobs living in Ventura County last year than there were the year before. That is unprecedented in Ventura County for a non-recessionary economy,” he said. “And the jobs that are coming back are not the same ones that we lost,” Fienup added, saying the county is seeing fewer jobs in high-paying fields like finance and technology. Despite all of these factors, home prices in the county continue to rise, driven by a lack of supply caused by negative feelings about growth, Fienup said. Prices have returned to 90 percent of their levels before the housing crisis, he said. The combination— stagnant wages and higher housing costs—means that Ventura County’s affordability rate stands at just 26 percent, which means just one in four people can afford the cost of a median priced home. By comparison, Orange County’s affordability rate is 29 percent. Fienup said unless policy changes are made to allow for more residential development, the county’s economy will continue to under perform. “We would argue what needs to change is really attitudes about densification, infill development, attitudes about urban expansion,” the economist said. “Not without any sustained development do we expect . . . any of these numbers to change direction in the years ahead.” Return to top Copyright © 2005-2016 J.Bee NP Publishing, Ltd., All Rights Reserved.

Biotech Since the early 2000s, the cost of sequencing a human genome — determining the precise order of nucleotides within DNA molecules that defines who we are — has dropped sharply. A genome that cost $100m to sequence in 2001 can today be sequenced for roughly $1,000. This plummeting cost, along with the shortened timescales for sequencing DNA, has led to a revolution in biotechnology: gene hacking, or the ability to turn genes on and off, and to manipulate biology to our advantage. The most radical branch of this new technology is “gene editing” — a process by which our DNA code can be cut and pasted using molecular “scissors” for a variety of applications, including curing diseases such as cancers and HIV. Until recently, swapping the code was an arduous process. A new DNA cut-and-paste tool known as Crispr has made the process unexpectedly simple. Crispr has been used to create disease-resistant strains of wheat and rice, alter yeast to make biofuels and reverse blindness in animals. Ultimately, it could be used to edit defects out of human embryos. 2. Artificial intelligence © HANDOUT Artificial intelligence is not science fiction: it is already embedded in products we use every day. Apple’s Siri assistant, Amazon’s book recommendations, Facebook’s news feed and Spotify’s music discovery playlist are all examples of services driven by machine learning algorithms. This decades-old science is enjoying a renaissance today because of the deluge of data created by smartphones and sensors, and the supercomputing power that is available to crunch that data. According to technology research firm Tractica, the AI market will grow from $643.7m in 2016 to $36.8bn by 2025. Techniques such as deep learning and neural networks supposedly mimic the human brain: they spot broad patterns in enormous data sets in order to label images, recognise voices and make decisions. The next step is artificial general intelligence: an algorithm that will not have to be taught a specific skill such as a game of chess or a new language, but will acquire it through trial and error, just as a child does. Companies such as London-based DeepMind, owned by Google, and others are working to make this a reality. 3. Renewable energy World leaders last year ratified the Paris Agreement on climate change. This aims to keep the global average temperature from rising more than 2C above pre-industrial levels and to attempt to keep the increase under 1.5C. Keeping this promise will require more renewable energy research over the next decade. In energy, researchers are trying to build a nuclear fusion reactor that would tap the same process that causes the sun to give off light and heat to create a source of clean energy. An intergovernmental partnership is building a $19bn fusion reactor, ITER, in France. Other innovations include artificial photosynthesis to make hydrocarbons in laboratories to power cars, and high-altitude wind power that involves kites and hot-air balloons acting as aerial wind turbines. Iceland is investing in geothermal technology, drilling for heat energy underground. Thirty years ago it started by using geothermal resources to heat towns and cities. Now, the entire country’s electricity and heating systems are powered almost fully by renewable energy, including geothermal and hydropower. 4. Connectivity © Getty WiFi — a household staple that modern children take for granted — turned 25 last September. As more objects connect to the “internet of things” — an estimated 50bn of them by 2020, according to estimates from technology company Cisco — the future of WiFi lies in reducing the power it drains from internet-enabled devices. One innovation, invented by students at the University of Washington in Seattle, is known as “passive WiFi” which its inventors say consumes 10,000 times less power. It is currently slower than regular home broadband, but would work well for applications such as smart thermostats or lightbulbs. The WiFi community is also looking to develop higher-frequency bands that would be used over a limited range, such as in a house or car. Ultimately, WiFi itself could be replaced by a new superfast alternative called Li-Fi, which uses light to beam information through the air, instead of radio waves. Lightbulbs would act as routers for this technology. A pilot study earlier this year found that a Li-Fi prototype could send data 100 times faster than WiFi, allowing dozens of movies to be downloaded in minutes. 5. Smart appliances © Reuters Almost two-thirds of the human population is connected to the internet via smartphones, but these devices are not the only portal to the web. In 2016 there were 6.4bn connected things — excluding PCs, phones and tablets — in use worldwide, up 30 per cent from the previous year, according to technology analyst Gartner. The internet of things, as it is known, is this universe of objects — everything from cars to printers, lightbulbs to thermostats — that are no longer “dumb”, static things: they can learn your habits and be controlled remotely using an app. The stereotypical smart appliance is the self-stocking refrigerator that replenishes your milk automatically. This innovation will replace a lot more than the sniff test. Cars are now computers, running more lines of code than the Apollo 11 spaceship on its way to the moon. As these computers become more intelligent, cars will drive themselves, potentially reducing traffic-related fatalities. Smart sensors can also transform industry, for instance by monitoring goods during transport, helping utility companies to measure energy usage and logistics companies to track vehicles over long distances.

Skip to content GPS Tracking Info Just another NEWS site Uncategorized Mundo Entretenimento Negócios Desporto Uncategorized Mundo Entretenimento Negócios Desporto iPhone 8 said to feature “biometric tech” instead of Home Button By admin in Uncategorized February 16, 2017 PanARMENIAN.Net – The upcoming 2017 iPhone will feature a 5.8-inch display with 5.15 inches of usable screen space according to new predictions shared by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Kuo believes the iPhone 8 will use a 5.8-inch OLED display panel, but that some space will be reserved for virtual buttons, MacRumors says. As has been rumored, the display is said to take up the entire front panel of the iPhone, effectively eliminating bezels, which means Apple will eliminate both the current Home button and the current Touch ID fingerprint recognition technology used in iPhones. Size wise, Kuo says the OLED iPhone will have measurements similar to the 4.7-inch iPhone, allowing for one-handed operation. Such a size is possible with a 5.8-inch panel because there will be no extra space outside of the display, as can be seen in the mockup below. It will feature a display similar in size to the 5.5-inch iPhone, but in a 4.7-inch package. Alongside the 5.8-inch OLED iPhone, Kuo continues to believe Apple will also offer standard 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch LCD iPhones, but it is not yet clear what features those devices will adopt. In previous research notes, Kuo has said they will include glass bodies and wireless charging, but he has not gone into detail on other potential features. He does, however, say that the OLED iPhone will be the only bright spot in the 2017 iPhone lineup, suggesting only minor improvements for the other two rumored devices. Because the OLED iPhone will eliminate the Home button, it is expected to adopt other biometric technologies, which other rumors suggest could include things like iris or facial recognition. Battery life may also be another major change in the OLED iPhone,… Post navigation Nvidia, and AMD Increase GPU Attach Rates While Total GPU Shipments Remain Flat Quarter to Quarter Jacqueline Fernandez wants to Bollywood’s action icon!

A dual-camera smartphone is a handset sporting two rear camera lens that typically work together to provide unique photography with different view angles and focuses. LG Innotek, which produced the world’s first dual cameras in 2011, went ahead of its rivals after becoming a sole supplier to Apple’s iPhone series since September. The supply to Apple led LG Innotek to post a record-breaking operating profit of 117.8 billion won ($103 million) in the fourth quarter of last year. The parts company is expected to continue to post strong sales in the first quarter as LG Electronics’ flagship smartphone G6, which will be unveiled at the Mobile World Congress, will feature its dual cameras. “LG Innotek’s optical solutions unit is predicted to beat market expectations of 919.2 billion won in the first quarter, driven by LG’s flagship smartphone G6 sales,” said Noh Guen-chang, an analyst at HMC Investment & Securities.  (LG Electronics) Innotek’s rival Samsung Electro-mechanics, which posted an operating loss in the fourth quarter due to the discontinued sales of Galaxy Note 7, is also expected to make a turnaround this year because of rising demand for dual cameras from Chinese clients, analysts said. Samsung Electro-mechanics began supplying its dual cameras for Chinese tech firms Xiaomi and LeEco since the third quarter and it is also in talks with other Chinese firms, such as Huawei, Oppo and Vivo, for new supply, industry watchers said. Park Kang-ho, an analyst at Daishin Securities, said, “Samsung Electro-mechanics’ sales in China is expected to increase 108 percent from 312 billion won in 2016 to 649 billion won this year.” The tech firm’s total camera sales will also rise 16.9 percent year-on-year to 2.4 trillion won, driven by rising sales of dual and high-definition cameras in the global market, Park added. According to local market research firm Counterpoint, the sales of smartphones sporting dual cameras will rise more than 400 percent on-year to reach 300 million units in 2017.

February 16, 2017 0912 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:187781 Publish Date: Thu, 16 Feb 2017 10:04:24 GMT Service: Iran Smoke and mirrors: Beijing battles to control smog message In its 'war' on hazardous air pollution, China's government has a dilemma: it needs to be open about air quality data to hold polluters to account, but worries that too much bad news from alternative, independent sources could stoke public unrest. Beijing has greatly improved how it collects data, made more of it available to the public and cracked down on misreporting, but it's concerned about the spread of unauthorized or inaccurate data from popular mobile apps and handheld detectors, according to the reuters.com The conflicting approach reflects a broader debate about China's appetite for political reform. The Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP), under a former academic, wants to create a modern regulatory system based on independent monitoring and the rule of law, but that could rub up against the ruling Communist Party's priority for stability. After scandals about fraudulent data, the government also worries that alternative sources of information on pollution levels could erode public trust in official statistics, and undermine its message that the environment is improving. Liam Bates, CEO of Origins Technology, which produces the Laser Egg handheld pollution monitor sold in Beijing's Apple store, said China has no problem with people measuring air quality; it just doesn't want the findings to be published. "Basically (China) says it's illegal to publish data from non-official sources. As far as I know there's nothing about collecting data, or processing data and using it for research," he said. China says its main concern is accuracy. In 2014, it ordered mobile phone pollution apps to drop data provided by the United States embassy and its consulates, concerned it might differ from its own. More recently, apps came under scrutiny for trying to give a more detailed picture than the government of China's air quality. In one recent example of what the government calls "rumor mongering" by individuals, a man was detained by police for five days in Chengdu in the southwest after he warned on his Weibo microblog that the city faced its "heaviest smog in its 2,000-year history", local media reported. Regulators also accused one air pollution monitoring app of spreading rumors by providing data in December indicating Chengdu was the third most polluted city in the world. While China's short-staffed environmental watchdogs are keen to involve the public in enforcing standards, authorities are wary that social media-driven protests against chemical plants, waste incinerators or nuclear processing facilities could trigger protests. "In general, there is hope at the provincial and ministerial level that they will not try to shut down all these other sources, but what they're really concerned about is that they will show something that isn't scientific," said Ma Jun, director of the Institute for Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE), a non-government organization campaigning for greater transparency. "This is a challenge in this era of mobile internet and social media," he noted. The MEP did not respond to a faxed request for comment. China still does not give out data for climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions, and offers only incomplete heavy metal pollution figures - a sensitive issue following food scandals in rice-growing regions. There is also reluctance to allow the free publication of sensitive data on the health impact of pollution. There is no database on the health impact from pollution that companies, say, could access to help them decide where to locate staff. While Chinese media have cited foreign studies on the correlation between smog and mortality - including the heavy death toll in London in the winter of 1952-53 - there have been few equivalent Chinese studies. As winter pollution gripped much of northern China last month, the health ministry told state media it had no data linking smog to cancer, and it was too early to reach any conclusions about the impact of PM2.5 - the tiny particles that form smog - on human health, though foreign researchers say the evidence was available. Some foreign studies suggest pollution could cause more than 1 million premature deaths a year in China. Last year, staff at a monitoring station in the northwestern city of Xi'an were accused of tampering with equipment to reduce emissions measurements. Beijing promises "zero tolerance" on statistical fraud, and has brought as many as 1,436 local monitoring stations under central government control. It also uses satellite imagery to check local governments' data accuracy. But individuals are prepared to enter a legal grey area by measuring emissions themselves. One mobile phone app, Air Matters, with over 9 million subscribers, got into trouble from at least one local government for crunching official data in alternative ways. And the government itself is starting to use data from private citizens. Monitoring water pollution presents even tougher challenges, says Ma at the IPE, noting the high cost of measuring equipment.     KeyWords Beijing smoke control   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Too soon to evaluate outcome of Astana talks: Syrian diplomat Justice minister in Azerbaijan to promote legal cooperation President back home from Persian Gulf tour Iran dismisses Erdogan’s allegations of Tehran’s interference in Iraq, Syria Iranophobia plot hatched by common foes of Islam, regional Arab countries: Rouhani AFC gives overview of Iran’s Zob Ahan Esfahan Iran beats Poland in Persian Beach Soccer Cup Iran’s Amiri/Sadeqi advance to Kish Island 3-Star main draw Velayati warns of plots to partition Iraq Tehran: Erdogan’s anti-Iran remarks made in emotional atmosphere Most Visited CIA honors Saudi crown prince with 'George Tenet Medal' UK officials drop plan for Trump to address Parliament ‘Frustrated’ Trump’s insistence on Muslim ban ‘unconstitutional’: Analyst www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/0477 sec

Foxconn was not comfortable in funding the set up of a manufacturing facility in India unless the import duties imposed in India were cheaper than those in China and hence the state government was in a way forced to make the offer and give the assurance to the manufacturing giant Foxconn. American technology company Apple also wanted to manufacture in India and hence made similar offers of duty exemptions and tax concessions to manufacture their products in India. The inter-ministerial panel was formed by the central government to look into matters such as these. Had the inter-ministerial panel paid heed to Apple’s offer and concern and waived off the duty or offered tax exemptions it would have benefitted Foxconn as well. However, there are questions as to whether Maharashtra can give such concessions under GST. “From a manufacturing point of view, the revenue generated can be incentivised to state GST, but only for the products consumed within the state. If they think that manufacturing activity is generating employment opportunity and other benefits to the state, they can offer other incentives, but for that they will have to dip into their own pockets, “said Bipin Sapra, an indirect tax expert at consulting firm EY told the Economic Times.

The Beijing-based company remains the world's largest PC maker, but has been trying to broaden its smartphone business as the market for personal computers fizzles. But it has struggled to keep pace with Apple and Android rivals. Shares in Lenovo Group were down more than five percent at HK$4.95 ($0.64) in early afternoon trading. Net profits fell by 67 percent year-on-year to US$98 million in the third quarter, the company said in a statement. That came in well short of analysts' estimates by Bloomberg which on average predicted profits of $145.9million. Revenues were also down six percent compared with a year earlier. "Lenovo faced sizeable challenges in its three main lines of business, namely data centre, mobile devices, and PCs and smart devices," the firm said. The company is battling as consumers opt for smartphones instead of PCs. Rising component prices are also weighing on profits. Sales of the firm's Moto and Lenovo branded phones slipped 23 percent year-on-year in the three months to December. Its data centre business, which includes servers, storage, software and services also took a 20 percent dive in sales compared with the previous year. However, Lenovo's PC and smart device business, which includes tablets, still saw sales gains of two percent year on year. That was spurred by strong growth in North America, the company said. US firms HP and Dell follow Lenovo as leaders in the global PC market. All three increased their share of the market in the final quarter of last year, according to industry trackers. Lenovo announced in January that it is launching a "Smart Assistant" which recognises user's voices to conduct tasks including web searches and playing music. The firm is also in talks over a potential merger with Japan's struggling PC maker Fujitsu.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 16 February 2017 | MYT 2:09 PM Huawei said to plan its own voice assistant for smartphones by mark gurman Ambitious plans: A file photo of Huawei's mobile phones. The company is working on an assistant that would communicate in Chinese languages and target domestic users while continuing to work with Google and Amazon's Alexa service outside China, a source said. — Reuters Huawei Technologies Co, the third-largest smartphone maker, is preparing to enter the competitive world of digital assistants with its own voice-powered service, people familiar with the matter said.  A team of more than a hundred engineers is in the early stages of developing the technology at its Shenzhen, China offices, one of the people said. The efforts are extensive and are aimed at Apple Inc's Siri, Amazon.com Inc's Alexa, and Alphabet Inc's Google Assistant, not smaller players, the person said.  Huawei's assistant would communicate in Chinese languages and target domestic users while the company will continue to work with Google and Amazon's Alexa service outside China, a one of the other people said. They asked not to be identified as the details are private.   Building its own answer to Siri may help Huawei devices stand out in a crowded Chinese market, where many Google services that come with the dominant Android smartphone operating system are blocked.   Huawei is targeting US$33bil (RM147.08bil) in sales from its consumer business this year. The company trails only Apple and Samsung Electronics Co in global smartphone shipments as it pushes upmarket with premium features.   Having a major Android device manufacturer choose to build a voice assistant in-house may throw another wrench in Google's plans. Huawei last month announced it would use Alexa on its Mate 9 smartphones in the US. Currently, the Google Assistant only runs on Google's Pixel smartphone, Home speaker and smartwatches running the latest version of the Android Wear software. The largest online search company is trying to get third-party device makers to pre-install its assistant, according to people familiar with the talks.  Spokespeople for Huawei and Google declined to comment.   Huawei is not the first Android device manufacturer to develop its own service over using Google's.   Samsung acquired Viv Labs last year, a startup formed by some Siri founders, to serve as the basis for its own voice assistant. Samsung plans to release the first devices with this new technology later this year. Chinese search giant Baidu Inc announced its own voice service in 2015. — Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Technology Related Stories You May Be Interested Apple struggles to make big deals, hampering strategy shifts Clash of Clans maker profit up despite Pokemon challenge Stand up to cancer Apple hunts for the app stars of the future with new show Spotify expands with World Trade Centre move Yahoo notifies users of sophisticated breach methods Others Also Read Embassy tight-lipped on death of Jong-nam Only hard work can save Foxes from drop, says Pearson advertisement Latest News DBS profit slumps to two-year low on oil and gas bad debts Maybank Indonesia posts record earnings in FY16 Ukraine says Russian state hackers using new viruses for attacks Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Pokémon Go: The universe expands Most Viewed in Tech Pokémon Go: The universe expands Nokia 3310 on the comeback trail: report Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra Stand up to cancer Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Lenovo’s profit misses estimates after PC rivals erode lead Smartphone maker Huawei catching up on Samsung, Apple: study Apple struggles to make big deals, hampering strategy shifts China’s Huawei, Philippine telco join forces in 5G deal Yahoo notifies users of sophisticated breach methods Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

If they'd included a trap door at the bottom of the gimmicky escalator that would have improved things immensely. I'm not sure that Carpool Karaoke will be entirely successful without James Corden at the wheel though. Part of the charm of the sketches is his urbanity.

By Rene Ritchie Tuesday, Feb 14, 2017 at 10:18 am EST 5 Comments Project Phoenix aims to reignite Twitterrific for Mac — and you can help make it happen! Twitterrific was the first Twitter client for Mac — for anything. It gave us the bird icon and much of the early culture surrounding Twitter, especially in the Apple community. It gave us a start. And now Twitteriffic for Mac wants to give us a re-start. But it needs a little help. From the brand-new Kickstarter: This project is to fund a reboot of Twitterrific for Mac (codename: Phoenix) and let Ollie the Twitterrific bird emerge from the ashes of his former self.

Some of Twitterrific's functionality on iOS can be shared with this new Mac app, but even though that will save us some effort, creating a new app from scratch is not a simple process. In the long run, we'd like to bring Twitterrific for Mac to feature-parity with the iOS app, but before that can happen we need a solid foundation to build upon. More features are planned for updates as well, if they beat their goal and make it into the stretches. You can get in on the ground floor for just $15, which includes a copy of the final release, currently scheduled for August 2017. Pledges top out at $1000, which includes hand painted art from the legendary David Lanham, your name in the credits, and more. (No word yet on what a dance with Hockenberry at WWDC will cost you...) The Iconfactory are literally icons of our industry. They've made visual interface elements for some of the biggest operating systems and social networks on the planet and icons for many of the apps you use every day.

Share Tweet No matter how many fucks and meth jokes you put in them, they’re still lame—those schmaltzy, nugget-of-non-wisdom life-lesson arcs that middling studio comedies force audiences to endure in exchange for whatever laughs were already in the trailer. Did anyone buy a ticket to Central Intelligence, Office Christmas Party, Sex Tape, or any other randomly picked title because they really wanted to see the characters learn to stand up for themselves, put family and friends first, or get that promotion? Only a masochist would. But the rule still holds that, in broad terms, the mainstream of film comedy consists of indifferently formulaic, atrociously paced family and work dramas in which the characters are always stopping to talk about what just happened. Often, there are jokes, but through a critic’s They Live glasses, they all read as, “Look at the thing. Buy Apple products.” Or, “I am a supporting character with no social filter. Blurt, blurt, blurt. Time for drugs.” Fist Fight, which stars Ice Cube and Charlie Day as feuding schoolteachers, is no different in this respect, and can’t be accused of anything beyond an industry-wide shoddiness. It’s set on the last day of school at a cash-strapped high school in the Atlanta suburbs, where graduating seniors have a tradition of playing elaborate pranks (an idea that yields surprisingly few gags), the faculty ranges from buffoonish to psychotic, and nobody sounds like they’re from the South. After the nebbishy English teacher Mr. Campbell (Day) gets the short-tempered, prank-hating history teacher Mr. Strickland (Cube) fired to protect his own job amid budget cuts, Strickland challenges him to a fight in the school parking lot. With shades of the ’80s teen comedy Three O’Clock High, Campbell spends the day trying to weasel his way out of this 3 p.m. appointment. It’s a quintessential latter-day studio comedy, in that the premise gets completely lost in self-actualization subplots that nobody (filmmakers included) gives two shits about and that the characters do a lot of pointing. Sometimes it’s the incredulous “Who, me?” point-to-self, sometimes it’s the “Over there!” or the “I’m on to you.” Nowhere is the index finger wielded as indiscriminately as it is in lackluster comedies. Fist Fight basically has two good gags: the tireless mariachi band hired by pranking seniors to follow the principal (Dean Norris) around and the sheer amount of bodily harm inflicted in the eventual showdown between Campbell and Strickland. The rest depends on the presumably improvised ramblings of assorted kooks: a golf-cart-driving security guard (Kumail Nanjiani), an incompetent coach (Tracy Morgan, with noticeable post-accident scars), and a guidance counselor (Jillian Bell) with a meth habit and the mind-set of a sexual predator. Photo: Warner Bros. Bell’s spun advisor ends up making a better foil than the glowering, one-note Strickland, a character who is somehow less well-developed than the broad parody of hardass black police captain stock types that Cube played in 21 Jump Street and its sequel. Day’s Campbell, however, has the misfortune of being the straight man protagonist, which means that he must learn to stand up for himself, become a better husband and father, and overcome embarrassment at a talent show (at a different school, no less) before he finally trades blows with his rival. In there, he also finds time to make a trip to the Apple store, attempt to frame Strickland for drug dealing, and get arrested and released without his boss noticing. He also has a due-any-minute pregnant wife (JoAnna Garcia Swisher) and financial troubles, though nothing that happens in Fist Fight suggests any relationship to the realities of money or the human body, or even the basic rules of space and time. But who cares, right? The fact is that moviegoers deserve a better class of comedy, or at least movies that aren’t composed of one part recycled three-act filler and one part vamping. As is too often the case, there are the makings of a diverting comedy in here: the pranks, the pathologically inept teachers and school staff, the more-than-capable cast. But they’re executed with a minimum of inspiration and packaged in conventions that are neither sincere nor funny—ironic for a movie whose characters are constantly complaining about substandard materials and cut corners.

New York City second most expensive place on the planet to rent behind San Francisco The Big Apple is the second most expensive city to rent behind San Francisco Both are more expensive than the most expensive place to rent internationally: Hong Kong A single New Yorker will on average pay $1,994 a month; a family $3,783 a month  By Kiri Blakeley For Dailymail.com Published: 01:09 EST, 16 February 2017 | Updated: 01:19 EST, 16 February 2017 e-mail 10 shares 6 View comments New York City is known as the city that never sleeps, and maybe that's because people are worried about their rent. The skyscraper city is the second most expensive city for renters in the world, according to a new report. London-based real estate brokerage Nested says that New York is only slightly behind San Francisco as the most financially onerous to renters. New York City (above) is the second most expensive city in the world, behind San Francisco NYC's distinct neighborhoods, such as Chinatown, above, make it a popular place to live San Francisco's homes are beautiful - but not cheap. The city is the most expensive place to rent in the US A New York City apartment on average will cost a family $3,783 a month The country's tech capital, San Francisco, is the most expensive city for renters The average monthly rental for a single New Yorker is $1,994 and its $3,783 for a family, says the report. That's only slightly behind San Francisco, where rents have skyrocketed thanks to being a tech hub, home to hundreds of technology companies including Google, eBay and Apple (Facebook is an hour away in Menlo Park).  If you're a single person in the city of angels, you'll pay on average $2,077.96 a month. A family will have to shell out $3,942.82 a month. Rents are $4.95 per square foot for San Francisco and $4.75 for New York City.  Boston, above, home to Harvard, is the third most expensive city to rent  Washington DC, the capital and political hub, is the third most expensive city  New York has long been known for its sky high rents, with people renting out apartments that are little bigger than large closets for prices that would bring them a house elsewhere in the country.  The city's steep rental prices have no doubt been fueled by the many industries people come here to work in, including fashion, retail, finance, entertainment, media and technology. Seattle,  Prices for former second-class cousin borough Brooklyn have also soared in the past couple of decades.  If the rent in New York City is too damn high, rounding out the top five are college town Boston, political mecca Washington, DC, and progressive haven Seattle. After that comes Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, and Houston. Rounding out the top ten is Detroit, which despite all of the negative press it's gotten lately for its soaring crime, beat out cities like Austin, Atlanta, Portland, and Philadelphia. Globally, the most expensive city was Hong Kong, followed by Dubai, Singapore, Geneva and Sydney. Of the fifty cities listed, Barcelona, Spain was the cheapest place to rent.    Share or comment on this article e-mail 10 shares Most watched News videos Moment ISIS suicide attacker detonates bomb near Syrian rebels Dog CRIES after being told off for chewing sofa into pieces Redback spider catches brown snake in it's web and attacks it Terrifying moment deadly Chicago ambush captured on Facebook live Shocking moment a model poses on the ledge of very tall skyscraper Final moments of radio broadcast before Dominican Rep DJ shot dead Social Experiment: Would you breastfeed a stranger's baby?

I've written quite a bit about CSV processing. It crops up in my books. A lot. In all cases, though, I make the implicit assumption that my readers already know a lot of Python. This is a disservice to anyone who's getting started. Getting Started You'll need Python 3.6. Nothing else will do if you're starting out. Go here to find it. You can get the small "Miniconda" version to start with. It has some of what you'll need to hack around with CSV files. The full Anaconda version contains a mountain of cool stuff, but it's a big download. Once you have Python installed, what next? To be sure things are running do this: Find a command line prompt (terminal window, cmd.exe, whatever it's called on your OS.)
Enter python3.6 (or just python in Windows.)
If Anaconda installed everything properly, you'll have an interaction that looks like this: MacBookPro-SLott:Python2v3 slott$ python3.5

Python 3.5.1 (v3.5.1:37a07cee5969, Dec  5 2015, 21:12:44)  [GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. >>> More-or-less. (Yes, the example shows 3.5.1 even though I said you should get 3.6. As soon as the Lynda.com course drops, I'll upgrade. The differences between 3.5 and 3.6 are almost invisible.) Here's your first interaction: >>> 355 / 113 3.1415929203539825 >>> 355 / 113 3.1415929203539825 Here's some more. >>> exit Use exit() or Ctrl - D(i.e.EOF) to exit >>> exit() Okay. That was fun. But it's not data wrangling. When do we get to the good stuff? To Script or Not To Script We have two paths when it comes to scripting. You can write script files and run them. This is pretty normal application development stuff. It works well. Or, you can use a Jupyter Notebook. This isn't exactly a script, but you can use it like a script. It's a good place to start building some code that's useful. You can rerun some (or all) of the notebook to make it script-like. If you downloaded Anaconda, you have Jupyter. Done. Skip over the next part that covers installing Jupyter. Installing Jupyter If you did not download the full Anaconda -- perhaps because you used the Miniconda -- you'll need to add Jupyter.  You can use the 'conda command' installer for this. Another choice is to use the PIP program to install Jupyter. The net effect is the same. It starts like this: MacBookPro-SLott:Python2v3 slott$ pip3 install jupyter

What just happened? You installed a large number of Python packages. All of those packages were required to run Jupyter. You can see jupyter-1.0.0 hidden in the list of packages that were installed. Starting Jupyter The Jupyter tool does a number of things. We're going to use the notebook feature to save some code that we can rerun. We can also save notes and do other things in the notebook. When you start the notebook, two things will happen. The terminal window will start displaying the Jupyter console log. A browser will pop open showing the local Jupyter notebook home page. Here's what the console log looks like: MacBookPro-SLott:Python2v3 slott$ jupyter notebook [I 08:51:56.746 NotebookApp] Writing notebook server cookie secret to /Users/slott/Library/Jupyter/runtime/notebook_cookie_secret [I 08:51:56.778 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /Users/slott/Documents/Writing/Python/Python2v3 [I 08:51:56.778 NotebookApp] 0 active kernels  [I 08:51:56.778 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at: http://localhost:8888/?token=2eb40fbb96d7788dd05a49600b1fca4e07cd9c8fe931f9af [I 08:51:56.778 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation). You can glance at it to see that things are still working. The "Use Control-C to stop this server" is a reminder of how to stop things when you're done. Your Jupyter home page will have this logo in the corner. Things are working. You can pick files from this list and edit them. And -- important for what we're going to do -- you can create new notebooks. On the right side of the webpage, you'll see this: You can create files and folders. That's cool. You can create an interactive terminal session. That's also cool. More important, though, is that you can create a new Python 3 notebook. That's where we'll wrangle with CSV files. "But Wait," you say. "What directory is it using for this?" The Jupyter server is using the current working directory when you started it. If you don't like this choice, you have two alternatives.  Stop Jupyter. Change the directory to your preferred place to keep files. Restart Jupyter. Stop Jupyter. Include the --notebook-dir=your_working_directory option. The second choice looks like this: MacBookPro-SLott:Python2v3 slott$ jupyter notebook --notebook-dir=~/Documents/Writing/Python [I 11:15:42.964 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /Users/slott/Documents/Writing/Python Now you know where your files are going to be. You can make sure that your .CSV files are here. You will have your ".ipynb" files here also. Lots of goodness in the right place. Using Jupyter Here's what a notebook looks like. Here's a screen shot. First, the notebook was originally called "untitled" which seemed less than ideal. So I clicked on the name and changed it to "csv_westling." Second, there was a box labeled In [ ]:. I entered some Python code to the right of this label. Then I clicked the run cell icon (it's similar to this emoji --  ⏯ -- but not exactly). The In [ ]: changed to In [1]:. A second box appeared labeled Out [1]:. This annotates our dialog with Python: each input and Python's response is tracked. It's pretty nice. We can change our input and rerun the cell. We can add new cells with different things to run. We can run all of the cells. Lots of things are possible based on this idea of a cell with our command. When we run a cell, Python processes the command and we see the output. For many expressions, a value is displayed.  For some expressions, however, nothing is displayed. For complete statements, nothing is displayed. This means we'll often have to throw the name of a variable in so that we can see the value of that variable. The rest of the notebook is published separately. It's awkward to work in Blogger when describing a Jupyter notebook. It's much easier to simply post the notebook in GitHub. The notebook is published here. You can follow the notebook to build your own copy which reads and writes CSV files.

Twitter/BlackBerry Blackberry's overall smartphone OS market share in Q4 2016 was 0.0481 percent. According to research firm Gartner, the smartphone company only sold 207,900 units out of about 432 million units sold worldwide. According to the Gartner Q4 2016 report, it did not include the smartphone's handsets that run Android. However, even if the Android handsets were included, the total number of units sold was still low. When compared to the Q2 2016, the number has dropped as the company sold about 400,000 units. In the Q3 2016 report, the smartphone's operating system showed a global market share of 0.1 percent. Its equivalent was 377,800 devices sold during that period. Alex Thurber, senior vice president of global sales, said that the company would still invest in its mobile operating system BB10. The company did not release any phone running BB10 OS. "BB10 has a strong following around the world in enterprise and government, as well as consumers in particular markets. I want to make sure that our customers and users don't get concerned that we're not continuing to support and invest in BB10 because we absolutely are," Thurber told the Financial Post. Google dominated the OS sales as the company sold 352.7 million smartphones running Android. The company's global market share was 81.7 percent. Apple iOS was ranked in second place for its market share of 17.9 percent. Apple sold 77 million units in Q4 2016. In Gartner's worldwide smartphone sales to end users by vendor., it showed that Apple sold 77,038 million devices having a market share of 17.9 percent. The company ranked number one in this category. However, the report showed that there was only 256,000 units difference between Samsung that ranked in second place. Samsung sold 76,782 million devices with a market share of 17.8 percent. Samsung's Q4 2015 report showed that it sold 83,437 million devices. "This is the second consecutive quarter in which Samsung has delivered falling quarterly smartphone sales. Samsung's smartphone sales declined 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 and its share dropped by 2.9 percentage points year on year," Anshul Gupta, research director at Gartner, said. Gupta said Apple achieved the strong sales in Q4 2016 because of iPhone 7 and iPhone Plus. It also benefited from the mature markets in North America, Western Europe, Asia, Australia and South Korea with a weakened demand on Samsung handsets.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India Elections World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Budget 2017 Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Moto G5, G5 Plus listed on e-commerce site; promo images, key features revealed ahead of MWC 2017 launch Though there are no similarities between Moto G5 and Moto G4 series, the circular camera module on the former looks identical to flagship Moto Z (2016) series. Rohit KVN   February 16, 2017 10:21 IST Moto G5, G5 Plus listed on e-commerce; Promo images, key features revealed ahead of MWC 17 launchReuters Promotional images of Lenovo's upcoming Moto G5 (& G5 Plus) series have surfaced online, revealing almost every aspect of the device, be it design or the key features.  K-Tronix, an e-commerce site, inadvertently listed the un-released Moto G5 series revealing that the Moto G5 and the G5 Plus will come in all-metal body with IP67 certification (can survive close to 3 feet under-water for up to 30 minutes). Also read: Here's how Apple plans to place big battery in iPhone 8 (aka iPhone X), yet keep iPhone 7 form factor In the photos, both the Moto G5 series models have the same physical attributes. They are smaller in stature with 5.0-inch and 5.2-inch screen sizes, respectively. Its predecessor G4 series, both the generic and the Plus models, had 5.5-inch display. This year's models have also undergone a complete make-over in terms of design language. Though there are no similarities to the Moto G4 series, the circular camera module looks identical to flagship Moto Z (2016) series. It features a smooth cover and blends seamlessly with the metallic frame around the edges. It also houses the iconic dimple with batwing logo inside. On the front, it sports a camera on top right corner, single-grille speaker at centre with 'moto' branding and below, we see a curved rectangular physical home button, which we believe will also double up as the fingerprint sensor. The similarities between the G5 and the G5 Plus end there. And, as their names suggest, the latter is a top-end model and comes with superior internal hardware. Moto G5 sports 5.0-inch full HD screen and comes with Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 octa-core CPU backed by 2GB RAM, 32GB internal storage, a 2,800mAh battery with Rapid charging feature, 13MP camera on the back and a 5MP snapper on the front. On the other hand, Moto G5 Plus flaunts a 5.2-inch full HD display with Gorilla Glass 3 shield and features superior Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 octa-core SoC (System-on-Chip) with 2GB RAM, 64GB in-built memory, 12MP camera with dual autofocus, a 5MP front shooter and a bigger 3,000mAh cell with Turbo charging technology.

Zandy Mangold More On: immigrants Mexican official chased off parking lot, threatened with arrest Conway: Why isn't media covering their 'immigrant first lady'? Dozens of immigrants arrested in NYC during raids: leaked memo Hundreds of immigrants arrested in 'enforcement surge' Restaurants in the Big Apple and other major US cities may be short-handed on Thursday. Immigrant food-service workers are planning a work stoppage and protest in a number of cities, including New York and Washington, DC. “A day without immigrants” reads a flyer in Spanish that has been widely distributed. It goes on: “Dear President, without our support this country will be paralyzed.” The workers and many employers who support them, including celebrity chef Tom Colicchio and the owners of Blue Ribbon in New York, are voicing their anger over anti-immigrant rhetoric during the election campaign and since the Jan. 20 inauguration of President Trump. “We support our people and want them to be heard,” said Doug Griebel, chairman of Rosa Mexicano, a chain of more than 15 eateries. “It’s a tough situation because we also want enough staff in our restaurants.” Some restaurateurs, including Eric and Bruce Bromberg, who own more than half a dozen Blue Ribbon outlets, are planning to close most of their NYC eateries for the day due to an expected shortage of workers.

DESIGN McDonald's Unveils a Silly New Tech Innovation That's Actually Kinda Cool McDonald's taps big-name product designers and engineers to shake things up. By Betsy Mikel Betsy Mikel is the owner of Aveck, a content consultancy that helps businesses big and small solve word problems of all sorts. She writes about innovation, creativity, entrepreneurship, and technology. Mikel holds a journalism degree from the University of Missouri, Columbia. @BetsyM Owner, Aveck@BetsyM WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement The internet's abuzz with McDonald's latest announcement. It's not all-day breakfast (ICYMI, that's already a thing). And no, they're not making the McRib a menu staple. It's tech-y. It's design-y. It's a new straw. McDonald's has dubbed this innovation as the Suction Tube for Reverse Axial Withdrawal (a.k.a. STRAW). That's right, the world's largest fast food company is now investing in straw technology. McDonald's even hired a whip-smart team of engineers and designers to invent this new straw from scratch. They're clearly having a bit of fun with it. For starters, McDonald's unabashedly mimicked Apple in how they broadcasted the announcement. They tapped YouTube tech star Austin Evans to announce the straw on Facebook Live. Evans presented the straw in sleek packaging, not unlike the box your iPhone arrives in. He then led the design and engineering team in a tongue-in-cheek Q&A session, inviting Facebook users to comment and participate for a chance to win one. CREDIT: Photo courtesy of McDonald’s Why McDonald's thought the straw was ripe for innovation But you're probably wondering: What's wrong with a regular old straw? For a regular old shake, a regular old straw works just fine. But this season, McDonald's shook things up by adding a two-toned number to their Shamrock Shake repertoire -- chocolate on the bottom, mint on the top. With standard straw technology, it's impossible to sip both flavors at once. So McDonald's brought in the best-of-the-best product designers and aerospace engineers. The managing partners of NK Labs and JACE Design -- the same engineers and designers who worked on Google's Project Ara together -- came together to solve this perplexing problem. Could they design a new straw that would allow simultaneously sipping of the bottom chocolate shake layer and the top Shamrock Shake layer? "It's one of those things that seems so simple, but as we got into it there were a lot more issues exposed," NK Labs managing partner Seth Newburg told Fast Company. "It turned out to present quite a few engineering and scientific challenges." One major challenge? Shakes ultimately melt. So the straw had to account for a change in viscosity. What's more, the design had to work well whether the shake was full, half-consumed or nearly finished. At all stages of shake consumption, as-close-to-equal doses of both flavors had to enter the sipper's mouth. The team had solved complex engineering problems before. They had designed aviation components, robotic submarines and smartphones. But sometimes the simplest of problems are the most complicated to solve. So they went back to the drawing board to design a straw that would solve the two-layered problem. Whiteboarding, brainstorming, prototyping and a heck of a lot of Shamrock Shake taste testing led to the final design: a J-shaped straw with strategically placed holes on the bottom and sides. CAD models and 3D printing were employed to get the design just right. Engadget described the McDonald's STRAW as "a snorkel for your Shamrock Shake." Fast Company's Mark Wilson got his hands on one and described its shape as "a saxophone, or a fish hook, with fluted holes." Whatever it is, it's certainly something different. And does it work? Only a select few will get to find out for themselves. McDonald's is distributing the straw with Shamrock Shakes in 80 cities to start. If people like what they sip, McDonald's may roll out the straw to more markets. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.

CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Uber CEO Travis Kalanick is set to meet with Rev. Jesse Jackson "in the near future" to discuss the company's diversity initiatives ahead of its looming expansion into Oakland. The meeting was confirmed Wednesday by an Uber spokeswoman. Over the last couple of years, Jackson has been putting public pressure on major tech firms to disclose the demographics of their workforces and make commitments to improve the hiring of minorities and women. Uber has been one of the most notable companies not to release these figures or make public its efforts to improve diversity. Jackson zeroed in on Uber in January. The civil rights leader gave the tech company a deadline of Feb. 15 to create a program and make a commitment to reflect the diverse demographics of Oakland. Uber has yet to release these figures, but the company has been in touch with Jackson's Rainbow Push organization over the last few weeks. A spokesman for Jackson told Inc. that he will meet with the ride-hailing company around the time of Apple's shareholder meeting, which is scheduled for Feb. 28 in Cupertino, Calif. Jackson is an Apple stockholder. With Uber planning to move about 2,300 employees to Oakland as soon as this year, local organizations in the Bay Area city have also been calling on the company to release its diversity figures and make a commitment to hiring diverse local talent.

ROS LBoard 1 Gobind: Clear direction, agreement needed to challenge BN FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Smoke and mirrors – Beijing battles to control smog message Reuters | February 16, 2017 The government also worries that alternative sources of information on pollution levels could erode public trust in official statistics, and undermine its message that the environment is improving. SHANGHAI: In its ‘war’ on hazardous air pollution, China’s government has a dilemma: it needs to be open about air quality data to hold polluters to account, but worries that too much bad news from alternative, independent sources could stoke public unrest. Beijing has greatly improved how it collects data, made more of it available to the public and cracked down on misreporting, but it’s concerned about the spread of unauthorised or inaccurate data from popular mobile apps and handheld detectors. The conflicting approach reflects a broader debate about China’s appetite for political reform. The Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP), under a former academic, wants to create a modern regulatory system based on independent monitoring and the rule of law, but that could rub up against the ruling Communist Party’s priority for stability. After scandals about fraudulent data, the government also worries that alternative sources of information on pollution levels could erode public trust in official statistics, and undermine its message that the environment is improving. Liam Bates, CEO of Origins Technology, which produces the Laser Egg handheld pollution monitor sold in Beijing’s Apple store, said China has no problem with people measuring air quality; it just doesn’t want the findings to be published. “Basically (China) says it’s illegal to publish data from non-official sources. As far as I know there’s nothing about collecting data, or processing data and using it for research,” he said. China says its main concern is accuracy. In 2014, it ordered mobile phone pollution apps to drop data provided by the United States embassy and its consulates, concerned it might differ from its own. More recently, apps came under scrutiny for trying to give a more detailed picture than the government of China’s air quality. In one recent example of what the government calls “rumour mongering” by individuals, a man was detained by police for five days in Chengdu in the southwest after he warned on his Weibo microblog that the city faced its “heaviest smog in its 2,000-year history”, local media reported. Regulators also accused one air pollution monitoring app of spreading rumours by providing data in December indicating Chengdu was the third most polluted city in the world. While China’s short-staffed environmental watchdogs are keen to involve the public in enforcing standards, authorities are wary that social media-driven protests against chemical plants, waste incinerators or nuclear processing facilities could trigger protests. “In general, there is hope at the provincial and ministerial level that they will not try to shut down all these other sources, but what they’re really concerned about is that they will show something that isn’t scientific,” said Ma Jun, director of the Institute for Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE), a non-government organisation campaigning for greater transparency. “This is a challenge in this era of mobile internet and social media,” he noted. The MEP did not respond to a faxed request for comment. Gaps Despite progress on official information disclosure, led, Ma says, by the environment ministry, there are still gaps, with agencies like the National Development and Reform Commission lagging and some local governments “reluctant and resistant”. China still does not give out data for climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions, and offers only incomplete heavy metal pollution figures – a sensitive issue following food scandals in rice-growing regions. There is also reluctance to allow the free publication of sensitive data on the health impact of pollution. There is no database on the health impact from pollution that companies, say, could access to help them decide where to locate staff. While Chinese media have cited foreign studies on the correlation between smog and mortality – including the heavy death toll in London in the winter of 1952-53 – there have been few equivalent Chinese studies. As winter pollution gripped much of northern China last month, the health ministry told state media it had no data linking smog to cancer, and it was too early to reach any conclusions about the impact of PM2.5 – the tiny particles that form smog – on human health, though foreign researchers say the evidence was available. “The centres for disease control have this kind of data,” said Dan Greenbaum of the Health Effects Institute, which has studied the links between pollution and health. Some foreign studies suggest pollution could cause more than 1 million premature deaths a year in China. Public distrust Despite doing more than many countries to make real-time air quality data publicly available, China has yet to overcome public scepticism about official statistics. Recent cases of fraud have not helped. Last year, staff at a monitoring station in the northwestern city of Xi’an were accused of tampering with equipment to reduce emissions measurements. Beijing promises “zero tolerance” on statistical fraud, and has brought as many as 1,436 local monitoring stations under central government control. It also uses satellite imagery to check local governments’ data accuracy. But individuals are prepared to enter a legal grey area by measuring emissions themselves. One mobile phone app, Air Matters, with over 9 million subscribers, got into trouble from at least one local government for crunching official data in alternative ways. And the government itself is starting to use data from private citizens. The IPE has its own app that allows users to report pollution on the ground, and the environment ministry feeds that information into its own official reporting platform. Monitoring water pollution presents even tougher challenges, says Ma at the IPE, noting the high cost of measuring equipment. “They (regulators) want the data to be the right data when it gets published. The next challenge will be (to see) who will be qualified to provide third-party monitoring services.” “My gut feeling is that it will be no longer totally closed, but they want a more controlled opening of this space.” Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

Name: Subject: Message: Huawei may add to the already crowded field of voice-based digital assistants Newsby John Callaham5 hours ago 8 423 4 Are you ready to use yet another digital assistant? If you live in China, you may get that chance. A new report claims Huawei is working on its own voice-based AI service, which would compete with other similar products, including Apple’s Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft’s Cortana and Amazon’s Alexa. See also: Huawei CEO Richard Yu talks new partnerships, growth in interview at CES 2017 January 6, 2017 The report from Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, claims that Huawei is in the early stages of developing the voice assistant, but it still has over 100 people actively working on it. The assistant will only be used in China, according to the article. Huawei will work with other companies to add third-party AI services when it offers its phones outside the country. Huawei already plans to add support for Alexa to its Mate 9 phone in the US, via a software update that’s planned for release sometime in March. Even though this report says Huawei’s in-house voice assistant will only be used in China, that’s still a massive market for smartphones. It may mean that Google Assistant, which currently is only used in the company’s Pixel and Pixel XL phones, won’t be available for future Huawei Android handsets in that country. That could be a big loss for Google, as it is reportedly trying to get Assistant pre-installed on more third-party devices. Huawei is not the only Android phone maker developing its own AI outside of Google. Samsung will reportedly debut its Bixby assistant as part of the the launch of its Galaxy S8 phone in April. What do you think of Huawei making its own voice-assistant service in China? Do you think it could find its way to other markets if it is successful in its home country? Are there simply way too many voice-based assistants being made? Let us know what you think of this already crowded field that’s looks like it’s about to get even more crowded in the comments!

Bouncing between historian, self-promoter and motivational speaker, the Oaks Christian School founder told a crowd of more than 100 inside CLU’s Lundring Events Center that the nation was approaching a point of no return. A return from what? It wasn’t clear. “We are right now cresting on that point, we are emotionally out of control as a country and as a people. We’re scared. We don’t want to admit it, and we are being led by somebody totally different,” he said. “What Uber did to taxis and Apple did to smartphones is what Donald Trump has done to the Republican party, presidential elections, polling, global governance and maybe even the financial global markets: He’s disrupted it; he’s changed it forever.” Unlike most speakers at the long-running economic breakfast who opt to stay behind the dais and stick to statistical analysis, Dallas grabbed the microphone and headed out into the audience for his portion of the keynote address. Event organizer Patrick McCoy called Dallas’ performance “a reflection of his strong passion and remarkable acumen in business matters.” “Bill’s ability to leave his chair and deliver up close a flamboyant and provocative speech really dazzled that early-morning audience,” McCoy said. The breakfast tradition, now 25 years old, brings together CLU’s Center for Economic Research and Forecasting and local leaders in the fields of public policy, finance and real estate to predict what’s in store for the regional economy. Matthew Fienup, CERF’s new executive director, said his organization predicted no major economic shift this year resulting from a Trump presidency (its prediction was the same for a Hillary Clinton victory). CERF has historically been one of the more pessimistic forecasting outlets. “We’re the only economic forecast I’m aware of that’s saying no change,” Fienup said. “There are some saying positive change, there are some saying negative change . . . we’re saying no change. We expect that slow growth (of the past eight years) to continue.” He said CERF—which produces regular federal, state and regional forecasts—doesn’t believe Trump will be able to institute the major policy changes that could kickstart the economy, such as corporate tax and regulatory reform. If Trump were able to lower the corporate tax rate, for example, that change alone would force CERF to revise its forecast upward, Fienup said. “Lowering federal corporate tax rates and, in particular, allowing the repatriation of foreign earnings, would have a big positive impact,” the economist said. Regarding Trump’s impact on the California economy, Fienup said even a minor change to the Affordable Care Act could have major consequences in a state where one-third of residents receive subsidized healthcare coverage via MediCal. And Fienup said CERF agrees with research that suggests an increase to a $15-an-hour minimum wage will lead to massive job losses among lower-skilled workers. “We find evidence for very strong increases in the unemployment rate among that group,” he said. Shifting to the topic of Ventura County, Fienup shared a string of statistics to demonstrate how the local economy is failing to keep pace with neighboring counties. Ventura County, the economist said, is the only county in Southern California that has not returned to pre-recession (2008) job levels. “There were fewer people with jobs living in Ventura County last year than there were the year before. That is unprecedented in Ventura County for a non-recessionary economy,” he said. “And the jobs that are coming back are not the same ones that we lost,” Fienup added, saying the county is seeing fewer jobs in high-paying fields like finance and technology. Despite all of these factors, home prices in the county continue to rise, driven by a lack of supply and negative feelings about growth, Fienup said. Prices have returned to 90 percent of their levels before the housing crisis, he said. The combination—stagnant wages and higher housing costs— means only 26 percent of Ventura County residents can afford the cost of a median-priced home. “We would argue what needs to change is really attitudes about densification, infill development, attitudes about urban expansion,” Fienup said. “Not without any sustained development do we expect . . . to change direction in the years ahead.” Return to top Copyright © 2000-2017 J.Bee NP Publishing, Ltd., All Rights Reserved.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Charlie Munger, the billionaire vice chairman of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., said some of U.S. President Donald Trump's ideas may prove constructive for the country, tempering comments a year ago suggesting that his fellow Republican was not morally qualified for the White House. "Well, I've gotten more mellow," Munger said during Wednesday's annual meeting at the publishing company Daily Journal Corp. in Los Angeles, which he chairs. "He's not wrong on everything," said Munger, referring to Trump. "Just roll with it. If there's a little danger, what the hell, you're not going to live forever anyway." Munger, 93, spoke for nearly two hours to investors and students on a wide range of issues. He has been Buffett's right-hand man for decades, helping the 86-year-old build Berkshire into a roughly $410 billion conglomerate with more than 90 companies including insurers, utilities, food producers and a railroad. Berkshire also has large investments in dozens of stocks, including iPhone maker Apple Inc. and the four biggest U.S. carriers: American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc., Southwest Airlines Co. and United Continental Holdings Inc. On Tuesday, Berkshire revealed multi-billion-dollar stakes in all five companies, marking a reversal of its longstanding aversion to the technology sector and antipathy to the "joke" that Munger said airlines once were. Berkshire is now Apple's fifth-largest investor, and the largest or second largest investor in the four airlines. "The nice thing about the game we're in is that we can keep learning," Munger said. "He's changed when he's buying airlines, and he's changed when he's buying Apple," he said of Buffett. "I don't think we've gone crazy," Munger added. "I think we're adapting." Munger downplayed the impact of the recent scandal afflicting Wells Fargo & Co., in which Berkshire is the largest investor with a roughly 10 percent stake. Wells Fargo was caught flat-footed by the public outcry after it settled regulatory charges that workers created as many as 2 million sham customer accounts to meet sales goals. The scandal cost longtime Chief Executive John Stumpf his job. Munger said the bigger problem for Wells Fargo was not its sales culture, but how it reacted. "The mistake there was that when the bad news came, they didn't recognize it," Munger said. "I don't think that impairs the future of Wells Fargo." He was less definitive about the outlook of another big Berkshire holding, American Express Co., saying people would be in a "state of delusion" for thinking they could project the state of the payments system in a decade. Munger also defended his earlier faulting of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.'s business practices, including the Canadian drug company's model of acquiring rights to drugs and driving prices higher. Criticism and regulatory probes have caused Valeant's growth plan to unravel, and its share price to plunge more than 93 percent in a year-and-a-half. "It was really interesting how many high-grade people that took in," Munger said. "It was too good to be true." © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News. All rights reserved.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search iPhone 8’s 5.8-inch screen to have reserved function area JC Torres - Feb 15, 2017 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit The strange and mythical iPhone 8 just got even stranger and more mythical. According to famed KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the 10th anniversary edition of the iPhone will indeed have a 5.8-inch OLED display that will indeed take up almost all of the front of the device. That said, only 5.15 inches (in the diagonal) will actually be used for screen contents, says Kuo. The rest of the space is being reserved for a “function area” at the bottom that will house still unknown virtual buttons. That’s quite a lot to take in, if you think about it. It has already been theorized that iPhone 8 will provide an almost bezel-free face, in line with the trends these days. But to do so, Apple had to throw out the Home button as well as Touch ID. However, Kuo suggests you’d be mistaken if you think that all 5.8-inches will be devoted to a regular screen. Instead, there will be a strip at the bottom reserved for virtual buttons, a first for an iPhone. This is a rather new development in the iPhone 8 story and it still isn’t clear what these virtual buttons would do. One would most likely be devoted to the Home button, but it would be a terrible waste of space if that were the only virtual button there. There is a high likelihood that the area would be similar to the MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar, with buttons changing depending on the context or app. But the home button isn’t the only thing that the all-display feature has removed. Also gone is Touch ID but, contrary to common speculation, it won’t be replaced by an “under glass” fingerprint scanner. Instead, Kuo believes that the iPhone 8 will employ other biometric security systems in its stead, like iris or even facial recognition. All of these changes, especially the switch to an OLED screen, will make the iPhone 8 a terribly expensive affair.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries E-edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site 1985-Present 1831-1950 Residents surprised by Springfield public school facility situation Wednesday Feb 15, 2017 at 8:58 PM Feb 15, 2017 at 8:58 PM Jason Nevel Staff Writer @jasonnevelSJR The number of aging buildings, modules and cost for new construction were among the biggest surprises people gleaned Wednesday during the first in a series of community engagement sessions to gather input on a comprehensive facilities study of Springfield Public Schools. Around 50 people attended the 90-minute session at Springfield High School. The second session is scheduled for 6 p.m. Wednesday at Lanphier High School, 1300 N. 11th St. Springfield School Superintendent Jennifer Gill opened the session discussing the overall state of facilities in District 186. Gill said 27 of the 33 buildings were more than 50 years old and that the Springfield School District deploys 28 module classrooms at 13 schools. Gill also noted, to the surprise of many, new construction now costs $250 per square foot, compared to $19 when Washington Middle School was built in 1957. Gill praised work done to maintain buildings but noted equity varies greatly from school to school. For example, she said, many teachers in older buildings use a chalkboard and projector, while Enos Elementary School, opened in 2014, has Apple televisions. She also noted how some teachers at Lindsay Elementary work out of storage closets, gym space is limited at the middle and elementary schools, Lanphier High School does not have an auditorium and cafeterias at the middle schools are too small. “We are using every nook and cranny, but the spaces weren’t designed for what we need,” said Gill, who also noted the district estimates it will have to spend $98 million over the next 10 years to maintain facilities. Attendees broke into small groups after the presentation and discussed surprises, concerns and questions they had moving forward. A common theme that emerged from the small groups was how the district would pay for improvements and if the buildings could be remodeled rather than torn down. One resident, Sarah Mueth of Springfield, said she was interested in how the district would prioritize its needs. Also present Wednesday was staff from BLDD Architects, the firm District 186 hired to complete the study. BLDD previously worked with Decatur, Champaign and Normal school districts. Samuel Johnson from BLDD said the company uses a quantitative analysis to help the community decide if it would get more bang for its buck with new construction, a remodel or combination of both. As far as funding, Johnson said, a financing committee will determine the best possible revenue stream. “Whatever plan comes together, it will be accompanied by a financing plan,” he said. — Contact Jason Nevel: 788-1521, jason.nevel @sj-r.com, twitter.com/JasonNevelSJR.

A team of more than a hundred engineers is in the early stages of developing the technology at its Shenzhen, China offices, one of the people said. The efforts are extensive and are aimed at Apple Inc’s Siri, Amazon.com Inc’s Alexa, and Alphabet Inc’s Google Assistant, not smaller players, the person said. Huawei’s assistant would communicate in Chinese languages and target domestic users while the company will continue to work with Google and Amazon’s Alexa service outside China, a one of the other people said. They asked not to be identified as the details are private. Building its own answer to Siri may help Huawei devices stand out in a crowded Chinese market, where many Google services that come with the dominant Android smartphone operating system are blocked. Huawei is targeting US$33 billion (RM147 billion) in sales from its consumer business this year. The company trails only Apple and Samsung Electronics Co in global smartphone shipments as it pushes upmarket with premium features. Having a major Android device manufacturer choose to build a voice assistant in-house may throw another wrench in Google’s plans. Huawei last month announced it would use Alexa on its Mate 9 smartphones in the US. Currently, the Google Assistant only runs on Google’s Pixel smartphone, Home speaker and smartwatches running the latest version of the Android Wear software. The largest online search company is trying to get third-party device makers to pre-install its assistant, according to people familiar with the talks. Spokespeople for Huawei and Google declined to comment. Huawei is not the first Android device manufacturer to develop its own service over using Google’s. Samsung acquired Viv Labs last year, a startup formed by some Siri founders, to serve as the basis for its own voice assistant. Samsung plans to release the first devices with this new technology later this year. Chinese search giant Baidu Inc announced its own voice service in 2015. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week ‘Pokemon Go’ adds more than 80 new pocket monsters this week (VIDEO) Huawei said to plan own voice assistant for smartphones New Facebook job-hunting features challenge LinkedIn Yahoo notifies users of sophisticated breach methods BusyKid turns chores into child's play Focus on Vivo: Chinese smartphone maker known for audio quality, selfies Google brings virtual reality to updated Chrome mobile browser Algorithms: The managers of our digital lives Sony's new 4K Ultra HD TVs, Blu-ray player hit stores in March Apple TV eyes Amazon Fire TV's success Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Related Articles Smartphone maker Huawei catching up on Samsung, Apple Apple joins group devoted to keeping AI nice From Alexa to virtual reality: Highlights of CES 2017 Amazon Alexa virtual assistant shines at CES 2017 Google pushes virtual reality harder with new phones from partners Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

But one is getting attention thanks to his mugshot. Jeremy Meeks, also known online as the hot felon, has gone from the big house to the Big Apple where he’s quickly becoming the star of the show at New York Fashion Week. Jeremy isn’t your average high-fashion model. Look again, this time in slow motion. If he looks familiar — you’re not mistaken. Here’s his mug shot from 2014, following an arrest on weapons and gang-related charges in California. His picture went viral; the internet dubbing him the “hot felon.” Now, he’s getting a second chance of sorts, walking the catwalk at New York Fashion Week. Jeremy Meeks: “It’s a second chance, it might be my fourth, it might be my eighth.” Meeks is working with German fashion designer, Phillip Plein. Celebrities like Tiffany Trump taking in his show. Plein is known for his luxury clothing, edgy designs and out-of-the box thinking. His runway shows reflect the same sensibility. Phillip Plein, fashion designer: “I did it all in Europe. I killed Milan — I did the biggest shows ever in Milan. There is no one who could compete with us anymore, so the next step was to come to New York.” Plein, who’s just making his mark in the U.S., wanting to catch people’s attention. That’s part of the reason he took a chance on Meeks. Jeremy Meeks: “I’m a little nervous, but more excited.” The felon-turned-model celebrating his catwalk debut posting on social media. One in a fashionable outfit and another with Carine Roitfeld, the former editor-in-chief of Vogue Paris. This social media video showing Meeks moments before he struts his stuff. And also capturing his first walk down the runway. Now, people may start calling him — a smooth criminal. Copyright 2017 Sunbeam Television Corp. All rights reserved.

Beijing has greatly improved how it collects data, made more of it available to the public and cracked down on misreporting, but it is concerned about the spread of unauthorised or inaccurate data from popular mobile apps and hand-held detectors. The conflicting approach reflects a broader debate about China’s appetite for political reform. The Ministry of Environmental Protection, under a former academic, wants to create a modern regulatory system based on independent monitoring and the rule of law, but that could rub up against the ruling Communist Party’s priority for stability. Five Chinese lawyers sue local governments for failing to tackle smog After scandals about fraudulent data, the government also worries that alternative sources of information on pollution levels could erode public trust in official statistics and undermine its message that the environment is improving. Liam Bates, chief executive of Origins Technology, which produces the Laser Egg hand-held pollution monitor sold in Beijing’s Apple store, said China has no problem with people measuring air quality; it just doesn’t want the findings to be published. “Basically [China] says it’s illegal to publish data from non-official sources. As far as I know there’s nothing about collecting data, or processing data and using it for research,” he said. China says its main concern is accuracy. In 2014, it ordered mobile phone pollution apps to drop data provided by the United States embassy and its consulates, concerned it might differ from its own. More recently, apps came under scrutiny for trying to give a more detailed picture than the government of China’s air quality. In one recent example of what the government calls “rumour mongering” by individuals, a man was detained by police for five days in Chengdu in Sichuan province after he warned on his social media microblog that the city faced its “heaviest smog in its 2,000-year history”, local media reported. Regulators also accused one air pollution monitoring app of spreading rumours by providing data in December indicating Chengdu was the third most polluted city in the world. While China’s short-staffed environmental watchdogs are keen to involve the public in enforcing standards, the authorities are wary that social media-driven protests against chemical plants, waste incinerators or nuclear processing facilities could trigger protests. “In general, there is hope at the provincial and ministerial level that they will not try to shut down all these other sources, but what they’re really concerned about is that they will show something that isn’t scientific,” said Ma Jun, director of the Institute for Public and Environmental Affairs, a non-government organisation campaigning for greater transparency. “This is a challenge in this era of mobile internet and social media,” he noted. The environment ministry did not respond to a faxed request for comment. China mulls more curbs on coal, metal industries to combat smog Despite progress on official information disclosure, led, Ma says, by the environment ministry, there are still gaps, with agencies like the National Development and Reform Commission lagging behind and some local governments “reluctant and resistant”. China still does not give out data for climate warming carbon dioxide emissions and offers only incomplete heavy metal pollution figures, a sensitive issue following food scandals in rice-growing regions. There is also reluctance to allow the free publication of sensitive data on the health impact of pollution. There is no database on the health impact from pollution that companies, say, could access to help them decide where to locate staff. While Chinese media have cited foreign studies on the correlation between smog and mortality, including the heavy death toll in London in the winter of 1952-53, there have been few equivalent Chinese studies. As winter pollution gripped much of northern China last month, the health ministry told state media it had no data linking smog to cancer and it was too early to reach any conclusions about the impact of PM2.5, the tiny particles that form smog, on human health, although foreign researchers say the evidence was available. “The centres for disease control have this kind of data,” said Dan Greenbaum at the Health Effects Institute, which has studied the links between pollution and health. Some foreign studies suggest pollution could cause more than a million premature deaths a year in China. Despite doing more than many countries to make real-time air quality data publicly available, China has yet to overcome public scepticism about official statistics. Recent cases of fraud have not helped. Staff at a monitoring station in the northwestern city of Xian were accused last year of tampering with equipment to reduce emissions measurements. Beijing promises “zero tolerance” on statistical fraud and has brought as many as 1,436 local monitoring stations under central government control. It also uses satellite imagery to check local governments’ data accuracy. But individuals are prepared to enter a legal grey area by measuring emissions themselves. One mobile phone app, Air Matters, with over nine million subscribers, got into trouble from at least one local government for crunching official data in alternative ways. And the government itself is starting to use data from private citizens. China firing blanks in ‘war on pollution’ as smog worsens The Institute for Public and Environmental Affairs has its own app that allows users to report pollution on the ground and the environment ministry feeds that information into its own official reporting platform. Monitoring water pollution presents even tougher challenges, says Ma at the institute, noting the high cost of measuring equipment. “They [regulators] want the data to be the right data when it gets published. The next challenge will be who will be qualified to provide third-party monitoring services. “My gut feeling is that it will be no longer totally closed, but they want a more controlled opening of this space.”   Most Popular Viewed 1 Murdered Kim Jong-nam ‘felt he was on borrowed time’ in Macau 2 Missing tycoon had diplomatic passport from Caribbean state 3 Uncertainty stalks China-N Korea ties with death of Kim Jong-nam 4 Female assassins ‘used spray’ to kill Kim Jong-un’s brother 5 Woman arrested after murder of Kim Jong-un’s brother Shared 1 Murdered Kim Jong-nam ‘felt he was on borrowed time’ in Macau 2 Missing tycoon had diplomatic passport from Caribbean state 3 Eight killed in Xinjiang knife attack 4 Uncertainty stalks China-N Korea ties with death of Kim Jong-nam 5 Female assassins ‘used spray’ to kill Kim Jong-un’s brother Commented 1 Police chief ‘saddened’ by conviction of officers in Occupy assault case 2 Beijing warns India over Taiwan delegation 3 Armed police out in full force after deadly Xinjiang terror attack 4 Carrie Lam angers both sides in same-sex marriage debate 5 Missing tycoon had diplomatic passport from Caribbean state       You may also like Politics Why Malaysia is fighting Singapore over a rock 11 Feb 2017 - 12:21pm 5 Fast facts of cloud computing In partnership with: Alibaba Cloud Hong Kong Dwindling support for bitcoin businesses in Hong Kong 11 Feb 2017 - 10:55pm 2 Eternally entwined Sponsored by: Georg Jensen Opinion Trump’s assault on Muslims takes US back to 1882 11 Feb 2017 - 11:31am 36 World CIA files reveal how US used psychics to spy on Iran 11 Feb 2017 - 9:27pm 3 Post Magazine Hong Kong men victims of sextortion by Philippine cybercriminals 11 Feb 2017 - 9:31am 14 Geopolitics Revealed: Malaysia’s ‘new evidence’ in island row against Singapore 11 Feb 2017 - 2:19am 16 Hong Kong John Tsang builds big poll lead over Carrie Lam in leadership race 10 Feb 2017 - 10:28am 35 China China to store foreigners’ fingerprints upon entry, starting with Shenzhen 10 Feb 2017 - 8:25am 27 China Fire at Chinese factory that supplied Samsung Note 7 batteries 9 Feb 2017 - 10:25am 8 China Does China’s Communist Party follow any succession rules at all? 7 Feb 2017 - 9:21pm 10 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

Ogg February 14, 2017 4:13 pm EST Print Email Tweet The hedge fund Tiger Global Management is one of the most widely followed hedge funds in the world by investors and the media alike. Its latest 13F filing shows 37 positions worth some $8.03 billion, versus 27 positions worth some $6.94 billion at the end of the third quarter. This is a ‘whale hunters’ effort under founder Julian Robertson, so investors pay attention when they buy and sell stocks. It turns out that Robertson and Tiger have made a stunning move by dumping Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). It was just this week that Apple hit all-time highs, but the 13F filing with the SEC now shows that they have exited the position. The firm’s stake in Apple had more than doubled to about 3.6 million shares, valued at more than $400 million at the end of the third quarter. It is unknown what price and what day the stake in Apple was sold off, but the share price was $113.05 on the last day of the third quarter of 2016 and Apple’s price was at $115.82 on the last trading day of 2016. It turns out that the Tiger team left some money on the table, because Apple’s stock price hit $135.00 on February 14. What matters now is what else Tiger’s management team has bought. This is far from a total portfolio view but these are some of the top changes below. Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) was listed as a new position of 366,800 shares. This stake in Facebook would be worth close to $50 million in current dollars — versus $42 million at the end of 2016. Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) was listed as a new stake of more than 2.1 million shares under Tiger’s 13F filing. In current dollars, that would be worth some $136 million. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (NYSE: FCAU) was perhaps the big surprise here. Tiger now owns about 52.7 million shares of Fiat Chrysler that would be worth about $600 million today. At $11.40 now, this was a $9.12 stock on the last day of 2016, a gain of about 20% from the end of the year. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) was a tad smaller at 1,381,929 shares (versus an end of third quarter stake of 1,342,548 shares) but this is a huge position — worth $1.036 billion at the end of 2016.

But not James Sudakow, a consultant who noticed the laborious way people talk and realized it can be a problem if not everyone understands the metaphor. Sudakow lists the most peculiar business buzzwords in his book, Picking the Low-Hanging Fruit … And Other Stupid Stuff We Say in the Corporate World. He is the founder and principal of CH Consulting, a boutique management and organizational effectiveness firm. He recently spoke on the Knowledge@Wharton show on SiriusXM’s Channel 111. An edited transcript of the conversation follows. Knowledge@Wharton: Where did you get the idea to put this book together? James Sudakow: I started my career years ago, working for one of the big four consulting firms, Deloitte Consulting, and had a great experience there. But I have to say that one of the things I could not get out of the way there was the hurling around of what I thought were really strange expressions. I remember at one point, I sat in a meeting and instead of paying attention to what I was supposed to be doing, which was probably client work, I started writing down the terms that I kept hearing thrown around. That evolved into me putting it up on my whiteboard in my office, and you could say it evolved or devolved from there. Knowledge@Wharton: But that’s part of how we live our lives and talk. It’s a hard habit to break. Sudakow: In my office at Deloitte, the entire whiteboard was filled with consulting expressions. That’s what I called them at the time. When I joined other businesses outside of consulting, I learned that they were using them, too. But it was expressions you weren’t allowed to use in my office. We had to find a way not to say “drill down” or “boil the ocean” or “open the kimono.” We had to say normal words. But you’re right, it’s a habit. And there’s a rub-off effect. It’s so common and prevalent that it’s hard for you not to do it — myself included. I don’t like corporate jargon, but I found myself using a few expressions, especially after sitting in a meeting where they were being lobbed around a lot. Then I said it. I said, “What the heck just happened?” I don’t like using these expressions, and I did it. Knowledge@Wharton: In your mind, who is the perpetrator of keeping these phrases alive? Sudakow: I think we all are. It’s one of those really interesting things. I could easily point back at my consulting friends. I have a lot of friends that are still in the consulting business, and I run a consulting firm. So you could easily do that, because there is this concept of trying to be on the leading edge or talk about new ways of saying things. “People are trying to speak in a way that gets people’s attention because it’s so hard to do in the business world.” One of the challenges that we have in the business world is there’s so much going on. There are so many initiatives, and they all start to blend together. I can see where someone might say, “Hey, you know what? If we say this a little bit differently, it might stand out and people will pay attention to it. I get that. There’s actually a kernel of value in there, where people are trying to speak in a way that gets people’s attention because it’s so hard to do in the business world. But I do think we’re all to blame for it. If we all sat down and said, “Let me just try to talk about this in a normal way, the way I would talk to anybody else,” we might actually be able to communicate better. That’s the irony. Knowledge@Wharton: What are a couple of your favorite phrases in this book? Sudakow: When I say favorites, these are the ones that make me have a funny expression on my face when people say them. They’re the ones that just irk me the most, but they’re kind of funny. One of the things that I don’t like is “baking into the process.” I don’t know where that came from, I don’t know who came up with it, but instead of just saying “we’ll include this person” or “we’ll include that process,” somehow we decided we were going to bake it in. That one drives me nuts. Sponsored Content: The other one that I find particularly strange is “tissue rejection.” I don’t know if you’ve heard that expression before, but it was frequently used when we were consulting, where we would be working with a client and maybe presenting a concept or an idea that might be a little bit beyond where they’re able to take it at the time. And people would say, “Are we going to get tissue rejection on this?” Basically, making an allusion to some sort of transplant and the body rejects it — kind of this crazy visual image. Both of those phrases are particularly annoying to me. Knowledge@Wharton: “Bake it into the process” was one that I had marked down. It makes me think, what are we baking at the CEO level these days? Apple pies? Sudakow: I know. What’s funny is when I mentioned earlier the rub-off effect, that was the one I used. I can’t stand it, and I actually said it in front of a large group. I almost had this out-of-body experience where I said, “What did you just do? You hate that expression. You just used it.” Knowledge@Wharton: There’s another phrase in your book that I’ll bring up: data dump. Sudakow: Yes, I remember the first time I heard this. It’s very typical on large projects, right? “Hey, we’ve got to do a data dump.” I was like, “What does that even mean?” And it’s kind of this overwhelming amount of information being thrown at people in a way that they could never possibly internalize it. So then they came up with this idea of calling it knowledge transfer, which I think was supposed to be the softer, gentler data dump. But it’s the same thing. Knowledge@Wharton: The one expression I really can’t stand anymore is, why do people have to “reach out” to each other? Why can’t we just talk to each other or email each other? Where does that come from? Sudakow: That’s a great one, and it brings to mind several others that are equally as strange. Now we have to “talk live.” That’s in the book, which cracks me up. Why do we have to “reach out” and “talk live?” I thought we were talking. And then there’s “getting your arms around” things. There’s all these graphic images of things … Why can we just have a conversation? I don’t know where “reach out” came from, to be honest with you. But it certainly is annoying, because we could just simply say, “Let’s just have a conversation. I’ll call you or I’ll text you.” Knowledge@Wharton: Another one that’s obviously a result of the smartphone revolution is, “I’ll ping you.” Sudakow: Pinging. Yea. I couldn’t help myself, when I wrote the book. It just strikes of The Hunt for Red October. I think it started with tech. That became the en vogue way of saying, “Hey, I’ll just reach out,” or “I’ll text you,” or “I’ll email you” or whatever. But pinging just got out of control. I would sit at meetings, and everybody’s like, “I’ll ping you after the meeting,” or “I’ll ping you later.” I sat in a meeting once and said, “So, you’re just going to call me? Or you’ll send me a text?” It’s a very strange expression. “‘I’ll ping you later.…’ So, you’re just going to call me? Or you’ll send me a text?” Knowledge@Wharton: How many of these phrases have a crossover from sports? I ask because you have “bench strength” in the book. It’s a term that is used quite often in sports, but you wouldn’t necessarily link it to business. Sudakow: There are some in the book that kind of come from sports, although not that many. I really don’t like all the sports analogies that we use in the business world, especially if it’s a global company, because half of the sports analogies we use make no sense to somebody else. I just had a conversation with someone who was in Europe, and she said, “They always want to make all these football analogies, and we sit around the table like, ‘I don’t even know what we’re talking about. We play soccer.'” Knowledge@Wharton: It’s kind of appropriate that you’re talking about this. One of the ones that I just can’t seem to let go is “low-hanging fruit.” Sudakow: Yea, that’s a great one. It was so prevalent that it made the title of my book. I hear that every day, everywhere I go. I did some research on “low-hanging fruit,” and that one comes from back during the General Electric Work-out [program days]. I don’t know if you guys remember this stuff, under CEO Jack Welch, when they would do these [corporate bureaucracy-busting] work-outs and try to figure out in an efficient way the stuff that’s easy to get. How they got at low-hanging fruit, I have no idea. I don’t even say it because I just can’t stand the way it sounds. But I get your point. It’s so common. I just try to say, “Hey, what are the quick things we can get done?” But yeah, “low-hanging fruit” is super-prevalent. Knowledge@Wharton: I have a few that really get me going, but I think my No. 1 is when someone asks me what my bandwidth is. I’m a human, not whatever they’re asking about. I automatically react to it. Sudakow: Part of the reason that I try to get people not to use all these terms is exactly what you just said. To talk about it in these terms kind of takes away the fact that we’re humans. “What is your bandwidth?” We could just say, “How much room do you have to be able to do this? Are you available? Do you have enough to do it?” But to talk about bandwidth always feels a little strange, I agree. Knowledge@Wharton: Another one that you have in this book is “rubber meets the road.” What is it about that one that gets under your skin? Sudakow: I think that it’s just used so frequently. And you sit there in meetings, people will talk at the “20,000-foot level.” It’s used as a way of trying to get us down to the ground level of what’s going to happen. But they all sit there and say, “Hey, when the rubber hits the road, that’s when we’re really going to find these things out.” It’s just so overused I think it loses the impact that it’s trying to have. “I saw a motor oil the other day being advertised as ‘re-imagined.’” Knowledge@Wharton: You also have the “elephant in the room” phrase, and people will say “gorilla” in that one as well. Sudakow: Yeah. Then there’s the “red-headed stepchild,” the “dead moose on the table,” which is really strange. It’s not as common. You have to be really, really, really good at using corporate expressions to be throwing the “dead moose on the table” out there. That’s how we know you’re incredibly adept at it. But yeah, I even use it and I’m embarrassed every time that I do it, so now I just tell people, “Look, I’m going use a terrible expression, but we’ve got to talk about the elephant in the room.” I hate it. Knowledge@Wharton: You also have in here “change agent” and “change network.” Sudakow: Change agent is a great one. Companies are always trying to transform and change, and they’re always trying to find these people that have now been labeled as change agents. These people that are influential, that people listen to. The concept’s really good. How do we help get people who everybody else wants to listen to, regardless of their title or level, to help make the change? But calling them a change agent always kind of gives this secret, operative visual to me. And then the “change network” is all these change agents kind of working together across this network. The whole thing kind of reeks of special ops to me. Knowledge@Wharton: It sounds like there’s a follow-up book here. Sudakow: Well it’s funny that you say that, because there were 30, 40 terms left on the table. I don’t know how I didn’t put them in, but I can’t even talk without using them, right? Now I have to air quote myself. But yeah, there’s quite a few more. Knowledge@Wharton: You also use “harness the organic process.” When I first saw that, I was like, “Are we talking about horses and racing here?” Sudakow: That’s great. That one, to me, is particularly strange. Usually organizations are using this organic process to talk about internally grown. That’s what they mean. How it came to that, I don’t know. It’s a strange expression. Knowledge@Wharton: This is one of those books that I think resonates with so many people out there. You probably could take suggestions from people on Twitter or Facebook and do a whole series of these. Sudakow: Oh, absolutely. One of the ideas that we had was, “Hey, let’s put this out and see which ones we’re missing that are particularly annoying to everyone else.” There’s tons of them out there. I don’t know if you’ve been paying attention to branding campaigns, but “reimagine” and “reinvent” is really prevalent these days, to the point where I saw a motor oil the other day being advertised as “reimagined.” I was like, “Could I come home and tell my wife that I bought this motor oil because it had been re-imagined?” I mean, she’d be like, “You’ve got to get some more sleep.” It’s crazy.

Wearable Tech by Lexy Savvides 15 February 2017 2:00 pm GMT @lexysavvides Seeing is believing: Glasses give sight back to the blind The eSight 3 is a headset with video camera that can help the legally blind see again. by Lexy Savvides 3:00 Close Drag This is part of CNET's "Tech Enabled" series about the role technology plays in helping the disability community. Yvonne Felix is walking toward me wearing a device that could be straight out of "Star Trek: The Next Generation." Like Geordi La Forge in the science fiction series, Felix is legally blind. In the show, La Forge, played by LeVar Burton, wore a headset called VISOR that helped him see again. Felix is wearing its real-world equivalent, the eSight 3. The eSight 3 has a camera that works with high-resolution displays and optical prisms in the headset to restore sight to those with low vision. The video image is presented to the user in a way that can overcome the cause of their vision loss. "I remember putting them on and looking up and I saw my husband who I'd been married to for eight years and had never seen before," Felix tells me as we're looking over the San Francisco Bay. "And my 2-month-old son, who we had just brought home from the hospital and he was holding him and it was the most beautiful image, like it's burned in my mind for the rest of my life." This headset can help solve many accessibility challenges the legally blind face. eSight This headset is an example of how accessibility issues are being solved with technology. It's an increasingly important topic, particularly for tech companies like Apple and Microsoft, who have been pushing to make products easier to use for low vision users. But these solutions still have limitations for the legally blind. Felix lost her sight after being hit by a car when she was 7 years old. She was diagnosed with Stargardt disease, a juvenile form of macular degeneration. As a result, she has a blind spot that blocks 98 percent of her visual field. Her condition is more suited to eSight than other low vision issues. Macular degeneration and sight loss from diabetes complications are more likely to benefit rather than glaucoma. In these cases, damage to the retina can be greater than eSight can resolve. Regardless, anyone can give eSight a try. CEO Dr. Brian Mech explained that eSight has a better than 50 percent chance of working with all conditions. "The beautiful thing is it's not surgical, it's not medication, it's not a drug. So you can just try it on." A clearer view The liquid lens technology inside the headset helps the camera focus incredibly fast: less than 1 millisecond, similar to the human eye. Combined with a feature Mech calls "bioptic tilt," wearers also get access to their peripheral vision which is important for tasks where you are mobile and moving. Felix is a longtime user of the device that's currently in its third generation. She's worn previous versions for everyday tasks like shopping, banking and going to work, but she put it to an even more extreme test with vigorous activities like zip lining and riding a mechanical bull. This controller lets the wearer adjust the image to their liking. eSight "There are a lot of people out there like me that are going through the same experiences of feeling alone, feeling isolated, and not being a part of the world visually," she said. "Being able to connect with people and your family, and getting out of your house and being part of the world again is something that I would think everybody would want." A special controller connected to the headset lets wearers adjust the image to their liking. Manipulations include boosting the contrast (which can help edges and objects stand out) or zoom controls to enlarge text. The built-in light can illuminate the scene, useful for low-light situations. Although eSight has slimmed down the visor from previous generations, Mech believes there's still room for improvement. "I think the day will come where it's not so different than just a regular pair of glasses, or maybe even a pair of contact lenses," he said. "We're not talking 20 years from now, we're talking about maybe in the next five to 10 years." The company is also looking at waterproofing future versions of the headset. Other devices like magnifying glasses are certainly an option for the legally blind, but in most cases they don't actually improve vision or can only enhance vision for a specific task. Another option is a customized virtual reality headset that may help some low vision conditions. For now, Felix is more than happy with the freedom she's been given with the headset, even if the design prompts questions and stares from curious onlookers. When I walked through San Francisco's Ferry Building with Felix, at least two sales associates approached her to ask about the device. "I love when people come up and ask me what I'm wearing because it's a door opener," she said. "It allows me to talk about low vision and that there are solutions and low vision hits everybody. You might not have it, but it doesn't discriminate." CNET Magazine: Check out a sampling of the stories you'll find in CNET's newsstand edition.

Name: Subject: Message: Play as the bad guys as Batman: Arkham Underworld finally launches for Android Apps & Games Newsby John Callaham7 hours ago 1 100 3 Sometimes you will see games that still launch for iOS weeks, and sometimes months, before they are finally made available for Android. That’s the case for Batman: Arkham Underworld, which launched in the summer of 2016 for Apple’s platform, but is only now making an appearance on Android in the Google Play Store. See also: Best action games for Android! 2 weeks ago While this game may have “Batman” in the title, you don’t actually play as the Dark Knight. Instead, Arkham Underworld is centered on the many bad guys in the Caped Crusader’s packed Rogue’s Gallery. The free-to-play game itself takes place before the events in the Batman: Arkham trilogy of console and PC games created by developer Rocksteady. Arkham Underworld, developed by Turbine, is a combination of a top-down tactical action game and a management game. You have to recruit your super villains from a list that includes the Riddler, Harley Quinn, Killer Croc and many more. You control their actions as they, along with AI minions, go on missions to raid, steal and pillage from others in Gotham City. At the same time, you also have to build up your secret base with your own traps and upgrades to keep others from raiding what you have. Graphically, the game keeps the dark and gothic art style of the console and PC Arkham games, even if they don’t come close to matching the detail from those titles. It also features some of the same voice actors that are in those games, including Tara Strong as Harley Quinn and especially Kevin Conroy, who once again does a great job playing Batman (he does appear in the game at times, and your job is to stop him, naturally). Keep in mind that while Batman: Arkham Underworld is free to download and play, it does support optional in-game purchases. Have you been waiting patiently for this game to finally come out for Android and if so, what are your impressions? Let us know your thoughts in the comments!

Home Macs | 13 Feb 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (4) Chrome for iOS Gains QR Code and Barcode Scanning by Adam C. Engst I was playing around on my iPhone the other day and happened to use 3D Touch on the icon for the Google Chrome Web browser. Imagine my surprise when one of the “quick actions” that Chrome presented was Scan QR Code. And indeed, tapping it brought up a QR code scanning screen. It turns out that QR code and barcode scanning are new to version 56 of Chrome for iOS, which Google updated on 1 February 2017. For those who aren’t aware, a QR code uses regions of rectangles within a square to encode data, most commonly a URL to a Web page. QR codes are used in advertising, publishing, product tracking, and other fields where it’s helpful to have a graphical element stand in for a URL that would likely be impossible to remember or difficult to type, as I’ve done in the TCN screenshot below. QR codes are also used to seed two-factor authentication systems (see “Authy Protects Your Two-Factor Authentication Tokens,” 6 November 2014), and some companies even use the technology in payment systems — see “Walmart Pay Is Better Than You Might Expect,” 18 July 2016. Various apps and Web sites can create QR codes for you, and any designer using Adobe InDesign can insert one into a document merely by choosing Object > Generate QR Code. Although QR codes have been around since 1994 and in common use since 2009, they’ve never really taken off. That’s likely because Apple never built a general-purpose QR code scanner into the iPhone’s Camera app. (The Wallet app can scan QR codes, but it only understands QR codes associated with Wallet passes.) Glenn Fleishman bemoaned this lack almost five years ago in “Apple Could Make QR Codes Work with a Simple Tweak” (2 July 2012). With Chrome, scanning a QR code is easy, but you likely wouldn’t figure it out on your own because there is absolutely no indication of the feature within the app itself. Instead, you must either 3D Touch the app (if you have a compatible iPhone) and then tap Scan QR Code or search in Spotlight on “QR” and then tap a Scan QR Code search result. Then, center the QR code you want to scan in the camera’s viewfinder. Chrome scans nearly instantly (so much so that capturing the screenshots was hard), and puts the URL associated with the QR code into the address field so you can preview it — just tap the Go button to load the page. Chrome can also scan traditional barcodes, which it feeds directly into Google’s search engine to find product pages and the like. In the screenshot below, I’ve scanned the barcode on the bottom of my Garmin Forerunner 620 GPS watch box, and Google promptly displayed related information. If you have a dedicated QR code scanning app that you use regularly, you may prefer to stick with it. In particular, I found it clumsy to invoke Chrome’s scanner repeatedly, so a dedicated app may work better in such situations. But if, like me, you have to do a Spotlight search to find your QR code scanner anyway, it’s faster and easier to use Chrome from the Spotlight results screen.   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

Maybe I'm behind on the nomenclature or missed reading something, but if I do a search (in the window that appears if you drag down from the top), iScanner is the only app that shows up. And if I search for Chrome it opens and I don't see how to do scan. I get that I can do a 3D touch, but I have to find Chrome (is there a way to search and go to the app instead of opening it (macOS, show in Finder)? Thanks for the story. I almost never do a QR scan because I never remember how to do it. Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-14 10:22 Hmm, I'm not sure why Spotlight isn't finding it. Try going into Settings > General > Spotlight Search and making sure that Chrome is enabled there. You might also make sure the other switches at the top are on, though they didn't matter in my testing. Reply Anders Borg  2017-02-14 14:06 "they’ve never really taken off" They have industry/logistics-wise, but not for public use. I still try to change that. Can it only be activated via 3D Touch? That's a bummer, and not smart by Google. Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-14 16:10 It's good to hear that QR codes are being used more in the back end of logistics systems. 3D Touch and Spotlight searches are the only way, yes. That's probably fine for casual users, but for anyone doing serious stuff with QR codes, a dedicated app would make more sense.

PHOTO: REUTERS [SHANGHAI] In its 'war' on hazardous air pollution, China's government has a dilemma: it needs to be open about air quality data to hold polluters to account, but worries that too much bad news from alternative, independent sources could stoke public unrest. Beijing has greatly improved how it collects data, made more of it available to the public and cracked down on misreporting, but it's concerned about the spread of unauthorised or inaccurate data from popular mobile apps and handheld detectors. The conflicting approach reflects a broader debate about China's appetite for political reform. The Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP), under a former academic, wants to create a modern regulatory system based on independent monitoring and the rule of law, but that could rub up against the ruling Communist Party's priority for stability. After scandals about fraudulent data, the government also worries that alternative sources of information on pollution levels could erode public trust in official statistics, and undermine its message that the environment is improving. Liam Bates, CEO of Origins Technology, which produces the Laser Egg handheld pollution monitor sold in Beijing's Apple store, said China has no problem with people measuring air quality; it just doesn't want the findings to be published. SEE ALSO: China's record global buying spree wanes amid capital flow curbs "Basically (China) says it's illegal to publish data from non-official sources. As far as I know there's nothing about collecting data, or processing data and using it for research," he said. China says its main concern is accuracy. In 2014, it ordered mobile phone pollution apps to drop data provided by the United States embassy and its consulates, concerned it might differ from its own. More recently, apps came under scrutiny for trying to give a more detailed picture than the government of China's air quality. In one recent example of what the government calls "rumour mongering" by individuals, a man was detained by police for five days in Chengdu in the southwest after he warned on his Weibo microblog that the city faced its "heaviest smog in its 2,000-year history", local media reported. Regulators also accused one air pollution monitoring app of spreading rumours by providing data in December indicating Chengdu was the third most polluted city in the world. While China's short-staffed environmental watchdogs are keen to involve the public in enforcing standards, authorities are wary that social media-driven protests against chemical plants, waste incinerators or nuclear processing facilities could trigger protests. "In general, there is hope at the provincial and ministerial level that they will not try to shut down all these other sources, but what they're really concerned about is that they will show something that isn't scientific," said Ma Jun, director of the Institute for Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE), a non-government organisation campaigning for greater transparency. "This is a challenge in this era of mobile internet and social media," he noted. The MEP did not respond to a faxed request for comment. Despite progress on official information disclosure, led, Mr Ma says, by the environment ministry, there are still gaps, with agencies like the National Development and Reform Commission lagging and some local governments "reluctant and resistant". China still does not give out data for climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions, and offers only incomplete heavy metal pollution figures - a sensitive issue following food scandals in rice-growing regions. There is also reluctance to allow the free publication of sensitive data on the health impact of pollution. There is no database on the health impact from pollution that companies, say, could access to help them decide where to locate staff. While Chinese media have cited foreign studies on the correlation between smog and mortality - including the heavy death toll in London in the winter of 1952-53 - there have been few equivalent Chinese studies. As winter pollution gripped much of northern China last month, the health ministry told state media it had no data linking smog to cancer, and it was too early to reach any conclusions about the impact of PM2.5 - the tiny particles that form smog - on human health, though foreign researchers say the evidence was available. "The centres for disease control have this kind of data," said Dan Greenbaum of the Health Effects Institute, which has studied the links between pollution and health. Some foreign studies suggest pollution could cause more than 1 million premature deaths a year in China. PUBLIC DISTRUST Despite doing more than many countries to make real-time air quality data publicly available, China has yet to overcome public scepticism about official statistics. Recent cases of fraud have not helped. Last year, staff at a monitoring station in the northwestern city of Xi'an were accused of tampering with equipment to reduce emissions measurements. Beijing promises "zero tolerance" on statistical fraud, and has brought as many as 1,436 local monitoring stations under central government control. It also uses satellite imagery to check local governments' data accuracy. But individuals are prepared to enter a legal grey area by measuring emissions themselves. One mobile phone app, Air Matters, with over 9 million subscribers, got into trouble from at least one local government for crunching official data in alternative ways. And the government itself is starting to use data from private citizens. The IPE has its own app that allows users to report pollution on the ground, and the environment ministry feeds that information into its own official reporting platform. Monitoring water pollution presents even tougher challenges, says Mr Ma at the IPE, noting the high cost of measuring equipment. "They (regulators) want the data to be the right data when it gets published. The next challenge will be (to see) who will be qualified to provide third-party monitoring services." "My gut feeling is that it will be no longer totally closed, but they want a more controlled opening of this space."

Political cartoon compares Betsy DeVos to Ruby Bridges. Glenn McCoy (Belleville News-Democrat) ah yes, the n-word and "conservative" – two equally hateful words. https://t.co/Va8V5b5n2I — Kendall Uvena (@AsianOnOccasion) February 15, 2017 @AsianOnOccasion tweeting sarcastically about political cartoonist Glen McCoy’s illustration comparing education secretary Betsy DeVos to Ruby Bridges, who integrated an all-white school during the civil rights movement. Based on the Norman Rockwell painting “The Problem We All Live With,” the cartoon was published in the Belleville News-Democrat in Belleville, Ill., and drew wide outrage. Here is the painting it is based off of: Norman Rockwell “The Problem We All Live With” Equating DeVos, a well-connected billionaire who paid her way into the Cabinet, with the heroic Ruby Bridges is ignorant and offensive. https://t.co/5Q2tGWb4Ob — Tim Gibson (@timgibson) February 15, 2017 That huge difference aside, the opposition to Betsy DeVos was not remotely like the opposition to desegregation in New Orleans. /4 — Kevin M. Kruse (@KevinMKruse) February 14, 2017 Kate Upton got not one — but three — SI Swim covers. Sports Illustrated congratulations to kate upton for having her many bodies celebrated on the covers of SI's "body diversity" issue https://t.co/EG61Mmf341 — Jessica Roy (@JessicaKRoy) February 15, 2017 @JessicaKRoy tweeting sarcastically about the three different Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue covers — all of which feature model Kate Upton. This swimsuit edition is supposedly focused on body diversity and age inclusion. It is Upton’s third time appearing on the cover, and the cover was released after rumors that the model had demanded cover treatment. Last year, Sports Illustrated also had three different covers, but they featured models Ashley Graham and Hailey Clauson and MMA fighter Ronda Rousey. The real scandal here is … The real scandal here is we don't know what kind of candy. Caramel? Mike & Ike? Butterfingers? The American people deserve to know! 🇺🇸 https://t.co/uBqCuQd52k — Chris Robinson (@ChrisRobinsonNJ) February 15, 2017 @ChrisRobinsonNJ tweeting about “the real scandal” after President Trump tweeted, “The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by ‘intelligence’ like candy,” after the administration fired Michael Flynn.  The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by "intelligence" like candy. Very un-American! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017 The real scandal here is I fell asleep eating frozen grapes like candy. Nearly choked to death in bed. Very un-American! — Louis Peitzman (@LouisPeitzman) February 15, 2017 has anyone ever succeeded in distracting people from a scandal by saying ‘the REAL scandal here is that…’ — Bennett (@bfod) February 15, 2017 Planet of the Apps gets dragged after trailer released. Apple is launching its first TV show, “Planet of the Apps.” Here’s the trailer. More in our live blog: https://t.co/wK3Nn4xjuv #CodeMedia pic.twitter.com/AbdhyxRvJ8 — Recode (@Recode) February 14, 2017 Apple should be producing amazing content like Netflix Originals does. Not this garbage. I am disappointed. — Dan Counsell (@dancounsell) February 14, 2017 @dancounsell tweeting after Apple released a trailer for its forthcoming show, “Planet of the Apps.” Twitter user @Panoras1 aptly described it as “‘The Voice’ show, but instead of music players they have developers.” It was widely derided on social media. @Recode I can only assume this was made 10 years ago and it got shelved and now some intern found it and was like "yo, we should air this!" — whoisthebaldguy (@whoisthebaldguy) February 15, 2017 Gorgeous rehabilitated felon walks in New York Fashion Week. Jeremy Meeks (Getty Images) “This is a happy ending, hopefully he doesn’t fall into any more issues and just keeps going. I’m proud of … anybody who finds success out of a dark time.” EJ Nash, a commenter on buzzfeed.com, writing about “Felon Bae” (real name Jeremy Meeks) walking in New York Fashion Week.

Abhijit Ahaskar AI specifically refers to the enhanced ability that a piece of software may have, where it can understand specific information, add contextual knowledge to it and suggest responses based on that. Artificial intelligence, popularly referred to as AI, is no longer seen only in movies and TV series. Many of us are already taking advantage of it through mobile apps and smartphones. AI specifically refers to the enhanced ability that a piece of software may have, where it can understand specific information, add contextual knowledge to it and suggest responses based on that. For example, the suggestion about which content to view on YouTube has an element of AI working in the background. Smarter photo and filter apps Available by default in many Android smartphones, Google Photos uses AI and machine learning to identify objects or human faces in a photo and club ones with common elements and the same faces into specific folders without the user’s intervention. It is this ability to understand the content in a photo which makes Google Photos better than an ordinary photo storage app. This also makes it easier for users to find images they want quickly. A number of photo and video filter apps such as Prisma and Artisto use AI to apply filters. Prisma uses AI and a set of neural networks to understand the contents of an image to convert an ordinary photo into a beautiful work of art. Click here for enlarge Chatting made fun Google’s instant messaging app Allo uses AI and language processing tools to understand how a user converses with friends and the built-in personal assistant on the messenger. It focuses more on the context and content in a message so it can come up with smart suggestions and more accurate answers. Its accuracy depends on how much time you spend on the messenger. The more you use it, the more accurate and interesting its suggestions will become. Allo can also detect content in photos shared with the user to suggest a more appropriate reply. Typing made easy Typing on touchscreen phones is not as comfortable as typing on a proper keyboard. This is where predictive text input, a feature of touch-based keyboards, can help users overcome the limitations of small keys and keyboards. Click here for enlarge Microsoft’s SwiftKey takes it a step further by using AI to understand the context in what is typed to provide more accurate text predictions and auto correction options to users when they are typing. It focuses on a user’s writing style and factors in the entire sentence and not just a few words. So, if you type “We are excited for”, SwiftKey’s predictions will be “New Year” and “Future” which can actually help complete the sentence. Making smartphones actually smart What makes Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones unique is the AI assistant that has been incorporated into the phone’s software. At the start, it seems like another voice-based personal assistant such as Apple’s Siri or Microsoft’s Cortana, but brings a lot more to the table. Like the AI in the Allo, it creates a virtual image of a user based on his queries, commands and browser history, so it can understand the context in query better and provide more appropriate suggestions. HTC has deployed a similar AI tool called Sense Companion in the HTC U Ultra and U Play smartphones. It works on similar lines as Google Assistant and uses machine learning to understand a user’s interest and tastes to provide better suggestions and improve their overall experience with the phone. For example, it will give more priority to notifications from apps that are regularly used or contacts that are more frequently called. AI in smartphones is still at a very nascent stage. The way we interact with smartphones is not going to change anytime soon, but the coming of AI into our lives shows its immense potential.

Palaniswami to take oath today Tata Consultancy Services chief N Chandrasekaran on Wednesday said concerns surrounding the H1-B visa are hyped and asked the USD 155-billion domestic IT industry not to get paranoid as these are exciting times with lots of opportunities. Chandrasekaran, who is set to take over the chairmanship of Tata Sons next week, said at the annual Nasscom conference here this evening, "Every time there is a regulatory change or some kind of a perceived challenge, in our industry, everybody says 'there is a problem' ... and it is hyped up whether it is H1-B, whether it is increase in re-staffing." COMPLETE COVERAGE: TRUMP IN POWER In fact, he said these are exciting times for the IT industry given the exponential demand for technology as every business reorients itself. "Fundamentally, every business is going to be powered by technology. So, the opportunity and the demand that we are going to see is just exponential," he said. "Change is something you have to live with. You cannot get overly paranoid, I don't think there is a cause for concern, I really feel the opportunity is immense," he added.

Building skills, hiring the right talent and re- engineering senior people is also important, he said, using a cricket analogy of waiting for the loose ball. It can be noted that there are heightened concerns, after a change in the US to adopting more protectionist policies. The proposed changes have rattled the sector and also prevented industry lobby Nasscom from disclosing its revenue guidance for the next fiscal. Chandrasekaran also made a strong case for not "rubbishing" the domestic services companies, which have not been able to do products like Microsoft's Windows. ALSO READ: Republican Senator does not expect Trump to weaken H1B visas He also sound critical of those who call the work of domestic IT companies as "labour arbitrage", saying a lot of world-class skills have been used by the industry. He hoped one day a domestic company will be able to create a widely used product like Windows or an Apple, but asked the industry to give such entrepreneurs a chance. Welcoming proliferation of digital in the financial world with payments, he said digital needs to go deeper into other sectors like education and healthcare as well. ALSO READ: Republican Senator does not expect Trump to weaken H1B visas He said various flagship government initiatives like Digital India, Skill India, Make in India have to ultimately converge in the digital sphere and asked the IT industry to make it happen. "Multiple initiatives of the government will all get connected at some stage...All these initiatives we have to bring it together. Best people to bring it together is IT professionals," he said.

About Baccarat  Baccarat is a banking card game played on casino floors worldwide. The person playing the game bets on who will win the hand - the "player" or the "banker". The aim is to form a hand whose point value is nearer to 9. Cards count as face value, with pictures and tens as zero, and only the last digit of the total counts (so for example, seven plus six is worth 3, not 13). Two hands are dealt by the house dealer, the "banker" hand and the "player" hand. Before the hands are dealt, bets may be placed on the banker hand, on the player hand, or on a tie.

About Baccarat  Baccarat is a banking card game played on casino floors worldwide. The person playing the game bets on who will win the hand - the "player" or the "banker". The aim is to form a hand whose point value is nearer to 9. Cards count as face value, with pictures and tens as zero, and only the last digit of the total counts (so for example, seven plus six is worth 3, not 13). Two hands are dealt by the house dealer, the "banker" hand and the "player" hand. Before the hands are dealt, bets may be placed on the banker hand, on the player hand, or on a tie.

 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is investing billions in airline stocks Akin Oyedele Feb. 14, 2017, 4:38 PM 20,364 facebook linkedin twitter email print Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett.Rick Wilking/Reuters Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway upped its holdings in various airlines during the fourth quarter, according to a regulatory filing published Tuesday. The 13F filing showed that Berkshire took a new position in Southwest Airlines, buying 43.2 million shares valued at $2.15 billion. The company increased its stake in Delta Air Lines by 848% to 60 million shares worth $2.95 billion. Berkshire also raised its stake in American Airlines. Buffett continued to load up on airline stocks even after calling the sector a "death trap for investors" during his 2013 annual shareholder meeting. Berkshire hiked its ownership in Apple by 277%, buying 42.1 million shares valued at $6.64 billion. Buffett's most valuable holding remained Kraft Heinz, and no change was made to the stake worth $28.4 billion. Wells Fargo, Coca-Cola, IBM, and American Express also remained top holdings. Berkshire dumped nearly all its Walmart shares, cutting its stake by 89%. Berkshire's combined portfolio gained 15% during the fourth quarter. The benchmark S&P 500 index of US stocks gained 3.3%. Major investment firms including hedge funds are required to disclose their long positions in stocks every quarter. Because of a time lag, these positions may have changed or been closed by the time the filings are made.

Māori-themed online game removed by Czech firm after NZ protests over intellectual property 6:18 PM Thursday Feb 16, 2017 SHARE: Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Not saved Email Print Culture Gambling Intellectual Property Lifestyle Maori The online gambling game "Māori" has been withdrawn by its Czech creators after Māori protests. Image / Supplied A Māori-themed online gambling game has been withdrawn by its Czech creators after protests that it breached Māori intellectual property. The game, released in December and called simply Maori, was described by Czech-based developers Endorphina as "celebrating the traditional inhabitants of the [sic] New Zealand". "This interesting ethnic group inspired the creative team and the result is visually mastered slot that features full 3D modelled characters in HD that allows great immersion into the game and the culture of the people," the company announced in Casino News Today on December 29. But this week it withdrew the game and apologised to public health agency Hāpai Te Hauora, which complained about it last month. Hāpai has now offered to "support the company to develop cultural awareness policies". "It's a great result for little old New Zealand," said Hāpai chief executive Lance Norman. "Vodafone wouldn't allow their logo to be on a gambling game, neither would Apple, neither would Coca-Cola. Intellectual branding at a different level makes no difference." The game used pounamu symbols which are the intellectual property of Ngāi Tahu. Image / Supplied Continued below. Related Content Te Puia defends popular Emotiki Lords of the games: New Zealand's gaming success stories How ex-gaming addict turned $200k into $10m The game was free to download, but part-way into it players were asked to pay real money to play at the next level. "You start getting addicted to it, then they say you have to pay to keep playing," Norman said. "They were using pounamu symbols which are the intellectual property of Ngāi Tahu. They were using Māori warriors. And when you won, if you got three or four in a row, it would actually come up into a Māori haka which is the intellectual property of Ngāti Toa." Hāpai's lawyers Simpson Grierson wrote to Endorphina asking them to remove the game because of the intellectual property breaches. Endorphina director Erlene May Rodriguez provided specific apologies to Ngāti Toa Rangatira for use of the Ka Mate haka, and to Ngāi Tahu for use of the pounamu. Apology "It wasn't our intention to insult or be offensive to you or any of Maoris or to New Zealanders," Rodriguez wrote. "Also it wasn't our intention to gain some additional benefits from use of Maori cultural icons." - NZ Herald Read more by Simon Collins Email Simon Collins Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Discover more Loading Loading Herald Services Book your ad Driven Photos for sale True Commercial Death Notices Public Notices Our Regional News Stories The Northern Advocate Kevin Page: A case of taste not, want not Mrs P and I are going out for dinner with friends this weekend.

 A VC fund set up by Skype's cofounder has raised $765 million to invest in European startups Sam Shead Feb. 16, 2017, 12:50 AM 541 facebook linkedin twitter email print Niklas Zennström, founding partner and CEO of Atomico. Atomico Atomico has raised a $765 million (£613 million) fund to invest in European technology startups, shrugging off any concerns that Brexit has made it harder for venture capitalists to raise large sums. The London-based investment firm has now raised a total of $1.5 billion (£1.2 billion) to back companies across Europe that have the potential to scale into billion dollar businesses. Atomico, founded 10 years ago by ex-Skype CEO Niklas Zennström, claims that the Atomico IV fund is the largest fund of its kind in Europe. Speaking to Business Insider at Atomico's head office on New Bond Street in Mayfair, 51-year-old Zennström, said: "If you compare it to other pure-play European VC funds, it's the largest." Rocket Internet, arguably not a "pure-play" European VC, announced it had raised a $1 billion ($800 million) fund in January. Elsewhere, Japanese tech giant SoftBank announced a $100 billion (£80 billion) tech fund last October but that's set to be invested worldwide and much of it is expected to go towards mergers and acquisitions as opposed to VC deals. Other household VC firms such as Index and Balderton have also raised large startup funds that European companies can access but none of them have been as big as Atomico IV. Atomico raised the new capital from wealthy family offices and pension funds across Europe, which have traditionally been risk-averse, according to Zennström, who cofounded Kazaa and two other companies before setting up Skype. European startups have long-struggled to scale to the same size as their US rivals due to a lack of capital, according to Zennström. That's largely because institutional investors in the US (particularly large pension funds) have been more willing to pump their billions into VC than their European counterparts. "If the European pension funds allocated half a percent of their assets to European venture, that funding gap would disappear," he said. "We have all the ingredients here [in Europe]. We don't need to raise money from the US or other places. There is plenty of capital here." The Atomico team. Atomico Zennström, reported to have a net worth of $1.3 billion (£890 million), said in September that he believes the next Facebook will come from Europe. This is partly due to increasing amounts of funding but a couple of other factors are also at play. Five of the world's top 10 computer science institutions can now be found in Europe (ETH, Oxford, Imperial, EPF, and TU Munich), according to an Atomico report published last November. The same report stated that there are more professional engineers in Europe now than there are in the US (4.7 million vs 4.1 million). There's also an increasing number of business development mangers for startups to hire. "For me, when I was recruiting people to Skype, it was hard to find experience at a fast-growing startup so you had to hire people from the US to come," said Zennström. "Today, there's many people working for Skype, Spotify, lastminute.com, King, Zoopla, whatever. They've learned the skills to scale a fast growing company." Although Europe doesn't yet have an Apple or an Amazon-sized tech company, there are several firms that have grown into substantial technology companies in recent years. Enterprise software company SAP is now worth $107 billion (£86 billion), while Spotify and Zalando are valued at over $10 billion (£8 billion). Cambridge chip designer ARM was bought by SoftBank for $32 billion (£26 billion) last year. Atomico's fully electric Lilium Jet. Lilium Aviaiton Innovative technology companies are being developed across Europe and not just in the traditional tech hubs of London, Berlin, and Stockholm. So far, Atomico has invested in 85 companies, including the likes of "Clash of Clans" creator Supercell, which was acquired by China's Tencent for $8.6 billion (£6.9 billion) in June 2016, and Swedish payments firm Klarna, which has also grown to become a $2.25 billion (£1.8 billion) business. The new Atomico IV fund will be used to back approximately 25 startups across all stages over the next 3-4 years. Nine companies have already received capital out of the new fund, including Austria-based Lilium Aviation, which is due to test a flying car prototype in the next few months. "We like to back entrepreneurs who have big ambition. But also when they are about to scale," said Zennström. "So we would come in when they have achieved a product market fit and the company needs to shift focus from innovation to scaling. That means we're investing in Series A or later, say B or C."

After months of irrelevant banter and confusing rhetoric, someone is ready to lead. Different organizations have attempted to gain control of OWS, but now the destiny of the movement is clear. A voice for Occupy Wall Street has stepped up. It’s time is now. Ladies and gentlemen … Miley Cyrus. Yes, Miley Cyrus has offered her support for Occupy Wall Street. This week on her website, the social conscience of a generation released a video “dedicated to the thousands of people who are standing up for what they believe in.” The video posted by Cyrus edits Occupy Wall Street video clips over her song “Liberty Walk” from the CD “Can’t be Tamed” — available at Best Buy (NYSE-BBY) for $9.99. Someone needs to take Miley aside and explain to her that the only reason she is relevant is because she made a shitload of Wall Street dough off the “Hannah Montana” franchise, a fictitious corporate nom de plume created for her by Disney (NYSE-DIS). Without The Mouse’s creation of Hannah Montana — movie available at Target (AMEX-TDTF) for $8.19 — Miley Cyrus would be covering “Achy Breaky Heart” in the lobby of the Hampton Inn (NYSE-HIL) in Ashland, Kentucky. I have no particular animosity towards Miss Cyrus. Last week at her nineteenth birthday party she admitted to being a “stoner.” This was following an earlier video of her smoking “legal” pot from a glass bong. For those of us who went to college in the ’70s — a generation one toke away from being an entire graduating class of Lindsay Lohans — her smoking habit is almost endearing. Miley Cyrus’s support for Occupy Wall Street points out the absurdity of the entire protest. Back in June, M Magazine declared Miley Cyrus to be the richest teen in the world and placed her personal wealth at $120,000,000.00. That’s a lot of zeros for someone who wants to show support for people who hate greed. Don’t blame Miley Cyrus for the hypocrisy of OWS. Just peruse the pictures from the various OWS locations. Participants in the Wall Street bash-a-thon are drinking Starbucks (NASDAQ-SBUX) coffee, talking on their Apple (NASDAQ-AAPL) iPhones and browsing the Internet on their Hewlett Packard (NYSE-HPQ) laptops. The fact of the matter is the Occupiers — just like Miley Cyrus — are addicted to corporate America. The irony of people protesting greed while drinking $5.00 cups of coffee is priceless. The great philosopher, Pogo, once said, “We have met the enemy and he is us.” Of course, after he said that, Pogo was fired and is now living in a tent in Zuccotti Park. The thought that protesters support the very system they despise must send a chill right through their North Face (NYSE-VFC) jackets and Ugg boots (NASDAQ-GS). Somewhere in Seattle, Howard Schultz, the CEO of Starbucks, is looking at a picture of a protester drinking a cup of his coffee and laughing his ass off.

 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is investing billions in airline stocks Akin Oyedele Feb. 14, 2017, 4:38 PM 20,364 facebook linkedin twitter email print Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett.Rick Wilking/Reuters Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway upped its holdings in various airlines during the fourth quarter, according to a regulatory filing published Tuesday. The 13F filing showed that Berkshire took a new position in Southwest Airlines, buying 43.2 million shares valued at $2.15 billion. The company increased its stake in Delta Air Lines by 848% to 60 million shares worth $2.95 billion. Berkshire also raised its stake in American Airlines. Buffett continued to load up on airline stocks even after calling the sector a "death trap for investors" during his 2013 annual shareholder meeting. Berkshire hiked its ownership in Apple by 277%, buying 42.1 million shares valued at $6.64 billion. Buffett's most valuable holding remained Kraft Heinz, and no change was made to the stake worth $28.4 billion. Wells Fargo, Coca-Cola, IBM, and American Express also remained top holdings. Berkshire dumped nearly all its Walmart shares, cutting its stake by 89%. Berkshire's combined portfolio gained 15% during the fourth quarter. The benchmark S&P 500 index of US stocks gained 3.3%. Major investment firms including hedge funds are required to disclose their long positions in stocks every quarter. Because of a time lag, these positions may have changed or been closed by the time the filings are made.

Chandrasekaran, who is set to take over the chairmanship of Tata Sons next week, said at the annual Nasscom conference here this evening, "Every time there is a regulatory change or some kind of a perceived challenge, in our industry, everybody says 'there is a problem' ... and it is hyped up whether it is H1-B, whether it is increase in re-staffing." In fact, he said these are exciting times for the IT industry given the exponential demand for technology as every business reorients itself. "Fundamentally, every business is going to be powered by technology. So, the opportunity and the demand that we are going to see is just exponential," he said. TCS Chairman N Chandrasekaran. AFP file photo "Change is something you have to live with. You cannot get overly paranoid, I don't think there is a cause for concern, I really feel the opportunity is immense," he added. Chandrasekaran, under whose leadership TCS grew to become the largest domestic IT company, said the industry will have to adapt to changes, build capabilities, IP, form new partnerships and reskill its employees. Building skills, hiring the right talent and re- engineering senior people is also important, he said, using a cricket analogy of waiting for the loose ball. It can be noted that there are heightened concerns, after a change in the US to adopting more protectionist policies. The proposed changes have rattled the sector and also prevented industry lobby Nasscom from disclosing its revenue guidance for the next fiscal. Chandrasekaran also made a strong case for not "rubbishing" the domestic services companies, which have not been able to do products like Microsoft's Windows. He also sounded critical of those who call the work of domestic IT companies as "labour arbitrage", saying a lot of world-class skills have been used by the industry. He hoped one day a domestic company will be able to create a widely used product like Windows or an Apple, but asked the industry to give such entrepreneurs a chance. Welcoming proliferation of digital in the financial world with payments, he said digital needs to go deeper into other sectors like education and healthcare as well. He said various flagship government initiatives like Digital India, Skill India, Make in India have to ultimately converge in the digital sphere and asked the IT industry to make it happen. "Multiple initiatives of the government will all get connected at some stage...All these initiatives we have to bring it together. Best people to bring it together is IT professionals," he said. #Apple#Digital india#H1-b visa#Labour arbitrage#Make in india#Microsoft#N chandrasekaran#Nasscom#Skill india#Tata sons#Tcs#Windows Also See TCS board to consider share buyback on 20 February; co says dividend payments rising over years Why Nasscom is in no hurry to forecast: 5 factors that influence Indian IT’s uncertain mood Trump's 'America First' policy could challenge Modi's 'Make in India' vision: Chinese media Mukesh Ambani says Donald Trump can be a blessing in disguise for India's IT players Top Stories Palaniswami new TN CM: Panneerselvam's rebellion reminiscent of 2015 Jitan Ram Manjhi impasse in Bihar AIADMK Live: Edappadi Palaniswami is New CM of Tamil Nadu, Swearing-in Today Israel-Palestine two-state solution: What comes after Donald Trump's ambiguous yet unsettling remarks?

By Zack Whittaker for London Calling | July 11, 2012 -- 11:21 GMT (04:21 PDT) | Topic: EU We've all been there. You fire open iTunes or any other premium content provider to download (legally) your favourite music track or that album you wanted to buy in Holland or wherever but didn't have the time, and it's not there. Why? Because you're in the wrong region of the European Union. Despite the single market economy, many of the 27 member nation states still don't talk to one another, and collecting societies are no different. That could soon change. The European Commission today proposed changes to licensing rules that could see online content stores --- such as iTunes or Amazon --- selling music and other content across Europe.  Currently, music rights and the like are licensed mainly on a national basis, but the Internet has broken down the walls of national borders and taken to iTunes, Amazon, and Spotify in a bid to reach out to the wider European community. Consumers don't think about national borders either, and therein lies the rub. No wonder piracy is off the charts; most Europeans can't legally access the music they want to buy and download. The proposals made would require greater transparency and better management for groups that collect royalties and copyright holders alike. The rules would encourage rights to be licensed more widely, the Commission said in a statement.  "Some collecting societies struggle to adapt to the requirements of the management of rights for online use of musical works, in particular in a cross-border context," said EU Internal Market Commissioner Michel Barnier.  Collecting societies, which act as intermediaries between the composers, musicians and content creators and those who seek to sell their work. These societies need to be more "efficient," the Commission added.  Some collecting societies have "struggled to adapt" to the requirements of rights management for music in particular across borders. The new proposals would see companies like Apple, Amazon, Google and Spotify --- to name a few --- to obtain licenses for music and other content to their online stores and see revenue distributed fairly back to the content creators. iTunes is available in all 27 member states, but accounts for just shy of 20 percent of all the recording industry's revenue in 2010, compared to around 50 percent in the United States, the New York Times said. Rights holders would ultimately be better protected, the Commission said, and give consumers increased access to "cultural content" outside of their EU member state.  There are more than 250 collecting societies in the EU, with one collecting society in each member state representing all of some of a category of rights holders --- such as composers or artists. The Commission said the EU recorded music market is around €6 billion ($7.37 bn; £4.74 bn).  Image source: Flickr.

Although the three major indexes traded somewhat higher in the sessions’ last hour, six S&P sectors traded lower, led by utilities and real-estate. Financials were the day’s biggest gainers. WTI crude oil for March delivery settled at $53.20 a barrel, up about 0.5% on the day. April gold slipped 40 cents on the day to settle at $1,225.40.

The stock’s 52-week range is $49.24 to $65.72, and the high was posted this afternoon. Volume was nearly 30% lower than the daily average of around 10.7 million shares.

The Expedition will be on display at the Pittsburgh International Auto Show from Feb. 17-20 at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, Downtown. This photo provided by Ford Motor Company shows the 2018 Ford Expedition. Ford says the 2018 Ford Expedition is 300 pounds lighter than the previous model thanks to a new aluminum body and a high-strength steel frame.

Updated 6 hours ago The notion that millennials are less likely to buy cars has hit a speed bump. With gas prices holding steady and millennials having children, car manufacturers are betting that SUVs once again will be popular once again. According to Edmunds.com, new car sales hit a record 17.5 million in 2016, with SUVs, pickups and vans making up 60 percent of the total — also a record. Edmunds reported that in December alone, more than 1 million SUVs, pickups and vans were sold. Some of these vehicles will be on display beginning Friday when the Pittsburgh International Auto Show gets under way at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center in downtown. The show runs through Monday. John Putzier of the Greater Pittsburgh Automobile Dealers Association, which sponsors the event, said the popularity of SUVs isn't all that surprising; it's one Americans typically see every few years as gas prices fluctuate. But it's not always easy for dealers to pivot from selling one type of vehicle to another. “Our dealers will sell anything,” he said. “But the dealers are not in the driver's seat when it comes to what manufacturers are building. When that pendulum swings, it's hard for manufacturers to keep up, and it's expensive for dealers to retool their inventory to go from a showroom full of pickup trucks to small cars and back again.” The 2018 Ford Expedition, the carmaker's biggest vehicle, has been overhauled, said product marketing manager Ryan Gillenwater. The frame is lighter aluminum, and there are a host of tech features designed to lure plugged-in buyers. There's an available Wi-Fi hotspot that has a 50-foot range, six USB ports, four 12-volt power sources and Apple Car Play, Sync Connect and Android Auto capabilities. Besides Ford, manufacturers with SUVs or pickups being featured at the convention center include Lexus (LX), Land Rover (Discovery), Jeep (Compass), Hyundai (Tucson) and Chevrolet (Equinox and Silverado). Putzier said a problem for manufacturers selling SUVs will be adhering to the federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, which require automakers to make new vehicles more fuel efficient. “If everyone wants the gas hogs, that's going to make it harder to meet the standards,” Putzier said. If demand for SUVs remains strong, manufacturers will continue to build them. Whether the vehicles sell is another matter, Putzier said. “It boils down to the price of gas and the economy,” he said. “People are holding on to their cars longer than they used to because they're built so well.” Kim Lyons is a Tribune-Review contributing writer.

As previously rumors suggest, the entire front of the phone will be glass overall. Meaning that all bezels will be removed, and the Touch ID and Home button, front facing camera, and speakers will need to be embedded into the display. Kuo says that the OLED iPhone will be similar in size to the current 4.7-inch iPhone, allowing for one-handed operation. Having a 5.8-inch display would make sense as it would not leave any space for anything but the display, as seen with the mockups above. It would in theory create a display that’s similar in size to the 5.5-inch iPhone, but in the package of a 4.7-inch iPhone. Alongside the 5.8-inch iPhone, Kuo still believes that Apple will be updating the 4.7 and 5.5-inch iPhones, but it is unclear what upgrades Apple plans on doing for these models. It’s worth noting that these iterative iPhone upgrades will feature an LCD display, like previous iPhones. Kuo says that the 5.8-inch OLED iPhone will be “the only bright spot” in the 2017 iPhone lineup, suggesting that the other two models will see modest upgrades. He believes that Apple will sell 100 million iPhones in the second half of 2017, with 60 million of those being the OLED iPhone.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 16 February 2017 | MYT 7:00 AM Facebook plans video autoplay changes, TV app Sound and fury: Previously, Facebook had announced a video casting feature in October 2016. — Facebook, Inc Videos surfaced in Facebook feeds are to start playing with sound on automatically, representatives from the social network said, with a vertical video tweak, watch and scroll, and a separate TV app also announced.  "As people watch more video on phones, they've come to expect sound when the volume on their device is turned on," Facebook argued in a Feb 14 post outlining several ways in which video is being emphasised by the social networking platform.  "With this update, sound fades in and out as you scroll through videos in News Feed, bringing those videos to life."  There are two exceptions to the new rule: videos won't play with sound on phones set to silent mode, and the feature can be turned off by toggling a "Videos in News Feed Start With Sound" from Settings in the Android, iPhone and iPad apps.  The company is also introducing minimisable video, allowing users to have a video play and remain on screen while they continue to scroll through other items presented via the Facebook News Feed.  On Android, the smaller video display can stay on screen after users switch away from the Facebook app.  Fourthly, a Facebook video app has been created for Apple, Amazon Fire and Samsung Smart TVs.  It expands on a 2016 mobile app update that allowed users to stream Facebook video from their devices to a compatible TV, by collating "videos shared by friends or Pages you follow, top live videos from around the world, and recommended videos based on your interests[,] videos you've saved to watch later [and] videos you've watched, shared or uploaded" within one smart TV app.  The update continues a trend of emphasising video content; in 2016, Facebook entered into talks with content publishers to produce exclusive videos for the social network. — AFP Relaxnews  Related Stories You May Be Interested Gartner: Spend your limited IT budget wisely ‘Zelda: Breath of the Wild’ introduces series-first Season Pass Lenovo’s profit misses estimates after PC rivals erode lead Ford bets big on artificial intelligence Facebook plans video autoplay changes, TV app One bot to rule them all?

Probably neither did President Donald Trump when he first donned his now-famous slogan laden red cap. But two New York designers were inspired enough from his “Make America Great Again” mantra that they sent men and women down the runway in New York with a ripped version of the campaign hat. It’s just one example of how the fashion industry — never one known for shying away from political or cultural expression — has taken to the runway to voice opinions amidst the glamour of New York Fashion Week. Celebrity-magnet Prabal Gurung opened his show with his usual sophisticated fare: feminine silk skirts flowed underneath deliciously oversized cable knit sweaters so big they could be blankets. But for his closing walk of the show, Gurung had model-of-the-moment — Bella Hadid — lead a charge of mannequins in shirts that read: “The Future is Female” and “I am an immigrant.” Every woman wore a different shirt, and the messages (“Nevertheless, she persisted”) were full-frontal. Gone are the days of fashion and politics being mutually exclusive, Gurung told CNN in a recent phone interview. “We’re living in this day and age and time when we are questioning, and should be questioning, what is our responsibility, our part, our action,” the designer said, when asked why he designed the politically charged shirts. Gurung said he was inspired by the women’s march in New York City last month, which he and models in his fashion show participated in. “It’s the right thing to do. That’s how we all feel. It is basic human decency. There is nothing political about it,” he said. By and large, the fashion industry backed Democrat Hillary Clinton as candidate. There was even a fashion-show sponsored fundraiser in September featuring Tory Burch, Marc Jacobs and Dian von Furstenburg (among others) designed “I’m With Her” T-shirts sold on the campaign website. Steven Kolb, the president of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, said fashion has always been politically vocal. For example, he offered, designers were outspoken advocates in the 80s for HIV/AIDS awareness. He does admit, however, the mood may be heightened now. “It’s always been a part of our industry, but maybe it’s more amplified now because of this election we just came out of,” he told CNN in a recent phone interview. Fashion week represents the industry’s most high-profile event; a biannual Super Bowl featuring an international jet set of editors, buyers, stylists and even celebrities who descend on the Big Apple for a highly publicized array of fashion shows. Every sashay is snapped, tweeted, filtered and posted within milliseconds. This year, the fashion designer council harnessed the power of social media to raise money for Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit women’s health organization providing an array of reproductive health services. About 3% of those services are abortions, according to the group, making it a favorite target of conservative politicians. Easily the most organized and influential fashion organization in the country, the Council of Fashion Designers of America designed a bright pink pin that says: “Fashion stands with Planned Parenthood.” For every social media post with the pin and hashtag #IStandwithPP, a donation will be made to the organization, said Kolb. Even Vogue editor extraordinaire Anna Wintour was spotted wearing one pinned conspicuously to her scarf at a show. But it was the duo designers behind Public School that reimagined Trump’s iconic red campaign hat with white lettering. A brand with major street cred, there was a lopped-off printed hoodie with Michael Jordan’s visage on the front and the words “We Need Leaders” printed on the back. “This Land is Our Land,” a Bernie Sanders favorite song used during his rallies on the campaign trail, provided the musical backdrop for the strutting. There is always the consideration that such a strong message could be bad for business, but Gurung says that so far, he has experienced no commercial backlash. “On the contrary, I’ve gotten the best reaction from my retail partners like Bergdorfs, Saks, Neiman, Nordstrom, stores and clients. Everyone was excited. It was truly about calling the world together,” he said. Kolb similarly said he didn’t think his political expression would be bad for business. “Mostly what I see is not an anti-Trump sentiment, but more of an alignment or show of support for communities that might be disenfranchised or women’s organizations like Planned Parenthood that provide health care for those in need. You think about the customer, and the industry, who works in the industry. It’s part of who we are,” he said.

The Public Schools Funding Formula Interim Committee released its report Wednesday summarizing work accomplished and recommendations for action this year. The committee’s work is far from done — the original plan was for it to finish in 2018 — but the committee hopes to begin taking concrete action this year. The committee met throughout 2016, holding five hearings across the state. “We switched from our public input structure from a ‘sit and listen’ session to a dialogue where you could have two-way conversation, that’s where committee members were able to get a deep understanding of the issues districts are facing as a result of an outdated formula,” said Rep. Wendy Horman, R-Idaho Falls. Horman and Sen. Chuck Winder, R-Boise, are leading the committee. Horman holds a particularly powerful position for schools. She serves on the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, which sets annual state budgets. And for the last several years, she has been charged with carrying the budget for public schools, the single largest chunk of state spending. Not only does she exercise considerable sway over how that budget takes shape, she also understands it at a level of detail shared by few other lawmakers. That’s the reason Speaker Scott Bedke, R-Oakley, said he tapped Horman to be the House’s leader on the committee. The funding formula dictates how state and many federal education funds are distributed to school districts. The formula was last revamped in 1994, and, over time, a number of problems have developed. Lawmakers have identified several so far. One recommendation is that Idaho re-examine its reliance on a metric called “support units.” Support units are an estimate of the number of personnel a school ought to need based on its average daily attendance. Idaho is one of only seven states whose formulae distribute funds based on the number of staff a school needs, rather than on the basis of the number of students in a school, the committee found. Another is to fix the proliferation of line items in the education budget. When the formula was first drawn up, schools had a lot of choice about how they would use state funds, Horman said. Over time, it became clear that the formula was leaving some schools with difficulty covering certain kinds of expenses. Instead of rebuilding the formula, lawmakers patched it, creating new line items dedicated for specific purposes as problems arose. But with 20 years of patches, some school districts now often find that state funding doesn’t match their particular needs. In the last 10 years, the number of line items has grown from 26 to 41. “We heard loud and clear that districts would like some additional flexibility in those line items,” Horman said. The committee also returned a number of recommendations that could see action this year. A key recommendation is that the state reduce the number of line items, putting that money in larger pots that would give schools more local control over the funds. “I’m working with JFAC members to implement some of these recommendations, so that we can take care of them this session,” Horman said. If lawmakers can agree on a plan, it could mean greater spending flexibility for schools this year. The Wilder school district, for example, was just granted 500 iPads by Apple, Horman said. So it may need less for in-classroom technology and more for services such as wireless internet or internet technology staff. Combining line items into larger buckets could allow the district that flexibility. Another recommendation is to increase funding for school personnel other than teachers and administrators — a group referred to as “classified staff.” Classified staff originally meant positions such as playground supervisors, cafeteria servers and janitors. Today, those positions are still classified staff, but so are network administrators, who often make $50,000 to $60,000 per year. But the state only funds about $20,000 per classified position. “One way we could address that (this year) is increasing IT staffing salaries as a bridge to a new structure,” Horman said. Another pressing issue facing school districts is how to fund the ever-rising cost of health insurance. Currently, many schools use discretionary funds to cover that cost, but discretionary dollars are generally increased to cover inflation. The cost of health insurance has been rising faster than the pace of inflation for decades. Horman said there’s an ongoing debate as to whether that should be done with a line item or by splitting discretionary funding into two pots — one which could be increased in line with the general rate of inflation and another that could be tacked to health insurance increases. The committee also recommended changes to the way the state funds school buildings and transportation. The second phase of the committee’s work will come with costs estimated to be around $400,000. That would cover computer modeling that would allow the committee to test out different proposed replacement formulas to see how they would impact schools around the state. It also would cover the cost of education consultants to assist in the process. Horman said she hopes the next steps can be accomplished by 2018, but it will depend on what the committee finds during the next year. “I’d rather do it right than fast,” she said.

After months of irrelevant banter and confusing rhetoric, someone is ready to lead. Different organizations have attempted to gain control of OWS, but now the destiny of the movement is clear. A voice for Occupy Wall Street has stepped up. It’s time is now. Ladies and gentlemen … Miley Cyrus. Yes, Miley Cyrus has offered her support for Occupy Wall Street. This week on her website, the social conscience of a generation released a video “dedicated to the thousands of people who are standing up for what they believe in.” The video posted by Cyrus edits Occupy Wall Street video clips over her song “Liberty Walk” from the CD “Can’t be Tamed” — available at Best Buy (NYSE-BBY) for $9.99. Someone needs to take Miley aside and explain to her that the only reason she is relevant is because she made a shitload of Wall Street dough off the “Hannah Montana” franchise, a fictitious corporate nom de plume created for her by Disney (NYSE-DIS). Without The Mouse’s creation of Hannah Montana — movie available at Target (AMEX-TDTF) for $8.19 — Miley Cyrus would be covering “Achy Breaky Heart” in the lobby of the Hampton Inn (NYSE-HIL) in Ashland, Kentucky. I have no particular animosity towards Miss Cyrus. Last week at her nineteenth birthday party she admitted to being a “stoner.” This was following an earlier video of her smoking “legal” pot from a glass bong. For those of us who went to college in the ’70s — a generation one toke away from being an entire graduating class of Lindsay Lohans — her smoking habit is almost endearing. Miley Cyrus’s support for Occupy Wall Street points out the absurdity of the entire protest. Back in June, M Magazine declared Miley Cyrus to be the richest teen in the world and placed her personal wealth at $120,000,000.00. That’s a lot of zeros for someone who wants to show support for people who hate greed. Don’t blame Miley Cyrus for the hypocrisy of OWS. Just peruse the pictures from the various OWS locations. Participants in the Wall Street bash-a-thon are drinking Starbucks (NASDAQ-SBUX) coffee, talking on their Apple (NASDAQ-AAPL) iPhones and browsing the Internet on their Hewlett Packard (NYSE-HPQ) laptops. The fact of the matter is the Occupiers — just like Miley Cyrus — are addicted to corporate America. The irony of people protesting greed while drinking $5.00 cups of coffee is priceless. The great philosopher, Pogo, once said, “We have met the enemy and he is us.” Of course, after he said that, Pogo was fired and is now living in a tent in Zuccotti Park. The thought that protesters support the very system they despise must send a chill right through their North Face (NYSE-VFC) jackets and Ugg boots (NASDAQ-GS). Somewhere in Seattle, Howard Schultz, the CEO of Starbucks, is looking at a picture of a protester drinking a cup of his coffee and laughing his ass off.

TORRE via ESPN Feb 15, 2017, 7:01 PM ET 0 Shares Email Star 0 Shares Email This story appears in ESPN The Magazine's Feb. 27 Entertainment Issue. "When LeBron was playing with the Heat, they went to Cleveland, and he wanted to spend the night. They don't do overnights. Teams just don't. So now [coach Erik] Spoelstra has to text [president Pat] Riley and say, 'What do I do in this situation?' And Pat, who has iron-fist rules, answers, 'You are on the plane. You are with this team.' You can't hold up the whole team because you and your mom and your posse want to spend an extra night in Cleveland. ... I do know LeBron likes special treatment. He needs things his way." -- Phil Jackson, Knicks president Magic had offers to own the Warriors, Knicks LeBron knows when he needs to rest Magic has high praise for Michael and Jemele LeBron building media empire sc "It just sucks that now at this point, having one of the biggest businesses you can have both on and off the floor, having a certified agent in Rich Paul, having a certified business partner in Maverick Carter, who's done so many great business [deals], that the title for young African-Americans is the word 'posse.'" -- LeBron James To men who hate having their power tested, Maverick Carter is a special nightmare. Heat president Pat Riley, a Hall of Fame coach, can't control Carter. Cavs owner Dan Gilbert, a billionaire capitalist, can't buy away Carter's fealty to his lifelong friend, LeBron James. Phil Jackson, who coached no less than Michael Effing Jordan, can't fathom a man challenging his team's travel itinerary -- so what kind of blasphemy would Jackson profess to see if he walked into Carter's Las Vegas hotel suite right now? It's a Thursday night in January, and Draymond Green, James' ostensible Warriors rival, laughs from a love seat in the marble-floored living room. Crumpled on a nearby couch is a napping Chris Bosh, who's still waging a cold war with Riley's Heat. As of an hour ago, I didn't know this enormous, mahogany-walled edifice existed. Which is no accident. The Mansion's VIP-only villas, decorated in the style of a Florentine, yes, mansion, are hidden behind a warren of secure hallways linked to the MGM Grand's high-roller tables. Welcome to an ironfisted coach's posse-driven fever dream. "This," says Carter, barefoot and raspy-voiced, swaddled in gray sweats and a black hoodie that reads UNINTERRUPTED, "is like the All-Star Game." Sort of. The all-stars Carter is referring to are the likes of Google, Amazon, Verizon, Facebook and Twitter, the luminaries of the planet's biggest tech convention, the Consumer Electronics Show. Carter's business partner, James, is back East with the Cavs -- the man, after all, has a day job. Meanwhile, Carter, head of SpringHill Entertainment, their multiplatform production company, has hosted a dozen meetings over the past three days with chief marketing officers, media execs and ad agencies. "Maverick's network is at the highest levels of business in the U.S. and abroad," says Harvard Business School professor Anita Elberse, who published a case study about James and Carter in 2009. "He stands shoulder to shoulder with Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates. And then, in the entertainment world, it's a ridiculous list of movers and shakers." Earlier today, Carter moderated a Life Off the Court panel with Green and Bosh. Green, who has the day off between home games, was a founding partner of Uninterrupted, SpringHill's online network for athlete-centric, nonjournalistic projects. And Bosh's nap owes to the daylong gauntlet of CES meetings Carter helped arrange. Now, as the 6-foot-4 Carter leans back in a wooden chair, his right leg up on a desk, he takes stock of the game plan that he and his decidedly more famous partner have committed to: "LeBron and I have always been interested in the long game. And the long game here is to build a media company. To really, truly build a media company." Jocks, of course, have always cashed in as actors or "human billboards," as one Hollywood agent puts it. (Think O.J. Simpson in The Naked Gun, Shaquille O'Neal in any of his 28 acting credits.) But SpringHill, named for the Akron projects where James lived until his rookie year, is attempting to win a harder game. Consider: Two decades ago, when Jordan was making Space Jam, he leveraged his celebrity to get Warner Bros. to erect an outdoor court for him and his buddies to use between takes. Eighteen months ago, James and Carter persuaded that same studio to ink them to an overall production deal -- for film, television and digital video -- that Warner Bros. called unprecedented in scope. A few months after that, Warner Bros. and Turner Sports invested $15.8 million into Uninterrupted. And so as James trudges toward a seventh straight NBA Finals, he delegates to Carter, trusting his erstwhile high school teammate to build out the SpringHill and Uninterrupted portfolios. And Carter, in turn, relies on an inner circle that includes their high-powered entertainment agent, Ari Emanuel, the co-CEO of William Morris Endeavor. "We're still climbing Mount Kilimanjaro," James says. "But having this group of people, who can put together my thoughts and bring them to fruition, is the vision that I had 10-plus years ago." Those thoughts have led to Survivor's Remorse, SpringHill's first show, a scripted drama, renewed for its fourth season on Starz, about a basketball player balancing fortune and family. Then there's The Wall, the prime-time NBC game show that premiered in January to roughly 7 million viewers and has already been picked up for 20 more episodes. There's Cleveland Hustles, an unscripted CNBC series, renewed for a second season, in which Ohio entrepreneurs compete to revitalize distressed neighborhoods. There's the oft-discussed Space Jam 2, in development at Warner Bros. There's a feature-length documentary about Muhammad Ali coming for HBO. There's a comedy in development for New Line Cinema about a guy who pretends to be an NBA draft pick. And there are three other scripted series -- a Cleveland-based family comedy and a sports medicine drama, both sold to NBC, and a comedy about assistants at a sports agency sold to CBS. "LeBron James will have one of the most exciting careers to be a part of for the next two decades," says Paul Telegdy, who oversees The Wall as NBC's president of alternative and reality programming. "Business, entertainment, anything you could apply branding to, he stretches the imagination." Indeed, more than a dozen sources directly familiar with SpringHill, including rival producers, filmmakers and media executives, declare LeBron James, without debate, the most powerful athlete in entertainment today. And then they make sure to stress something else: the probability that James will ultimately fail. Eight years ago, in an article for Sports Illustrated, I asked Magic Johnson -- the gold standard for athlete capitalists -- how he helps players avoid financial suicide. He underscored one of his cardinal rules: When players call Johnson for counsel, which happens all the time, he stops them cold if they mention any business plan -- be it for a record label, a car wash, a production company -- featuring a buddy or relative. "That's the killer," said Johnson, who added that he became CEO of his eponymous billion-dollar conglomerate by rejecting friends and family in favor of the shiny suits who sat courtside at Lakers games. "They hire these people not because of expertise but because they're friends. Well, they'll fail." It is fair to say that James, Johnson's spiritual descendant on the court, has embraced an opposite vision off it. James was only 5 when he first befriended Carter, whose 9th birthday party he attended because of a mutual family friend. When James was a freshman at St. Vincent-St. Mary, Carter was the senior captain on their state championship basketball team. So as I relay Johnson's philosophy to James, now 32, the question hangs in the air: Didn't he worry about empowering personal friendship over professional experience? "I never even got caught up in the narrative," James replies. "I wasn't going to let anything else stop me from what I wanted to do." To Johnson, partnering with Carter, a college dropout, would qualify as intrinsically problematic. To James, Carter is what makes entrepreneurship worthwhile. "I knew I had to grow as a businessperson," James says. "So why not let the guys around me grow with me? We can all see our mistakes. Let's get in the bunker together." Their first bunker, LRMR Marketing, was constructed at Carter's mother's kitchen table in Akron, not long after James fired Aaron and Eric Goodwin, his well-established sports agents, in 2005. The LRMR acronym famously stood for LeBron James, Rich Paul, Maverick Carter and Randy Mims, four friends from Ohio. James, only 20, yearned to become his own kind of boss. "I don't want to have guys around me who are just along for the ride," he says. "I want guys around me to actually put rides in the amusement park." Ask Carter, who was all of 23 then, what he recalls of the blowback such aspirations ignited and he recalls one line in particular: A few years from now, an America Online columnist wrote in 2005, when LeBron needs knee surgery, he'll have his plumber do the job. "It's a very funny line," Carter says now. Of course, back in 2010, when James jerseys were non-metaphorically on fire across America, such jokes landed differently. LRMR's first big television project was The Decision -- the broadly consumed and deeply unpopular ESPN prime-time special wherein James announced he was leaving the Cavs for the Heat. At the time, NBA commissioner David Stern called the show "ill-conceived, badly produced and poorly executed." "[James] seems to have no idea of the public relations damage he has inflicted on himself," New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote. (In fairness: The same could be said of ESPN.) Forget the $6 million The Decision would raise for charity. That fall, CNBC reported that it "was one of the most detrimental acts -- not related to any anti-social behavior -- by a sports personality since the Q Scores were first developed more than 45 years ago." Carter, who takes ownership of the one-hour show, was embarrassed by the packaging and execution of The Decision. But as America resolved to hate-watch James, LRMR pivoted, seeking an outside opinion on public relations that would have made Magic proud. "We knew we were going to take bumps and bruises, like what happened in '10," James says. "But we always looked at it like a marathon, not a sprint." LRMR's new running partner: Adam Mendelsohn, a political strategist who'd advised Fortune 50 clients and served as deputy chief of staff to California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Mendelsohn's mission was to forecast the series of consequences that come crashing down, domino-like, whenever an intensely scrutinized celebrity makes a public decision. "I look at everything from 100,000 feet," Carter says. "Adam asks, 'Did you think about this thing?'" In 2014, it was James who pushed a return to Cleveland -- all but ensuring the inverse of the reaction from four years before. But it was Mendelsohn who managed the announcement. This time LeBron took to print, breaking the news with a heartfelt, Ohio-focused Sports Illustrated cover essay that helped complete an EKG-like trajectory. Like Anakin Skywalker, James went from hero (Nike slogan: "We are all witnesses") to villain ( Decision punch line: "I'm going to take my talents to South Beach") ... to hero again (essay pull quote: "Nothing is given. Everything is earned"). And if Riley's Heat -- like Gilbert's Cavs in 2010 -- also felt viscerally betrayed? No matter. The production was unassailable. "People used to ask me questions like, 'Is LeBron smart?'" Paul Wachter says. Wachter, a Los Angeles-based financial adviser whom James hired after leaving the Goodwin brothers, always believed their partnership was answer enough. "Think about this: LeBron and Maverick, when they first started out in Akron, went through the trouble of finding a financial guy in LA who turned out to be 25 years older than they are. They did the research! Are they intelligent? Of course they're intelligent. They're unusually intellectually curious -- they both are. Many celebrities and athletes just go, 'Wow, we're making money! Let's go buy a Bentley!'" Wachter -- who also advises, among others, Bono, Schwarzenegger, music mogul Jimmy Iovine and Boston Red Sox chairman Tom Werner -- would know. Carter sought him out through the founders of a private aviation company, Marquis Jet, which was bought by NetJets, which was owned by Warren Buffett, who would later enter Carter's fabled Rolodex too. And it was Wachter, the CEO of Main Street Advisors, who most encouraged James to demand the very corporate equity that current players cannot acquire from the NBA itself. In fact, for all the ink spilled about LRMR, Carter has assembled what Johnson might have instructed James to build from the start: a network of shiny suits and credentialed brains. Wachter advised James, who loves biking, to buy an ownership stake in Cannondale Bicycle Corp. in 2007. (LRMR would cash out a year later, after Cannondale had quadrupled in value.) The next year, James and Carter acquired equity in Beats Electronics, which was co-founded by Iovine. (Apple would buy Beats for a $3 billion windfall in 2014.) In 2011, LRMR partnered with Werner's Fenway Sports Group, making James and Carter minority shareholders in Premier League power Liverpool. (No other active pro athlete can claim to be an owner of a team that size.) In 2015, James left the guaranteed millions of McDonald's to hawk Blaze Pizza, a smaller franchise in which he and Carter were original investors. (Blaze would be named the fastest-growing restaurant chain in America in 2016.) And then, before 2015 was over, Wachter negotiated James' landmark lifetime deal with Nike. (The contract can reportedly pay up to $1 billion.) Wachter, who sits on the board of Time Warner, was the guy who connected SpringHill and Uninterrupted to Warner Bros. and Turner Sports -- and connected Carter to Mendelsohn. Their relationship has been mutually beneficial. "In 12 years, I've never arranged a meeting for either LeBron or Maverick with anyone -- on Wall Street, in Hollywood or even with Warren Buffett -- where the feedback was not enormously positive," Wachter says. "Not once. And that's unusual." Still, Carter knows he lacks the pedigree that would inoculate him from a certain type of dismissive profiling. He has openly discussed how his father, Otis, has done time for selling drugs. How his mother, Katherine, was a social worker. How his own higher education consisted of scattered course credits from Western Michigan -- where he scored two points a game as a freshman off the bench -- and his hometown University of Akron, which he evacuated to work for Nike's marketing department as a field rep once James entered the league. But Carter has also lectured at Harvard Business School several times over the past decade. And though "it's natural for students here to think, 'Oh, Maverick just lucked out, he grew up with LeBron,'" Elberse says, when the class starts asking him probing questions, Carter delivers. They watch him cover five blackboards with sales diagrams depicting various fee structures in white chalk. They listen to him break down Elberse's case study, which focused on why James declined deals with Electronic Arts and 2K Games. The answer: a third bidder, Microsoft, offered greater creative control and up to 20 percent of video game profits, permitting James and Carter the ownership they crave. "What becomes clear is that the choices he and LeBron make are not opportunistic," Elberse continues. "[Maverick] blows these people away." The element of surprise has its advantages. But after more than a decade in business -- where credibility is supposedly measured in power, influence and wealth, all of which Carter has -- underestimation can be frustrating. "One thing that really bothers me," he says, "is when a young black person speaks or leads a conversation, and afterward a white person says, 'You're really articulate.'" To be clear: Carter knows there's luck in his journey. He openly praises James for being an executive-level job creator for those who otherwise might never have been offered entry-level. Randy Mims is now the Cavaliers' executive administrator of player programs and team logistics. Rich Paul, who used to sell throwback jerseys out of his trunk -- and first encountered James at the Akron-Canton Airport in 2002 -- is now the respected head of his own agency, Klutch Sports Group, which reps 13 NBA players, including James and 2016 No. 1 pick Ben Simmons. And Carter, once so secretive, is now managing a public portfolio that you can judge for yourself -- that they hope you will judge for yourself -- on your screen of choice. To wander the Warner Bros. studio lot in Burbank, California, is to encounter many hidden attractions: the warehouse full of Batmobiles, Clint Eastwood's office, the display case with five Maltese falcons. But Building 183, a two-story house with a red front door and gray vinyl siding, is perhaps the most anonymous of all. To say the place is less posse and more Gilmore Girls is not to traffic in random analogy. The family drama was filmed right here, on the tree-lined pseudo street that today houses, in Building 183, SpringHill Entertainment -- the name of an urban housing project now insinuated into a fictional, suburban Connecticut street. If it weren't for the curbside parking spot, where l. JAMES is stenciled onto the pavement, there'd be no sign of the ambition Warner Bros. is funding inside. It's here where Carter, following the triumph of The Decision 2.0, has again chosen to pivot. A marketing firm? That's so 2015. "LRMR is not anything more than a family office now," Carter explains. He's betting their collective futures on SpringHill, their second bunker -- an entity that had been sitting around since birthing More Than a Game, a documentary about James and St. Vincent-St. Mary that finished second to Slumdog Millionaire at the 2008 Toronto Film Festival. "I'd never contemplated being in TV and film," Carter says. "But I love working with athletes and talent and shaping great stories." It was obvious that James, who loved hosting Saturday Night Live in 2007, was eager to be an owner in an industry he adored -- not just a human billboard. "[LeBron] already watches as many movies as I watch," says Warner Bros. CEO Kevin Tsujihara. "And I watch a s--- ton of movies." And Hollywood -- a geographic descriptor that fails, increasingly, to describe the power Silicon Valley has in entertainment -- was ready. Once upon a time, humans consumed a rigid menu of terrestrial channels. Now we are all Roman emperors, standing over a messy, all-you-can-eat buffet of CES-flavored media. "We're in the world of unlimited choice," NBC's Telegdy says. "We're in a world of TV everywhere, on demand, with access to thousands of hours of catalog, at the same time as new programming, at a rate that surpasses our wildest imaginings. It's extremely hard to cut through the clutter. LeBron James is a clutter cutter." Such an economy prizes James for the same basic reason comic book superheroes dominate modern cinema and television: He's a globally recognizable brand that attracts eyeballs. With more than 60 million followers between Twitter and Instagram, James can create viral marketing, as when he and Carter filmed themselves delivering $1.3 million cash to winners of The Wall. "There could be surveillance-camera footage of LeBron watching TV," says one filmmaker who's dealt with SpringHill, "and some channel would buy it for 90 minutes." That, Carter knows, is the converted power of The Decision 1.0. By returning to the Cavs -- and winning them their first championship -- James did something even more unthinkable: He won over the millions of viewers who hate-watched him. Today, LeBron is both David and Goliath; Akron and Hollywood; mill town and mansion; blue-collar and billionaire. He projects a scandal-free bipartisanship that reminds Hollywood power brokers of Dwayne "the Rock" Johnson, who went from intentional wrestling heel to the highest-paid actor in the industry last year. But James' inner circle pushes back on that parallel. It's too limiting, they say. Who else can do all this while at the pinnacle of a global sport? Who else can speak out on civil rights and police misconduct ... and campaign for Hillary Clinton ... and tweet support for the Women's March ... and win the NAACP's Jackie Robinson Sports Award ... and remain beloved in the Rust Belt? Who else can found a media company that's half people of color, helmed by a trio of black senior execs: Carter, Uninterrupted's Devin Johnson, SpringHill's Jamal Henderson? When Henderson left his job as a senior manager at Pepsi to join SpringHill in 2015, notably, he asked around for a list of 10 black names he needed to meet in the industry. The consensus reply? We're not sure we can get to 10. "LeBron is a bridge to black programming," says director and comedian Neal Brennan, who co-created Chappelle's Show and has worked with James on commercial shoots. "The impetus for picking up a show may start off stupid, even embarrassing: LeBron's a guy executives just want to meet. But then white people get access to a smart black dude who has them spend time around other smart black people." And while it's true that Building 183 has consistently leveraged the magnetic pull of LeBron, Carter does not want to be known only for merchandising his friend's image. "People will tell me about Survivor's Remorse, 'Wow, that show you guys are making is really good,'" he says. "That's basically them saying, 'I thought you were going to make something s----y and just vanity.'" He sighs. While James helps sell the shows, he isn't all over them. Given his day job, he can't possibly be. That's why the King's typically empty second-floor office consists of tan leather couches and a television but no desk. And that's why Carter, Henderson and Johnson -- who dream of one day producing the next Atlanta, the next Moonlight and, yes, the next Space Jam -- go to work. "Kobe was contentious, combative," says Gotham Chopra, an executive producer at Uninterrupted and the producer of the Showtime doc Kobe Bryant's Muse. "I was constantly texting him on every little decision. LeBron doesn't seem to have that need. He wants to succeed. But he still wants to empower you." It's a january afternoon at the Cleveland Clinic Courts, and after chucking a basketball 40 feet up off a wall, catching it and tomahawking it in one motion -- you know, as one does -- James walks over to reveal his own muse. How long has James seriously wanted to act? "Ever since I was a kid," he says. "I used to always walk around the house pretending I was the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air." It was, he admits, more than just a character on TV. More like an inspiration. "The guy makes it out of Philadelphia? I treated that as Akron, Ohio. He makes it to Los Angeles with a rich family, but he can still be himself? That's what I wanted to be. With the blazer inside out, with the Air Jordan 5s on. All of that." James doesn't share this because he's angling to be Will Smith in a Fresher Prince reboot (although, note to self: spectacular idea). It's mostly just how he talks about acting -- with the thrilled sincerity of a theater major who's suddenly making it in Hollywood. "One of our stewardesses yesterday, she came up to me after I had just got done watching The Sopranos -- I'm rewatching The Sopranos, from the beginning, all the way down; I love that show -- and she was like, 'I hate to disturb you, but please tell me there's a Trainwreck 2 coming.'" James grins sheepishly. It's a humblebrag and he knows it. "This is a lady who probably doesn't care about basketball," he says. "She was like, 'You're amazing!'" Talk to enough people around Los Angeles, though, and you hear a less generous critique. In basketball, it has long appeared as if the game is too easy for the 6-foot-8, 250-pound James, whose singular physique can make tomahawks look routine. In entertainment, there are eerily parallel presumptions about SpringHill's operation. "I mean, they have LeBron James," more than one rival producer says, stretching every syllable for emphasis. Once upon a time, elevating a Maverick Carter seemed too risky; now, in a blockbuster-seeking, celebrity-leveraging attention economy, it's as if the posse seems too big to fail. "We hear that," James says. "That he's bigger and stronger than everybody, so he should win. That he has that platform, so he should be successful off the court. But it's not true." With athletes in media, Carter warns, "there are a zillion failed projects." The smile is gone from James' face now. "I've been blessed with God-given ability," he says. "But I get in here for an 11 o'clock practice at 8:30, and I bust my ass in the weight room. I get on the court before practice for another hour and I work on my craft. And off the court, yes, we've been given a platform where people would like to listen to what I have to say. But how long can we keep that door open?" LeBron Inc. is huge business right now, Carter knows. But quietly, the inner circle also believes that it's worth pondering: Is a James who embraces political activism -- and ethers Charles Barkley -- trading mass adulation for moral authenticity? Can the staggering failure rate in Hollywood turn their global brand into a burst bubble? Has the marathon of fame run its course? Hollywood, like Silicon Valley, ritualistically eats even its biggest stars. One industry analysis suggests that 98 percent of television scripts bought by networks fail commercially and that only 35 percent of new shows last longer than a single season. Another study estimates that 80 percent of movies wind up unprofitable. As a production company, LeBron Inc.'s ambitious future is by no means guaranteed. "It's rare to go from zero to 60 that fast across so many different platforms," Tsujihara says. There's even an added risk for an athlete that doesn't exist for an actor or a reality star, a danger that Carter has feared so superstitiously -- since well before that AOL columnist's 2005 prophecy -- that it explains how James wound up playing himself in Trainwreck, the 2015 Judd Apatow and Amy Schumer comedy. Originally, Carter says, Apatow wanted James to cameo as a LeBron James who hurts his knee and is operated on by lead actor Bill Hader, playing a renowned orthopedic surgeon. We're not doing that role for two reasons, Carter recalls telling Apatow. One, that's not the right role for LeBron James. And two, he's never been hurt. I'm not even going to have him act like he's hurt. So Apatow, Hader and Carter partnered to invent a new, expanded role -- Hader's best friend. (Amar'e Stoudemire, naturally, was the one who ended up getting hurt.) James was lauded by critics from The New York Times (which declared James "a surprisingly limber comic presence") and The New Yorker ("greatest motion-picture acting performance by an active professional basketball player of all time"). Slate declared him "the best part of this movie." Still: Trainwreck wasn't James' film, as they say in the industry. "He's not even on the poster," Carter notes. And as much as James overdelivered, his character was, yes, himself. Today, James has committed to sitting down each offseason in LA -- where he bought a mansion two years ago -- and reviewing offers for his next movie role. And the offers are coming. But in Cleveland, I ask the man who's lived as both an idol and a villain, and knows the thin line between the two, if at some point he might want to be what every blockbuster-starved producer is truly craving. A role that Carter knows can be the most lucrative in modern entertainment. A role that, given the prospect of sequels and action figures and amusement park rides, is akin to failure insurance. James grins, catching the drift, perhaps mentally fitting himself into the costume already -- a costume that, for once, would not require the padding of fake Hollywood rubber muscles. "I love comedy," LeBron replies. "But I've always wanted to be a superhero." Pablo S. TorreTorre is a senior writer for ESPN based in Brooklyn, NY.

Or maybe more invasive, for that matter. Google and Amazon, two companies that dabble in smartphones (or previously, for Amazon) are reportedly mulling over evolving their Amazon Echo and Google Home speakers from smart home hubs to part time hands-free smartphones. While it might seem like a small step, considering how both companies already have strong presences in the mobile market, it is going to be a big leap in terms of what the companies may or may not collect from users. Amazon Echo and Google Home would effectively become the modern equivalent of speaker phones. It isn’t an alien concept but it’s still an awkward behavior for many in practice. Even more so in this case, as you will be speaking to a speaker rather than to a phone. Then again, the Amazon Echo has almost become commonplace that speaking to a canister no long feels too weird anymore. One consideration for this new feature is whether the speakers themselves will connect to phone lines. They could, for example, get their own numbers or perhaps tap into existing land lines or smartphones. Either way, new hardware would be required at the very least, which means this generation of speakers could be left out in the cold. The biggest hurdle that the two companies will face, however, won’t be the technical. It will, instead, be about privacy. Technically, these speakers already do record some amount of audio all the time, which it requires in order to have that always listening effect. Phone conversations, however, are entirely different can of worms. Naturally, the two companies will promise they won’t record conversations, but they will most likely still harvest some metadata out of it. Such a new phase of development could throw a wrench in Apple’s plans of launching its own Siri-powered speaker. Rumors indicate that such a device is still in the prototyping stage, which could mean that Apple will be terribly late for the party when it does launch.

Gartner analysts estimate that BlackBerry's once-dominant platform hit 0.0 percent market share in the fourth quarter of 2016. The company did ship 207,000 phones, but that gives it less than half the unit volume of the "other OS" category. This wasn't hard to see coming given BlackBerry's years-long decline, gradual shift toward Android and recent focus on services. It's still incredibly symbolic, however, and shows that the company's deal with TCL effectively amounts to starting from scratch, Engadget says. Microsoft won't be cheering much, either. Windows' share of the mobile space fell from 1.1 percent near the end of 2015 to 0.3 percent last year, with just shy of 1.1 million phones shipped. While that was virtually expected given the dearth of Windows phones (HP's Elite X3 was the real standout last fall), it leaves the platform not far behind BlackBerry. For all intents and purposes, this leaves the smartphone market down to just two platforms, Android (81.7 percent) and iOS (17.9 percent share). And it's rough even for some of those backing the winning horse. Samsung lost its lead among individual manufacturers after falling nearly 3 points to 17.8 percent. Gartner blames it on a combination of the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco and pressure from typically lower-priced Chinese rivals like Huawei and BBK. Apple didn't grow nearly as quickly as its Chinese counterparts, but its 17.9 percent share was enough to give it the lead. Simply put, the smartphone business is a vicious place to be -- even one misstep can cost a company dearly. Related links: Engadget.

Shockingly, almost half of all ­women in Scotland (44 per cent) are still not regularly checking for the signs and symptoms of breast cancer – mostly because they simply forget. giving Back Blog Mary Allison Director for Scotland at Breast Cancer Now Checking your breasts regularly could save your life. The earlier you find breast cancer the greater the ­likelihood of a better outcome. This year, around 4,600 women in Scotland will receive a diagnosis of breast cancer and almost 1,000 will lose their lives to the disease. Being aware of what is normal for you, and spotting any unusual changes to your breasts, could save your life. Everyone’s breasts are different, and they can change with age and at ­different times of the month. It’s important to get to know how your breasts normally look and feel so it will be easier to spot if there are any unusual changes. Most changes are nothing to ­worry about but if you do spot any ­anything that looks or feels ­different you should get it checked out by your doctor. We have a very effective breast screening programme in ­Scotland but even if you’ve recently had a mammogram, it is still vital that you check your breasts and take action if you spot anything out of the ­ordinary. Embargoed to 0100 Wednesday April 13 File photo dated 15/06/06 of a consultant analyzing a mammogram. Infertile women are more likely to have "dense breasts" - a significant risk factor for breast cancer, a new study suggests. PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo. Issue date: Wednesday April 13, 2016. Infertility and some infertility treatments are associated with small but significant increases in breast density, researchers said. See PA story HEALTH Breast. Photo credit should read: Rui Vieira/PA Wire So what should you look out for? Lumps are something to be wary of and can be one of the first signs or symptoms of breast cancer but most of them are benign (not cancerous). There are other important signs and symptoms too. Changes to skin texture, the appearance or direction of the nipple, a rash or crusting and nipple discharge can all be signs of breast cancer. There’s no special technique to checking – it’s all about getting to know how your breasts look and feel by checking regularly. After all, nobody knows your body like you do. It’s as simple as TLC; TOUCH your breasts. Can you feel anything ­unusual? LOOK for changes. Is there any change in shape or texture? CHECK anything unusual with your doctor. We know that most people want to be more breast aware but the biggest challenge for many people remains how to get into a habit of checking regularly. We want to help tackle this so Breast Cancer Now has created the Breast Check Now app to help ­women set a checking plan that fits with their lifestyle. Checking your breasts should be something that’s simple, easy and fits with your life, so we’ve designed the app to help women identify how often they want to check and to set reminders that work for them. The most important thing is to encourage ­people to keep checking ­regularly. The app also lets women keep a record of their checks so that they can refer back and see if anything’s changed. The app, which is available for free for both Apple and Android ­devices, will also provide information on what to look for, giving women the confidence to know what is normal for their body. The most important point in all of this is that it doesn’t matter when you check your breasts, as long as you check them regularly. In fact, by downloading our free Breast Check Now app you don’t have to worry about remembering. So what are you waiting for? You can download the free Breast Check Now app by searching “Breast Check Now” in Google Play or the App Store. Mary Allison is Breast Cancer Now’s Director for Scotland.

First: Shame on you. Second: Check out these services. Backing up your iPhone or iPad is one of the smartest things you can do as a device owner, but let's be honest: not everyone does (I don't… Please don't tell anyone). If you have a lot of sensitive data on your iPhone or iPad and it's just cacked on you and you don't have a backup, all is not lost. There are emergency data recovery services that specialize in recovering data that may seem otherwise lost for good. Trained technicians take your device apart and get right into the nitty gritty of your iPhone or iPad's storage on both the physical and software levels. Some of these services are garbage and lack security, customer service, and reliability. We've rounded up the best around so that you can get the help you need to recover your data safely and effectively. SalvageData DriveSavers Secure Data Recovery SalvageData Recovery SalvageData Recovery is number 1 on Top Ten Reviews' list of best recovery services and for good reason. The company has one of, if not the best evaluation process in the business (and it's free!), and its customer service is fantastic. The first person you talk to about your case becomes your single point of contact in the company. It has a certified clean room and security audit, so you know your hardware is safe from harmful particles, and you know your data is safe. One of SalvageData's best customer service features is the online chat, which is available 24/7. You can also submit and open recovery tickets right on the website instead of having to call someone. If you can do the recovery yourself, you'll even be given DIY software so that you don't have to send your phone or iPad away. If you're looking for the easiest way to recover your data with the most convenient options for contacting the company, check out SalvageData. Learn more DriveSavers DriveSavers has been in the data recovery business for over 30 years and as Top Ten Reviews can attest, it's an incredibly trustworthy service used by the likes of Harrison Ford and Buzz Aldrin. The company has proven it has a clean room, as well as a third-party security audit, so you know your data will be reliably recovered and completely safe. If you're looking for a reputable service (who isn't) that's been in the business since before cell phones were even mainstream, then DriveSavers is your bag. Learn more Secure Data Recovery Top Ten Reviews like Secure Data Recovery best for its ISO 4 Class 10 cleanroom, which decries that a cleanroom may only have particles less than 10,000 µm in a sample, which is insanely low. An ISO 1 can only have 10µm, which is reserved for the most sensitive scientific practices. In other words, Secure Data Recovery's cleanroom is really clean, meaning neither dust nor any other crap is going to get into the fine bits of your iPhone or iPad and screw it up. Secure Data Recovery has been in the biz for around 20 years, and it's been a member of the Better Business Bureau since 2011, making it a secure and reliable choice for your data recovery needs. Customer service is available 24/7/365 and the company is certified by Apple. Data is encrypted and your security is of the utmost importance. With locations in Canada, the U.S., Mexico, Australia, and the U.K., your data can be conveniently recovered relatively near to you, decreasing turnaround time for evaluations.
