I decided to build a PC; then make it work like a Mac. Ian Sherr Tech Culture by Ian Sherr 27 December 2016 12:00 am AEDT @iansherr Up Next Putin ordered campaign to influence US election, say intel agencies If you ask me what type of tech I have at home, you'd think I live in an Apple Store. We have iPhones, iPods, iPads, Apple TVs and Mac laptops. There isn't a PC in sight. I'm well-known for pushing my family to switch to Apple, too. No, it's not a cult thing. I'm just lazy. Did you know how much easier it is to fix these things? IBM says PCs cost about three times more than Macs to keep in good running order. And it's true. Just ask my in-laws how much less time I spend fixing computers when I visit, now that they've junked their old Windows-based PCs. My older brother, who convinced me to buy my first Apple computer (a PowerBook in 2003), often tells people he picks Macs because he doesn't have to routinely fight with them to work. But that changed for me in October. Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, got on stage at the company's Cupertino, California, headquarters to announce new Mac computers. Namely, the new MacBook Pro laptop, redesigned with, among other things, a nifty touchscreen built into the keyboard. I had my wallet out and waiting, but it wasn't for that. I needed a new desktop. I sat and watched the event along with my infant son, hoping Apple's Mac Mini computer would be updated with faster chips. I wanted a new Mac Mini because it's about the size of two best-seller books stacked next to each other -- easy to stash right beside our TV. It also starts at only $499 (you have to supply the monitor, keyboard and mouse, which I already have). The problem is Apple hasn't updated the Mac Mini since October 2014. For the past several years, I've used a nearly 7-year-old MacBook Pro as a media center, storing all our family photos, videos, iTunes movies, music and everything else. I've also started using Plex, an app that allows me to stream and search for all that stuff the same way you use Netflix, but also for -- y'know -- pictures of my son's first smile. This year, it was time for a replacement. Sadly, MacBook Pro laptops were all that'd be on tap. Even Apple's iMac (last updated October 2015) and Mac Pro (last updated December 2013) desktop computers were neglected. If I bought a Mac Mini today, I'd be paying full price for a machine more than two years old. Apple, you let me down. My son's first Apple event ended in disappointment. Photo by Ian Sherr/CNET Cook may have told employees Apple is still committed to making desktop computers, but that's not much consolation for people like me looking to buy a new machine this year. I can't just go and buy a PC, though. I rely on Apple's well-regarded MacOS software around my home. I've purchased far too many apps made for Macs, too. But Apple's software runs only on computers it sells, right? Wrong. There's an option known as Hackintosh. It's a process of getting MacOS to run on PCs, and it's possible thanks to a group of way-nerdier-than-I-am people who are always finding new ways to make it work. It's worth noting this is not something Apple supports, and may be a violation of the MacOS licensing terms. But it promised to be an interesting experience, and I was sure to learn a bit more about my computer as I went through it. Enlarge Image This sucker hasn't been upgraded in years. Photo by Sarah Tew / CNET After several hours of research, I decided to build a machine of my own. I went into this eyes wide open, prepared for the time, effort and hours of squinting at a screen this would take. I'd also have to learn how to manage driver software, the tech that makes stuff like video and audio work with an app. When you buy a Mac, Apple does all that for you. It just works. That's part of the appeal. On other computers, you have to keep CDs around and websites bookmarked just in case you need to reinstall a driver or update to make things work. Since my Hackintosh wasn't sanctioned by Apple, I'd have to figure all that stuff out now, too. Let me just say now that I'm not an engineer. My college degrees are in history and journalism. Building my Hackintosh It's relatively easy to get started on putting together a Hackintosh. There are many step-by-step guides and websites devoted to cataloging all the parts the community has found work with MacOS. This is important: Not all computer parts on store shelves offer the right software. One of the people who helps build these meticulous lists is Tonymacx86, whose website consistently draws several hundred thousand active members and as many as 10 million page views per month (and potentially more around the time of Apple events or MacOS updates). Though a trusted guide to many, Tonymacx86 prefers to stay anonymous to avoid overzealous fans and detractors alike. It used to be a lot harder to build a Hackintosh, but thanks to special software made by the community, even moderately computer-savvy people can do it. What's changed is that over the years, Apple and its parts suppliers have offered more code that Hackintosh builders can use to make audio, video and other components work. Still, the community relies on a dedicated team from around the globe to contribute new code and apps to help make setting up and maintaining a Hackintosh as easy as possible. "Our intention with the site's tools and guides was to lower the bar a bit and try to come up with a tried-and-true methodology for both new users and people who are tech-savvy," Tonymacx86 said. Let me just say now that I'm not an engineer. I ended up spending about $800 on all the pieces to build a machine, based on Tonymacx86's recommendations. I figured it should last me for the next six or seven years. Oh, and did I mention it'll be upgradable? Once everything from the microprocessing brain to the hard drive to the case arrived in the mail, I spent two days assembling my new computer. Imagine putting together an intricate Lego set, only this is a computer with screws, sharp edges, electricity and expensive parts you can inadvertently break if you touch them the wrong way. Enlarge Image Look inside my Hackintosh and you see a lot of cords and fans. It's not as sleek as a typical Mac. Photo by Ian Sherr/CNET Looking at my new machine, one downside was glaring. That svelte design Apple's known for? Gone. The black box I have now is 8.2 inches high and stretches 15.7 inches long, which is small by build-your-own-PC standards. But it seems ginormous compared to the Mac Mini's 1.4 inches by 7.7 inches. It even takes up more room than the Mac Pro's 9.9 inch height and 6.6 inch diameter. When my wife first looked at the machine, she gave me the side-eye, "Where's it gonna go?" In a one-bedroom apartment filled with books and baby gear, that's a fair question. Turning on my Hackintosh What I didn't expect was that even with parts the Hackintosh community said would work with MacOS, it still took hours to get my new machine up and running. I had to reach deep into the code of the computer and learn how the software makes video appear on the screen and how it moves audio to a speaker. I had to learn about software that makes USB thumb-drives work. It was kind of a nightmare. At one point, I cursed my days-earlier self for being too ambitious, too foolhardy and too naive to think this would mostly just work. Batteries Not Included The CNET team shares experiences that remind us why tech is cool. In the end, it took about 50 hours to get everything working, and another few to load all those apps I couldn't live without back onto the computer. There are still some odds and ends that make this less-than-ideal: My Hackintosh works better using the year-old MacOS version 10.11 El Capitan. That means I don't get the new features that came out this year in MacOS 10.12 Sierra, like the Siri voice assistant or better connections with my iPads and iPhones. But I can live without all that. It's good that Apple offers software updates for free, but Tonymacx86 said Apple could help the community further if it offered its code to the public, a practice known as open-source. Apple does publish some of its code, but not all. Imagine putting together an intricate Lego set, only this is a computer with expensive parts you can break if you touch them the wrong way. And remember, Apple makes its money by selling the computers I shunned. So, the company's not exactly inclined to help. An Apple spokesman didn't respond to a request for comment. One thing that'll bug me is that I'll have to be much more careful treading around MacOS these days. I can't just automatically download and install the latest upgrade, or even a regular security update. I have to check first with the Hackintosh community to see if it'll upset the various programs they created to make all this stuff work. As to where I physically store my new computer, we're still figuring that out. But that's not the point! What really matters is that I beat Apple. I won. I think.

Apple leaps into AI research with improved simulated + unsupervised learning Posted Dec 26, 2016 by John Mannes (@JohnMannes) 0 SHARES Next Story No Signal: Egypt blocks the encrypted messaging app as it continues its cyber¬†crackdown Corporate machine learning research may be getting a new vanguard in Apple. Six researchers from the company‚Äôs recently¬†formed machine learning group published a paper that describes a novel¬†method for simulated + unsupervised learning. The aim is to improve¬†the quality of synthetic training images. The work is a sign of the company‚Äôs aspirations to become a more visible leader in the ever growing field of AI. Google, Facebook, Microsoft and the rest of the techstablishment have been steadily growing their machine learning research groups. With hundreds¬†of publications each, these¬†companies‚Äô academic pursuits have been well documented, but Apple has been stubborn ‚Äî keeping its magic all to itself. Things started to change earlier this month when Apple‚Äôs¬†Director of AI Research,¬†Russ Salakhutdinov, announced that the company would soon begin¬†publishing research. The team‚Äôs first attempt is both timely and pragmatic. In recent times, synthetic images and videos have been used with greater frequency to train machine learning models. Rather than use cost and time intensive real-world imagery, generated images are less costly, readily available and customizable. The technique presents a lot of potential, but it‚Äôs risky because small imperfections in synthetic training material can have serious negative implications for a final product. Put another way, it‚Äôs hard to ensure generated images meet the same quality standards as real images. Apple is proposing to use Generative Adversarial Networks or GANs to improve the quality of these synthetic training images. GANs are not new, but Apple is making modifications to serve its purpose. At a high level, GANs work by taking advantage of the adversarial relationship between competing neural networks. In Apple‚Äôs case, a simulator generates synthetic images that are run through a refiner. These refined images are then sent to a discriminator that‚Äôs tasked with distinguishing real images from synthetic ones. ¬† From a game theory perspective, the networks are competing in a two-player minimax game. The goal¬†in this type of game is to minimize the maximum possible loss. Apple SimGAN variation is trying to minimize both local adversarial loss and a self regulation term. ¬†These terms simultaneously minimize the differences between synthetic and real images while minimizing the difference between synthetic and refined images to retain annotations. The idea here is that too much alteration can destroy the value of the unsupervised training set.¬†If trees no-longer look like trees and the point of your model is to help self-driving cars recognize trees to avoid, you‚Äôve failed. The researchers also made some fine-tuned modifications, like forcing the models to use the full history of refined images, not just those from the mini-batch, to ensure the adversarial network¬†can identify all generated images as fake at any given time. You can read more about these alterations directly from Apple‚Äôs work, entitled¬†Learning from Simulated and Unsupervised Images through Adversarial Training.¬† 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Founded 1976 Overview Apple is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications.

The company reverted to the old battery. DAVID PAUL MORRIS by Mark Gurman To¬†die-hard fans, Apple's Macintosh¬†sometimes seems like an afterthought these days. Mac upgrades, once a frequent ritual, are few and far between. The Mac Pro, Apple's marquee computer, hasn't been refreshed since 2013. The affordable and flexible Mac mini was last upgraded in 2014. And when a new machine does roll out, the results are sometimes underwhelming, if not infuriating, to devotees. In October, after more than 500 days without an update, Apple unveiled the new MacBook Pro with a slimmer design and louder speakers. The laptop garnered mostly favourable reviews from the technology press but grumbles from creative types, a key constituency, who said the device under-performed rival products. Interviews with people familiar with Apple's inner workings reveal that the Mac is getting far less attention than it once did. They¬†say the Mac team has lost clout with the famed industrial design group led by Jony Ive and the company's software team. They also describe¬†a lack of clear direction from senior management,¬†departures of key people working on Mac hardware and technical challenges that have delayed the roll-out of new computers. Related Quotes 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating... Last updated: Updating... View full quote Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements While the Mac generates about 10 per cent of Apple sales, the company can't afford to alienate professional designers and other business customers. After all, they¬†helped fuel Apple's revival in the late 1990s. In a stinging critique, Peter Kirn, founder of a website for music and video creators, wrote: "This is a company with no real vision for what its most creative users actually do with their most advanced machines." If more Mac users switch, the Apple ecosystem will become less sticky ‚Äî opening the door to people¬†abandoning higher-value products like the iPhone and iPad. ¬† People¬†now have more options. Microsoft, once derided by Mac loyalists for its clunky, buggy software, offers Windows 10, which provides¬†the tablet type functionality Apple pioneered with the iPad. Microsoft's Surface computers offer Apple-esque quality and a well-reviewed creative paint program aimed at the Mac's audience. Sensing an opportunity, Microsoft called the MacBook Pro a¬†"disappointment"¬†and said more users than ever were switching to its Surface laptops.¬†¬† An Apple spokesman declined to comment. However, the company has said the Macintosh remains one of its most important products and denies it takes a back seat to other gadgets.¬† Four years ago at Apple's annual developer conference, marketing chief Phil Schiller pledged to keep the computer¬†front and centre in the company's product arsenal.¬† "Nobody turns over their entire line as quickly and completely as we do at Apple," Schiller said. "We're really proud of the engineering team and the work they do to do this quick so you can get the exact product you need." Two years later,¬†the company held a 30th birthday party for the Macintosh, a splashy event that featured a OneRepublic concert at¬†Apple's Cupertino, California headquarters. The company also created a website celebrating the Mac's history. To be fair, Apple depends on Intel, which still makes key chips for¬†Macs. Like the rest of the PC industry, Apple's innovation and product cycles are sometimes constrained by when Intel produces new chips ‚Äî a¬†process¬†that's getting more difficult. Battery failure Making a laptop stand out is also harder these days. But¬†when Apple has tried to leapfrog the competition, it¬†has fallen short. Take the company's attempt to create a longer-lasting battery for the MacBook Pro. Apple engineers wanted to use higher capacity battery packs shaped to the insides of¬†the laptop versus the standard square cells found in most machines. The design would have boosted battery life.¬† In the run-up to the MacBook Pro's planned debut this year, the new battery failed a key test, according to a person familiar with the situation. Rather than delay the launch and risk missing the crucial holiday shopping season, Apple decided to revert to an older design. The change required roping in engineers from other teams to finish the job, meaning work on other Macs languished, the person said. The new laptop didn't represent a game-changing leap in battery performance, and a software bug misrepresented hours of power remaining. Apple has since removed the meter from the top right-hand corner of the screen.¬† In the Mac's heyday, people working on new models could expect a lot of attention from Ive's team. Once a week his people would meet with Mac engineers to discuss ongoing projects. Mac engineers brought prototypes to Ive's studio for review, while his lieutenants would visit the Mac labs to look at early concepts. Those visits have become¬†less frequent since the company began focusing more on more-valuable products like the iPhone and iPad, and the change became even more obvious after the design team's leadership was shuffled last year, according to a person familiar with the situation. In another sign that the company has prioritised the iPhone, Apple reorganised its software engineering department so there's no longer a dedicated Mac operating system team. There is now just one team, and¬†most of the engineers are iOS first, giving the people working on the iPhone and iPad more power.¬† That's part of a broader shift toward making Macs more like iPhones. Apple prioritises features, like thinness and minimal ports, that sell its iPhones and iPads, which generated about 75 per cent of revenue this year. Those are contrary to professional needs, like maximum computing power.¬† Early prototypes of the 12-inch MacBook used the iPhone's Lightning connector, although this was ditched for a more standard USB-C port. There was even a gold MacBook Pro planned, but this was shelved because the colour didn't look good on such a large product.¬† In recent years, Apple managers have also become more likely to float two or more competing ideas, meaning¬†designers and engineers must¬†work on more than one concept at a time. In the past, managers pushed a more singular vision. Engineers are now "asked to develop multiple options in hopes that one of them will be shippable", a person familiar with the matter said.¬† When the company was developing the first 12-inch MacBook, Apple tested two primary prototypes. One, known internally as Stealth Fighter, was lighter. The second, a slightly less ambitious design known as Stealth Bomber, was heavier. The lighter model prevailed, but with engineers developing and testing two competing concepts, they had less time to figure out how to cram all the electronics into a thin slab of aluminum that would hold together. In the end,¬†Apple shipped the laptop last year, months after its 2014 goal. For a 2016 MacBook update, some Apple engineers¬†wanted to add a Touch ID fingerprint scanner and a second USB-C port (which would have made some power users happy). The update instead included a new rose gold colour option alongside a standard¬†speed increase. The internal turmoil has taken a toll. More than a dozen engineers and managers working on Mac hardware have left for different Apple teams or other companies in the past year and a half, said people familiar with the situation. Some were looking for a less all-consuming work environment, while others felt the future of Mac hardware was unclear in a world of iPhones and iPads.¬† In 2013, Apple¬†launched a redesigned Mac Pro, a black cylinder with bright white LED lights. It was a powerful desktop machine created partly to cast a halo over the entire Macintosh lineup. The Mac Pro was also the first Apple computer in years to be assembled in the US. Under pressure from politicians to create manufacturing jobs at home, Apple was looking to score political points. The decision caused¬†production headaches though.¬† The Mac Pro's glossy exterior and chrome bevelled edges meant Apple had to make its own manufacturing tools and then¬†train people to run¬†those machines in an assembly plant. This slowed production and constrained Apple's ability to make enough computers to meet demand. Three years on,¬†the Mac Pro is ripe for an upgrade with its chips and connector ports lagging rival products. Because of the earlier challenges, some Apple engineers have raised the possibility of¬†moving production back to Asia, where it's cheaper and manufacturers have the required skills for ambitious products, according to a person familiar with those internal discussions. The political environment is tougher for such a move now. During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump hammered Apple for building most of its products overseas and since his election he has pushed other companies to keep some jobs in the US.¬† Still, Apple hasn't given up on Macs.¬†In a recent company Q&A session, employees asked whether Mac desktop computers remain strategically important. "We have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that," chief executive officer Tim Cook said, according to a transcript of the discussion obtained by Bloomberg News.¬† The latest MacBook Pro has a "Touch Bar", a thin touchscreen built into the keyboard that lets users quickly access app shortcuts, change¬†system settings, and pick emojis. The laptop also has Touch ID to speed up online purchases and a giant trackpad for easier gesture control. Apple designers are already exploring standalone keyboards with the touch strip and a fingerprint reader for desktops. Apple will decide whether to release these based on how well the features do on the MacBook Pro. Mac fans shouldn't hold their breath for radical new¬†designs in 2017 though. Instead, the company is preparing modest updates:¬†USB-C ports and a new Advanced Micro Devices¬†graphics processor for the iMac, and minor bumps in processing power for the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro. Cue the outrage.

Here are five things that will be on the horizon in the new year. Measure V vote The town‚Äôs takeover attempt of Liberty Utilities, Apple Valley produced an onslaught of punch, counterpunch scenarios in 2016, with both sides assuming the offensive when openings presented themselves. In June, Liberty officials disclosed to the Daily Press the town‚Äôs unauthorized use of 869,000 gallons of company water on the Apple Valley Golf Course, a move that ran up a nearly $7,000 bill and led to criticism of the town‚Äôs ability to safely run a water system. And in October, Liberty‚Äôs General Manager Tony Penna let fly an ireful outburst directed at Councilor Curt Emick during a meeting that culminated with Penna‚Äôs removal from Council chambers and town officials calling his comments a threat of physical violence. Yet these incidents, though providers of intriguing fodder, were mere jabs in the grand scheme; never would either decide the future water provider in Apple Valley. Voters‚Äô passage of Measure V on Nov. 8, however, carries the potential to significantly impact a future purchase, should the town win its eminent-domain case. If voters opt against the bond debt, the town will be forced to ‚Äî at the very least ‚Äî look elsewhere for financing. It‚Äôs unknown when the vote will occur; town officials say more discussion is required by the Council before a date is set. But with a trial setting conference scheduled for Jan. 7 ‚Äî and litigation expected to move forward thereafter ‚Äî 2017 could be the year of a vote on debt. Yucca Loma Bridge opening While work on the third and final phase of the Yucca Loma Corridor remains at least two years away, town officials celebrated completion of the Yucca Loma Bridge in 2016, over two years after construction commenced. And with widening work on the nearby Yucca Loma Road progressing ahead of schedule, 2017 will mark the long-anticipated opening of the bridge to traffic. The tentative schedule includes a ribbon-cutting ceremony on May 19 and a community bike ride on May 20 before the opening on May 22. Because Victorville‚Äôs Green Tree Boulevard Extension project is still in design, it‚Äôs unlikely the opening will alleviate congestion along Bear Valley Road or Highway 18 in the short term. Still, the opening will be seen as a major accomplishment given that officials have talked of a bridge over the Mojave River since the 1960s, according to former Victorville City Councilman Ryan McEachron. Reopening of closed fire stations Funds provided by Measure A ‚Äî the fire tax voters overwhelmingly passed in November ‚Äî won‚Äôt be available until July, but 2017 could be the year two closed fire stations reopen. Apple Valley Fire Protection District Chief Sid Hultquist previously told the Daily Press the reopenings of stations 336 and 337 are ‚Äúgoing to happen,‚Äù but he stopped short of providing a date. Staffing plans will be prepared in the interim, as the district‚Äôs board develops ‚Äútimelines with the logistics needed to open‚Äù the stations that closed following the Great Recession. Hilltop House More than seven months have passed since the town officially took ownership of Newt Bass‚Äô Hilltop House, but officials have been relatively quiet about future plans for the site outside of its eventual inclusion into the Parks and Recreation system. Per grant-program requirements, the town has three years from the acquisition date to create an ‚Äúoutdoor recreational opportunity for the public‚Äôs benefit,‚Äù so 2017 could be the year an ad hoc committee is formed to discuss what sort of recreational attraction the house will become. New year, new captain The promotion of San Bernardino County Sheriff‚Äôs Department Capt. Lana Tomlin to deputy chief of all desert region stations will signal the return of Capt. Frank Bell to town next month. Bell previously worked as lieutenant at the Apple Valley Sheriff‚Äôs station before moving to headquarters in San Bernardino where he served as captain of the Employee Resources Unit. He will assume the captain role after Tomlin makes her own transition to headquarters on Jan. 21. Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254.

By Matthew Miller for The Mobile Gadgeteer | December 26, 2016 -- 22:35 GMT (14:35 PST) | Topic: Mobility 2016 was another fantastic year in mobile technology where we find people using their smartphones as their primary source of information and social interaction. I've been blessed to now write here on ZDNet for more than a decade and look forward to an exciting 2017. This year-end post includes my ten most viewed posts from 2016, some "best of" titles for this year, answers to last year's questions, and questions I hope to have answered in 2017. Most viewed articles of 2016 7 small-screen smartphones: Can the 4-inch iPhone SE trump rivals? 10 best smartphones of 2016 so far iPhone 7 Plus case roundup: Speck and Tech21 provide drop protection in slim form Nationwide Cricket Wireless outage draws customer ire primarily due to lack of communications T-Mobile's free iPhone 7 offer requires upfront costs and lots of patience Running with the Apple Watch: Yes, you can leave your iPhone behind 10 ways to boost your productivity with the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 S Pen Android Wear 2.0 preview on a Huawei Watch: Significant UI changes and watch face complications 10 best smartphones for the 2016 holiday season Apple iPhone 7 Plus: 10 reasons to pick the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 instead see alo 10 best smartphones for the 2016 holiday season Now that Google has announced the Pixel smartphones, it is time to see what Matthew Miller considers the ten best smartphones available. Read More Smartphones dominated my most popular posts of 2016 with the Apple iPhone the primary subject of four posts. Readers seem to enjoy my picks for best smartphones and after CES and Mobile World Congress in January and February, you can expect my next list in early 2017. At this time, the iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel XL, Moto Z Force Droid, and Huawei Mate 9 are fighting for my attention on a daily basis. Despite the fact that the wearable market continues to struggle to gain consumer attention, two of my 10 most viewed posts were about the Apple Watch and Android Wear smartwatches. The Garmin Fenix 3 HR and Samsung Gear S3 were the subjects of three more articles in the next 10 most viewed articles I wrote here on ZDNet. Best of 2016 I have a few titles I would like to award to the devices, accessories, and software I checked out in 2016. Best overall smartphone: I recently posted my 10 best smartphones for the 2016 holiday season with the Apple iPhone 7 Plus earning my top pick. If the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 did not have a faulty battery design, it would have been my top pick. Best smartphone surprise: When Motorola launched the Moto X, I was a huge fan because of the price, customizability, and fact that software updates appeared as fast as a Nexus device. The Moto phones fell off my radar after the Lenovo purchase, but I've been pleasantly surprised and impressed by the new Verizon Moto Z Force Droid that received the Nougat update quickly while also being a phone that offers more than a Google Pixel XL. It has a shatterproof display, water repellant coating, modular design that is actually useful, expandable microSD storage, and handy Moto Actions to improve your efficiency. Rodney Dangerfield award (Best device that lacks the respect it deserves): LG continues to release excellent smartphones and with the failure of the Note 7 I expected the new LG V20 to do better than it has. LG phones deserve more attention and respect. The LG V20 has an excellent camera, microSD storage card, removable battery, and shipped with Android Nougat. Best Android smartphone: With the death of the Galaxy Note 7, choosing the Google Pixel XL as the best Android smartphone is an easy choice. It's battery seems to last forever and it reminds me of an iPhone running Android. While it's hard for me to pinpoint exactly why I can't put it down, the Pixel XL doesn't disappoint. Best iOS smartphone: This one is easy as Apple only launches a couple new phones each year. Apple iPhone 7 Plus is clearly the best Apple smartphone of 2016. It is similar to the iPhone 7, but the dual camera adds a fun portrait mode while the battery life also satisfies. Best BlackBerry device: I honestly didn't think I would have a BlackBerry to include on this list, but the DTEK60 is fantastic. BlackBerry no longer makes the hardware, but they worked with TCL to launch a powerful, attractive, and inexpensive flagship with the DTEK60. Android works well with BlackBerry Hub integration and the only thing I would like to see is a bit longer battery life. Best tablet: The Surface Pro 4 is my favorite computer ever and I personally also use it as my primary tablet. CNET has a list of the best tablets of 2016 and would agree that the Apple iPad Pro 9.7 is probably the best, non-PC tablet available. Best smartwatch: The new Apple Watch Series 2 is excellent, but I'm giving my top pick to the Samsung Gear S3 Frontier thanks to an integrated cellular connection, water and dust resistance, GPS, watch-optimized OS, and the ability to work with any Android smartphone. Best daily activity tracker: Fitbit is the Kleenex of the wearable world and having recently acquired some Pebble assets, it is definitely the company to beat. The Fitbit Charge 2 is the best wristband tracker available today. The Fitbit Blaze is a great tracker too, but comes in a watch form factor that is not as subtle as the Charge 2. Best GPS sport watch: I've spent years, and hundreds of dollars, trying out different GPS sports watches to track my running and cycling. I finally splurged this year and bought the expensive Garmin Fenix 3 HR and it does everything I could ever want while having a battery life that lasts me at least a week. It's a big watch, but has proven to be the best wearable I have ever purchased and I couldn't be any more pleased. Responses to questions from 2015 Will Microsoft finally give up on smartphone hardware?: The Lumia 950/950 XL have been on a fire sale recently and there continue to be rumors of a possible Surface phone. We didn't see anything new from Microsoft in 2016 and I'm not holding out much hope for anything in 2017 either. Will Android turn BlackBerry around?: I wouldn't say that Android has turned BlackBerry around, but the latest DTEK phones are receiving high ratings from reviewers and there are strong rumors of a successor to the BlackBerry PRIV. There is still a long road ahead to convince businesses that BlackBerry is the choice for a secure Android device, but high quality hardware like the DTEK60 may help. Will HTC get out of the smartphone business?: Not yet. The HTC 10 was released in 2016 and it's a solid device that didn't get as much respect as it deserved. HTC made the new Google Pixel phone so while it is possible HTC may get out of the branding business, maybe the company will become Google's preferred hardware maker. What's next in wearable tech?: I'm not sure what can be done to make wearables more attractive to consumers. The latest Apple Watch and Samsung Gear S3 do everything you could want in a wearable and there's not much more to be developed here. Battery life remains the biggest hurdle to overcome. What's going to be changed in the next iPhone?: Apple's iPhone line continues a similar form factor and we saw the expected new processor and an improved camera. The dual camera with bokeh portrait mode is a nice addition. The move away from a physical button took some getting used to, but makes sense in moving forward. The lack of a headphone jack still annoys me, but thankfully high quality Bluetooth headsets are available. Here are a few questions I have for 2017: Will VR become more popular now that Google Daydream is available? Will Huawei/Honor grow mindshare in the US market? Will wearables continue to stumble along and will other wearable companies go under? What's going to be changed in the next iPhone and Nexus? Looking ahead to 2017 I have a few Huawei phones I am testing right now and the company has moved into third place behind Samsung and Apple in worldwide market share. The phones are high quality with some excellent capability, but it remains to be seen if Huawei can show some success in the US. The Google Pixel/Pixel XL phones are the first Google-branded phones and both continue to have limited stock. I am excited about the next Pixel offering and the possibility of Google smartwatches too. Given that I like to write about the latest and greatest here on ZDNet, it's likely that I will sell my existing devices and pick up the next big iPhone, next Samsung Galaxy Note, and maybe the next Pixel smartphone. What was your favorite smartphone, tablet, or wearable of the year? How about your worst?

The company has been working with Foxconn on the efforts, the report explains, further strengthening the partnership between the two parties. Specifically, Apple is expected to begin constructing two new research and development centers in 2017. One is said to be located in¬†Indonesia, while the other is ¬†destined for Shenzhen, China, Apple¬†announced in October. For what it‚Äôs worth, Foxconn currently has a¬†presence in Indonesia, working¬†with local vendor Luna as well as Huawei in the country. Foxconn wouldn‚Äôt, however, comment on today‚Äôs report. This isn‚Äôt the first we‚Äôve heard of Apple‚Äôs plans in Indonesia. Last month, it was reported that the company was planning research and development centers in the country. The report claimed that Apple would announce the plans in December and begin construction and recruitment during 2017. Likewise, Reuters reported earlier this month that Apple was investing $44 million over three years in an R&D center in India. There has been¬†speculation that Apple‚Äôs establishment of a center is a quid pro quo for a license allowing the company to sell LTE products in Indonesia. Indonesia is similar to India in that in order to establish a retail store in the country, companies must have some sort of manufacturing or research facilities there as well. The Shenzhen R&D center will allow for Apple‚Äôs engineering team to work ‚Äúeven more closely and collaboratively‚Äù with manufacturing partners, it said. What‚Äôs arguably most notable about today‚Äôs report is that Apple is further deepening its ties with Foxconn for its Shenzhen and Indonesian expansion. A strong relationship with Foxconn means Apple will have the capability of expanding throughout the world at a faster pace. Earlier this month, it was reported that Foxconn had been discussing a potential expansion to the United States, believed to be worth $7 billion and 50,000 jobs. A move to the United States by Foxconn, given its relationship with Apple, would be huge news for the iPhone maker. At this point, however, it‚Äôs Foxconn‚Äôs ever-growing relationship with Apple that will be interesting to watch. Guides AAPL Company Breaking news from Cupertino.

Most of the news that has been coming out has been one complaint after another, ranging from GPU issues to battery life. We finally have our 2016 15‚Ä≥ MacBook Pro in-house and this is our initial brief thoughts¬†and first impressions of Apple‚Äôs latest Pro laptop after having used it for the past five days. Specifications Our 2016 15‚Ä≥ MacBook Pro has the following features and specifications: Processor: 2.9GHz Quad-core Intel Core i7 Memory: 16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM Graphics: Radeon Pro 460 with 4GB VRAM Flash Storage: 1TB PCIe-based SSD Ports: Four Thunderbolt 3 ports and 1 headphone jack Display: 2880√ó1800 Retina display TouchBar ForceTouch TrackPad Backlit Butterfly keyboard TouchBar There are varying thoughts on the TouchBar and its usefulness. Some seem to enjoy using it and some call it a gimmick. I found that some controls within the TouchBar were useful having around but it‚Äôs certainly not life changing technology at this point. The argument from some is Apple should embrace touchscreens much as Windows 10 has, but I‚Äôm not much of a touchscreen user. The TouchBar gives me some interesting control over certain functions and I like it just fine and despite others saying it‚Äôs not intuitive,¬†I find it fits my workflow just fine. TrackPad What can I say about Apple‚Äôs TrackPad other than I still think it‚Äôs the best damn TrackPad on any laptop period. The two changes here are ForceTouch and the sheer size of the TrackPad ‚Äî it‚Äôs huge. Many have complained that their palms rest on the TrackPad while typing and that palm-rejection software was a mixed bag. The way I rest my hands on the laptop I have yet to have my palms hit the TrackPad and I like having the extra¬†real estate. However, I can see how different typing styles might find the TrackPad a problem. Keyboard The keyboard is a mix between the 2015 MacBook Pro and the 2015 12‚Ä≥ MacBook. The 2nd generation Butterfly keys are much improved over the 1st generation. Not everyone is going to like this keyboard, it is true that it is louder than last years model but I enjoyed typing on it much more than the 12‚Ä≥ MacBook. The backlighting is much improved here as well and overall I‚Äôve been having a great keyboard experience. Build quality Apple‚Äôs build quality is still among the best in terms of materials and design. The machine feels solid and it‚Äôs crazy thin (though I would have liked a bigger battery instead of thin) and the hinge mechanism is now one piece of aluminum eliminating that gaudy plastic hinge. Display The resolution on this display is the same as last year‚Äôs but the nits and the color gamut are vastly improved and it shows. This is simply the best display I‚Äôve seen on a MacBook Pro in a long time. The color gamut is also much improved and colors just pop off the display, blacks are deep and rich and whites are true. Ports One of the most controversial things about the 2016 15‚Ä≥ MacBook Pro are the 4 USB Type-C/Thunderbolt ports. Apple pretty much killed every legacy port but the headphone jack ‚Äî ironic isn‚Äôt it ‚Äî and have fully adopted USB Type-C.¬†I don‚Äôt actually mind this, I currently am using a Satechi multiport adapter to give me my USB 3.0 ports back but it‚Äôs not that bad. The removal of the SD card slot doesn‚Äôt bother me either as I just plug my Sony a6300 into the USB 3.0 port on the adapter. I fully understand that the workflow of many users is much different than mine and the removal of these ports is something they should most certainly by upset by. Personally, the only port I miss is the MagSafe connector. I think this should have been kept as it has saved my Mac from being splattered many times, for now, I‚Äôm using Griffin‚Äôs Breaksafe cable, which isn‚Äôt the best solution but it works. Battery life This is the biggest controversy lately with the 2016 15‚Ä≥ MacBook Pro. Users have been reporting that battery life is dismal on the new MacBook Pro line in general and Consumer Reports has tested this as well and for the first time is not recommending this laptop to consumers. We‚Äôve had a mixed bag of results in regard to battery life, ¬†the first day was the worst with just over 4 hours of battery life with Apple Music playing, light Photoshop, browsing, email and writing posts in WordPress. Over the next few days, battery life did improve but I‚Äôve yet to get more than 6 hours of battery life on a near $4000USD machine that Apple says should get 10 hours of battery life. I also noticed the fans kick in fast and hard whenever I used the laptop on a soft surface like a bed or on the carpet and the battery drained much faster in these instances. Overall Apple has a lot of work to do in this department and had better make those improvements quick. Speakers One word, amazing! These speakers are among the best I‚Äôve heard on a laptop and I love them. Wrap Up The 15‚Ä≥ MacBook Pro has long been considered one of the most premiere Pro machines you could get for engineers, designers, musicians and more, but that was then and this is now. While the MacBook Pro is still a very capable machine, there are many other Windows 10 laptops that are really worth looking at even for pro users. I honestly would have looked at the Microsoft Surface Book with Performance Base or the newer Dell XPS 15‚Ä≥ that is slated for Q1 2017. The only reason I ended up pulling the trigger on this machine is because of the large amount of money I had in Apple Store gift cards. Apple Store gift cards are not redeemable for cash so I ended up paying for the majority of this machine using those. Had I had cash in hand, I would have most certainly checked out the Windows 10 offerings. This MacBook Pro is most certainly an upgrade from my 2011 MacBook Pro so I‚Äôm not complaining in that regard. Overall, I still love the new 2016 15‚Ä≥ MacBook Pro. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the money they‚Äôre charging for it when there are equal or even better alternatives on the market but it is a very capable and good machine. If you‚Äôre in the market for a new laptop and are looking at this laptop, I‚Äôd encourage you to shop around and see if there is a Windows 10 alternative that may suit your needs, but even if you don‚Äôt, the MacBook Pro is still a good machine ‚Äî unless Apple doesn‚Äôt find a way to fix the battery life problem. +111 Tweet Share1 Share1 Stumble Pin Related Items:Apple, featured, Laptops, MacBook Pro, Surface Book, technology, Windows 10 Recommended for you New Apple Watch in 2017 rumored to have ‚Äúimproved battery life‚Äù The SpeedX Unicorn wraps smart technology into a road bike Official Google+ Android community overrun by porn and no moderation Comments Lenovo at CES 2017 Our Top Review Picks Latest Tech News 9 Press Releases / Tech [CES 2017] D-Link debuts its first HomeKit enabled camera 48 Press Releases / Tech [CES 2017] Dell upgrades existing lines, introduces Dell Canvas, wireless charging 2-in-1, and more 40 Gaming / Gaming Hardware / Press Releases / Tech [CES 2017] Samsung unveils new products, from fridges to laptops Latest Reviews 78 Gaming / Gaming Hardware / Hardware Reviews / Mac / PC / Reviews / Top Picks Viper V760 Gaming Mechanical Keyboard review: A solid customizable RGB gaming keyboard 92 Audio / Audio Hardware Reviews / Reviews Scosche BoomBuoy review: A floating waterproof wireless speaker with decent sound 262 Hardware Reviews / Reviews / Tech Lenovo Yoga 910 review: A high quality, great performing ultrabook with average battery life Apple boots Nokia owned Withings products from their shelves The Gionee M2017 is up for pre-orders in China About Techaeris Techaeris was founded in 2013 by Alex Hernandez and covers a spectrum of information related to technology, gaming, entertainment, science, art, photography and life.

Though this movie certainly has its own issues, which I‚Äôll get into later, my greater frustration is that it continues the trend of video game movies falling flat. As someone who has spent most his life playing video games, it pains me to keep seeing my favorite franchises have their reputations smeared on the silver screen. Every release, from Tomb Raider to Mortal Kombat, has been a regular disappointment. I‚Äôd say the Resident Evil franchise has made waves but despite getting the green light for a total of five sequels its films get torn apart by critics and fans alike. For you to understand my issue with this movie I have to explain the plots on which it is based. Assassin‚Äôs Creed loosely follows and condenses the complicated story of the first three games in the franchise: Assassin‚Äôs Creed I, II and Brotherhood. Warning: video game and, to a lesser extent, movie spoilers ahead!

Both Altair and Ezio were key members of an ancient organization known as the Assassin‚Äôs Creed, which sought to protect the innocent. In the present day, Desmond is forcefully employed by the Abstergo Corporation, a front for the Knights Templar ‚Äî¬†the ever-present nemesis of the Assassins, to retrace his ancestor‚Äôs steps. Abstergo uses a machine called the Animus that allows Desmond to relive his ancestors‚Äô genetic memories. The corporation hopes to retrace the Assassins‚Äô steps to reveal where the Assassins hid the Apple of Eden, which can be used to enslave humanity by destroying free will. In the present day, Desmond begins to hallucinate as the line between his ancestors‚Äô pasts and his own reality blurs. Due to his prolonged time in the Animus, this ‚ÄúBleeding Effect‚Äù activates Desmond‚Äôs Eagle Vision, a sixth sense mastered by the Assassins. As he unearths more of the truth, Desmond goes rogue and uses his newly found Eagle Vision to acquire the Apple for himself, thus saving humanity from the Templars. In the film, Callum Lynch, played by Fassbender, shares blood with Aguilar de Nerha, an Assassin during the Spanish Inquisition. Side-note: √°guila means ‚Äúeagle‚Äù in Spanish‚Ä¶ easy does it with the symbolism guys. Lynch is revived after his own execution by the Abstergo Corporation, headed by Dr. Sofia Rikkin and her father ‚Äî played by Marion Cotillard and Jeremy Irons, to be used in their Animus program. In the movie‚Äôs universe, the Templars have traced the Apple of Eden all the way through history to √Åguilar and hope to discover its present location by finding out where he hid it. If you‚Äôre not a fan of the games all of that probably seemed a bit confusing, but in the games where the story can be revealed over the course of hours and hours it all makes good sense. The player is given time to digest the plot and become invested in the characters. The film‚Äôs 115-minute runtime robs the viewer of this luxury and squanders every character arc but those of Lynch and Rikkin. Potentially intriguing characters like Moussa, another of Abstergo‚Äôs kidnapped Assassin-descendants, and Maria, √Åguilar‚Äôs will-they-won‚Äôt-they Assassin cohort, receive so little screen time that the audience can‚Äôt even begin to relate to them. Leaderboard 2 <a href="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=d282f4125a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="http://oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538220188&cs=d282f4125a&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> I suspect that some executive at 20th Century Fox saw the successes of sequel-driven franchises like the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a video game series with 13 entries and put the film on course for a sequel that will likely never see the light of day. This approach led the director, Justin Kurzel, to focus heavily on Lynch‚Äôs actions in the present day instead of √Åguilar‚Äôs actions. This is the downfall of the film. The studio was so concerned with setting up Fassbender‚Äôs character for the future that they neglected to deliver on it in the present. What I as a long-time fan so desperately wanted to see was a film that forgets about Abstergo and the Animus. Cinematic releases simply don‚Äôt have the time to make such complex concepts work! Give me Assassin‚Äôs Creed: √Åguilar: the story of an Assassin fighting for what‚Äôs right against overwhelming odds during the Spanish Inquisition; let me fall in love with Maria and the other Assassins. There would be no problem hiking up the stakes around the fight for the Apple in the past because the Templars were seeking the same goal then as they were in the present. What upset me so much about this film is that it gave me glimpses into the movie I so desired and repeatedly ripped me away from it. This film even messed up the fast-paced sequences from √Åguilar‚Äôs point of view. The outstanding action is absolutely cut to pieces. Every stunt is seemingly shown from every perspective, jarring the audience and often cutting away from anything that might have raised red flags for a PG-13 movie. The film‚Äôs rating is another mistake. Every main entry in the video game franchise is rated M, meaning players must be 17 to purchase them for themselves, and depicts jaw-dropping violence and brutal assassinations. Taking this away from the franchise is clipping the eagle‚Äôs wings. The acting is solid ‚Äî Fassbender and crew seem to do the best they can with what they‚Äôre given. I‚Äôd even call the script adequate given the sheer volume of material it tried to cram into two hours and despite my reservations about the editing of the action scenes, it was a thrill to see the Assassin‚Äôs fighting style on the big screen. Still, Assassin‚Äôs Creed is a film plagued by a studio‚Äôs desire to make money on a sequel. Until a studio has the fortitude to make a video game movie for the sake of making a good movie, they‚Äôre all doomed to this brand of disappointing mediocrity. Rating: four out of 10 Hidden Blades.

Twitter Facebook Nokia and Apple trade accusations in patent lawsuits The companies are at odds over fair licensing of the H.264 video codec and other technologies Grant Gross (IDG News Service) 22 December, 2016 08:24 - - - - print email Comments An international patent dispute has broken out between Apple and Nokia over the Finnish mobile network vendor's licensing terms for the widely used H.264 video codec and other technologies. Nokia on Wednesday filed lawsuits against Apple in Germany and in the U.S., alleging that the smartphone giant has infringed 32 of its patents. Nokia's five lawsuits follow an Apple lawsuit filed in California Tuesday. The U.S. company accused Nokia of working with patent assertion firms Acacia Research and Conversant Intellectual Property Management to "extract and extort exorbitant revenues unfairly and anticompetitively" from Apple and other smartphone makers. Nokia was not named as one of eight defendants in the Apple lawsuit. Nokia's patent infringement lawsuits, filed with the Regional Courts in Dusseldorf, Mannheim and Munich in Germany and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, cover patents related to displays, user interfaces, software, antennas, chipsets, and video coding, Nokia said Wednesday. Nokia is planning to file more lawsuits in other jurisdictions, the company said in a press release. The eight patents covered in one of Nokia's Texas lawsuits, filed Wednesday, are related to the H.264 Advanced Video Coding standard approved by the International Telecommunication Union, according to Nokia's complaint. A second Texas lawsuit covers 10 patents for a range of other technologies. Apple products using the H.264 video codec include the iPhone, iPad, iPod, Apple Watch, Macs, and Apple TV, Nokia said in its complaint. "Despite all the advantages that have been enjoyed by Apple, Apple has steadfastly refused to agree to license Nokia's H.264 patents on reasonable terms," Nokia's lawyers wrote. "Dozens of companies have licensed Nokia‚Äôs patents for use in their products ... Apple, however, refuses to pay Nokia's established royalty rates." Apple did not immediately respond to a request for a comment on the lawsuits. As part of the ITU standards process, Nokia agreed to grant licenses for the H.264 decoder on reasonable and nondiscriminatory, or RAND, terms, the company said. However, the ITU standard covers only the decoder, and not the encoder, the complaint said. Nokia has offered Apple a license for the encoder technology on RAND terms, but Apple has refused to pay, the company asserted. "Nokia has negotiated in good faith and made substantial efforts to enter into a license agreement with Apple on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms," its lawyers wrote. Nokia research has contributed to "fundamental technologies" used in Apple products, Ilkka Rahnasto, head of Patent Business at Nokia, said in a press release. "After several years of negotiations trying to reach agreement to cover Apple's use of these patents, we are now taking action to defend our rights." Apple's lawsuit, meanwhile, alleges that Nokia is working with outside patent assertion firms to skirt its RAND patent commitments to standards bodies. Nokia promised it would "license its patents fairly," Apple's lawyers wrote. Nokia is working with the patent lawsuit filers on a "scheme to diffuse and abuse" the company's patents by extracting "exorbitant" royalties, they alleged in their complaint. Nokia's aggressive patent licensing efforts came after the company largely exited the smartphone-making business, Apple's lawyers wrote. "Unable to compete with innovative companies such as Apple -- which had developed a revolutionary hardware and software platform -- Nokia quickly transformed itself," Apple's lawyers wrote. "It changed from a company focused on supplying cell phones and other consumer products to a company bent on exploiting the patents that remain from its years as a successful cell phone supplier." Acacia and Conversant didn't immediately respond to requests for comments on the Apple lawsuit. The Apple lawsuit is "unrelated to our own complaints" against the company, a Nokia spokesman said by email. "By failing to agree to terms, Apple is seeking an unfair advantage over our other licensees and we are taking steps to protect our inventions and defend our rights," he added.

The patent infringement lawsuits, filed with the Regional Courts in Dusseldorf, Mannheim and Munich in Germany and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, cover patents related to¬†displays, user interfaces, software, antennas, chipsets, and video coding, Nokia said Wednesday.¬† Nokia is planning to file more lawsuits in other jurisdictions, the company said in a press release. The eight patents covered in the Texas lawsuit, filed Wednesday, are related to the H.264 Advanced Video Coding standard approved by the International Telecommunication Union, according to Nokia's complaint.¬† Apple products using the H.264 video codec include the iPhone, iPad, iPod, Apple Watch, Macs, and Apple TV, Nokia said in its complaint. "Despite all the advantages that have been enjoyed by Apple, Apple has steadfastly refused to agree to license Nokia's H.264 patents on reasonable terms," Nokia's lawyers wrote. "Dozens of companies have licensed Nokia‚Äôs patents for use in their products ... Apple, however, refuses to pay Nokia's established royalty rates."

Twitter Facebook Nokia files even more patent lawsuits against Apple Nokia accuses Apple of infringing 40 patents in lawsuits filed in 11 countries Grant Gross (IDG News Service) 23 December, 2016 05:47 - - - - print email Comments Nokia has filed new patent infringement lawsuits against Apple on Thursday, a day after it weighed in on a licensing dispute with the company by filing claims in Germany and the U.S. On Wednesday, the Finland-based mobile network vendor filed lawsuits in three German courts and two lawsuits in a Texas court, leveling infringement claims against Apple on the widely used¬†H.264 video codec and other technologies. Those suits cover 32 of Nokia's patents. Nokia's first round of lawsuits came after Apple filed a lawsuit Tuesday accusing Nokia of working with patent assertion firms Acacia Research and Conversant Intellectual Property Management to ‚Äúextract and extort exorbitant revenues unfairly and anticompetitively‚Äù from Apple and other smartphone makers.¬† On Thursday, Nokia announced new lawsuits against Apple, with 40 patents covered in the claims filed this week. The company's new lawsuits were filed in Finland, the U.K., Italy, Sweden, Spain, the Netherlands, France, Hong Kong, and Japan. In addition, Nokia has filed a complaint against Apple with the U.S. International Trade Commission, which has the power to bar the importation of products to the U.S. if they are found to infringe patents. The USITC complaint covers eight patents. Some of the disputes revolve around promises by Nokia to license some¬†H.264 technologies on reasonable and nondiscriminatory (RAND) terms. Nokia has accused Apple of refusing to negotiate for licenses for some H.264 technologies, while Apple has accused Nokia of violating RAND promises. Apple products using the H.264 video codec include the iPhone, iPad, iPod, Apple Watch, Macs, and Apple TV, Nokia said in a complaint filed Wednesday in Texas. Other Nokia patents in the lawsuits are related to displays, user interfaces, software, antennas, and chipsets.

The one prediction for the outgoing year that did come to pass was the migration of streaming video channels into the consumer mainstream, fuelled by successes like Jeremy Clarkson‚Äôs Grand Tour on Amazon Prime, and Peter Morgan‚Äôs drama about our post-war monarchy, The Crown, on Netflix. The production values of both these series easily outstrip anything the BBC could have afforded and undermines, more than somewhat, the corporation‚Äôs argument for the retention of the TV licence fee. But while a wholesale refinancing of the BBC is not on anyone‚Äôs roadmap for 2017, a few other trends are already starting to emerge... Death of the smartwatch: They were supposed to be the next big thing, and Apple‚Äôs entry into the ‚Äúwearables‚Äù market in 2015 seemed to lend an air of permanence to the whole enterprise. But it was always obvious that smartwatches were less useful than the phones - and as a result, neither the Apple Watch nor Google‚Äôs Android Wear sold in sufficient numbers. The disappearance of the pioneer Pebble Watch brand following the company‚Äôs sale to a maker of fitness tracking bands, was the final nail in the coffin. Doubling down on security: Two months ago, hackers managed to take down some of the world‚Äôs most popular websites for nearly 24 hours. But they didn‚Äôt need to penetrate the sites themselves - they simply hijacked unprotected security cameras, video recorders and other devices connected to what has become known as the Internet of Things - thereby throttling the bandwidth available to everything else You have probably lost count of the gadgets in your own house and garage that connect to the net, and it‚Äôs a fair bet that none of them, unless they are conventional PCs, have any sort of security software installed. That will start to change in 2017, but you can strike it off your own to-do list - it will be down to manufacturers, not consumers, to implement. Talking into our phones: A decade ago, you couldn‚Äôt get on a train without hearing someone shout, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going into a tunnel‚Äù into his mobile at the top of his voice - but texts and social media have supplanted traditional voice calls for many of us, and turned using a mobile phone into a more solitary experience. That will change as Google, Apple and Amazon all escalate their ‚Äúpersonal assistant‚Äù services - which will mean that very soon it will be the norm to shout, rather than type search terms into our handsets. Connected living: Amazon‚Äôs Echo range of ‚Äúsmart switches‚Äù for the home has gained enormous traction during the last few months, thanks to vastly reduced prices. These let you control your hi-fi, TV, lights, and other connected devices by - again - shouting at them from your sofa. But they will face competition in 2017 from Apple Home and Google Home, each with a range of compatible products. The best will control your central heating, too. And finally‚Ä¶ President Trump: Neither Old Moore nor I can accurately interrogate our almanacs for the likely outcome of this development‚Ä¶ but whatever happens, it‚Äôs a safe bet that we will hear about it first on a fake news site or on Twitter.

Patrick Thibodeau (Computerworld (US)) 22 December, 2016 21:58 - - - - print email Comments The Electronic Frontier Foundation is keenly worried that President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress will step up surveillance activities and pass laws to curtail electronic rights. As a result, the EFF is advising the tech sector to use end-to-end encryption for every transaction by default, and to scrub logs. "You cannot be made to surrender data you do not have," the EFF said. "We need to start securing our systems now," said Rainey Reitman, director of the EFF's activism team, in an interview. "If we wait until he [Trump] starts putting overbroad government demands on tech companies, they won't have the time to clean up their logs and encrypt data." "It's very clear to us that he is no friend to civil liberties," said Reitman, of Trump. "He will be in a position where he can move bills and support measures and even put out executive orders that can be very detrimental to digital rights." The tech community is wary, generally, of Trump. More than 1,000 people who work at tech firms have signed a pledge, Neveragain.tech , not to help the incoming administration create a database to target people because of race or religion or to facilitate mass deportations. The EFF has assembled evidence it believes justifies this call for action. That includes Trump's call for forcing Apple to open the iPhone owned by one the San Bernardino attackers. The government wanted Apple to hack into the iPhone, something it would not do. Trump's response to Apple was, "Who do they think they are? No, we have to open it up." The FBI ultimately unlocked the phone with help of a third party. Legislation also emerged to broadly compel the tech industry to provide a backdoor to encrypted communications, notably in an effort by Senators Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), chair and vice chair, respectively, of the Senate Intelligence Committee. But the White House didn't support it at the time. Reitman believes the encryption issue will emerge again, and a Trump White House may approve backdoor legislation. This "is one of the things to watch out for over the next few months," she said. Many of the big vendors also have large contracts with the government and are seeking pro-industry trade agreements as well. But the industry has also received pushback from its users, particularly in the wake of revelations by Edward Snowden that the government was participating in surveillance efforts. Because of Snowden, "tech actually had to show that they were willing to fight for individual users and were willing to take steps to improve privacy," said Reitman. The EFF has outlined a set of specific recommendations it believes tech firms can take. Some are aimed at specific firms, such as calling on Twitter to enable end-to-end encrypted direct messages. The data the Trump administration could use to track certain groups is already available. Businesses, Facebook being the obvious example, may have databases with details about the religious and ethnic backgrounds of their customers, Reitman said. The effort by some in Silicon Valley to speak out against and fight any effort by tech firms to participate in this data collection will also be up against government contracting. "The Trump administration will always be able to find contractors that are willing to do most anything short of illegal, provided the potential liabilities are realistic," said Ray Bjorklund, who heads federal market research firm BirchGrove Consulting. The government can issue new orders on existing contracts, although terms and conditions can be set that protect both parties, said Bjorklund. The government could also re-open the business for other bidders, he said. Even without the EFF raising its own concerns, the Neveragain.tech effort points to use of data gathering in the Holocaust to illustrate the gravity of the issue. Christopher Browning, a Holocaust researcher who wrote a number of books, said that in many countries, particularly eastern Europe, the Nazis relied on local collaborators to identify local Jews. But in western Europe, especially The Netherlands, "registration of Jews was a key, seemingly innocent, but in retrospect fatal step that made it virtually impossible for those who did register to escape all further measures" short of attempted hiding, he said, in an email response to questions. "In The Netherlands forged papers were particularly difficult, due to the very advanced technology of the bureaucracy in producing ID papers," said Browning. "In contrast, in Athens the ability of the Jewish community to destroy all of its records before the Germans arrived made it very difficult for the Germans to find and identify Jews in southern Greece. Those on the islands, however, were for all practical purposes trapped and thus suffered a much higher fatality rate than those on the southern mainland." "Given that any intensified persecution of minorities in the U.S. would more likely follow the western European rather than eastern European model, then yes, registration is a key, endangering factor," said Browning.

Sarah K. White (CIO (US)) 21 December, 2016 20:00 - - - - print email Comments Microsoft claims that more people are switching to Surface devices from Macs than ever before. That's a concept that would have been hard to picture when Microsoft first released the Microsoft Surface RT and Surface Pro in 2012 and 2013, respectively. The Surface RT suffered from a watered-down version of the new -- and generally disliked -- Windows 8 operating system and, while the Surface Pro featured the full desktop version, it came with hardware limitations and a high price tag. In a sea of clam shell notebooks, all vying to be thinner and lighter than the last, the Surface clumsily debuted as a confusing mashup of a tablet and a laptop. And people didn't like it. RT users complained of the limited functionality and never-ending bugs, while Surface Pro users were forced to pay a high price just to avoid Windows RT. In fact, the Surface RT did so poorly that Microsoft had to take a $900 million dollar write-down after drastically cutting the price of the device. The backlash even made some question whether or not we were witnessing the end of Microsoft. It might seem dramatic now in 2016, but in 2013, people really missed the Start menu. Instead, Microsoft listened to consumers' complaints to find a balance between the company's vision and what consumers wanted. And it worked -- Microsoft has regained credibility and popularity by creating new products that didn't simply mimic or improve upon what was already out there. [ Related story: Macbook Pro vs Surface Book i7 ] Apple's identity crisis For a company once targeting modern, creative professionals, it's hard to tell who Apple makes products for anymore. Apple's devices now feel tailored to a low-tech crowd, or people who like new tech, but just aren't that interested in specs. They want a reliable, easy-to-use device that just works. But where does that leave the original fan base of creative workers who need high-performance and cutting edge features? Apple hasn't left this industry with many options -- and at this point, you can get more for your money in graphics and performance on a Surface Book than a Macbook Pro. Plus, with the newly announced Microsoft Studio, there is finally a strong alternative to the iMac -- with a touch display, no less. Apple's compromise is the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, which features a dynamic touch bar replacing the row of function keys on the keyboard. The display changes depending on settings and the app you're using; it's a cool feature, and certainly useful, but it's a confusing message. If the iPad Pro is competing with hybrid notebooks like the Surface Pro 4, but Apple doesn't think people want touch-displays on a notebook, then does that make the iPad Pro a giant iPad? Microsoft is focused on touch-based input -- in fact, you'd be hard-pressed to find even a mid-ranged PC that doesn't at least offer the option of an upgrade to a touch display. The two companies have taken different stances, but in siding with touch, Microsoft has more to offer in each of its devices. If you want a notebook that can sometimes be a tablet, or a tablet that can sometimes be a notebook, you can purchase just one device instead of two. Microsoft has focused on developing a family of Surface devices that can suit a wide range of users. It starts with the lower-end Surface 3, which is a great device for anyone who just wants a computer to surf the web and use basic apps. The Surface Pro 4 acts as a step up in size and hardware, with configurations for anyone from light users to those who need more performance. And now, with the Surface Book and Surface Studio, even those who need the highest end configurations for heavy-duty video or image editing have an option. [ Related story: History of Apple and Microsoft: 4 decades of peaks and valleys ] The Surface in pop culture Remember when Windows users were the boring, out of touch, suit-wearing nerds in commercials, and a Mac user was the hipster CEO of a startup -- that guy in 2006 who wore hoodies and scootered to all his meetings? That landscape has changed a lot since then, and now Microsoft is the one calling out Apple on selling outdated hardware and falling behind the curve. Microsoft has clearly made a push to get the Surface in front of consumers anyway possible -- CNN commentators used the devices in this year's debates, but it was later discovered they were using them to hide their iPads. Hulu's The Mindy Project also features Mindy Kaling's character using a Surface Book, with one very obvious instance of product marketing, where she very purposefully ejects the display from the keyboard. And what New Englander can forget when the Surface Pro 4 made headlines after Patriot's coach, Bill Belichick, became so frustrated with the technology that he spiked it onto the field. These might not be the most positive representations of the brand, but the visibility of the device seems to be working. In places where it used to be a sea of aluminum notebooks, featuring the familiar, backlit Apple logo, we're starting to see some diversity. Just as it wasn't the end of Microsoft in 2013, it's now Apple's chance to step out of the spotlight and make some changes. But there's nothing like a little healthy competition to help spark new, creative designs and that's exactly what motivated Microsoft to step back, refocus and come back strong.

Twitter Facebook Nokia files even more patent lawsuits against Apple Nokia accuses Apple of infringing 40 patents in lawsuits filed in 11 countries Grant Gross (IDG News Service) 23 December, 2016 05:47 - - - - print email Comments Nokia has filed new patent infringement lawsuits against Apple on Thursday, a day after it weighed in on a licensing dispute with the company by filing claims in Germany and the U.S. On Wednesday, the Finland-based mobile network vendor filed lawsuits in three German courts and two lawsuits in a Texas court, leveling infringement claims against Apple on the widely used¬†H.264 video codec and other technologies. Those suits cover 32 of Nokia's patents. Nokia's first round of lawsuits came after Apple filed a lawsuit Tuesday accusing Nokia of working with patent assertion firms Acacia Research and Conversant Intellectual Property Management to ‚Äúextract and extort exorbitant revenues unfairly and anticompetitively‚Äù from Apple and other smartphone makers.¬† On Thursday, Nokia announced new lawsuits against Apple, with 40 patents covered in the claims filed this week. The company's new lawsuits were filed in Finland, the U.K., Italy, Sweden, Spain, the Netherlands, France, Hong Kong, and Japan. In addition, Nokia has filed a complaint against Apple with the U.S. International Trade Commission, which has the power to bar the importation of products to the U.S. if they are found to infringe patents. The USITC complaint covers eight patents. Some of the disputes revolve around promises by Nokia to license some¬†H.264 technologies on reasonable and nondiscriminatory (RAND) terms. Nokia has accused Apple of refusing to negotiate for licenses for some H.264 technologies, while Apple has accused Nokia of violating RAND promises. Apple products using the H.264 video codec include the iPhone, iPad, iPod, Apple Watch, Macs, and Apple TV, Nokia said in a complaint filed Wednesday in Texas. Other Nokia patents in the lawsuits are related to displays, user interfaces, software, antennas, and chipsets.

The decision could affect CIOs and mobile administrators. Matt Kapko (CIO (US)) 24 December, 2016 02:27 - - - - print email Comments When Apple in July announced it would require all iOS apps to use a technology called "App Transport Security" by the start of 2017, the move was widely regarded as a positive one for user privacy. Now, just barely a week before the deadline, Apple pulled back and extended the deadline indefinitely. The requirement, if implemented, would fill a significant security hole on iOS devices, according to experts.¬† Apple takes a strong and public position in favor of protecting its users' privacy. The highest profile example of this is perhaps the company's standoff in January with the FBI over its insistence that data be encrypted on iOS devices at rest, regardless of the owner or reasons for a government's requests to override those protections. (In that case, the intelligence agency wanted access to an alleged terrorist's personal device to scrape it for evidence and other information). What is App Transport Security? App Transport Security requires mobile apps to encrypt data in transit using HTTPS, thereby encrypting all data that is transported across the network via iOS devices, according to Robbie Forkish, vice president of engineering at Appthority, a mobile risk analysis firm that also sells assessment services for mobile devices, apps and APIs.¬† "To give you additional time to prepare, this deadline has been extended and we will provide another update when a new deadline is confirmed," Apple wrote Wednesday evening in a brief note to developers. The company originally introduced App Transport Security in iOS 9 in September 2015 but uptake has been tepid. Appthority earlier this month concluded in a report that just 3 percent of the top 200 iOS apps installed on enterprise devices worldwide meet Apple's security mandate. During the three weeks since that research was published, four additional apps added support for App Transport Security. "That takes the percentage from 3 percent to 5 percent," Forkish says. "Obviously there's a huge gap between having all the apps comply."¬† Why Apple wants stronger iOS app encryption Apple is pushing for the security tech to be adopted throughout the app ecosystem, following a trend that began a few years ago when HTTPS became the default in browsers, according to Forkish. "An increasing number of percentages across the web are now fully encrypted end to end," he says. "There's this gap where the majority of apps, in communicating with their backend servers, do so unencrypted. That kind of stands out now as an insecure part of the overall ecosystem." [Related: CIOs assess how Apple and Google approach enterprise apps] Enterprises should be concerned about this gap in security, and CIOs who have relied on Apple to provide necessary security are realizing that strategy is no longer viable, if it ever was, according to Forkish. CIOs need to be aware of the apps that don't support App Transport Security and seek out alternatives that provide the same productivity functions but in a more secure manner, he says. "It's hard to know why developers did not meet this deadline. There certainly was adequate time," he says. "The fact that they haven't announced a new date suggests to me that it's probably not in the next six months."¬† Forkish speculates that one of the problems could be a lack of security skills among iOS developers, who are more likely pressured to focus on time-to-market, size of the addressable market and quantifying the features of their apps compared to competitors' offerings. "Security may not be a concept that app developers, by and large, are familiar with," he says. "It wasn't an oppressive development challenge to implement App Transport Security." With no further explanation from Apple, the extension should also give enterprises cause for concern, according to Forkish. CIOs need to better understand how apps come to be in enterprise environments, as well as the different participants involved, he says. "A lot of CIOs are thinking more in terms of trust than just security, and if you can't trust that supply chain for your global apps then you really need to take steps to make sure you know how to separate the wheat from the chaff, so to speak." 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

The company had previously announced at its Worldwide Developers‚Äô Conference in June that all apps submitted to the App Store will need support the App Transport Security (ATS) feature starting January 1st, 2017. It has not yet set a new deadline. ATS is a feature first introduced in iOS 9 that forces apps to communicate with internet servers using encrypted HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS) connections. It's an improvement over the third-party frameworks that developers previously used to implement HTTPS because it ensures that only industry-standard encryption protocols and ciphers are used. Even if ATS is enabled by default in iOS, on a technical level app developers can disable some of its features or can opt out of it entirely through various exception settings that ATS makes available. A recent study performed by security firm Appthority on the top 200 apps present on iOS enterprise devices showed that 97 percent of them bypassed at least some ATS requirements and weakened the default and recommended configuration. Apple planned to include ATS compliance as a requirement in its App Store review process starting next year and to require reasonable justifications for any exceptions. However, as the Appthority study showed, many developers are unprepared to fully enable ATS in their apps. "At WWDC 2016 we announced that apps submitted to the App Store will be required to support ATS at the end of the year," Apple said in an announcement on its developer site Wednesday. "To give you additional time to prepare, this deadline has been extended and we will provide another update when a new deadline is confirmed." There are many reasons why developers might not be ready or even able to encrypt all of their apps' traffic. For example, many apps integrate with third-party advertising, analytics and media hosting services and the adoption of HTTPS by those services is not something that app developers can control. As of December 22, the 3 percent ATS readiness figure among iOS apps had grown to only 5 percent, the Appthority researchers said Thursday in a blog post. "We assume that Apple, too, realized that an unacceptably high number of apps would fail to meet the ATS deadline unless it was extended." The researchers believe that even if Apple hasn't abandoned its plans for full ATS compliance, this is not something that can be achieved very soon, which is probably why a new deadline hasn't been announced yet. "In light of this new development, we recommend that enterprises track the state of apps‚Äô ATS compliance and consider alternatives to apps that access sensitive corporate data and don‚Äôt secure their network connections using ATS," they said.

Call them marriages of necessity, but Apple is striking corporate deals that make it more friendly to CIOs. We look at five of those partnerships. Clint Boulton (CIO (US)) 20 December, 2016 02:44 - - - - print email Comments The late Apple CEO Steve Jobs Apple was notorious for taking a hard line against enterprises, which he suggested were bureaucracies who (do we say who in reference to a business?) struggled to make decisions. The reticence to play nice with enterprises didn't endear Apple to CIOs, who need to manage fleets of iPhones and iPads. "Apple has never, at least until recently, embraced corporations and embraced the enterprise," Stuart Appley, former CIO of Shorenstein, told CIO.com in 2015. "They're a consumer-first company." That began to change in 2011 under new CEO Tim Cook, who has been praised for his willingness to work with corporations. Ironically, Apple's success with consumers in the mobile device market make their manageability in the enterprise so vital today, as the iPhone and iPad almost single-handedly spurred consumerization. Employees have forced companies to initiate bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies. [ Related: CIOs assess how Apple and Google approach enterprise apps ] With these consumers/employees holding onto phones and tablets for several years rather than refreshing them every time a new device launches, Apple is "feeling the heat on sales" and must cut deals with vendors to improve its penetration with corporate customers, says Jack Gold, founder of J. Gold Associates research firm. "Apple didn't drive it, they were pulled along and faced bigger pressure to do the deals," Gold says. [ Related: Apple predicts growth in near term despite down year ] Gold says software makers and solution providers struggling with BYOD have increased the pressure on Apple to make their software run better on iOS devices. Apple, in turn, can no longer afford to remain aloof to the overtures from enterprise vendors. Call it a marriage of necessity. "It's being forced on them by enterprises who require security and manageability," Gold says. CIO.com highlights the corporate deals that are making Apple more friendly to CIOs who required simplified management solutions. IBM Apple-IBM In a landmark mobility deal, Apple in 2014 agreed to work with IBM cloud and analytics software ran on iPhones and iPads. While some initially derided this as a vaporware deal designed to grab headlines, the companies proved pundits wrong over the next 18 months, releasing 100 iOS apps for industries such as financial services, energy and retail. Gold says the deal epitomizes how "democratization," or consumerization has forced enterprises to do what their customers wanted for a change. Cisco Apple-Cisco Underscoring how Apple's enterprise deals had begun to pay off, CEO Cook said during an October 2015 earnings call that the enterprise market was generating $25 billion in revenue for the company, up 40 percent over the same period last year. Emboldened by this success, Apple accelerated its corporate deal-making, inking agreements with Box, ServiceMax and DocuSign. In December 2015, Cook joined Cisco Systems Executive Chairman John Chambers on stage at a Cisco conference to announce that the two companies would partner to enable enterprises to give their most important iOS apps priority. The true nature of the deal was revealed in September, in which iOS 10 was integrated with an updated version of Cisco's Wi-Fi router protocols to let businesses prioritize enterprise traffic, business apps and communications on corporate iOS devices. More than 30 customers, including telecommunications firms BT Group, Deutsche Telecom and KDDI, tested the enhanced Cisco capabilities in early field trials. SAP Apple-SAP In May 2016, Apple and SAP unveiled a wide-ranging deal to develop more native iOS apps, as well as an SDK for SAP's HANA cloud platform, together. The agreement also includes a plan to establish a new "SAP Academy for iOS," where SAP customers and partners can meet to design apps for iPhones and iPads and received training. Apple CEO Tim Cook praised SAP and called it a leader in enterprise software. "With 76 percent of business transactions touching an SAP system, SAP is the ideal partner to help us truly transform how businesses around the world are run on iPhone and iPad," Cook said. Deloitte Apple Apple teamed up with Deloitte in September in what could be Apple's biggest enterprise pact since IBM. Deloitte agreed to create a consultancy comprising more than 5,000 strategic advisors, including iOS architects, developers and designers, to help businesses improve operations in retail, field services, recruiting, research and development, supply chain management and back-office systems. Apple Device Enrollment Program Apple While IT administrators have been able to centrally configure and monitor iPhones and iPads using third-party mobile device management products since the release of iOS 4, they still had to enroll their devices with Apple and then activate workplace mobile device management themselves. Finally recognizing that managing fleets of Apple devices was a chore for CIOs, Apple in 2014 rolled out the Device Enrollment Program, which allows IT pros to automate deployment of iOS and OS X devices with preset MDM configurations.

Twitter Facebook Apple gives iOS app developers more time to encrypt communications The iOS App Transport Security (ATS) will not become a requirement on Jan. 1, as previously announced Lucian Constantin (IDG News Service) 24 December, 2016 00:25 - - - - print email Comments Apple has backtracked on a plan to force iOS developers to encrypt their app communications by the end of the year. The company had previously announced at its Worldwide Developers‚Äô Conference in June that all apps submitted to the App Store will need support the App Transport Security (ATS) feature starting January 1st, 2017. It has not yet set a new deadline. ATS is a feature first introduced in iOS 9 that forces apps to communicate with internet servers using encrypted HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS) connections. It's an improvement over the third-party frameworks that developers previously used to implement HTTPS because it ensures that only industry-standard encryption protocols and ciphers are used. Even if ATS is enabled by default in iOS, on a technical level app developers can disable some of its features or can opt out of it entirely through various exception settings that ATS makes available. A recent study performed by security firm Appthority on the top 200 apps present on iOS enterprise devices showed that 97 percent of them bypassed at least some ATS requirements and weakened the default and recommended configuration. Apple planned to include ATS compliance as a requirement in its App Store review process starting next year and to require reasonable justifications for any exceptions. However, as the Appthority study showed, many developers are unprepared to fully enable ATS in their apps. "At WWDC 2016 we announced that apps submitted to the App Store will be required to support ATS at the end of the year," Apple said in an announcement on its developer site Wednesday. "To give you additional time to prepare, this deadline has been extended and we will provide another update when a new deadline is confirmed." There are many reasons why developers might not be ready or even able to encrypt all of their apps' traffic. For example, many apps integrate with third-party advertising, analytics and media hosting services and the adoption of HTTPS by those services is not something that app developers can control. As of December 22, the 3 percent ATS readiness figure among iOS apps had grown to only 5 percent, the Appthority researchers said Thursday in a blog post. "We assume that Apple, too, realized that an unacceptably high number of apps would fail to meet the ATS deadline unless it was extended." The researchers believe that even if Apple hasn't abandoned its plans for full ATS compliance, this is not something that can be achieved very soon, which is probably why a new deadline hasn't been announced yet. "In light of this new development, we recommend that enterprises track the state of apps‚Äô ATS compliance and consider alternatives to apps that access sensitive corporate data and don‚Äôt secure their network connections using ATS," they said.

Thaivisa.com Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn 2016 has been a watershed year for technology. There has been some spectacular fails that have brought a more realistic perspective to the fundamental belief that technology improves with time. In part, this is because we have now pushed hardware and software to its limits, and certainly beyond our ability to guarantee that it will work as promised, or even secretly hoped. 2016 was the year that technology hit a wall, with significant challenges that will need to be overcome before it can pick up again and start to bring any of its promised future benefits. When batteries fail This was certainly the case with batteries, as Samsung was forced to abandon an entire product, the Galaxy Note 7 because of faulty batteries that spontaneously caught fire. In the end, the problems with the batteries were brought about because of the drive to each year produce new model phones that are thinner and have greater battery life. With each cycle, the engineering challenge becomes greater and the margin of error smaller. Samsung just happened to push beyond that point this year and it ended up costing them around US $3 billion with untold damage to its brand. Samsung were not the only phone company with battery problems however. Apple has had ongoing battery issues where iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S models of iPhone abruptly shut down with the battery percentage still showing anywhere from 30% to 50%. Apple maintained that the problem affected only a small number of iPhones and offered a limited replacement but has now admitted that the problem is more widespread than it first thought. Battery issues are not confined to mobile phones however. Apple‚Äôs new MacBook Pro has failed to be endorsed by the US Consumer Reports because its battery life was so erratic in tests that the consumer organisation was not able to determine what a reasonable consumer expectation would be for the product. In a set of tests of the 13-inch TouchBar model, Consumer Reports found that battery life varied from 19.5 hours to 4.5 hours. This mirrored what MacBook owners themselves were finding. Apple has now acknowledged the issue and is working with Consumer Reports to replicate its tests. Toxic Twitter and Facebook fake news 2016 was also the year where the world realised that social networks were not only not infallible but also suffering from problems so systemic that it has rendered them almost toxic. Twitter failed to find a buyer this year basically because of its reputation as being a haven for bullies, trolls, racists and misoginysts. The fact that Donald Trump and his followers found their element in Twitter only seemed to confirm this. Twitter‚Äôs troll problem dwarfed its other fundamental issue which was that it still hasn‚Äôt worked out how to make any money. Facebook and Twitter became the principle purveyors of fake news during the US election and like Apple and Samsung with their battery issues, eventually ‚Äú‚Äòfessed up‚Äù to the fact that it had it was responsible for this new, and socially damaging, phenomenon. Facebook was trying to stave off admitting that it was responsible because it now has to find a solution and it is really not clear that there is one. This was the year in which Yahoo proved once and for all that it really didn‚Äôt care about its customers‚Äô security in admitting that it had been hacked at least twice and lost details of 1 billion accounts to unknown hackers. Yahoo insiders talked of a culture that refused to properly fund security in the period before the hacks happened. The hacks may be enough to jeopardise Yahoo‚Äôs sale to Verizon, or at least shave billions off the already low price. Nazi AI Artificial Intelligence proved this year that it is a way off from dooming humanity as Microsoft unleashed a chat bot Tay that quickly became offensive, sending out racist, Nazi and anti-feminist tweets. Of course, one could argue that the chat bot was simply adapting to its Twitter environment but as the point was produce an AI with real intelligence, the experiment failed. 2016 was the year chat bots were due to be the next big thing in customer engagement but Microsoft illustrated quite dramatically the limitations of the technology. When things attack Probably the biggest wake-up call of 2016 was the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks that succeeded in bringing down a large part of the Internet. The DDoS attack was launched from large numbers of infected Internet of Things (IoT) devices which have been rushed to market with poor to non-existent security. As the number of these devices is already in the billions, the risks that compromised devices may pose is only really becoming fully appreciated. The list doesn‚Äôt end there of course. The US election was hacked by Russia, the Australian government proved it couldn‚Äôt run a website to conduct the census, and the movie industry continued to believe that spending money on ineffective blocks of torrent sites was better than making good movies universally available to customers. We can only hope that 2017 proves a better year for tech.

But that‚Äôs not saying much. These kind of adaptations have become a common talking point in relation to the worst films of all time. Studios want to adapt video games because they‚Äôre quickly becoming the most marketable and highest grossing entertainment industry. But films haven‚Äôt been able to capture the fun or the weight of video games, despite trying for the past 30 years. Try to watch ‚ÄúDoom,‚Äù ‚ÄúHitman: Agent 47‚Äù or the absolutely dreadful ‚ÄúSuper Mario Bros.‚Äù without thinking ‚ÄúI would rather be playing the game.‚Äù It‚Äôs impossible. Despite this curse on video game adaptations, ‚ÄúAssassin‚Äôs Creed‚Äù was supposed to be the film to change those sentiments. The film managed to get an up-and-coming director in Justin Kurzel ‚Äî coming off the Cannes-premiering ‚ÄúMacbeth‚Äù ‚Äî who brought over much of his crew from that film, including the principle leads: the Oscar-nominated Michael Fassbender and the Oscar-winning Marion Cotillard. Throw in the esteemed Jeremy Irons, Charlotte Rampling and Brendan Gleeson, and it appeared to be the perfect storm to finally bring some class to the genre. Yet, despite the promise, the story is a total mess. Replicating the game‚Äôs Assassins-versus-Knights-Templar basis, the film never fully establishes either groups‚Äô goal, other than that the Templars are looking for the ‚ÄúApple of Eden‚Äù ‚Äî a metallic apple that represents man‚Äôs first disobedience. If this apple can be captured, the Templars can control mankind‚Äôs free will and, thus, the world. Throw in some Catholic imagery, and the Templars represent the very worst that religion has to offer. So here is where the Assassins come in: They are a ‚Äúbrotherhood‚Äù formed to prevent the Templars by any means necessary ‚Äî typically assassinations (makes sense) ‚Äî from retrieving the Apple, in order to keep free will a possibility for all humans. For the most part, this setup makes sense and admirably condenses the convoluted lore that the video games were able to build off of for 14 installments now. But then the film gets bogged down with over-plotting, adding the modern timeline (one of the least successful transfers from the games) of Callum Lynch (Fassbender), a murderer on death row, being taken by a leading scientist Sofia Rikkin (Cotillard) of Abstergo Industries to take part in the company‚Äôs ‚ÄúAnimus Project.‚Äù In this game-referencing project, Sofia intends on sending Callum back to the Spanish Inquisition through his ancestor Aguilar de Nerha, to assassinate the Templars close to gaining control of the Apple. How this Animus works is never given an explanation, and how each detail of the past and present connects is supposed to be taken for granted. But really, the story seems only half-finished. The way the story plays out seems like it would be better suited for an eight-hour miniseries on HBO or Netflix, or some other company willing to pay the necessary budget, in a longform setting that can give the complexity of the story its due. Worst of all, though, the characters are thinly written. While Fassbender and Cotillard are fully committed to their roles ‚Äî the former is physically ripped, bringing his trademark intensity ‚Äî the characters are hard to care for. They are devoid of personality and their motivations to take part in this project are poorly explained. On top of that, the dialogue is laughably bad at times. There is an important sequence that uses the line ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hungry‚Äù three times just to show off another set piece. It‚Äôs not certain whether it‚Äôs intended for laughs or just a lazy excuse for exposition. Despite the fundamental issues with the story, there are some excellently shot crowd-pleasing sequences for gamers and cinephiles alike. Shot by lenser Adam Arkapaw ‚Äî who also worked on Kurzel‚Äôs ‚ÄúMacbeth‚Äù and the other Fassbender-starring ‚ÄúThe Light Between Oceans‚Äù ‚Äî the film replicates the lighting of the original game. The scenes taking place in ancient Spain are gorgeously filled with yellow tints and hues. Even more importantly, Arkapaw‚Äôs cinematography and Christopher Tellefsen‚Äôs work as editor perfectly capture the kinetic energy of the game‚Äôs action. When Fassbender‚Äôs Aguilar is shown in beautifully staged and furiously paced chase sequences on top of buildings, relying on extremely physical parkour and brutal knife-to-sword combat, it‚Äôs hard not to see the increasingly bright future in store for video game adaptations. While it‚Äôs not a winning accomplishment ‚Äî and it‚Äôs nowhere close to one by standards outside of those applied to video-game-to-movie attempts ‚Äî ‚ÄúAssassin‚Äôs Creed‚Äù is a step in the right direction. Maybe next time, like the main characters in the film and the games, the studios will take a greater ‚Äúleap of faith‚Äù and acquire better scripts for the lauded talent in front of and behind the screen. ¬†¬† Contact Levi Hill at [email¬†protected] .

The Apple Watch version will let you discover nearby Pokemon and collect special items, such as potions, from nearby ‚ÄúPokeStops.‚Äù But once you encounter a Pokemon, you will need to use your iPhone to catch it. Still, the Apple Watch should make it easier for players to log their steps (needed to advance in the game and to hatch new Pokemon out of eggs), and to avoid walking around with their phones held out to search for nearby monsters. ‚ÄúPokemon Go‚Äù was a huge success when it came out in July. It‚Äôs not clear how the Apple Watch version will do, especially now that it‚Äôs too cold in much of the Northern Hemisphere to be outside catching Pokemon. Plans for the watch version had been announced at Apple‚Äôs iPhone launch event in September. The game‚Äôs maker, Niantic, hasn‚Äôt announced any plans for Android Wear and Samsung Gear smartwatches.

European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager said on Aug. 30 that Apple must pay up to ‚Ç¨13 billion ($13.6 billion) in back taxes, plus interest, because opinions given by the Irish tax authorities in 1991 and 2007 constituted illegal state aid. Her decision concluded a two-year investigation of the company's tax affairs stretching back to 2003. Apple CEO Tim Cook dismissed Vestager's ruling as "total political crap" in an interview with the Irish Independent newspaper on Sept. 2, and announced the company's intention to appeal. Over three months later, Apple is now ready to file that appeal with the General Court, the European Union's second highest court, the company's General Counsel Bruce Sewell and Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters in an interview published Sunday. The Irish government decided to appeal the ruling alongside Apple, and on Monday the country's Department of Finance published an outline of its arguments, saying the Commission misunderstood the relevant facts and Irish law. The Commission is wrong to claim that the 1991 and 2007 tax opinions "renounced" tax revenue to which the country would otherwise have been entitled; Instead, the department's argument goes, the opinions correctly applied Irish tax law in only taxing the profit attributable to Apple's Irish branch, and not the company's non-Irish profits. The case presented by the Commission revolved around the activities of the Irish branches of Apple Sales International (ASI) and Apple Operations Europe (AOE). These branches carried out routine functions but all important decisions were made in the U.S., so profit deriving from those decisions should not be attributed to ASI and AOE, according to the department. Furthermore, the department said, the Commission tried to apply principles that do not exist in Irish tax law, failed to follow required procedures, wrongly invoked novel legal rules, and exceeded its powers and interfered with Irish sovereignty. A summary of the Irish government's legal arguments will be published in the Official Journal of the EU before the court hears the case.

Apple annual announces a holiday schedule, presumably to give some of the real people behind the app management process some time off. However, this year the break is only 5 days vs. 7 the past couple of years. While developers won't be able to submit new apps or updates during the break, they will have access to other iTunes connect features. Apple recently announced its Best of 2016 list, highlighting top apps and developers. Statista shows that about 2 million mobile apps are available for download on the Apple App Store, including the top new free app (well, it costs $10 to activate the good stuff), Super Mario Run. Nintendo says Super Mario Run was downloaded 40 million times in its first 4 days of availability, and Apple confirmed that is a record-breaker. So those of you forced to wait a few days before submitting new apps in to Apple's system, there's a goal for you... 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Apple has just posted its cheapest model, a refurbished Apple Watch Series 1 in a 38mm rose gold aluminum case, is only $229. Others, like stainless steel versions of the Apple Watch Series 2, are available for $509, or about 15 percent off. This move follows Apple‚Äôs recent decision to start selling refurbished iPhone models on its online store. The discounts generally range between 14 to 16 percent off throughout the entire range of models. Luxury goods buyers unfortunately won‚Äôt find the multi-thousand dollar Apple Watch Edition up for discount. The company notably left that eye-popping price tier, which originally included a 18-karat gold case and a five-digit price tag, out of its Series 2 refresh back in September. Instead, the company sells a ceramic version that costs about a tenth of the price.

Wall Street Daily Home Innovation GeoMacro Special Situations Contributors Free Reports Archives About Us Home Innovation GeoMacro Special Situations Contributors Free Reports Archives About Us WSD Team Contact Us Archives Ensure Email Delivery Frequently Asked Questions Broker Listing Smartphone Wars: Apple iPhone 4S vs. Samsung Galaxy S II Published Tue, Oct 11, 2011 ¬†|¬† Justin Fritz, Executive Editor Leading up to Apple‚Äôs (Nasdaq: AAPL) iPhone event last Tuesday, rumors of a redesigned iPhone 5 had been causing frenzy for weeks. So when Apple announced it was offering the iPhone 4S ‚Äì which is merely an upgraded device with the same design elements ‚Äì investors weren‚Äôt thrilled with the news. And shares plummeted 5% in short order. Then the company sold a record-breaking one million devices on the first day of preorders. Investors realized that consumers are happy to have anything with an Apple logo on it and shares quickly rebounded 8%. But is the iPhone 4S really worthy the hype? To decide, let‚Äôs see how Apple‚Äôs newest smartphone stacks up against Google‚Äôs (Nasdaq: GOOG) Android contender, which has already sold 10 million units ‚Äì the Samsung (SEO: 005930) Galaxy S II. Smartphone Contenders Duke it Out ~ Carriers: Apple now has access to the three big mobile carriers in the United States ‚Äì Sprint (NYSE: S), Verizon (NYSE: VZ) and AT&T (NYSE: ATT). ¬† The Galaxy S II isn‚Äôt supported by Verizon, but it‚Äôs available on T-Mobile. With low-priced plans offered on T-Mobile, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a win for Samsung. Still, many prefer Verizon‚Äôs excellent nationwide coverage. So let‚Äôs call it even. Advantage: Tie ~ Dimensions: Despite rumors that Apple was beefing up its screen real estate this go-round, the company decided to stick with its standard 3.5 inches. Samsung‚Äôs phone sports an enormous 4.3 inch display. What really stands out, however, is that Samsung‚Äôs larger-screened device is thinner and lighter than the iPhone 4S. So Samsung clinches the win in this category. Advantage: Samsung ~Display: A recent study conducted by Strategy Analytics indicates that users prefer Samsung‚Äôs display technology over any other smartphone 2-to-1. But Apple‚Äôs superior pixel density ‚Äì 960√ó640 vs. the Galaxy‚Äôs 800√ó480 ‚Äì should make for sharper graphics overall. Advantage: Apple ~ Processing Power: When it comes to electronics, we all have a need for speed. And since both phones come with dual core processors baked in, neither phone disappoints in this regard. Samsung‚Äôs device checks in at 0.2 gigahertz faster than Apple‚Äôs, though. That might not seem like a lot, but as Android Authority says, ‚ÄúThe additional fifth of a gigahertz in the Galaxy S II‚Äôs processor makes a lot of difference in the overall speed and performance of the device.‚Äù Not to mention the Galaxy packs almost two-times the RAM, meaning it can deliver better performance when multitasking. So Galaxy inches past iPhone in this round. Advantage: Samsung ~ Voice Control: This is by far Apple‚Äôs most promising addition to its iPhone operating system. The company has finally introduced voice controls from Siri, which Apple acquired in April 2010. Basically, Siri acts as a personal assistant, allowing you to speak to the phone naturally (i.e. ‚Äì not like a robot). And the program is intelligent enough to answer questions and perform actions in context. So you can ask the phone if you have any meetings scheduled at a particular time. Siri will respond after it glances at your calendar. Although Android has boasted voice command technology for over a year, it‚Äôs rather limited compared to Apple‚Äôs new service. Advantage: Apple ~ Camera: Both phones feature an eight megapixel camera. But Samsung‚Äôs two megapixel front-facing camera for video calling beats Apple‚Äôs 0.3-megapixel alternative hands down. Advantage: Samsung ~NFC: Despite previous rumors to the contrary, the new iPhone doesn‚Äôt feature a Near Field Communication (NFC) chip, which would allow it to perform advanced functions ‚Äì like transforming your phone into a mobile wallet. The Galaxy S II on the other hand, is NFC-enabled. Advantage: Samsung And the winner is‚Ä¶ Samsung Galaxy S II! Even though the iPhone 4S represents a solid upgrade from the previous model, don‚Äôt expect it to be the most feature-rich smartphone on store shelves. As you can see, the Galaxy S II edges it out in several major categories. Unfortunately for Samsung, though, 10 million units sold in five months may not be good enough to keep pace with a device capable of selling one million units in one day. Perhaps if Samsung put an ‚Äúi‚Äù before the phone‚Äôs name, consumers would have been more eager to scoop up the impressive Android device.

Comments (4) Jared says: October 11, 2011 at 6:18 pm You know its flawed merely to compare specs. B/c in the real world, the 4S still works way better b/c of the iOS system. Specs are great in all these android phones but what keeps holding them back? The android operating system itself which is extremely flawed and complicated compared to the smooth running iOS. Honestly only reason pick android is b/c some people are obsessed with hating apple, they like the whole ‚Äúopen‚Äù idea (which is stupid), they want the bigger screen (only reason that fandroids have for picking android over apple). [Reply] Brandon says: October 11, 2011 at 7:02 pm You are right. When you compare HARDWARE android always outdoes Apple. Any spec sheet will show you that Apple is behind.but its the EXPERIENCE on iOs that wins customers. I have had many android phones over the years, and the experience is always falwed or buggy.so many people making phones with Android OS makes for a fragmented/choppy/rough experience.where as apple makes their hardware and phones, so the overall experience is flawless and SMOOTH.I want a bigger screen, faster processor etc but it just isn‚Äôt worth it when the software its running is imperfect in so many ways. Smaller screen and amazing experience > big screen on a phone that force closeses apps every 5 minutes [Reply] Tim Reply: October 13th, 2011 at 1:11 am @Brandon ‚Äì Strange thing is I‚Äôve had the AT&T Galaxy S II since launch and experienced 0 (yes, NONE) app force closes. While I had frequent stalls/crashes on my apps on my iPhone 4. Part of the Android image problem is that people are talking about the past and aren‚Äôt educated enough to compare current real world performance on both platforms.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: ‚ÄúHow did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!‚Äù WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‚Äò annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with¬†music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008.¬†The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company‚Äôs iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple‚Äôs revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year ‚Äî late because of former CEO Steve Jobs‚Äô reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon.¬†Purchasing Beats would mark Apple‚Äôs largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as ‚Äúextraordinarily bad,‚Äù the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats‚Äô success is due in large part to its wide profit margins ‚Äì despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

Apple is reportedly looking to work with Foxconn as it wants to open up new research centers and wants to expand its business further into Southeast Asia. Foxconn has been a contract manufacturer for Apple for more than a decade now so the companies already have a deep partnership. It‚Äôs the biggest contract manufacturer for the Cupertino company so they do have a strong relationship to launch any future projects from. Apple‚Äôs presence in Indonesia is very limited but Foxconn started establishing its footing in the market several years ago. Chinese publication Economic Daily News reports that Apple has been talking to Foxconn for manufacturer‚Äôs assistance in Indonesia. However, the publication doesn‚Äôt go into the specifics of what Foxconn will be able to provide Apple aside from the business arrangements and contacts that have already been forged between the companies and independent suppliers. Apple has been particularly focusing on China as it seeks to continue growing in the coming years. It makes sense given that China is one of the most lucrative markets on the planet. It was reported earlier this year that Apple is opening its first research and development center in Zhongguancun Science Park, Beijing. The report mentioned that Apple will spend $15 million on this center and will hire up to 500 employees to work on Apple software and products. Filed in Apple. Read more about foxconn.

Trending in Apple Apple in 2017: What‚Äôs next for Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch & Apple TV this¬†year December 26, 2016 AAPL: 116.52 0.00 Best photography apps for your new iPhone 7 and 7¬†Plus Greg Barbosa - Dec. 26th 2016 10:22 am PT @gregbarbosa Apps & Updates iPhone 7 Camera photography View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Christmas has come and gone, but for many the holiday celebrations will continue onwards for the next week. Apple‚Äôs latest flagship iPhone may just be sitting wrapped and tucked away for many of you, and we decided it was a great time to introduce some enhanced photography apps. Here are some of the best photography apps in the iOS App Store that can help you take advantage of the best that your new iPhone 7 can offer‚Ä¶ Apple‚Äôs iPhone 7 and 7 Plus both sport powerful cameras, with the latter utilizing a dual-lens system. (The 7 Plus‚Äô secondary lens allows it to take gorgeous photos through the new Portrait Mode.) Though the native camera app on iOS is powerful in itself, iOS 10 brought RAW photo shooting support to third party app developers. This means that photographers can now get the best possible images out of their mobile cameras in a way that didn‚Äôt fully exist before. Combine that with granular ISO, exposure, and white-balancing support, and third-party camera apps can take your photos and videos to a whole new level. Photography ProCam 4¬†($4.99) ProCam 4 quickly became my top camera app of choice when I got my hands on an iPhone 7 Plus. The ability to shoot and edit in RAW (and have a Photos album automatically created to sort them) made the app all the more powerful. With RAW photo editing built right in, and the ability to shoot even better quality 4K video, ProCam 4 can give your photography toolbox the jumpstart it needs. Camera+¬†($2.99) Camera+ is another great long-time contender in the photography section of the App Store. With a few years under its belt, Camera+ has only added more features with time. The latest update, Camera+ 9, introduced RAW photo shooting, and a new Curves tool to finely edit your images. Editing Lightroom¬†(Free) Users of Adobe‚Äôs products may want to take a look at their Lightroom iOS app. Though the app also supports shooting RAW images, I‚Äôve come to use it more often for its editing interface and abilities. Lightroom for iOS recently saw an update that enhanced the editing interface, an info screen to add data directly to your images, and a pro mode when shooting images. Quite possibly the most appealing aspect of Lightroom for iOS is the app‚Äôs ability to sync with your Creative Cloud account. Instead of relying on iCloud‚Äôs Photos to sync your images and edits, Creative Cloud allows users to have their imports and edits sync across all the Lightroom apps on all devices. SnapSeed¬†(Free) Even before it‚Äôs Google acquisition, SnapSeed has been a staple with mobile photographers. One of it‚Äôs biggest features that came early with the application was its ability to edit images in selective areas. For example: if one side of your image looks darker than the rest of the image, with SnapSeed you could point to that location and edit that area until it seems fit. With the more recent updates, SnapSeed has added comprehensive abilities to edit your RAW images. Videography Filmic Pro¬†($9.99) Another longtime personal favorite of mine, Filmic Pro only got better with the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Adding support for the dual lens system with the 7 Plus, videographers can quickly switch between the wide, tele, and selfie lens to get the shots they need. Filmic Pro grants videographers granular control over every aspect of the shot. Our own Jeff Benjamin detailed 15 different ways to improve your videos with Filmic Pro. MAVIS ($16.99) MAVIS, a relative newcomer to the videographer game, introduces some truly enhanced pro-level features to your iPhone. Bringing in manual controls similar to Filmic Pro, MAVIS also includes Focus Peaking and Viewfinder Visualizations. The latter two are commonly seen on pro-camera configurations, but having them brought to iOS feels like a huge jump forward in what is possible with the camera in your pocket. Jeff took a quick look at MAVIS in one of his previous Friday 5.

This year‚Äôs sale isn‚Äôt quite clear as to what it entails. Roughly translated, Apple Japan‚Äôs site reads ‚ÄúApple‚Äôs first sale is on January 2nd. It will be held¬†online and at an Apple Store near you. Why not¬†prepare yourself for a wonderful year?‚Äù Apple Japan‚Äôs site lets customers know that the business hours on January 2nd will be different, and that they should confirm hours on their store‚Äôs page. What is included in this¬†year‚Äôs sale isn‚Äôt explained on the site,¬†but it could follow in the Black Friday sales we saw across the world this year. Regardless, Apple is prominently displaying gift cards at the bottom of the Apple Japan site explaining ‚ÄúYou can have the fun of choosing just what you like‚Äù. The sale could potentially entail discounts in other ways instead of just receiving a gift card. In 2015, with Apple‚Äôs ‚Äòlucky bags‚Äô, customers waiting in line for the sale would receive one random bag at purchase. With various ‚Äòlevels‚Äô of Apple products inside, the bags included a range of Apple products and accessories. ¬†In the ‚Äúbest‚Äù bag, buyers will get a¬†128 GB 11‚Ä≥ MacBook Air, an accompanying¬†Air Jacket case, an¬†Apple TV, an¬†Incase Icon Slim¬†backpack in a limited edition color, a set¬†of¬†Powerbeats2 (by Dre)¬†wireless headphones, a limited-edition¬†Mophie Juice Pack Powerstation, and a¬†Twelve South PlugBug. ‚Ä¶ The final (and apparently the most common) offer comes with a¬†16 GB fifth-generation iPod touch, an iTunes gift card, and the same additional goodies, as the other bags: Apple TV, Incase bag, Powerstation, and Powerbeats2. ‚Äì¬†Here‚Äôs what Apple included in this year‚Äôs $320 ‚ÄòLucky Bag‚Äô¬†specials Apple is also offering discounted albums in Canada and the UK as a part of their annual Boxing Day sales. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

The newly published research paper (via Forbes) is titled ‚ÄúLearning from Simulated and Unsupervised Images through Adversarial Training‚Äù and credits¬†Ashish Shrivastava, Tomas Pfister, Oncel Tuzel, Josh Susskind, Wenda Wang, Russ Webb and Apple Inc. as its authors. The paper shows a publication date of December 22 although it was submitted for publication on November 15. That‚Äôs just a few weeks before news reports that Apple was allowing its AI research team to publish their work for the research community. Because¬†the¬†AI research community generally makes its findings available through credited publication, the move is¬†expected to help Apple recruit top-notch researchers without asking them to break community tradition. Apple made the news earlier this month at the¬†NIPS 2016¬†conference where it stated clearly that its AI researchers are allowed to publish and engage with academia. At the executive level, Apple has also communicated its openness to machine learning applications and how it‚Äôs used in software already including iOS 10 and the Apple Pencil. The company has also continued a hiring spree of artificial intelligence and machine learning firms this year.

Just ask Siri what's playing, or even Google, and it works just as well. So why include it? And why Spotify over Pandora? For keyboards: Microsoft's WordFlow or Google's GBoard are the best. As for Evernote, since they now can read any of your notes, there is zero reason to use them. Bear or OneNote for full fledged, Google Keep or SimpleNote for simpler ones. Reply Jack Dawson December 28, 2016 at 3:45 pm AND......... the number one app to install is Android. Got sucked in to the iOS trap by my former employer. I have never used such an obfuscated operating system in my life. Ended up changing jobs just so I could get away from that crap. In Apples quest to make things simple they have created a huge mess. I used to be a huge Apple fan but got tired of over paying for my computers. Now I use Linux. Free, and far superior.

While certain specific wearables are doing well, the American wearable technology market as a whole is not growing as expected. A new eMarketer report suggest that even top performers aren‚Äôt reaching the anticipated growth levels. This, at the same time that Apple continues to insist that its Apple Watch sales are ‚Äúdoing great.‚Äù The eMarketer data showed that Fitbit, the Apple Watch and other devices were expected to see a 60 percent year over year growth from last year to this year. That said, the firm announced it is slashing that estimate to a notably lower 25 percent growth rate. The report pointed out that ‚Äúsmartwatches in particular have failed to impress customers.‚Äù This category of the American wearable technology market has seen considerable struggle in becoming accepted into mainstream use. The challenge in the American wearable technology market is in giving consumers a reason to buy. Nicole Perrin, analyst at eMarketer, explained that before the Apple Watch arrived in the wearables space, fitness trackers were leading the way. Today, health and activity tracking are among the most-wanted features in wearables, including the Apple Watch. The issue, according to eMarketer, is that Apple has yet to convince the majority of people who are not early adopters that a smartwatch is worthwhile. This is particularly true when taking into consideration the price tag that goes with that smartwatch when compared to the price of the average fitness tracker. Indeed, the Apple Watch comes with greater functionality, but it seems that most device users have yet to be convinced that the additional features are enough to pay the larger price. Perrin stated in the report ‚ÄúWithout a clear use case for smart watches‚Äîwhich have more features than fitness trackers, but significant overlap with smartphone functionality‚Äîthe more sophisticated, expensive devices have not caught on as quickly as expected.‚Äù The eMarketer report estimated that the American wearable technology market will include 39.5 million adults who will use a connected wearable gadget at least one time per month. As large as that figure may be, the firm‚Äôs prediction had been that there would be 63.7 million people in that group by this point.

Happy New Year firework wallpapers ¬† skip to main content skip to main menu ¬† ¬† Apple reportedly partners with Foxconn on R&D facilities in China and Indonesia By Christian Zibreg, Dec 26, 2016 Tweet Leave a Comment Last month, Apple¬†officially agreed to¬†set up¬†a research and development center in Indonesia. Now we learn from a report Monday by Chinese-language outlet Economic Daily News that the company‚Äôs allegedly partnered with contract manufacturer Foxconn to accelerate the planned expansion into the Southeast Asia region. The report was cited by Taiwanese trade publication DigiTimes. Indonesia‚Äôs Communication and Information Minister said last month that Apple would be setting up its R&D facility in the city of Jakarta some time in early 2017. As reported by Economic Daily News, Apple has now partnered with iPhone manufacturer Foxconn for those plans. It‚Äôs unclear from the article how precisely Foxconn may help accelerate Apple‚Äôs R&D expansion in¬†Southeast Asia. In addition to the Jakarta R&D center, Apple will begin constructing another such facility in Shenzhen, China. Earlier this year, media reports¬†said¬†Apple was looking to establish its first Chinese research and development center in Beijing‚Äôs technology incubation area Zhongguancun Science Park. For what it‚Äôs worth, Foxconn has already been operating in Indonesia for a couple of years, partnering with local brand vendor Luna and Chinese handset and networking equipment maker Huawei. The report notes that Foxconn may see increased demand for 4G smartphone manufacturing in 2017 as the government of Indonesia is expected to soon begin pushing policies soon to encourage the country‚Äôs 2G users to switch to 4G services. Indonesia has population of 250 million people.

Through the eyes of a business-tech reporter, 2016 was a year of big moves. Several key players in the tech industry laid the groundwork for the next decade of innovation and development, whether they be regulators or corporate titans. Apple, Google and Microsoft all¬†took confident strides into spaces we‚Äôd never expected to see them in, and governments have been working with tech companies in ways they never have before. Here are a few things from this past year that not only peaked my interest, but that I predict will play crucial roles in the year to come. Canada shifts its stance on personal data security¬† This past November, it came to light that the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) had been illegally collecting Canadian data for over a decade. The federal government chastised the agency for its actions, and handed down a ruling stating that the intelligence service had breached its duty to inform the court of its mechanisms. The information had been collected for reasons other than national security threats, and therefore, should not have been retained by CSIS in the first place. This report accompanied several others in 2016 detailing the relationship between federal regulators and Canadian data. News that a Quebec police station tracked the smartphones of six journalists made headlines around the world and attracted commentary from history‚Äôs most famous whistleblower, Edward Snowden. The reaction to these stories by federal courts and regulators demonstrates a more modern perspective on data than we‚Äôve seen from Canadian governments in the past. It‚Äôs encouraging for many Canadians to see that the legacy left by Bill C-51 needn‚Äôt be a permanent one. Of several notable topics in technology news, this year truly seems to be the year of cybersecurity. We‚Äôve begun laying the framework for our expectations of the companies that safeguard our data, and have learned in more ways than one that our information is our most valuable commodity. The epic Uber vs. taxicab saga¬† It was this historic year that the Uber vs. Taxicab saga finally came to an end in Toronto. While the two parties are still battling it out in other parts of Canada, the legalization of the ride hailing service and all services like it in the country‚Äôs largest city is a huge step towards complete integration. It‚Äôs become clear this year that transportation is changing, and like many services, it will soon be fully integrated with our smartphones. The conclusion to the months-long court case was met with protest and discontent for many and a long-awaited triumph for the San-Francisco based tech company. It reminded everyone that pursuing innovation is often difficult because it means letting go. It means relinquishing our attachment to systems that no longer work in favour of ones that do. It is, and always has been, the simple mechanism by which society moves forward. While Uber is now legal in¬†Montreal, Quebec, Toronto, Ottawa, Edmonton and the province of Quebec, there‚Äôs still a lot of work to do before it‚Äôs a regularly-accepted platform across the country. Mississauga voted earlier this year to ban the service until a pilot project can be agreed upon. One thing is certain however. The way by which we get from A to B is inevitably changing, and¬†consumers will need to take greater responsibility for directing those changes. Apple vs. the United States FBI¬† This¬†story is likely the most significant tech-government standoff in recent history. In my opinion, this is the most definitive demonstration of the shift in power from federal regulators to international innovators. Shortly after the San Bernardino shooter was identified and detained, the FBI appealed to Apple to unlock the shooter‚Äôs iPhone to reveal potentially incriminating information. To everyone‚Äôs surprise however, Apple refused on the basis of their commitment to user security. The relationship between government and non-government actors has always been a shaky one, to the point where it‚Äôs often been debated who truly has more power. However, this case seems to clear up any confusion on the subject. The fact that Apple was able to refuse the order of a federal court until the request was waived¬†not only demonstrates its ability to stand up to regulators, but sets a precedent for other corporate giants who may respond similarly in the future. The standoff lasted for months before the FBI found another avenue to unlock the phone and dismissed the request. On the other hand, it was recently uncovered that Yahoo handed over millions of user accounts to assist the federal government with a terrorism investigation, and was met with public hostility upon revealing this dissent. Not only do government and technology seem to bump heads more frequently these days, but the public seems to have a renewed sense of protectionism over their information. Driverless cars¬†became a real possibility For years, I‚Äôve had an unexplained interest in driverless cars, though it‚Äôs undeniable that transportation has forever been the afterthought of society. For the majority of the modern world, their day starts after their morning commute. In 2016, the world got its first tangible taste of the changes that could be coming to their morning commute in the next ten years. With the strong push by several tech giants and auto manufacturers, such as Apple, Google, BlackBerry QNX, GM, etc., towards the development of driverless cars, governing bodies have been forced to consider the implications of this innovation. With autonomous vehicles comes a whole slew of security, development, integration and infrastructure concerns that are, for the most part, yet to be addressed. Not only will our roads look different when driverless age finally dawns, but the majority ‚Äî if not all ‚Äî components of transportation in cities will need to be connected by a singular platform to avoid accidents, device malfunction and other complications. Furthermore, the notion of driverless cars has called the structure of vehicle ownership into question as regulators consider whether a ride-sharing model might be better suited to the development of smarter cities. Canada has been home to some significant strides towards developing autonomous vehicles in the past year, including a 1000-person hiring announcement by GM Canada and the opening of an autonomous vehicle research centre by BlackBerry QNX. Both events were frequented by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The technology is there. The next few years will bring new challenges of integration and acceptance. Netflix: 1 ‚Äì Struggling Canadian content industry: 0 The reign of American entertainment continued well into 2016 with the shutdown of the jointly-owned Rogers-Shaw streaming platform, Shomi. Shomi had been operational for just two and a half years at the time of shut down, and had yet to delve into producing original Canadian content. While this isn‚Äôt the first platform to emerge to compete with Netflix, it was the first of its kind to do so in Canada. Shortly after Shomi‚Äôs release, Bell launched a very similar platform called CraveTV. In one year, Canadians went from having virtually no home-grown video streaming options to having two, though many speculate that at this point, it didn‚Äôt matter much. The nation was already enthralled with Netflix, and it was way past entrenched with the U.S.-based service.¬†Shomi‚Äôs shut down was announced at the end of September, sparking conversations about the value of Canadian culture vs. the integrity of content on the internet. What‚Äôs more significant here, is that it presented one of the rare occasions where a Canadian tech story bleeds into the entertainment, culture, media, business and human interest spaces, all at once. I‚Äôm almost convinced that this is the most interesting Canadian tech story that broke in 2016, because of the magnitude of its impact, ranging from the people let go from the fledgling video service, to the comments the CRTC made about Shomi‚Äôs closure after the fact. The service closing not only made the country pay attention to Shomi in a way it never had ‚Äî not even when it launched ‚Äî but the shut down forced us to think about the Canadian content industry taking a backseat to the U.S. once again. Is this the cultural legacy we want to leave? That‚Äôs all folks! Well, there you have it. The key players have been named, the swords have been drawn, and the battles of 2017 are about to begin. All I have to say is, bring it on. Happy holidays! dirtyKIMCHI Great insight. This should be listed as an editorial though. Shogun Canadian content is largely uninteresting and dare I say boring. This country has never had very much cultural appeal and so while the stories may be there to tell, we don‚Äôt really have the best facility for making these programs. The sheer quality and scale of original Netflix programming isn‚Äôt something I see being done as successfully here. The fact we need to mandate tax dollars and legislate content to keep culture alive here also says something about the lack of interest Also I think autonomous cars is a technology that faces significant hurdles to any kind of widespread market acceptance not least of which is wholesale economic disruption to those that drive for a living. The consequences of technology and its negative effects is something that seems to rarely get addressed, but from a tech website that pushes how great all this stuff is, I‚Äôm not surprised In truth that isn‚Äôt always the case Not for you ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt really have the best facility for making these programs‚Äù You do realize that the phrase ‚ÄúHollywood North‚Äù exists for a reason right? Many of the films and shows you watch are filmed in places like Vancouver and Toronto. Shogun Yes I‚Äôve heard the term but talking about acting talent as well as companies that want to spend on production. American studios and actors filming here isn‚Äôt exactly the same thing. Not for you There are plenty of Canadians pretending to be Americans. The bigger issue is finance, especially given the *much* larger market next door. More money equates to higher production values and the ability to take more risks, which makes domestic product look less attractive. Downward spiral etc etc etc. Shogun Exactly and there is no money here to produce the kind of content people want to watch. Corner Gas and Trailer Park Boys just doesn‚Äôt cut it Not for you Perhaps not for you or I, but they were popular enough to be syndicated abroad. Not everything has to appeal to a mainstream audience. Shogun Uh‚Ä¶I think compared to just about ANY Netflix original (and I‚Äôm only using this as an example) TPB and Corner Gas are pretty ridiculous in both concept and execution. Syndication really doesn‚Äôt mean much all things considered because most Canadians never found it appealing and that‚Äôs the problem. A mainstream audience does matter IF a program is to be successful and attract the kind of funding needing for top notch production. Anyone could see TPB was nothing more than a camera manned by a couple people running around a lot filming a pack of *diots getting drunk, cursing and generally engaging in odious behaviour. Do you really consider this acceptable or what Canadian culture is about? Maybe you do but you‚Äôre in the minority. The last Canadian production that was half decent and worthy of syndication was The Beachcombers and there is a reason it ran for over nearly 18 years. It was just that good and did attract an audience both abroad and domestically. Since then, we‚Äôve seen nothing but pure crap in this country and that‚Äôs why culture here stinks. Not for you Still missing the point (and clearly didn‚Äôt read my response). We‚Äôve moved on from the days when everyone had 3 choices of what to watch. Audiences are far smaller, and programming has adjusted accordingly. Shogun And you‚Äôre missing my original point which is funding and talent are in short supply in this country hence the dearth of quality Canadian content. Not for you That you provided the Beachcombers as your example of ‚Äúgood‚Äù content demonstrates your understanding of the cultural scene in the 21st century. MoYeung Hollywood North means taking advantage of CHEAPER production costs in Canada, while pretending the location(s) were USA. Not for you I suggest you read the quoted text. MoYeung I did. They primarily come North for filming the outdoor locations. Not for you ‚ÄúIt reminded everyone that pursuing innovation is often difficult because it means letting go. It means relinquishing our attachment to systems that no longer work in favour of ones that do.‚Äù IMO, all Uber has done is replace one method of exploitation (taxi companies) with another (Uber). Plus an app that data mines your every move. MoYeung I am trying to guess what you meant. Do you the mean the inside of some hotel, mall, train station, restaurant are used for filming too? When I say outdoor, I mean the physical locations. With respect to indoor production facilities, I was thinking about sound stage or production studio. There are some indoor studios in Toronto and Vancouver, yes. My point was that they come for the physical locations, regardless of the filming actually takes place inside or outside. MoYeung I told you there are production studios in Vancouver and Toronto. Since you are unwilling and/or have an inability to clearly spell out what you meant. This is wasting my time.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile ¬´ Why is Apple Reviving their Old 'AirTunes' Trademark? | Main | Apple Granted 70 Patents Covering Night Shift, 3D Maps, Smart Keyboard Connector, a Security Attachment and More ¬ª December 26, 2016 Politics and the Chinese Smartphone Invasion into the U.S could Cause some Havoc for both Samsung and Apple in 2017 ¬† Earlier this month Patently Apple posted a report titled "Samsung is going to Experience the 'Big Squeeze' in 2017 and their U.S. Market Share is Headed for a Crash." The report pointed to Huawei, Oppo and Xiaomi entering the U.S. market in early 2017 for the first time and between that and Google ramping up their Pixel smartphone business in the coming year would certainly mean a downturn in total market share and profits for Samsung. A new report this morning forecasts strong smartphone growth for Huawei, Oppo and Vivo in 2017 who are currently ranked in the third, fourth and fifth positions worldwide.¬† ¬† The report further noted that the three Chinese vendors combined will account for 500,000 million smartphones in 2017. Both Vivo and Oppo, who are owned by BBK Communications Equipment, will account for an estimated 310 million smartphones which technically is likely to be more than Apple will ship unless their Anniversary iPhone breaks a sales record. ¬† Strong shipments from the three vendors will result in a drastic change of market share of the major players in the segment, while also affecting the profitability of smartphone vendors and component suppliers, sources said. ¬† In 2017 the U.S. will experience a Chinese smartphone invasion and for Android fans in general it's nothing but good news. It's bound to spark a price war that will no doubt eat into Samsung's bottom line. Yet when you take the increase of smartphones being sold in the market overall in 2017, it's very possible that Apple's market share will dangerously near the dreaded 10% mark. ¬† The Anniversary 2017 iPhone could be a grand slam for Apple and the rumor of a top-line third iPhone model coming to market could help them stay above 10% if not grow their market share. But if things don't go according to plan, then all bets are off. ¬† While we know that Apple has owned the profits of the smartphone industry for several consecutive quarters, it should be balanced so that developers remain interested in developing for a platform that continues to lose market share every year. ¬† I don't think the world would end if Apple took 71% of the industry's smartphone profits instead of 91% if it meant adding a third iPhone model at the top to work with Apple Pencil and perhaps beef up the iPhone SE or add another model with a 5" display to be more competitive in India, Indonesia and other emerging markets to win back some market share. Apple doesn't have to make crap, just make a little less profit to make it happen. ¬† I think bells will go off with some developers if the iPhone drops below 10% market share. I know the drill, I know that market share supposedly doesn't matter, but it does at a particular crossroads and below 10% could be a negative that pushes some developers to think of developing for Android first and not iOS. Just ask Microsoft who is struggling with less than 10% market share with their hardware. How long will they be able to stay in the hardware business if they can't crack 10% market share over the next five years?¬† ¬† Apple today is not the Apple some of us remember back in 1996 when the knife was falling. Today Apple has a massive base it never had with the Mac. Apple is swimming in profits and won't need to beg Microsoft for a bailout. So a dip below 10% won't kill Apple or put them at any risk short term, period. ¬† But it could be an alarm bell that no one really wants to hear being tripped, especially by the Wall Street crowd that could turn on Apple on a dime if they're unable to stop their market share slide in 2017. At some point, market share does matter. ¬† I hope that day never comes and believe that Apple will shake things up to ensure that it never does. ¬† Yet with that said, 2017 is going to be both an exciting and unpredictable year. This is the year that Chinese smartphone vendors invade the U.S. big time while the Trump administration stands up to China to reset their trade relations and to ensure that their new cyber laws kicking in next summer don't hinder American companies. Without a crystal ball, no one knows how this is all going to play out which could make 2017 one of the most interesting yet volatile years in our lifetime. ¬† About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Up until 2016, Apple took part in the Japanese tradition of offering "Fukubukuro" or "lucky bags" to customers. Fukubukuro used to contain an assortment of random Apple products at a price of approximately $300. Some bags contained things like backpacks, speakers, and other small accessories, but there was always a chance to win a larger product, like a MacBook Air or an iPad. The Fukubukuro tradition is still ongoing in Japan, but 2015 was the last year that Apple participated, opting instead for in-store sales and doing away with the long lines retail locations used to see as people hoped to snag one of the limited edition bags. It is not clear what kind of discounts Apple will be offering on January 2, but it could be similar to the Black Friday event in the United States, which saw the company offer Apple Store gift cards up to $150 with the purchase of Macs, iPads, iPhones, and more. Apple is also likely to offer additional sales in various countries around the world ahead of Lunar New Year, set to take place on Saturday, January 28.

The company was more focused on in-store sales than focusing on the tradition which lead to long lines at retail locations as people were hoping to grab one of the limited edition bags. It‚Äôs not clear as to what will be discounted, but we expect similar sales to the Black Friday event in the United States, which offered up to $150 in Apple Store gift cards with the purchase of new hardware.

Consumer reports conducted several tests on Apple?s MacBook Pro Series and concluded that the battery life of the laptops was ?highly inconsistent.? On the other hand, Apple is dismissing the said results. Apple Senior Vice President Phil Schiller stated that the results concluded by Consumer Reports do not match with the company?s strict lab tests. Apple Denied the Testing MacBook Pro Results? For evaluating display and performance, Consumer Report commenced tests on 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch bar. The reports declared that the battery life of these laptops is not up to the mark. The website declared that the battery life is highly inconsistent from one trial to another. The report included that the laptop series failed to meet the Consumer Reports? standard for recommendation models. The tests yielded disappointing battery results, as described by The Indian Express. Meanwhile, Apple believes in its extensive and strict lab tests. Schiller denied the results generated by Consumer Reports. In a tweet, he stated that, ?Working with CR to understand their battery tests. Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data.? Along with his justification, he even added a link to another article which recommends their products.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Hayley Tsukayama December 26, 2016 Follow @htsuka James Park, chief executive of Fitbit, speaks during an event at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Jan. 5, 2016. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg) Wearable devices such as smartwatches and fitness trackers are expected to be a popular gift this holiday season. But, once you open up the box, it can be hard to know what to look for outside of the basic setup. That's why we're here to help. For these tips, we're focusing on instructions for the Apple Watch and for Fitbit devices ‚Äî the two most popular wearables makers in the United States ‚Äî although the suggestions fit most types of wearables. Here are three things to think about as you set up your shiny new wearable device. Pick a side.¬†I realize this sounds pretty basic, but choosing a wrist can be important for fitness trackers such as Fitbit because your dominant hand tends to move a lot more throughout the day than your non-dominant hand. That, in turn, can affect the way trackers actually log your movement. On Fitbit, for example, you can tell it if you're wearing the device on your more active hand or not in the app that links with your new tracker. On the Apple Watch, during setup you can tell it which wrist you want to wear it on (right or left) and which side you want the digital crown ‚Äî Apple's little controller wheel¬†‚Äî to face. That should take care of everyone's preferences for watch orientation. If you want to change this for any reason, you can do so through the Watch app on your phone ‚Äî just hit ‚ÄúMy Watch‚Äù and then go to ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù settings. ‚ÄúWatch Orientation‚Äù should be an option for you. To share or not to share?¬†Many of the features in smartwatches and other wearables have a lot of sharing functions ‚Äî so you can share your fitness progress throughout the day, or compete with friends. For some people, this is part of the point of getting a wearable. But, for others, it may be a tracking step too far. So, it's time to get cozy with your privacy settings. For Fitbit users, you can find your privacy settings by heading to your web-based dashboard, and diving into the settings menu. From there, you can control who can see your daily step counts, photos, location and other things that Fitbit tracks. By default, some things ‚Äî sleep patterns, your age, your weight, photos ‚Äî can only be viewed by you, but some things are also viewable by everyone, such as your average daily step count. Adjust as you see fit. On the Apple Watch, you can also share your activity for the day, but that is not set up by default. Where privacy can get tricky with the Apple Watch is in displaying notifications on your wrist. If you don't want anyone who glances at your wrist to be able to read the start of your text messages, there is a setting that will let you limit what is shown on the watch face. Head to the Watch app on your phone and hit the ‚ÄúNotifications‚Äù menu. If you switch on ‚ÄúNotifications Privacy,‚Äù ¬†you'll have to tap to see messages and other notification details. It can be a little less convenient, but it could also save you some embarrassment in a meeting. Mind your notifications.¬†One thing that can quickly kill the joy of a wearable device is getting too many notifications. It's great to see who's calling or texting, but it can be pretty annoying to be expecting a message and then get a tap on the wrist to let you know that¬†an¬†article about a celebrity you don't know is trending on Twitter. For the Apple Watch, you can set the watch to mirror all your phone's notifications, but that can become overwhelming quickly. A better approach is to head¬†into the Watch app and find your ‚ÄúNotifications‚Äù section. Scroll down through all the apps to choose what you want to see on your wrist and what you don't. Keep in mind that you may have to head back here as you install new apps, to set those notifications as you like them as well. On Fitbit¬†devices, notifications vary by the type of device you own, but can be controlled through the Fitbit app by heading to the ‚ÄúAccount‚Äù section and then tapping on ‚ÄúNotifications.‚Äù On most models, you can choose whether you want to be notified about calls, texts and calendar events. On the Blaze, one of Fitbit's more advanced models,¬†you can also link your email account, as well as some messaging programs such as WhatsApp. For all models, keep in mind that to receive notifications on your wrist, you will also have to turn them on for your phone. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

In less than a week, Nokia has sued Apple for patent infringement in courts around the world, saying that Apple has refused to license its patents. Apple, for its part, sued several patent owners it said were conspiring with Nokia and accused the Finnish tech giant of ‚Äúextortion.‚Äù Taking things a step further, Apple has pulled all Withings products from its stores. (Earlier this year, Nokia bought Withings, which makes Wi-Fi scales and other digital health and fitness gear.) A Google search finds a listing on Apple‚Äôs web store for both a bathroom scale and smart thermometer made by Withings, but clicking on the link leads to an error message on Apple‚Äôs site. Screenshot by Recode Apple provides the following message: Screenshot by Recode This isn‚Äôt the first time Apple and Nokia have found themselves in a dispute over patents. The two companies sued each other in 2009 but eventually struck a deal in 2011, with Apple agreeing to license Nokia‚Äôs patents. However, this time Nokia says that Apple has refused to take a new license; Apple says that Nokia is refusing to license its patents on fair terms. After failing to strike a new deal, Nokia this week sued Apple in 11 countries, accusing Apple of infringing on 40 of its patents. Apple responded by saying Nokia was acting like a patent troll and said it was ‚Äúdefending inventors everywhere‚Äù by standing up to the Finnish tech giant. ‚ÄúWe respect intellectual property and we‚Äôve always been willing to pay a fair price to secure the rights of patents covering technology in our products.‚Äù Apple said in a statement to Recode. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, Nokia has refused to license their patents on a fair basis and is now using the tactics of a patent troll to attempt to extort money from Apple by applying a royalty rate to Apple‚Äôs own inventions they had nothing to do with.‚Äù Nokia, for its part, said it went to court only ‚Äúafter several years of negotiations trying to reach an agreement to cover Apple's use of these patents.‚Äù Subscribe to Recode Newsletters Recode Daily (Top News) Events Products Go recode_divider More From Recode CES 2017: We liveblogged all the news and updates from Las Vegas What were the most interesting gadgets at CES?

But my biggest beef with Siri on AirPods is that the assistant can‚Äôt handle back-and-forth conversation as well as services like Google Assistant. An example: after I came up from the subway on one of my first days with AirPods, I tapped and asked Siri to locate a restaurant. Siri was only able to tell me the address ‚Äî I couldn‚Äôt follow up and ask which way to go, or for it to give me directions. I had to either start the whole conversation tree over or pull out my phone. AirPods don‚Äôt deliver on the futuristic idea of a smart assistant in your ears ‚Äî yet This is all hopefully changing ‚Äî Siri is getting smarter, and third party apps can now plug into Apple‚Äôs assistant. I actually enjoy using Siri when I need to use Venmo, for example. Shouting a few words at my phone feels quicker and more fun than tapping into and around the app. Fun! When giving away my money! Siri is one of the clearest paths to a technology like the one we saw in the movie Her. You can debate the merits of a technology like that, but Apple now has all the pieces in place to get us there. Siri‚Äôs limitations are the company‚Äôs last big hurdle. A new design I struggled with the way AirPods fit, but my review focused heavily on this problem so I won‚Äôt dive into it again here. That said, I hope Apple finds a way around the current design sooner than later. I want a closed design with options for different tips, and I also want them to get rid of the awkward-looking stems. Sure, those stalks help pick up your voice, and the design adds to the robustness of the Bluetooth connection. But I‚Äôll wait for something more discreet. Apple AirPods review: wireless that wows, earbuds that don‚Äôt There‚Äôs a lot to love about AirPods ‚Äî¬†if they fit you. But the shining star is Apple‚Äôs W1 chip. No one has done Bluetooth quite as well as this before. The connection is great, and pairing is easier than ever. And surprise! They‚Äôre even better if you own and use a lot of Apple devices. Onboard storage Separating headphones from your phone makes things like running much easier. The problem here is iTunes. It‚Äôs almost 2017 and you still can‚Äôt drag and drop songs from iTunes onto your iPhone, so it‚Äôs hard to hold out hope for a better experience on AirPods. (Update: you can drag and drop! Just not in every situation. If you have iCloud Music Library enabled, which you need to sync Apple Music playlists across devices, among other things. It took this 40-minute Twitter thread to figure this out, so I think my larger point about iTunes stands.) Better volume control You can double tap AirPods to activate Siri or play and pause your music, but that‚Äôs it. The only way to control the volume from AirPods is to ask Siri, which is a process. Buttons on earbuds are a tough proposition ‚Äî you don‚Äôt want people pushing earbuds deeper into their ear. But I‚Äôve really come to love volume control on wireless earbuds that have it, and I hate when it‚Äôs missing. AirPods are going to be a lot of people‚Äôs first pair of wireless earbuds, so some of these might sound like small quibbles in light of the impressive technological accomplishment that made them possible in the first place. It‚Äôs also a pretty short list! But it‚Äôs a sign of how close Apple came to making something truly revolutionary. Instead, Apple‚Äôs wireless earbuds are just another (good!) option in this new part of the market.

The latter bought the French firm back in April this year. However, Apple had continued selling Withings‚Äô goods on its shelves even after the acquirement. The sudden disappearance of the brand has lead many to believe that the move was in retaliation to Nokia‚Äôs lawsuit against Apple. When exactly Apple decided to purge Withings from its stores is unclear. It had previously carried a number of the manufacturer‚Äôs iOS-compatible products such as a Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor and Body Cardio Scale. Even a quick search of the retailer yields no results or text autofill options. Also Read: Apple working with Consumer Reports to investigate MacBook Pro battery issue This probably means that Apple has gotten rid of Withings from its online retail database. The two have been in partnership for over 2 years before the sudden end in relations. The first had done something similar before with Bose. Bose had previously been at the receiving end of Apple‚Äôs wrath when it decided to sue Beats over noise-cancelling patents. All Bose speakers and headphones vaporized from its stores for 2 months. Withings may or may not make a comeback in the future going by this instance, though this mostly depends on how the fight against Nokia pans out. Nokia initially fired the first salvo by filing a lawsuit against Apple for violating 32 of its patents. Apple in turn responded to this by filing its own lawsuit against third-party firms working in collision with Nokia to extract exorbitant revenues. Nokia then expanded its original complaint to add 8 more patents.

Here are some setup tips. By Hayley Tsukayama / The Washington Post Monday, December 26th, 2016 at 9:04am .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........Wearable devices such as smartwatches and fitness trackers are expected to be a popular gift this holiday season. But, once you open up the box, it can be hard to know what to look for outside of the basic setup. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre here to help. For these tips, we‚Äôre focusing on instructions for the Apple Watch and for Fitbit devices ‚Äì the two most popular wearables makers in the United States ‚Äì although the suggestions fit most types of wearables. Here are three things to think about as you set up your shiny new wearable device. ‚Äì Pick a side. I realize this sounds pretty basic, but choosing a wrist can be important for fitness trackers such as Fitbit because your dominant hand tends to move a lot more throughout the day than your non-dominant hand. That, in turn, can affect the way trackers actually log your movement. On Fitbit, for example, you can tell it if you‚Äôre wearing the device on your more active hand or not in the app that links with your new tracker. On the Apple Watch, during setup you can tell it which wrist you want to wear it on (right or left) and which side you want the digital crown ‚Äì Apple‚Äôs little controller wheel ‚Äì to face. That should take care of everyone‚Äôs preferences for watch orientation. If you want to change this for any reason, you can do so through the Watch app on your phone ‚Äì just hit ‚ÄúMy Watch‚Äù and then go to ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù settings. ‚ÄúWatch Orientation‚Äù should be an option for you. ‚Äì To share or not to share? Many of the features in smartwatches and other wearables have a lot of sharing functions ‚Äì so you can share your fitness progress throughout the day, or compete with friends. For some people, this is part of the point of getting a wearable. But, for others, it may be a tracking step too far. So, it‚Äôs time to get cozy with your privacy settings. For Fitbit users, you can find your privacy settings by heading to your web-based dashboard, and diving into the settings menu. From there, you can control who can see your daily step counts, photos, location and other things that Fitbit tracks. By default, some things ‚Äì sleep patterns, your age, your weight, photos ‚Äì can only be viewed by you, but some things are also viewable by everyone, such as your average daily step count. Adjust as you see fit. Advertisement Continue reading On the Apple Watch, you can also share your activity for the day, but that is not set up by default. Where privacy can get tricky with the Apple Watch is in displaying notifications on your wrist. If you don‚Äôt want anyone who glances at your wrist to be able to read the start of your text messages, there is a setting that will let you limit what is shown on the watch face. Head to the Watch app on your phone and hit the ‚ÄúNotifications‚Äù menu. If you switch on ‚ÄúNotifications Privacy,‚Äù you‚Äôll have to tap to see messages and other notification details. It can be a little less convenient, but it could also save you some embarrassment in a meeting. ‚Äì Mind your notifications. One thing that can quickly kill the joy of a wearable device is getting too many notifications. It‚Äôs great to see who‚Äôs calling or texting, but it can be pretty annoying to be expecting a message and then get a tap on the wrist to let you know that an article about a celebrity you don‚Äôt know is trending on Twitter. For the Apple Watch, you can set the watch to mirror all your phone‚Äôs notifications, but that can become overwhelming quickly. A better approach is to head into the Watch app and find your ‚ÄúNotifications‚Äù section. Scroll down through all the apps to choose what you want to see on your wrist and what you don‚Äôt. Keep in mind that you may have to head back here as you install new apps, to set those notifications as you like them as well. On Fitbit devices, notifications vary by the type of device you own, but can be controlled through the Fitbit app by heading to the ‚ÄúAccount‚Äù section and then tapping on ‚ÄúNotifications.‚Äù On most models, you can choose whether you want to be notified about calls, texts and calendar events. On the Blaze, one of Fitbit‚Äôs more advanced models, you can also link your email account, as well as some messaging programs such as WhatsApp. For all models, keep in mind that to receive notifications on your wrist, you will also have to turn them on for your phone. tech-smartwatch Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe More News Suggested Stories: Wearable fitness tracker maker Fitbit files for $100M IPO ‚Äì May 7, 2015 Fitbit shows off its pipes in NYSE debut as shares soar ‚Äì Jun 18, 2015 Strong sales, but high abandonment for fitness trackers ‚Äì Jul 8, 2015 Samsung challenges Fitbit with GPS device ‚Äì Jun 14, 2016 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

That Jobs was quick to give Forstall so much responsibility wasn‚Äôt much of a surprise. Throughout the early-mid 2000s,¬†Forstall played an increasingly important role in spearheading¬†successive versions of OS X. What‚Äôs more, Forstall already had a strong working relationship with Jobs stemming from their time together at NeXT. Don't Miss: This free web app will tell you the instant AirPods are in stock nearby Jobs famously gave Forstall a lot of leeway to develop Apple‚Äôs iPhone team as he saw fit. Indeed, the only constraint Jobs gave Forstall was that he couldn‚Äôt hire anyone from outside the company. In typical Apple fashion, development on the iPhone was to be kept a closely guarded secret. During Apple‚Äôs 2012 patent lawsuit with Samsung, a deposition of Forstall revealed all sorts of interesting details about how Apple developed the iPhone under lock and key. One of the more interesting aspects of how the iPhone came to be is that Forstall didn‚Äôt even tell prospective team members what they‚Äôd be working on. Instead, Forstall explained to engineers that Apple was working on an incredible new product and that if they were willing to join the team, they would have to ‚Äúwork hard, give up nights, and work weekends for years.‚Äù Forstall also divulged that the secretive iPhone project was internally known as ‚ÄúProject Purple‚Äù, and work done on the project was conducted under heavy security. As Forstall explained a few years back: ‚ÄúThe [Project Purple] team took one of Apple‚Äôs Cupertino buildings and locked it down. It started with a single floor with badge readers and cameras. In some cases, even workers on the team would have to show their badges five or six times.‚Äù Adding even more detail to an already intriguing story, former Apple engineer Terry Lambert recently took to Quora where he described his experience working on the original iPhone team. Lambert says that he came to the iPhone team late during the development process as a kernel debugger, but his experience on the uber-secretive iOS team is nonetheless fascinating. So I got taken into areas where there were black cloths everywhere‚Ä¶ I only got to see the machine doing the remote debugging, not the target ‚Äî but it was obviously an ARM based system. ‚Ä¶ When you finally got read in, you signed an NDA that let you see the NDA that had the code name on it. You couldn‚Äôt see the code name, until you agreed not to discuss the code name. ‚Ä¶ After the read in, you got access to the ‚Äúsecret lab‚Äù. That‚Äôs a lab inside the main lab. You may have access to the regular lab, but not the ‚Äúsecret lab‚Äù. You didn‚Äôt really get to see the form factor, because when you are doing the initial work, it‚Äôs all prototypes on plexiglass. Lambert also details how Apple will sometimes assign groups working on the same project different code names. In turn, two engineers might be working on the exact same mysterious project and assume that they‚Äôre actually working on two separate things. His¬†full answer can be read on Quora. For anyone with even a passing interest in Apple history, it‚Äôs a captivating¬†peek behind Apple‚Äôs notoriously closed-off curtains. Lastly, Apple‚Äôs 2012 lawsuit with Samsung revealed all sorts of previously unknown details about the iPhone‚Äôs early days, including the iOS feature Steve Jobs cared about the most and a fascinating look at original iPhone prototypes that were never released. We compiled some of the best unearthed secrets from that trial over here.

Happy New Year firework wallpapers ¬† skip to main content skip to main menu ¬† ¬† Why is Apple reviving its old AirTunes trademark? By Christian Zibreg, Dec 26, 2016 Tweet 13 Comments It seems that Apple may be¬†reviving its old AirTunes trademark for purposes unknown, Patently Apple reported Monday. AirTunes became AirPlay in 2010 so it‚Äôs a mystery as to why precisely¬†Apple has now decided to¬†file¬†for the figurative trademark ‚ÄúAirTunes‚Äù with the European Union‚Äôs Trademark Office. According to a U.S. Patent and Trademark Office‚Äôs (USPTO) document, the¬†U.S. trademark for ‚ÄúAirTunes‚Äù expired on November 11, 2016. The AirTunes feature originally worked with the original AirPort router. AirTunes first appeared in 2004 as a software feature designed to work with the then new AirPort Express wireless router, which included an optical audio port. With AirTunes, customers were able to stream music wirelessly from iTunes for Mac to the speakers connected to their AirPort Express appliance. Before becoming AirPlay six years later, AirTunes used UDP for streaming audio and was based on the RTSP network control protocol. The audio streams were sent at the original full volume and transcoded using the Apple Lossless codec with 44100 Hz and two channels encrypted with AES. It supported streaming to multiple targets, each with its own volume control. In¬†September 2010, AirTunes was¬†rechristened¬†into¬†AirPlay and gained the ability to wirelessly stream video content through the Apple TV. Bloomberg said last month that¬†Apple recently¬†ceased AirPort development,¬†disbanded the¬†team and dispersed engineers to other product development groups, including the one handling the Apple TV. The Cupertino firm never officially confirmed the report. The alleged change could indicate that either new AirPort products won‚Äôt be developed or that AirPort functionality might¬†be eventually integrated into future gadgets, such as¬†a next-generation Apple TV or a standalone Siri appliance. Although AirPort Extreme and Time Capsule devices were¬†pulled briefly in May from Apple retail and online stores in the United States, all AirPorts continue to be¬†available for purchase from Apple.com as of this writing.

Michael Miller It does. Neil Urban You can stream just about anything via AirPlay. Your iDevice/Mac‚Äôs display content; video and music content from those devices‚Ä¶ even live gameplay from video games (though there is often transmission lag). This all has been possible for years. 5723alex . Only for the unimportant Apple TV but not to the billion of home cinema systems with AirPlay support. burge Well if yo know how to setup a good system you can incorporate the ATV in to it. 5723alex . I have already another and better streamer. I want AirPlay to stream video. burge AirPlay will stream video. I use it with my ATV, It‚Äôs your receiving device can‚Äôt receive airplay. Maybe it‚Äôs time you purchase something else that can use this feature if you really require this feature. Neil Urban True. However, AirPlay is an Apple service designed to work best and function richly with other Apple products. To get the best out of AirPlay, you will need an AppleTV. This should come as no surprise, as a large part of Apple‚Äôs catch-and-reel is that their products and services work best with *each other* ‚Äî the more Apple you own, the stronger, tighter, and more efficient your Apple-product experience becomes. I‚Äôve never owned a different set-top box aside from AppleTV, however I‚Äôve used a Roku before. I believe that box has limited AirPlay compatibility.

Andrew Cunningham - Dec 26, 2016 3:00 pm UTC reader comments 247 Share this story Andrew Cunningham Andrew Cunningham Andrew Cunningham Andrew Cunningham Andrew Cunningham Further ReadingiPhone 7 and 7 Plus review: Great annual upgrades with one major catch When we reviewed the iPhone 7 in September, we also got to spend some time with a pair of the fancy new wireless AirPods. At the time, the ‚Äúfinal‚Äù versions were slated to ship in just a few weeks, but the planned late October release was delayed with no reason or time estimate given. AirPods didn‚Äôt actually start shipping until earlier this month, and quantities were limited enough that shipping times quickly slipped to January and February. Apple doesn‚Äôt usually like to announce things early, and it doesn‚Äôt like to miss its own deadlines in public, but it also needed to have a bold statement about the wireless future to go along with the iPhone 7‚Äôs missing headphone jack. But the problems with the AirPods, whether they were wireless issues or manufacturing bottlenecks, were apparently severe enough for the timing to slip. Apple sent us a final production version of the AirPods in exchange for the non-final version we tested before. The company wouldn‚Äôt tell us what the differences were, though, and everything from the packaging to the markings on the hardware to the pairing process and audio quality is apparently identical. With that in mind, we‚Äôve revisited and expanded our original impressions‚Äîbut final hardware hasn't changed those impressions dramatically. Unpacking and using the AirPods The AirPods come in a small cardboard box with a USB-A to Lightning cable but no separate power adapter‚Äîanother small speedbump on the road to USB-C. It‚Äôs easy to miss the fact that there‚Äôs a cable in the box at all, hidden as it is under the box‚Äôs white cardboard insert. The headphones themselves come in a small glossy white flip-top case reminiscent of a dental floss dispenser or a cigarette lighter, and the case's finish is identical in style to the one Apple uses for the Apple Pencil. Clearly glossy white-and-silver is the way forward for Apple‚Äôs smart accessories, even as the Macs and iPhones they connect to stick to aluminum or glossy black. The case also serves as a mobile wireless charger for the buds themselves, and there‚Äôs a small female Lightning connector at the bottom to charge it up. There‚Äôs a nearly invisible button on the back of the case for pairing‚Äîthe W1 chip coupled with iCloud will make it so that many buyers never need to use it, but you‚Äôll have to press it with the AirPods inside to pair it with any normal Bluetooth devices, and it‚Äôs helpful if things come unpaired. A small indicator light between the two AirPods in the charger case tells you when the buds are charged and when they still need more time‚Äîgreen means charged, orange means charging. The light will also gently pulse white while the case is in pairing mode. On an iPhone, pairing is accomplished by flipping open the top of the case near your phone‚Äîthis works exactly the same way regardless of whether you‚Äôre using an iPhone 5 or an iPhone 7, which is pretty cool. Hit "Connect" on your phone, and you‚Äôre ready to go. After that, you can check your AirPods‚Äô battery level in the Batteries widget, or you can flip the top of the case near your phone to make a custom battery status sheet for both the AirPods and the case. Take one of the AirPods out of the case while this sheet is visible, and it can show you the battery level for each individual AirPod instead of the battery level for both at once. For no obvious technical reason, neither the pairing nor the battery status sheet work on iPads or iPod Touches. Andrew Cunningham Andrew Cunningham Andrew Cunningham Andrew Cunningham Apple says that the AirPods themselves can provide up to five hours of battery life on a single charge, that the battery case can charge them enough to get you up to a total of 24 hours, and that popping dead AirPods into the battery case for 15 minutes will yield about three hours of battery life. This is Apple‚Äôs standard answer to questions about longevity with its Bluetooth accessories: charging¬†the Magic Mouse 2 with the port on the bottom,¬†the Apple Pencil that juts awkwardly out of the bottom of your iPad, or the AirPods might be annoying, but in a pinch you don‚Äôt need to charge them for¬†long¬†to get you as much power as you need to finish doing whatever you‚Äôre doing. It‚Äôs a compromise, for sure, but it‚Äôs livable. Charged AirPods sitting in their case will slowly drain the case battery over time. Completely unattended, the case discharges at the rate of 10-or-so percent a day. You won‚Äôt need to charge daily, but once every two or three days is a reasonable estimate. The AirPods are shaped exactly like Apple‚Äôs standard EarPods, so if you hate the way the wired earbuds feel or if they physically don‚Äôt fit in your ears, you won‚Äôt like these either. But the sound quality is noticeably better than the 3.5mm or Lightning AirPods. In particular, the bass is clearer and louder, which is always the biggest issue with cheap or weak speakers and headphones. And you can attribute the improvement to the little cutout on the back of the headphones. In regular EarPods, this cutout is just a tiny slit. In AirPods, it‚Äôs larger with¬†its own little speaker grille. Put your fingers over that cutout on the AirPods while music is playing, and you‚Äôll hear the bass tones fade out entirely. So AirPods may be expensive, but at least you‚Äôll get an audio-quality upgrade if you spring for them. The standard EarPods fit just fine in my ears, so I was never worried about the AirPods falling out even if I was running or tilting my head around. In fact, without a cable jostling them or getting caught on things, the headphones actually feel lighter and less prone to coming out than the standard EarPods do. Whether I was cooking or doing chores around the house or going for a jog, I never had any problem with AirPods escaping. My main problem is that the controls on the AirPods are much more limiting than those on the wired earbuds. The standard headset comes with a small nub on the wire that controls volume and can play and pause playback, but it‚Äôs also capable of lots more if you know how to use it. You can skip tracks and go back to previous tracks, enable Siri, scrub forward and backward in audio, use it as a remote trigger to snap pictures, and answer or end calls. The AirPods can‚Äôt even do volume adjustments, and if you want them to be able to play and pause music, you‚Äôll either have to get in the habit of removing one from your ear (at which point the AirPods stop playing automatically) or turn off double-tap-for-Siri in favor of double-tap-to-play/pause. To replace these lost functions, Apple turns to Siri, which is more functional in some ways‚Äîyou can ask for directions, check AirPod or iPhone battery status, ask about the weather, and all the other stuff you can do with Siri. But it‚Äôs not always appropriate or possible to use voice controls for everything. What if you want to adjust the volume but you‚Äôre already on a call? What if you‚Äôre on a train without Internet connectivity and can‚Äôt reach Siri? What if you just don‚Äôt like talking to your phone or if you prefer the instant feedback of a button to the delayed (and potentially misinterpreted) feedback of voice controls? As I‚Äôve used the AirPods longer and switched back and forth between the AirPods and EarPods, this has become the thing I‚Äôve liked the least. On top of all that, the initial swift, unforgiving Internet reaction to the AirPods still resonates, and I don‚Äôt love having tiny white straws poking two inches out of my ears even if I¬†do¬†mostly like the way they sound and fit. It‚Äôs not a problem if I‚Äôm sitting at my desk or wandering around the house, but when you go outside in them you do feel as though there‚Äôs a giant white glossy arrow pointed at you that everyone can see. Now that they‚Äôre beginning to leak out into the wild, the feeling may disappear as they become more normalized. I found a similar thing to be true of the Apple Watch, which felt ostentatious at first but felt less conspicuous as the sight of them became more common. If you do hate the design of Apple‚Äôs headphones, the W1-equipped Beats models should give you the same pairing experience in a different package. Otherwise, it‚Äôs Bluetooth or bust.

The video, representing the work on Apple Campus 2 for December 2016, was taken yesterday on Christmas. Solar panel installation is believed to be 65 percent complete now, up from 60 percent in November and 50 percent in October. Elsewhere on the main building, the atrium of Apple Campus 2 has seen "major progress" in the last month. A month ago, the atrium was just receiving its glass installation. Walkways are also sprouting up around the campus, making it possible for employees to get to and from the various sites Apple is building. Among the walkways, the landscaping on the campus has seen its usual iterative progress, and now "many different types of trees" are noted to have been planted in December. A few other buildings nearby have made notable progress as well, including the reception area for the underground auditorium, and some work being done on the local R&D center is said to be mostly centered inside of the building. Recent rains have left most of the campus in mud, and it's clear that construction will continue well into 2017.

(Photo: Getty Images) There‚Äôs something crucial you need to know about Apple‚Äôs stock,¬†especially¬†if you already own it, know someone who does, or have even¬†thought¬†about buying it: 1. There‚Äôs a mountain of money up for grabs as¬†Apple‚Äôs next potential huge hit¬†product is now¬†making¬†its way out of¬†the company's secretive design labs in Silicon Valley. 2. One stock that's poised to benefit the most from Apple's next game-changer IS NOT Apple. While millions of tech-hungry consumers line up to get their hands on Apple's global sensations, a group of in-the-know investors will be licking their chops to capitalize on a¬†backdoor way to potentially profit as Apple's products fly off the shelves. Here's how. Apple is set to sell millions of new Apple Watches, PLUS millions of iPhones, PLUS millions of iPads. But you already knew that.¬†What most people don't know is there's an extremely valuable¬†tiny component inside all of these devices that Apple doesn't manufacture on its own.¬†They don't make it because they don't have the technology OR the patents to do so. That's because another company (1/30th of Apple's size) owns the rights to those patents -- so¬†Apple has to pay that company to include its technology in their gadgets. Translation: This tiny company essentially gets paid¬†every time¬†Apple sells a new device. You don't have to be a numbers-whiz to understand what that kind of growth can do to a company's stock price. And now, take these numbers and EXPLODE them even bigger, because this company has nearly every major device maker on its customer list,¬†so it‚Äôs not just Apple that it profits from! Think Samsung, Amazon.com, Nokia, Garmin‚Ä¶ They¬†all¬†pay this tiny tech company to use its products. That's why I hope you take a few minutes to unlock the full research a team of highly trained stock analysts from The Motley Fool put together on this developing story and discover why we could be near a turning point.¬†Click here to get all of the details and the name of this stock poised to take-off.

But with the popular mobile game already utilizing the Pokemon GO plus accessory, is the Apple Watch version really worth it? Join us to find out which one is the better Pokemon GO accessory between the Pokemon GO Plus and the Apple Watch! Apple Watch Pokemon GO on the Apple Watch has features that are ahead when compared to the Pokemon GO Plus. On the Apple Watch you are able to spin PokeStops to collect items and notifications of Pokemon nearby are present. In addition, Pokemon tracking and distance traveled are also being worked on the Apple Watch. Pok?mon GO Plus The Pokemon GO Plus may not lack some of the features of the Apple Watch but it has one that completely obliterates its Apple contemporary. What is it? Well, you can catch Pokemon on the Pokemon GO Plus. Related: Pokemon GO Trading Rumor: Niantic?s New Patent To Transport Virtual Items WIth Real Vehicles The Pokemon GO Plus will also allow players to collect items and spim PokeStops. Notifications of nearby Pokemon are also present in the Pokemon GO Plus. However, with the absence of a screen like the Apple Watch, players won?t be able to know just what Pokemon is close by. On the other hand, it?s important to note that some users have reported that at least the Pokemon GO Plus notifies players of nearby Pokemon faster than the Apple Watch version. The Pokemon GO Plus lack distance tracking but the feature does become available when it is paired alongside the phone app. In this respect, the Apple Watch has an advantage when it comes to health and fitness usage.

So which one is the better Pokemon GO tool? Well the answer actually depends on a user?s preference. The Apple Watch is fine if you already own one. Keep in mind that you won?t be able to catch Pokemon on the GO with it alone. Meanwhile, the Pokemon GO Plus accessory?s catching ability is pretty great and would be worth it?s $35 price tag. If you don?t have an Apple watch, then you?re better off getting the Pokemon GO Plus instead.

Valentina Palladino - Dec 26, 2016 2:10 pm UTC Valentina Palladino reader comments 60 Share this story 2016 was a year of looking inward for most companies making wearables. Big names like Fitbit and Garmin released a handful of totally new products, but¬†most companies focused on making improvements to their existing products. While refinements are not as exciting as brand-new product debuts can be, they show us the direction in which fitness trackers are moving. This time last year, the open question was if smartwatches and all-purpose devices like the Apple Watch would kill fitness-only devices like those made by Fitbit. Thanks to developments made this year, we can say that both categories will likely survive‚Äîmostly because the consumer¬†wearable landscape has expanded¬†to encompass a few distinct categories: the "move more" devices, the¬†serious training devices, and the all-purpose smartwatches. Most of the second- and even third-generation products that came out this year fit into these categories, and there are¬†obvious hits and misses. We're going to examine each category and where it went in 2016 and then tell you our picks for best and worst device in each‚Äîalong with our predictions for 2017 and beyond. If you've been waiting for the holiday to pick up a fitness tracker or fancy smart watch, now might be the time! Move more, live more The "move more" trackers are what most people buy for their friends or relatives as holiday gifts. They're trackers that are meant to live on your wrist all day to make you more aware of all that time you spend in your office chair. They all focus on tracking the trifecta: steps, calories, and distance. But many¬†can also monitor¬†sleep, stairs climbed, and inactive time and track some basic workout information. Since their features are more limited than the other trackers we'll get into, there's not a huge learning curve preventing even the least tech-savvy wearers from using them. However, they're also the types of trackers most likely to be abandoned after a few months of use. Video shot/edited by Jennifer Hahn. Quite a few companies make great move-more trackers. Fitbit is the most obvious, and its newest device in the category is the $129 Alta. We¬†didn't review the Alta, but we did review other great trackers including the $99 Misfit Ray. The¬†Alta and¬†the Ray¬†are meant for the same kind of person: someone who wants a tap on the wrist to remind them to be more active throughout the day and someone who doesn't want to look like they're wearing a fitness tracker. The Alta's¬†only perk in comparison to the Ray is its tappable display that can show the time and some activity stats, which will be useful if you like that instant gratification of knowing your step count¬†on a whim. But the Ray ups the ante by tracking swimming and using Misfit's Link system to control smart lights and music. It can also act as a shutter for your smartphone's camera. Further ReadingNearly all Fossil brands now have hybrid smartwatches Both Fitbit's and Misfit's devices (not just the Alta and the Ray, respectively, but others as well) can be classed as¬†"fashionable" wearables, as can many of the other move-more trackers. One of the biggest reasons for this is that most of these devices are simple‚Äîthey're not meant to have onboard GPS, a heart rate monitor, or other complex sensors‚Äîso manufacturers can take the tech needed for a simple tracker and¬†develop more ways to dress it up. Misfit has been doing this for a long time, starting with the¬†bracelet and necklace accessories for its Shine tracker, then its¬†Shine-Swarovski collaboration, and now the Phase hybrid watch that barely looks like a smart device. Misfit's parent company, Fossil, is also doing this across nearly all of its brands, but it started by making some basic smartwatches that track steps, calories, and distance for Fossil's own line of watches. That was a year ago, and now nearly half of Fossil watches are hybrids, and many of its brands (Diesel, Emporio Armani, and more) have hybrids in their watch families. I can happily say that none of the basic trackers I tried this year were bad. All of them track steps, calories, and distance fairly well. The bad parts¬†come when you examine their value for money compared to similar devices. For example, Withings' $80 Go tracker has most of the features the Misfit Ray has, but¬†it lacks a vibration motor (meaning it can't send reminders and alerts to your wrist), and it's not particularly fashion-forward.¬†The Go is only for those who want a very bare-bones tracker; for all others, something like the¬†Ray is a better value. Best:¬†Misfit Ray Worst:¬†Withings Go Serious devices for serious fitness buffs A previous misconception about fitness trackers was that they were only for people who wanted to get off the couch and get back into shape and that their value significantly decreased if you were already active. That's not really true anymore, and many companies make devices that are meant for serious training rather than just step counting. There are different levels of these "serious business" trackers, and levels typically depend on the built-in advanced sensors they have. The two most popular ones are built-in GPS and optical heart rate monitoring, and the former is still more of a serious feature than the latter.¬†Some trackers toe the line in between move-more and serious devices by having built-in heart rate monitoring, like Fitbit's $150 Charge 2. But the best serious tracker to come out this year is Garmin's $250 Vivoactive HR. That's not because it's the most expensive or the most advanced device you can get. Garmin, Polar, and other companies make very high-end trackers costing over $300 that do more than the Vivoactive HR with features like GLONASS satellite reception, VO2 max estimates, onboard altimeters and barometers, to name a few. Video shot/edited by Jennifer Hahn. What Garmin did with the Vivoactive HR is make many of the most desired fitness tracker features available in a solid device that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. With onboard GPS and Garmin's own heart rate monitoring technology, the Vivoactive HR tracks a plethora of workout activities, including swimming; it also keeps tabs on your daily activity and sends smartphone notifications to your wrist. Our big issues with it were its design‚Äîanyone who knows what a fitness tracker is will be able to tell what's on your wrist when you wear it‚Äîand the convoluted nature of its Garmin Connect companion app. We would love to see Garmin fine-tune its Connect app to make the user experience better. If it did so, Garmin's hardware lineup and software ecosystem would be hard to beat. Garmin does a good job of making serious training devices, but it's not the only fish in the serious business pond. There's¬†the $99 Lumo Run, a small sensor that attaches to the waistband¬†of your pants to monitor running form. This device won't be good for anyone who wants to track daily movement, or even an athlete who's training for a triathlon. Instead, Lumo Run helps you run better by tracking your form and suggesting ways to improve in real-time using an audio coach within its companion app. More devices like Lumo Run are coming out, and it proves that you don't have to have a tracker that monitors every activity under the sun to get a device that's hardcore enough to help you get to the next level in your training. In that same vein, some serious trackers try too hard to incorporate as many features as possible. Polar's $329 M600 is an example of this‚Äîit takes most of Polar's typical tracker features, which are quite good, and marries them with Android Wear. This made the M600 a confusing mix of fitness tracker and smartwatch that is ultimately unsuccessful. First, it only works well with¬†Android phones, thanks to the limitations of Google's wearable OS and Apple's restrictions on third-party apps. It's also too bulky to wear all day long if you want to track daily activity in addition to workouts. While it is a true example of an all-in-one kind of device, it's not the best that it could be‚Äîespecially considering many of Polar's other devices have a few smartwatch features, done Polar's way and not Google's way. Best:¬†Garmin Vivoactive HR Worst:¬†Polar M600 Anything and everything Finally, there are the devices that try to do everything you'd want a wearable to do. Even though the overall "wearable" class of devices is still new and without a clear leading direction, some devices are trying to prove¬†the potential¬†of wearables beyond fitness. The best example of this is the Apple Watch, although Apple did follow the crowd a bit with its Series 2 revision. Video shot/edited by Jennifer Hahn. When the Watch came out about a year-and-a-half ago, Apple pushed all the features it had that weren't fitness-related as ways the¬†watch could improve your quality of life and help you get off your phone more. The Apple Watch does succeed in doing that, thanks to its rich smartphone notifications and the ease with which you can actually do useful things from the device. Typically with wearable notifications, you can't do more than glance at them to see what they have to say. Since the Apple Watch came out, Apple has done a good job making the Watch a more interactive device, allowing users to text in multiple ways from the Watch, control smart home devices, and use mini-versions of full iOS apps from its display. Of course, all these things apply only if you have an iPhone‚Äîthe Watch won't work with an Android device. Further ReadingDoing laps and making waves: How to pick a swim tracker But with the $375 Series 2, Apple made a conscious decision to focus on fitness more without getting rid of any of the core smartwatch features. The Series 2 has an onboard GPS for outdoor workout mapping, an accurate optical heart rate monitor, and the device is swim-proof with its unique mechanism for ejecting water that might get into the Watch's speakers. I predict we'll see more trackers of all kinds becoming waterproof enough to track swimming, and the way the Apple Watch does so is refreshing and different. It was also nice¬†to see an Android OEM come out with something nearly as good as the Apple Watch for Google's mobile OS. Samsung's $179 Gear Fit 2 packages the most important smartwatch features and hardcore fitness features into one device. Since the Gear Fit 2 only works on Android devices, it's arguably the best alternative to the Apple Watch for Android users.¬†The main outstanding issue shared by both the Gear Fit 2 and the Apple Watch is the battery life: neither of them last more than two days on a single charge. That's a sacrifice you currently have to make when these wearables are doing so much all the time. In comparison, plain activity trackers both basic and serious typically last anywhere between five days to a few weeks on a charge (and lightweight fashionable trackers like the Misfit Ray can go for a month or more). That's one area that will have to improve in order for more people to invest in all-purpose wearables‚Äîwhen you're spending hundreds of dollars on an accessory that you wear all day long, it should at least be able to last more than a couple days before you need to charge it again. The one product that came out this year and didn't totally live up to expectations was Fitbit's $200 Blaze fitness watch. We didn't come away from the review thinking the Blaze was a bad device, but it occupies a space in Fitbit's lineup and the smartwatch world in general that seems unnecessary. The only smartwatch features it has are notifications (and not all of them, either‚Äîjust call, text, and calendar alerts) and music control. It did take a page from Microsoft's book with FitStar guided workouts, which let you follow moving icons on the display to do a full workout routine comprising¬†different exercises. Otherwise, as a fitness tracker, it could be considered a mid- to high-end device since it has an onboard heart rate monitor but can only use GPS via a connected smartphone. The Blaze's design is also an issue, mostly because you need to remove the module from its strange metal case to charge it with a bulky proprietary cable. This was the first obvious attempt by Fitbit to compete with the Apple Watch, and it definitely fell short. Best: Apple Watch Series 2, Samsung Gear Fit 2 Worst: Fitbit Blaze Looking forward in 2017 We will likely see Fitbit try again to create a solid Apple Watch competitor next year. The news of the company's $40 million Pebble acquisition¬†points to Fitbit's desire to incorporate more smartwatch features into its traditionally fitness-based products. The lukewarm reception to the Blaze may have prompted Fitbit to reconsider its expertise in making a true smartwatch‚ÄîPebble ostensibly knows how to do this and do it well enough to have a big fanbase that supported it through the years with crowdfunding. Pebble's Timeline interface on its newest watches is a totally different way of separating information from the UI on Fitbit trackers, and it's also quite different from the Apple Watch's UI. We'll likely see Fitbit put its spin on Pebble's smartwatch interface in new products. Further ReadingPebble confirms Fitbit sale: Hardware is dead, software in maintenance mode The acquisition of Pebble is one of the biggest stories in the wearable world this year. No matter how you feel about its products, Pebble was the first company to make a modern smartwatch that its customers enthusiastically embraced, and the company's crowdfunding campaigns set records. Now, Pebble won't be making any more products (that means we'll never see its Core running module‚Äîunless Fitbit does something with it) and it's ceasing support for existing watches. Anyone who has a Pebble will still be able to use it, but support has been cut off, and Pebble has already said that functionality¬†may be¬†reduced in¬†the coming months. It's tough to recommend a similar device for anyone looking to get a different smartwatch, simply because most other smartwatches are not like Pebble devices at all. Even the Apple Watch is more limited in some ways, since the Apple Watch is only useful for those with iPhones, and Pebble's devices worked with Android and iOS. There's also the issue of battery life: most of Pebble's watches last a week on a single charge, and some of them could run for 10 days. Unless you opt for a simple tracker that runs on a coin-cell battery (which lasts for about six months), you're not going to get battery life like that on any smartwatch. If we had to recommend an alternative for Pebble enthusiasts, we'd say Garmin's $219 Vivoactive is arguably the company's best marriage of looks, UI, and fitness prowess, and the $269 Apple Watch Series 1 is another good option if you can live without a waterproof design or¬†onboard GPS. Along with Fitbit, we think wearable companies will lean toward opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of smartwatches. According to a recent report from IDC, consumers are embracing "basic" fitness trackers more than smartwatches, due to the basic devices' simplicity. But a device doesn't have to take the form of a generic wristband to be a basic activity tracker. We'll likely see companies take the Fossil route‚Äîincorporating basic activity tracking into stylish devices‚Äîor the Apple route, which is¬†undoubtably the harder of the two options. Fitness remains the most practical use for these devices, and most wearables we know today are fitness trackers in some sense. The companies that try to make true smartwatches will have to define the purpose of those devices, and what will be even more difficult is getting customers to buy into the need of that device. Apple did what Apple does best with the Series 2 Watch: it helped normalize smartwatches and showed they could be both general connected¬†devices as well¬†as good fitness trackers. More people know what smartwatches are thanks to the original Watch and the Series 2, but the devices' necessity is still ambiguous. While you can more easily justify spending $150 on a Fitbit Charge 2 in the hopes of getting fit in the new year, it's harder (but now, not impossible) to make the case for a $375 Apple Watch that you're not sure how you'll most use it¬†aside from tracking workouts. The electronic boat anchor of the tethered smartphone still holds the category back; a true standalone smartwatch that does everything without a smartphone doesn't yet exist. Further ReadingReview: The Moov Now is an activity tracker that forces you to be active Also in the new year, we'll likely see more wearables moving off your wrist. This has been happening slowly for the past year or two, with prime examples being Sensoria's smart clothing and Under Armour's run-tracking sneakers. Moov has already debuted¬†Moov HR, which places a heart rate monitor in a headband or swim cap. This change depends on two things: the size of the sensors used to track movement and the creativity of companies using them to make products that look and feel natural. The wrist was the perfect part of the body for wearables to start with simply because it feels natural to wear something bracelet-like or watch-like all day. But the wrist won't be the only place for wearable technology to live, especially when there are better areas of the body to track things like heart rate, breathing rate, pace, and more. In fact,¬†we'll likely see more trackers come in the form of one of the first wearable technologies: earbuds. Audio companies are starting to embrace the idea of putting accelerometers and heart rate monitors in their earbuds, and ideally it would be a highly practical combo. Most people listen to music while exercising, so a reliable earbud-based monitor could eliminate the need for a music maker and a fitness tracker. We reviewed a bunch of the heart-rate toting earbuds on the market now, and the good news is that some of them are fairly accurate in detecting heart rate. It's still a hit-or-miss market for now, but 2017 could usher in some even better, second-generation fitness buds that could go toe-to-toe with your favorite wristband. Overall, 2016 wasn't a year where we saw anything incredibly new or eye-catching in the combined wearable space. But we did see a lot of big companies come into their own, refining products and making some features more ubiquitous. Hopefully 2017¬†will bring some all-new devices, particularly some that don't live on your wrist. We're optimistic that we could see new companies with unique wearable ideas in the coming year, but they always have the hardest job of all‚Äîsimilar to the struggle that Apple and other smartwatch makers are faced with. They must prove necessity, rather than¬†relying on intrigue, to convince consumers to give their devices a shot. At the very least,¬†we'll see companies trying to figure out how each of their products fits into the current wearable categories that are more likely to stick around.

Happy New Year firework wallpapers ¬† skip to main content skip to main menu ¬† ¬† Withings products removed from Apple Stores following Nokia patent row By Christian Zibreg, Dec 26, 2016 Tweet 3 Comments iOS-compatible smart bathroom scales, thermometers, fitness watches and other HomeKit-enabled smart accessories by French health tracking company Withings have been removed from both online and brick-and-mortar Apple Stores following the latest legal spat with Nokia. Wait, what do Withings products have to do with the Nokia patent row, you ask.¬†Well, Nokia bought Withings¬†in April 2016 for a reported $192 million, integrating their¬†products into its Digital Health unit led by former Withings CEO Cedric Hutchings. The removal was first¬†reported by MacRumors. Withings products like Body Cardio Scale, Smart Body Analyzer and Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor are currently not available on Apple store shovels and are nowhere to be found¬†on Apple.com. Last week, Apple filed an antitrust lawsuit accusing Nokia of illegally transferring patents to patent holding firm Acacia Research and Conversant Property Management in an ‚Äúillegal scheme‚Äù to demand additional royalties from the Cupertino company. Nokia fired back by filing 40 patent infringement lawsuits against Apple across eleven countries after saying it‚Äôs been unable to cut a licensing deal with Apple for its patents that cover displays, user interface, software, antenna, chipsets and video coding. Apple is no stranger to removing third-party products from its own¬†stores: back in October 2014, for example, it pulled¬†all¬†Bose accessories from store shelves over a patent infringement lawsuit Bose¬†filed against Beats following¬†the iPhone maker‚Äôs¬†purchase¬†of Beats Electronics for $3 billion earlier that year. The Cupertino firm eventually settled the dispute and Bose hardware¬†returned¬†¬†to Apple retail and¬†online stores in December 2014, in time for the holiday season.

By Jason Cipriani | December 26, 2016 -- 13:43 GMT (05:43 PST) | Topic: Smartphones In 2016, we saw some phone manufacturers take big risks, trying to push the boundaries of what a smartphone should do, while other companies played it safe. LG and Lenovo each tried to create a modular ecosystem, while Google walked away from the idea altogether. Apple even got on board with water resistance, and then Google jumped into the smartphone war. Take your phone for a swim Jason Cipriani/ZDNet Apple announced the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in September, both of which are IP67-rated. That translates into phones that are dust resistant and water resistant, but they're not completely waterproof. The new iPhones can withstand a splash or quick drop in the pool -- or even worse, the toilet -- and most likely will continue to work without issue. For its part, Samsung brought the feature back to its Galaxy S7/S7 Edge, as well as the doomed Note 7, after waterproofing the Galaxy S5, but not the Galaxy S6 lineup. Water resistance is a feature you hope to never have to use, but it provides peace of mind and a reassurance that your investment is protected during random mishaps. Going forward, water resistance is sure to become a feature expected of flagship smartphones. Reading through reviews of the Google Pixel, for example, there was a lot of disappointment due to the lack of water resistance -- and rightfully so for a phone priced over $650. The technology, which makes a phone immune to an occasional dip without impacting aesthetics, exists, and it's time phone makers far and wide begin using it. Modularity fell flat The Moto Z Play and Hasselblad True Zoom Moto Mod. Jason Cipriani/ZDNet When LG announced its flagship smartphone in 2016, the G5, it included a removable battery. Only, instead of removing the back of the phone to get at the battery, the bottom chin of the device pulled out of the phone. Users could then put in a new battery or enhance the capabilities of the phone using a series of modules. Surely, you saw the commercial featuring Jason Statham dressed up as various characters, swapping modules in and out of the G5. Despite no announcement regarding the company's next smartphone, presumably the G6, reports already indicate LG has decided to forget about adding modules to phones. Lenovo's Moto division is still pushing forward with Moto Mods on the Moto Z line of devices. Instead of removing the battery to swap out a mod, thus forcing the device to power off and back on, Moto Mods use magnets to activate and stay attached to the phone. Google's Project Ara, a phone designed from the ground up as modular, so you can swap out processors and camera sensors, was reportedly canceled during the year. Moto's implementation is better than LG's, and I rather liked the Hasselblad True Zoom Moto Mod, but it's still unclear if modular phones are the future. ZDNet Contributor Ross Rubin said they aren't sticking. Owning the entire experience Google Pixel XL's back is half metal, half glass. It's different, but not as ugly as I expected it to be. Jason Cipriani/ZDNet After years of rumors and speculation, Google released a phone of its own. The Pixel and Pixel XL, for all intents and purposes, are Google's. Through a partnership with HTC, which acted as a contract manufacturer working with Google, Google took control of the entire Android experience. Historically, Google's Nexus phone line used a reference design from a phone manufacturer and ran a "pure" version of Android. The end result was often a decent phone, with a disappointing camera and less-than-stellar battery life. With the Pixel, however, Google was able to tweak the processor to ensure the battery lasted all day, along with fine tuning the camera module to get the best photos possible. And it succeeded. The Pixel, for many, including yours truly, is the phone of 2016. It puts Google on course to seriously compete with Apple, on its own, while also forcing its Android partners to improve their own products. For the most part, 2016 was a year of slight iterations and changes, interspersed with companies trying to set themselves apart from the pack. With rumors suggesting 2017 will usher in radical changes for Samsung and Apple smartphones, the future sounds more exciting than ever.

I decided to build a PC; then make it work like a Mac. Ian Sherr Tech Culture by Ian Sherr 26 December 2016 1:00 pm GMT @iansherr Up Next Putin ordered campaign to influence US election, say intel agencies If you ask me what type of tech I have at home, you'd think I live in an Apple Store. We have iPhones, iPods, iPads, Apple TVs and Mac laptops. There isn't a PC in sight. I'm well-known for pushing my family to switch to Apple, too. No, it's not a cult thing. I'm just lazy. Did you know how much easier it is to fix these things? IBM says PCs cost about three times more than Macs to keep in good running order. And it's true. Just ask my in-laws how much less time I spend fixing computers when I visit, now that they've junked their old Windows-based PCs. My older brother, who convinced me to buy my first Apple computer (a PowerBook in 2003), often tells people he picks Macs because he doesn't have to routinely fight with them to work. But that changed for me in October. Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, got on stage at the company's Cupertino, California, headquarters to announce new Mac computers. Namely, the new MacBook Pro laptop, redesigned with, among other things, a nifty touchscreen built into the keyboard. I had my wallet out and waiting, but it wasn't for that. I needed a new desktop. I sat and watched the event along with my infant son, hoping Apple's Mac Mini computer would be updated with faster chips. I wanted a new Mac Mini because it's about the size of two best-seller books stacked next to each other -- easy to stash right beside our TV. It also starts at only $499 (you have to supply the monitor, keyboard and mouse, which I already have). The problem is Apple hasn't updated the Mac Mini since October 2014. For the past several years, I've used a nearly 7-year-old MacBook Pro as a media center, storing all our family photos, videos, iTunes movies, music and everything else. I've also started using Plex, an app that allows me to stream and search for all that stuff the same way you use Netflix, but also for -- y'know -- pictures of my son's first smile. This year, it was time for a replacement. Sadly, MacBook Pro laptops were all that'd be on tap. Even Apple's iMac (last updated October 2015) and Mac Pro (last updated December 2013) desktop computers were neglected. If I bought a Mac Mini today, I'd be paying full price for a machine more than two years old. Apple, you let me down. My son's first Apple event ended in disappointment. Photo by Ian Sherr/CNET Cook may have told employees Apple is still committed to making desktop computers, but that's not much consolation for people like me looking to buy a new machine this year. I can't just go and buy a PC, though. I rely on Apple's well-regarded MacOS software around my home. I've purchased far too many apps made for Macs, too. But Apple's software runs only on computers it sells, right? Wrong. There's an option known as Hackintosh. It's a process of getting MacOS to run on PCs, and it's possible thanks to a group of way-nerdier-than-I-am people who are always finding new ways to make it work. It's worth noting this is not something Apple supports, and may be a violation of the MacOS licensing terms. But it promised to be an interesting experience, and I was sure to learn a bit more about my computer as I went through it. Enlarge Image This sucker hasn't been upgraded in years. Photo by Sarah Tew / CNET After several hours of research, I decided to build a machine of my own. I went into this eyes wide open, prepared for the time, effort and hours of squinting at a screen this would take. I'd also have to learn how to manage driver software, the tech that makes stuff like video and audio work with an app. When you buy a Mac, Apple does all that for you. It just works. That's part of the appeal. On other computers, you have to keep CDs around and websites bookmarked just in case you need to reinstall a driver or update to make things work. Since my Hackintosh wasn't sanctioned by Apple, I'd have to figure all that stuff out now, too. Let me just say now that I'm not an engineer. My college degrees are in history and journalism. Building my Hackintosh It's relatively easy to get started on putting together a Hackintosh. There are many step-by-step guides and websites devoted to cataloging all the parts the community has found work with MacOS. This is important: Not all computer parts on store shelves offer the right software. One of the people who helps build these meticulous lists is Tonymacx86, whose website consistently draws several hundred thousand active members and as many as 10 million page views per month (and potentially more around the time of Apple events or MacOS updates). Though a trusted guide to many, Tonymacx86 prefers to stay anonymous to avoid overzealous fans and detractors alike. It used to be a lot harder to build a Hackintosh, but thanks to special software made by the community, even moderately computer-savvy people can do it. What's changed is that over the years, Apple and its parts suppliers have offered more code that Hackintosh builders can use to make audio, video and other components work. Still, the community relies on a dedicated team from around the globe to contribute new code and apps to help make setting up and maintaining a Hackintosh as easy as possible. "Our intention with the site's tools and guides was to lower the bar a bit and try to come up with a tried-and-true methodology for both new users and people who are tech-savvy," Tonymacx86 said. Let me just say now that I'm not an engineer. I ended up spending about $800 on all the pieces to build a machine, based on Tonymacx86's recommendations. I figured it should last me for the next six or seven years. Oh, and did I mention it'll be upgradable? Once everything from the microprocessing brain to the hard drive to the case arrived in the mail, I spent two days assembling my new computer. Imagine putting together an intricate Lego set, only this is a computer with screws, sharp edges, electricity and expensive parts you can inadvertently break if you touch them the wrong way. Enlarge Image Look inside my Hackintosh and you see a lot of cords and fans. It's not as sleek as a typical Mac. Photo by Ian Sherr/CNET Looking at my new machine, one downside was glaring. That svelte design Apple's known for? Gone. The black box I have now is 8.2 inches high and stretches 15.7 inches long, which is small by build-your-own-PC standards. But it seems ginormous compared to the Mac Mini's 1.4 inches by 7.7 inches. It even takes up more room than the Mac Pro's 9.9 inch height and 6.6 inch diameter. When my wife first looked at the machine, she gave me the side-eye, "Where's it gonna go?" In a one-bedroom apartment filled with books and baby gear, that's a fair question. Turning on my Hackintosh What I didn't expect was that even with parts the Hackintosh community said would work with MacOS, it still took hours to get my new machine up and running. I had to reach deep into the code of the computer and learn how the software makes video appear on the screen and how it moves audio to a speaker. I had to learn about software that makes USB thumb-drives work. It was kind of a nightmare. At one point, I cursed my days-earlier self for being too ambitious, too foolhardy and too naive to think this would mostly just work. Batteries Not Included The CNET team shares experiences that remind us why tech is cool. In the end, it took about 50 hours to get everything working, and another few to load all those apps I couldn't live without back onto the computer. There are still some odds and ends that make this less-than-ideal: My Hackintosh works better using the year-old MacOS version 10.11 El Capitan. That means I don't get the new features that came out this year in MacOS 10.12 Sierra, like the Siri voice assistant or better connections with my iPads and iPhones. But I can live without all that. It's good that Apple offers software updates for free, but Tonymacx86 said Apple could help the community further if it offered its code to the public, a practice known as open-source. Apple does publish some of its code, but not all. Imagine putting together an intricate Lego set, only this is a computer with expensive parts you can break if you touch them the wrong way. And remember, Apple makes its money by selling the computers I shunned. So, the company's not exactly inclined to help. An Apple spokesman didn't respond to a request for comment. One thing that'll bug me is that I'll have to be much more careful treading around MacOS these days. I can't just automatically download and install the latest upgrade, or even a regular security update. I have to check first with the Hackintosh community to see if it'll upset the various programs they created to make all this stuff work. As to where I physically store my new computer, we're still figuring that out. But that's not the point! What really matters is that I beat Apple. I won. I think.

Apple filed for the figurative trademark 'AirTunes' under application 016d199507. Apple's AirTunes became AirPlay in 2010. Apple officially cancelled the AirTunes trademark on November 11, 2016, according to a U.S. Patent and Trademark document that we present below in abbreviated form. Searching USPTO's database for AirTunes produced a result that we've tagged onto the graphic below. All references to it are now "Dead," which means the trademark is owned by no one any longer, has been abandoned and/or cancelled. Could that be any clearer? ¬† Yet in black and white, the UK filing shows that Apple is reviving the trademark. It's weird because AirTunes was originally designed to work with Airport which Apple has now reportedly killed off. So whatever purpose Apple has in mind for reviving the 'AirTunes' trademark has to be for something completely new or it's a complete error on the part of Apple's UK lawyers thinking it was time for a renewal of the trademark. ¬† USPTO Document Shows 'AirTunes' TM Cancelled ¬† Apple's European Trademark Filing for 'AirTunes' ¬† Apple filed 'AirTunes' under International Class 009 with the specifics as follows: ¬† "Computers, computer hardware and computer software, parts and fittings for all the aforesaid goods; computer hardware and computer software for database management; interactive computer software, apparatus for searching electronic information from a global computer network or the Internet; magnetic and optical data carriers; data storage programs; computer animation software; audio-visual computer hardware and software; computer hardware and software for use in video editing; digital video recorders; multimedia computer software; computer hardware and computer software for a wireless technology to provide communication between multiple computers and between computers and local and global computer networks; computer hardware and computer software for a wireless technology to provide communication between computers, tablets, phones, mobile devices, wired and wireless communication devices, and optical and electronic communications networks." ¬† In 2004 when Apple filed for the AirTunes trademark originally, it obviously didn't include verbiage including "tablets, phone, mobile devices" which are presented in Apple's current EU's filing as noted above. So this doesn't appear to be an automated renewal of the old application. ¬† About Comments: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit comments.

One look at the current fight that has broken out between Apple and Nokia and that is the feeling you will get it. We have seen it in the phone market in the last several years. Again and again. The patent fights, including the one with Apple and Nokia -- at that time Nokia also used to make phones -- started after 2008 when it became clear that the smartphone market was going to be hot. The industry saw so many fights, all almost an attempt to trip the companies like Apple, Google, Samsung, Sony and HTC that were hoping to make it large in the market. Every time there was a company that seemed to surge in the market, one of its competitors filed a patent. Soon almost all major tech companies were part of patent fights. Nokia was fighting several, including Apple. Apple was fighting many, including Samsung. The industry's phone fights looked like this: Image courtesy: Droid Life But then as the years rolled on, the patent fights started to go down in intensity. The companies got tired, or rather realised that they couldn't trip their competitor using patents. At the same time, companies like Google which seemed on the backfoot gathered patents at a record breaking pace and spend billions of dollars in acquiring old phone patents -- Motorola was bought by Google for patents. This restored the balance in the industry and companies¬† realised that patent fights would be kind of useless. Even Nokia and Apple settled in 2011. That is until a few days ago, when the two companies started the fight again. Also Read: BlackBerry will rise from the ashes in January, Nokia in February But if the history is any indication, this is a meaningless fight. Although before we talk about it, a quick recap of the latest Nokia vs Apple patent fight. -- It is important to understand that there is more to this fight than what meets the eye. For one, Apple's fight is against a couple of Nokia subsidiaries. These subsidiaries have lots of Nokia's old patents. But they don't make networking equipment or phones. Instead, they are like patent trolls. They sue companies, hoping to extract some money using the patents they hold. And Apple has called them patent trolls, although before you say that Apple is the good guy here, remember that in the past Apple has used same patent troll tactics against Apple. -- Apple fired first salvo this time by filing a lawsuit against Nokia related companies. In response, Nokia filed 32 cases against Apple in various countries. -- Apple's argument is the classic argument that phone companies, which are at the receiving end of patent trolls employ. It says that the patents that Nokia related companies hold fall under FRAND. This means these patents have to be made available to any company at a reasonable rate because these are essential patents behind technology that powers smartphones. For long the FRAND has a been a bone of contention between the companies that have them and between those who don't. According to rules FRAND patents are available to all companies at a reasonable fee, however this is not something that FRAND patent holders like because they want more money in lieu of making the patents available to other companies. -- It is important to note that the Nokia and Apple fight comes just weeks before Nokia-branded Android phones hit the market in 2017. Although, it is also important to note that this fight is between Nokia, which makes network equipment, and Apple. HMD, which will make Nokia branded phones in 2017, is not the company that has been sued by Apple. Neither HMD is the company that is suing Apple. All of it is meaningless The most famous patent fight of all time is the fight between Apple and Samsung. The cases that the companies fought against each other are yet to reach their conclusion even though it has been nearly 5 years since they the two companies went after each other. Apple has tasted a lot of success in its fight but none that matters. Initially when Samsung was told to give over $1 billion in damages to Apple it seemed as if the US company had won big time. But that was in a lower court. As the fight reached higher courts, the damages that courts awarded shrunk. Just a few weeks however, the Supreme Court of the US overturned the decision of a lower court that had asked Samsung to pay $400 million. The case has been now sent back to the lower court for retrial. Also Read: Nokia and Apple fight patent war ahead of Nokia's Android phone launch But the money was not something that was at the centre of the fight. The objective of the patent fight was to slow down the competitor. On that count neither Apple has succeeded, nor Samsung. Apple is the world's most profitable smartphone maker. Samsung is world's biggest phone maker in terms of volume. It still sells and makes the same kind of phones, only better, that it was making in 2012. All Apple phones, despite Samsung's countersuits, have the same features, only better now, that they had in 2012. It is safe to say that for both Samsung and Apple, their big patent fight has been nothing but an unnecessary distraction that gives them no tangible gain. And the same I suspect will be the case with the Nokia and the Apple patent fight. The patent fights between two companies that can spend millions of dollars in courts never reach any conclusion that will satisfy any party. So, why are the Apple and Nokia fighting? The answer is that they have money, and that they want better terms when they negotiate again for patents. Especially after what we have seen in the last decade, this patent fight may have started with a bang but it will fizzle out in a couple of years with neither Apple nor Nokia gaining anything from it.

For years, apps like f.lux let you control the temperature of your screens in pursuit of a better night‚Äôs rest, but this year, adaptive screens with mainstream with Apple‚Äôs Night Shift and Amazon‚Äôs Blue Shade. The two separate but similar features alter the color temperature¬†of a device‚Äôs screen throughout the day, starting out¬†bright in the morning before transitioning to a warmer, amber glow in the evening. It‚Äôs a subtle effect, but one that shows how technology can (and should) adapt to the context in which it‚Äôs used.

But SFMOMA‚Äôs new app, which it unveiled with the museum‚Äôs re-opening earlier this year, allows visitors to keep their phones in their pocket. Using WiFi and a phone‚Äôs location-sensing technology, the app is able to triangulate a person‚Äôs location within the multi-story building. Based on this information, the app feeds context-relevant content to your phone. It might tell you to look up at the massive Alexander Calder mobile in the entryway. Or it might direct¬†you to turn left instead of right to continue a narrative. It goes at your pace because it knows exactly where you are at all times. Sound creepy? It is a little.

The old design made it easy for¬†members of the social network to¬†file incident reports based on race, instead of behavior. It didn‚Äôt ask enough questions it didn‚Äôt make the people using it think twice about what they were writing. With the new interface, users no longer fill out a blank form and press send. Instead, the form¬†guides users through a series of checkpoints that¬†encourage¬†them to be thorough with their reports. Typically adding steps to a process makes it less ‚Äúuser friendly,‚Äù but in the case of NextDoor, friction ended up making the platform more friendly than before.

Announcing the results for the fourth quarter of 2016 on Tuesday night, Apple said it sold 45.5 million iPhones, 9.3 million iPads and 4.9 million Macs in the fourth quarter - a year-over-year decline of 5.2 per cent for iPhones, 6 per cent for iPads and a massive 14 per cent for the Mac, Engadget reported. International sales accounted for 62 per cent of the quarter's revenue. "Our strong September quarter results cap a very successful fiscal 2016 for Apple," said Apple's CEO Tim Cook. In after-hour trading, Apple shares were down 2.8 per cent to $114.99. "We're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and Apple Watch Series 2, as well as the incredible momentum of our Services business, where revenue grew 24 per cent to set another all-time record," Cook added in a statement. For its fiscal 2017 first quarter, Apple forecast revenue between $76 billion and $78 billion and operating expenses between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. "We are pleased to have generated $16.1 billion in operating cash flow, a new record for the September quarter," said Luca Maestri, Apple's CFO. "We also returned $9.3 billion to investors through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter and have now completed over $186 billion of our capital return programme," Maestri added. The fall in sales was mostly down to declining sales of the iPhone but the newly launched iPhone 7 and 7 Plus may tilt the figures in favour of Apple in the near future. The iPhone 7 went on sale from September 16. The current quarter's sales are likely to benefit from Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 fiasco. Apple is set to unveil new Mac computers on October 27.

Amidst an escalating corporate feud with the Finnish smartphone maker, Apple has reportedly pulled all Withings products (a subsidiary of Nokia) from its online and retail stores. Known particularly for its wide range of fitness trackers for Android and iOS, Withings has had devices in Apple stores for almost two years now. Unfortunately,a row over patent infringement has prompted the iPhone manufacturer to pull the plug on Withings sales, AppleInsider reported Saturday. Nokia and Apple are locked in a lawsuit once more, after the former sued the company earlier this week for infringing 32 of its patents. In retaliation, Apple has since filed an anti-trust lawsuit against nine firms that hold the patents, alleging they‚Äôre are working with Nokia to "extract and extort exorbitant revenues", as well as a countersuit against Nokia itself. This is even‚Äôt the first tussle between the the two tech giants. Earlier in 2011, the two settled a long-running patent suit over smartphone technology through a licence agreement where Apple agreed to a one-time payment to Nokia, as well as future royalties.

Apple had altogether a good year if we look from the lens of the iPhone 7 demand and AirPods. Yet, toward¬†the end of 2016, the company started suffering from a slew of software issues with many of its devices. In the coming year, the company is expected to cover more ground with its devices, especially since rivals such as Samsung Galaxy Note series will be out of the running, at least for the first half of the year. Here‚Äôs what you can expect from Apple in 2017: iPhone 8: iPhone 8 is expected to be a major iPhone generation for Apple; especially since iPhone 8 (also being called the 7S or iPhone X) is its tenth-anniversary iPhone. The device is expected to have all-glass edge-to-edge display, which means that Apple will be making an iPhone without the physical home button for the first time. The company is expected to go for a virtual home button instead. An OLED iPhone 8 variant is also expected to be in the works. OLED displays are more power efficient and show better images than traditional LCD displays. Other expected features of the device include an A11 processor made with 10nm technology, which is expected to be more performance-optimized and battery efficient than the current device. Additionally, it is also expected to sport wireless charging and iris scanning.

In terms of camera technology, it is expected to come with a multi-sensor camera with light sensing capabilities that will produce more color optimized images. iPad Series: Apple is expected to come out with an eighth generation iPad and an iPad Pro with a screen size between its existing 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch models. New iMac and MacBooks: The company is expected to tweak the MacBooks and iMacs in 2017. The expected changes could be USB Type-C connectors and improved graphics chip. The company needs to step up its game for the iMac, ever since its newfound competition from the Surface Studio all-in-one PC. Augmented Reality (AR) devices ‚Äî Apple CEO Tim Cook signaled his interest in AR in September and stated that instead of jumping on the VR bandwagon like other major tech companies, Apple would be more interested in AR.

According to the Consumer Reports review, there are battery-life issues with the 13-inch MacBook without the new Touch Bar control strip, and the 13- and 15-inch models with the Touch Bar. They all threw up wildly inconsistent battery times in testing. On some trials, the laptops gave out battery life readings that exceeded Apple's own 10-hour estimate. But in other trials, the laptops had less than half of what Apple promises; in one case, the 13-inch MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar ran for a paltry 3.45 hours. The average of the test totals seem to be in-line with Apple's 10-hour estimate, but that would be cold comfort to someone whose laptop dies on the first leg of a cross-country flight. So, the publication decided to rate the laptops using their shortest battery life times, which dragged down the computers' overall scores. (Also see: ¬†Apple Contests Consumer Reports' MacBook Pro Battery Life Test Results) But while the laptops "did very well in measures of display quality and performance," wrote Consumer Reports' Jerry Beilinson, that wasn't enough to outweigh the battery issues. So what should people who've already bought (and maybe wrapped) a MacBook Pro do? There is a bright spot in the Consumer Reports article: try using a browser that isn't Apple's own Safari. When Consumer Reports testers ran their trials using Google's Chrome browser, they found that the laptops had "consistently high" battery life. Unfortunately for Apple, those Chrome tests don't count -- part of Consumer Reports' testing criteria is that it only uses the default browser to score devices. That would flip the conventional wisdom on browsers and Mac battery life; using Safari instead of Chrome is often recommended to improve your battery life. It's not clear why that has changed with these models. Switching browsers may help in the short-term, but doesn't explain why Consumer Reports found the laptop batteries so inconsistent in its official tests; it could hint at a larger underlying problem. Still, it may at least give Apple users who've already paid big money for these computers a way to avoid these battery life problems. Consumer Reports's review follows on the heels of some complaints by MacBook Pro users who have had issues with the battery life of Apple's newest laptops since they hit shelves in October . I haven't experienced battery life problems on the Touch Bar-less laptop Apple has provided for me, but 9 to 5 Mac, running a battery test trial on one Touch Bar model, found a battery life of 8 hours for the 13-inch model. Its reviewer also reported a 6 hour battery life for the 15-inch model. Apple responded -¬†sort of -¬†to user complaints by removing the part of the battery indicator that shows the "time remaining" in a laptop's charge, saying that those estimates can be inaccurate. But, it said, there was no issue with the computers' battery life in general. The company is also already running a small replacement program for short-lived batteries on some iPhones. ¬© 2016 The Washington Post For the latest coverage from the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, visit our CES 2017 hub.

Those tax advantages must now be repaid, the EU said in a statement. Some believe this is the writing on the wall for Apple. ¬† Raymond H.C. Luja, a professor of comparative tax law at Maastricht University commented that "This is a landmark decision because it clarifies the rules of the game. That will also have its effect on a number of ongoing cases." ¬† Europe's crusade against unfair tax treatment has led EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager to order Apple to pay a record 13bn euros ($13.6bn) in back taxes because of arrangements with Ireland that she says weren't open to others. Belgium was also told to claw back some 700m euros in tax advantages granted to companies, including AB InBev, the world's biggest brewer. ¬† The EU Commission said in an emailed statement that "The judgment is important because it confirms that a measure may be selective, if it benefits only those companies that carry out certain transactions." ¬† Yet the Irish finance ministry sees the ruling differently. The ministry said in a statement last Wednesday that the 'facts and the approach' in the Spanish cases 'are very different' from those in the Apple case. "It is a complete overstatement to say that the Irish appeal of the Apple decision is dependent on the outcome of the Santander and Autogrill decision of the European Court Justice, or that today's judgment is crucial for the Irish case." ¬† Though as positive as the Irish Ministry may be, Patently Apple posted a report earlier this month that chronicled the growing clash between Europe and the U.S. and a shift in the EU's approach to the tax affairs of multinationals. The report centered in on "The Maxforce," the European Union's team that ordered Ireland to collect billions of euros in back taxes from Apple which rattled the Irish government, and spurred changes to international tax law. ¬† In the end, it is my opinion that a great deal of time and effort has gone into this case against Apple to ensure that they they become the European Commission's poster child for tax evasion and punishment.Trying to read the tea leaves regarding the Spanish ruling is likely to prove irrelevant. The fix is in and little else matters at this point in time. ¬† About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

CLOSE Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Friday, January 6, 2017 Insider K Street Lifestyle Opinion Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Home Headline Comparing Apples to Apples: Banning Smartphones Increases the Digital Divide Headline Comparing Apples to Apples: Banning Smartphones Increases the Digital Divide By Kristal High - 9:19am February 27, 2015 1642 3 SHARE Facebook Twitter There seems to be a growing sense of exceptionalism going around Silicon Valley these days ‚Äì what‚Äôs good for the goose isn‚Äôt good for the gander. Large tech companies are trying to manipulate laws and regulations to get a competitive edge while regular folks are left to deal with the fall out. The latest example of the ‚ÄúX law should only apply when it benefits me‚Äù logic comes by way of the on-going patent wars between smartphone providers Apple and Samsung. In 2011, Apple filed suit against Samsung claiming the company made smartphones that infringed on patents currently held by Apple.¬† Today, the companies remain embroiled in several lawsuits with billions of dollars on the line. Apple‚Äôs main gripe is that Samsung has apparently infringed on various patents in the production of its Android smartphones. Ironically, a federal jury in Texas just found Apple liable of patent infringement to the tune of $532.9 million for willfully using another company‚Äôs patents in its iTunes software.¬† Even still, Apple has been granted monetary damages for Samsung‚Äôs infringement of three patents.¬† Now, the company is seeking to prevent Samsung from ‚Äúmaking, selling, developing, or advertising‚Äù smartphones containing ‚Äúinfringing features in its products.‚Äù Apple made $182.35 billion last year, resulting in $39.51 billion in profits being added to the company‚Äôs bottom line for 2014. It was ranked the most successful company in the world‚Ä¶ever‚Ä¶based on its fourth quarter performance. Yet, it‚Äôs claiming that Samsung should be effectively banned from making and selling several models of its smartphones so as not to place in jeopardy Apple‚Äôs competitive position. A bit of Shakespeare is apropos for these theatrics: ‚Äúthe lady doth protest too much, methinks.‚Äù¬† The lady, of course, in this instance is Apple. Not only are Apple‚Äôs actions ludicrous, but they are very dangerous and run the risk of increasing the digital divide.¬† According to the Pew Internet & American Life Project, 90% of American adults own cell phones while 58% own smartphones.¬† People of color slightly over-index the national averages with 59% of African Americans and 61% of Hispanics owning smartphones, and 90% and 92%, respectively, owning cell phones. Even though a pervasive digital divide means far too many people of color and members of low-income communities don‚Äôt have broadband at home, 60% of cellphone owners use their mobile devices to get online. Of all American smartphone owners, 52% own androids while 42.7% own iPhones. So what does this tell us? Smartphones, with their ability to enable the use of varied applications and word processing programs, make all the difference in the world between the digitally connected and those who are on the wrong side of the digital divide. Even still, not everyone can afford a $600 iPhone, and so the Android market has become essential to ensuring that people not only have a choice in the kind of smartphone devices they purchase, but also that they are able to affordably access the web. The potential for smartphones to bridge the digital divide countered against the cost of obtaining a smartphone device makes Apple‚Äôs law suits against Samsung over the past four years all the more ridiculous.¬† It‚Äôs one thing to claim a competitor is infringing upon your patents.¬† It‚Äôs quite another to seek injunctive relief (meaning that the android phones containing the allegedly infringing patents would have to be taken off the market) disconnecting people from the affordable technology that allows them to get online in the first place. United States District Judge Lucy H. Koh, authoring the opinion of the Court in Apple v. Samsung in 2014, got it right when she determined that ‚Äúthe principles of equity do not support a permanent injunction‚Äù in this case. Even assuming Samsung did, in fact, infringe on three patents held by Apple, she said, Apple has not and cannot demonstrate that it suffered any irreparable harm from the exploitation of these patents, it did not experience any loss to its sales or reputation because of any patent infringement, and it didn‚Äôt make the case that Samsung was the actual cause of any such harm. There are certainly those instances in which patent infringement, especially in the tech sector, harms the public interest and places a company and its intellectual property in danger. This, however, is not such a case. Not only would the public interest be harmed if Samsung couldn‚Äôt produce or sell its smartphones ‚Äì the average cost of an Android is $254, while the average cost of an iPhone is $687. But it‚Äôs incredibly hard for Apple, which just had the most profitable quarter of any company in the world in the recorded history of mankind, to seriously argue that the production of competitive smartphones containing portions of ostensibly infringing patents somehow damages its reputation and financial standing. The tech game almost inevitably breeds overlap in products and ideas. While some sort of action may be required to compensate parties from having their ideas coopted and exploited by others for profit, people would suffer if the standard Apple is trying to promote in its dispute against Samsung was allowed to stand. As a society that increasingly relies on smartphones to conduct just about every facet of our lives, we cannot afford to allow behemoth corporations to pretend that law and equity require a specific result that, in truth, only maximizes that company‚Äôs bottom line.¬† Apple is no innocent bystander here, and the real balance of equity we should be focused on is the impact on real people who would truly lose out and fall deeper in the cracks of the digital divide if options for affordable smartphones are taken out of production. ¬† ¬† TAGS Android apple apple v. samsung cell phone digital divide iPhone lacy h. koh patent patent troll pew internet samsung smart phone smartphone u.s. district court SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleOpen Carry Gun Laws Won‚Äôt Work for Black People Until Racial Bias Abates Next articleLeelah Alcorn‚Äôs Story Rings True for Everyone Who‚Äôs ‚ÄúDifferent‚Äù Kristal High http://www.politic365.com Kristal Lauren High co-founded and serves as Editor in Chief of Politic365.

The new improvements are a welcome addition to Apple‚Äôs fledgling Touch Bar.¬† ( Spotify ) Advertisement The Spotify¬†app for Mac has now been updated to sport new Touch Bar¬†controls for the new MacBook Pro¬†models, and it now also supports AirPods integration, pausing whatever is playing when the tiny buds are yanked off and then resuming playback once they're snugly in place again. Touch Bar Controls Owners of the new MacBook Pro lineup will now have a Spotify experience similar to iTunes, wherein the Touch Bar can be used to scrub through music, pause, play, shuffle, and search for tracks. The new update also adds a dedicated volume slider in the Touch Bar, so music volume can independently be controlled apart from the system volume. AirPods Auto-Pause Support The Spotify for Mac app can now also support auto-pause with AirPods, automatically halting the music when users pop the wireless headphone off their air, though this was a feature mostly discovered by users, since Spotify didn't boast about it too much. Spotify's Reign Spotify still leads the music streaming pantheon, continuously lording over its field competitors as it sits atop the space. Spotify claims that it has now reached 40 million users with a premium subscription, which is twice as much as Apple's 20 million. The Spotify app is a free download from the company's own site. For those still on the fence about Premium, Spotify does have a free tier service, although that comes with advertisements intercut between songs, and free users are locked into the service's shuffle mode. $9.99 per month throws all this away, alongside offering users to download the songs for offline listening, among other things. Spotify's direct competitor, Apple Music, was introduced in 2015, billed meant to oust Spotify and Google Play Music in their rank. It's built into the music app on iOS and iTunes, though some users have requested for a standalone app. Apple Music boasts a stellar music library, alongside similar pricing tiers with Spotify, which makes it a worthy competitor to the latter. Spotify App For Apple Watch And Apple TV? Several users have long been requesting for Spotify to release apps for other Apple devices, such as the Apple Watch and Apple TV, though Spotify has noted that support¬†for these aforementioned devices aren't slated any time soon, and Spotify hasn't exactly explained the reasoning behind prioritizing the two devices down in the pipeline. The update is available now for the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. For users who own a pair of AirPods, try listening to Spotify with them now and see if auto-pause works as described.

Nokia has confirmed that it'll be making its long-awaited return to the market, rumour has it that Microsoft will finally be debuting the so-called Surface Phone, and Samsung's Galaxy Note range looks set to make a comeback. We've rounded up the best smartphones you can expect to see in 2017. ¬† iPhone 8 With the next year's iPhone set to mark the 10th-anniversary of Apple's smartphone lineup, speculation is rife that the firm has something big in store. If these rumours are to be believed, Apple will skip the iPhone 7S in favour of the iPhone 8, which analysts are claiming will be the most radically redesigned iPhone yet with its 'all-glass' design and OLED screen. There's also talk that the iPhone 8 will be the first to support wireless charging and a Touch ID sensor embedded in its display, while ¬†an all-new "Pro" model is rumoured to pack to feature an S7 Edge-style curved display and dual camera setup.¬† Apple's so-called iPhone 8 is expected to debut in September 2017.¬† Samsung Galaxy S8 Samsung has confirmed that it's coming, and online leaks have revealed what we can expect from the Galaxy S8.¬† Following in the footsteps of Apple's iPhone, the Galaxy S8 will be the first smartphone to come with Samsung's own artificial intelligence (AI) assistant built in. That won't be its only similarity to the iPhone, as rumour has it that the Galaxy S8 will also dump the headphone jack, in favour of audio over USB-C. Further speculation points to a 2K-resolution AMOLED Edge display, baked-in IP68 certification, both fingerprint and iris scanners, Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 power and a dual rear-facing camera setup.¬† The Galaxy S8 likely will debut at Mobile World Congress in February.¬† Nokia P1 Nokia has confirmed that 2017 will be the year that it returns to the smartphone market, this time with Android-powered handsets in tow.¬† The Nokia P1 is tipped to be the firm's first high-end Android device,¬†and will reportedly offer IP68 water and dust resistance and be available in two sizes, 5.2in and 5.5in, each with QHD 2560x1440 AMOLED displays. With Android 7.0 on board, the Nokia P1 also looks set to arrive with support for Google's Daydream VR platform.¬† Nokia's P1 will launch in the first quarter of 2017.¬† Huawei P10 With this year's Huawei P9 selling more than nine million units, it's no surprise that Huawei is already planning a follow-up. While we don't yet know much about the so-called Huawei P10, speculation suggests that it will be the first to feature an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner, which will be faster and more accurate than current capacitive sensors. Leaked specs also point to a 5.5in QHD display with a Samsung-style curved variant, Leica dual-lens rear cameras, Huawei's own Kirin 960 chip and either 4GB or 6GB RAM. ¬† The Huawei P10 is expected to see an unveiling in April 2017.¬† OnePlus 4 The OnePlus 4 - which could arrive branded OnePlus 5 due to the fact that the number four is regarded as unlucky in Asia - is expected to be the highest-spec OnePlus smartphone yet. Details are thin, but rumours claim that the next-gen OnePlus will feature a high-end metal casing, housing a Snapdragon 835 processor and a 5.5in QHD display, improving on the Full HD screen seen on the OnePlus 3T. There's also talk of a whopping 8GB RAM, a 21MP or 23MP rear-facing camera, a 4,000mAh battery and Android 7.0 Nougat.¬† The OnePlus 4 is expected to launch in May or June next year. Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Given the fiery fiasco surrounding this year's now-defunct Galaxy Note 7, one thing's for sure about next year's release: it (probably) won't set on fire. Beyond that, we don't yet know much about the so-called Galaxy Note 8, although we can expect it to come with support for Samsung's S Pen stylus, a built-in iris scanner and a 5.7in display, with speculation pointing to a 4K resolution. Rumours also point to a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, and support for Google's Daydream VR platform.¬† Samsung's Galaxy Note 8 likely will debut in August 2017.¬† Surface Phone 2017 might be the year that Microsoft's elusive Surface Phone finally debuts as the firm looks to bolster its flailing share of the smartphone market. If speculation is to be believed, the Windows 10-powered Surface Phone¬†will be available in three versions; 4GB/128GB, 6GB/256GB and 8GB/512GB. All three devices are expected to pack USB-C ports, built-in fingerprint scanners and 5.7in AMOLED panels, while power is expected to be provided by Qualcomm.

By: Abhinaya Prabhu Updated: Monday, December 26, 2016, 10:39 [IST] Every year, Google shares the top searches made on its search engine as the year comes to an end. With just a week left in 2016, we have come up with a list of smartphone searches that were made on Google India over this year. It goes without any surprise that the affordable Rs. 251 priced smartphone called Freedom 251 by Ringing Bells is the most searched smartphone. But what's surprising is that this phone has bet even the most-anticipated flagship smartphone, Apple iPhone 7 in terms of search volume on Google.

This way, you will get to know the models that have created an interest among the Indian consumers. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Freedom 251 Ringing Bells' Freedom 251 created a lot of buzz in the smartphone arena earlier this year. The smartphone priced at Rs. 251 got millions of people order one for themselves without any suspicion of how they could get a smartphone at such a low price tag. Later, when the company failed to deliver its promises regarding the launch date, people started raising questions related to the shipping of the phone. Now there are claims that the company is shut down for good, but there are no confirmations as of now. Apple iPhone 7 The iPhone 7 emerges as the second most searched smartphone on Google among Indians. India is a significant market for Apple with a surge of 50 percent in the sales of iPhones of late in comparison to the previous year. With the numerous Galaxy Note 7 explosions everywhere, the iPhone 7 was preferred by many who seek a high-end flagship phone. Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 The Redmi Note 3 was the third smartphone, which was searched a lot by Indians. Ever since its launch, the Redmi Note 3 is one of the best-selling smartphones in the country. Lately, Xiaomi announced that it sold around 23 lakh units of the device in seven months of its launch, which is a notable record created by the Chinese mobile maker. Lenovo K4 Note Lenovo K4 Note has ranked fourth in the annual search rankings of Google India. The smartphone is an impressive budget offering in the country that has a vivid display, inbuilt VR technology, and a long-lasting battery. This smartphone is a value for money offering in the Indian market making it a good buy. Samsung Galaxy J7 Belonging to the Galaxy J lineup of smartphones, the Galaxy J7 is an attractive mid-range smartphone. This device has been one of the best sellers and it has grabbed the fifth position among the most searched smartphones in Google India. The positives of this phone include the support for 4G connectivity, long lasting battery life, and competitive price point. Moto G4 Undoubtedly, Moto G lineup has built a great user base across the world ever since it was launched, which was possible due to the affordable price tag of these smartphones. The Moto G4 launched in mid-2016 also carries these highlights and is a great seller in the mid-range smartphone market. This smartphone features all the much-needed aspects that a smartphone should have making it a good buy. OnePlus 3 This flagship killer smartphone priced competitively is the seventh most searched smartphone among Indians. This smartphone is packed with everything that a flagship smartphone should have and comes at half the price of Apple and Samsung phones making it a¬†great choice for the buyers. Eventually, there's no doubt that the OnePlus 3 occupied a place in the list of most searched phones. iPhone SE While the newly launched iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are way too expensive for many smartphone buyers in India, the iPhone SE launched earlier this year is a great buy. This smartphone comes with a much affordable price tag. Also, the many offers on iPhone SE provided by the e-commerce portals have interested those who want to own an iPhone, which is not too expensive. Google Pixel The Google Pixel smartphones are impressive ones in the market, but they did not make it to the top of the search results on Google India for many reasons. Google is claimed to have grabbed 10 percent of the market share in the premium smartphone segment of the country, but these phones are too expensive. Lenovo K5 Note The¬†Lenovo K5 Note is the third smartphone from the Chinese company to have occupied a position among the 10 most searched smartphones in Google India. Well, we say third including the Moto G4. Like the K4 Note, this one has also set a USP of delivering long lasting battery life and 4G connectivity despite the reasonable price tag.

They are: the department of industrial production and promotion, department of revenue and department of information and technology. (AFPs) Your iPhone and iPad might not get the made in India tag, just yet. Top sources in the government say that it is unlikely to further sweeten the deal for Apple to start manufacturing in India with its contract manufacturer Foxconn. Three departments within the Indian government are looking into Apple Inc‚Äôs demands for incentives. They are: the department of industrial production and promotion, department of revenue and department of information and technology. ‚ÄúApple has been looking for several duty and tax incentives for manufacturing handsets in India, but the government is unlikely to make any exception for one company,‚Äù said a top official in one of the departments mentioned above. Speaking to HT on conditions of anonymity, the official said that any exception for the iPhone manufacturer will defeat the purpose of an integrated policy such as Make-in-India. Apple wants more incentives from the government under the Make in India. The iPhone maker is in talks with the government for higher sops and benefits under the scheme, government sources told HT on conditions of anonymity. Local manufacturing will help Apple open retail stores in the country. Taiwan‚Äôs Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn), which makes Apple devices, has a manufacturing facility in southern India. ‚ÄúApple wants higher exemptions since there are not many high-end phone-component makers in India to buy from,‚Äù said another government official, who did not wish to be named. ‚ÄúThe company will have to manufacture the components in India, and it has to meet international standards.‚Äù Apple CEO Tim Cook has said that the company was looking at India as the next big market. Apple was not in India for a year or two, instead ‚Äú100s of years‚Äù, Cook said during his visit to India earlier in the year. HT‚Äôs mail to Apple has so far not received any response. The government already offers several initiatives, including differential duty structure, modified special incentive package scheme (MSIPS) and zero-duty on import of all components except adapters, batteries and headsets, for global and local manufacturers, under Make in India. Aimed at promoting electronic manufacturing, MSIPS provides capital subsidy of 20% in special economic zones (SEZs) and 25% in non-SEZs, in the form of reimbursement of excise for capital equipment. For high-capital investment projects, it also provides for reimbursement of central taxes and duties. Also, if a handset-manufacturer assembles phones locally, then it just pays a 1% duty, instead of the 12.5% on a phone that is imported. There is also a duty differential on battery, adapter and headsets. If a handset-maker purchases all these from domestic companies, it pays only 2%, instead of 12.5% when imported. However, Apple seems dissatisfied with such facilities. A person in the know of things said that India is now being compared to manufacturing destinations like Vietnam and China. ‚ÄúApple might want MSIPS to continue, freight subsidy as the country has logistical issues, continuation of differential duty on mobile handsets and components manufacturing even when the GST regime comes in and income tax holiday in the country just as China or Vietnam offers,‚Äù an industry expert told HT, adding that ‚Äúexports should be made a top priority by enhancing sops under merchandise exports from India scheme (MEIS) from 2% to 5%.‚Äù Earlier, the Tim Cook-led company had sought relaxation of local sourcing norms under the shield of ‚Äòstate-of-the-art and cutting edge‚Äô technology providers. A foreign brand looking to open single-brand retail stores in India is mandated to source 30% from Indian manufacturers for a minimum period of three years. ‚ÄúApple wants higher exemptions since there are not many high-end phone-component makers in India to buy from,‚Äù said a government official, who did not wish to be named. ‚ÄúThe company will have to manufacture the components in India, and it has to meet international standards.‚Äù tags Apple Foxconn Apple India Make-in-India DIPP more from tech Google pushes virtual reality harder with new phones from partners Jan 06, 2017 13:50 IST Forget TVs or VR, even phones!

The company is currently in production of its own Planet of the Apps TV show and had a small but notable presence at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year. Now, notable internet entrepreneur and Mega founder Kim Dotcom is predicting that Apple will purchase a Hollywood Studio in 2017. It‚Äôs not entirely clear where Dotcom is getting his information from at this point. He made the claim in a tweet and ended it with the hashtag ‚Äú#InsiderIntel,‚Äù but didn‚Äôt include any further details. Known for his hacking and espionage skills, it‚Äôs possible that Dotcom‚Äôs information is coming from inside a major studio, perhaps in a style similar to the massive Sony leak from last year. That‚Äôs purely speculation, though. Apple‚Äôs interest in the film industry has been a hot button issue in recent months. Earlier this year, it was reported¬†that Apple¬†had a ‚Äústrong but secretive‚Äù presence at the Sundance Film Festival. The company apparently spent its time at the festival meeting with ‚Äútriple A-list‚Äù talent to discuss building a lineup of original TV shows.¬†A more recent report claimed that¬†Apple has a ‚Äúquixotic and reserved‚Äù attitude about its original content plans as it has been hesitant to go all-in. On the other hand, Apple has been working more closely with Hollywood studios to bring movies to iTunes, even while they‚Äôre still in theaters. It‚Äôs these negotiations, paired with talks with content creators like at Sundance, that lend the most credibility to Dotcom‚Äôs claim that Apple will buy a major studio in 2017. At this point, take all of this with a grain of salt. It‚Äôs unclear where Dotcom received his ‚ÄòInsider Intel‚Äô from and he‚Äôs infamous for being at the more extreme end of the spectrum.

Trending in Apple Apple in 2017: What‚Äôs next for Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch & Apple TV this¬†year December 21, 2016 AAPL: 117.06 0.11 New profile sheds light on Apple‚Äôs push to switch to OLED displays with iPhone¬†8 Chance Miller - Dec. 21st 2016 4:58 pm PT @ChanceHMiller iPhone 8 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit It‚Äôs long been reported that Apple plans to switch to an OLED display with at least one iPhone model in 2017, with supply and production issues being the primary reason not to bring the technology to all models. This evening, Bloomberg¬†has published a new profile shedding more light on the production of OLED displays and how Apple‚Äôs inclusion of the technology largely depends on one supplier in the Japanese countryside‚Ä¶ The profile details Canon Tokki Corp., which employs 343 people and has been perfecting the manufacturing equipment needed to produce OLED displays for more than two decades. Canon Tokki Corp., surrounded by rice fields in the city of Mitsuke in Niigata prefecture, has a near monopoly on the machines capable of making screens with organic light-emitting diodes, which enable sharp, vibrant displays that use less energy. A unit of Canon Inc., the company of 343 employees has spent more than two decades perfecting the manufacturing equipment used by OLED screen makers. Despite doubling output in 2016, however, Canon Tokki is facing a growing backlog of orders heading into 2017. The current wait for one of the machines, which costs around $85 million, is two years. The company currently is facing demand from suppliers such as Samsung Display, LG Display, and Sharp. CEO¬†Teruhisa Tsugami explained to Bloomberg that the demand will keep up for at least the next three years. ‚ÄúWe are doing all we can to increase output and make that wait shorter,‚Äù said Chief Executive Officer Teruhisa Tsugami, adding that demand from display makers, including Samsung Display Co., LG Display Co. and Sharp Corp., will remain strong for the next three years. Canon Tokki is responsible for nearly all of the machines that build OLED displays and its current annual output capacity is less than 10 units. Each machine is essentially a vacuum production line at 328 feet long. ‚ÄúGlass panels, roughly the size of a large TV screen, are propelled by robotic arms through several chambers. Red, green and blue pixels are¬†deposited on the surface by evaporating organic materials,‚Äù describes Bloomberg. Regarding the next iPhone specifically, today‚Äôs report reiterates that Apple hopes to ship at least one iPhone model with an OLED¬†screen next year and that Samsung is on track to be the sole¬†supplier. Due to low yield rates and high demand, however, there are still doubts about production capacity. The full profile can be read on Bloomberg and is really interesting, even without the iPhone 8 details. It‚Äôs kind of wild to think that the fate of the next-generation iPhone at least partially depends on one small, relatively unheard of company in Japan.

The announcement came as part of the App Transport Security feature in iOS 9. This evening, however, Apple announced that it is extending the deadline for developers to make the switch to HTTPS connectivity‚Ä¶ In a post on its developer website, Apple stated that it is giving developers more time to support App Transport Security and thus extending the deadline. At this point, however, Apple has not announced the new deadline: App Transport Security (ATS), introduced in iOS 9 and OS X v10.11, improves user security and privacy by requiring apps to use secure network connections over HTTPS. At WWDC 2016 we announced that apps submitted to the App Store will be required to support ATS at the end of the year. To give you additional time to prepare, this deadline has been extended and we will provide another update when a new deadline is confirmed. Despite being introduced with iOS 9, App Transport Security was not required for developers to use and in many cases, it wasn‚Äôt used. For instance, not long after the feature was announced, Google offered developers code to disable the feature and¬†continue serving ads. We‚Äôll be sure to keep you updated on the new deadline Apple imposes on developers for¬†supporting¬†HTTPS server connectivity.

Taps to the wrist could then be delivered by the band rather than the Watch. Apple specifically cites space-saving as the benefit of the invention ‚Ä¶ Many portable electronic devices continue to decrease in size while the number of uses and functions of the electronic devices can remain the same or increase. For example, some cellular phones and digital music players are contained within small and compact housings that include electronic circuits and components that provide a user with a wide range of applications and functions. Space can therefore be an issue when including or adding additional components, circuits, and functions to a portable electronic device. Although Apple does the usual patent thing of keeping the language as general as possible, referring to ‚Äòportable electronic devices‚Äô rather than smartwatches specifically, frequent reference to ‚Äòband‚Äô as well as the patent drawings make it abundantly clear that the company has the Apple Watch in mind. A system includes a band, an attachment mechanism attached to the band, and one or more haptic devices included in the attachment mechanism. The attachment mechanism can attach the band to an electronic device. Additionally or alternatively, the attachment mechanism can attach the band to a wearer. The haptic device or devices are in communication with a processing device. At least one of the one or more haptic devices produces a haptic response based on an activation signal received from the processing device. Signals from the Watch to the band would be transmitted via a connector within the slot attaching the band. Although the Apple Watch is not especially thick by the standards of other smartwatches and, indeed, many conventional watches, the design does make it look quite chunky on the wrist. Anything Apple can do to slim it down is likely to boost appeal among more fashion-focused customers. The one downside, of course, is that it would limit third-party band options, and make bands more expensive.

Withings, for those who don't know, was acquired by Nokia in April 2016 for $191 million. Further, Withings is a French consumer electronic company famous for manufacturing digital health products such as blood pressure monitors, fitness trackers etc. As per the report by MacRumours, all the products from Withings are no longer available on the Apple Store. Last week, Nokia filed the patent lawsuit in Germany and US, however, it is believed that the Finland-originated company has now filed a lawsuit for about 40 patents across 11 nations including UK, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, France etc. Just after filing the lawsuit, Nokia released a statement saying - "Since agreeing a license covering patents from the Nokia Technologies portfolio in 2011, Apple has declined subsequent offers made by Nokia to license other of its patented inventions which are used by many of Apple's products," In response, Apple's spokesperson, Josh Rosenstock said - "We've always been willing to pay a fair price to secure the rights of patents covering technology in our products," "Unfortunately, Nokia has refused to license their patents on a fair basis and is now using the tactics of a patent troll to attempt to extort money from Apple by applying a royalty rate to Apple's own inventions they had nothing to do with." Coming back to Withings, this is not the first time Apple has done something like this. As reported by 9to5Mac, Apple had previously pulled down Bose products when it entered into a patent dispute with Beats. Beats Electronics, formerly known as Beats by Dr. Dre was acquired by Apple in 2014 after which the company acts as Apple's subsidiary. Interestingly, only after Beats and Bose settled the dispute for an undisclosed amount, Apple re-introduced Bose products to its store.

With the impending release of Microsoft?s Surface Pro 5, it may face tougher sales as many begin to realize the Surface Pro?s potentials. According to the Microsoft blog, more and more people are switching to the Surface Pro by the day. Some even preferring Microsoft?s tablet in comparison to the MacBook Pro 2016. Because of this, Apple would need to find a new avenue to explore when it comes to the iPad Pro 2. By offering the usual hardware upgrade with the same style and features, Apple is not doing itself a favor. In fact, many consumers are now finding Apple?s products boring and lack inspiration. What the tech giant needs is a plausible and marketable design feature for the upcoming iPad Pro 2. READ ALSO: Apple iPad Pro 2 Specs, Release Date: Apple Will Unveil the iPad Pro 2 with iPhone 8 Rumor has it that the upcoming tablet from Apple will feature a built-in keyboard; very much unlike its predecessor. Instead of having the keyboard as a separate hardware, Apple, it seems, is planning to have it fully integrated. While this may sound weird to some, it is probably a welcomed addition to the tablet. iPad Pro (via apple.com) A recent post from Chinese micro-blogging site, Weibo, indicates that an aluminium shell is spotted from one of Apple?s suppliers. According to the said post, this chassis has a sort of cavitation that alludes having a built-in keyboard. While this sort of rumor should be taken with a grain of salt, perhaps there is still some truth to it. READ ALSO: Delta Emulator: Play Pokemon and Other Games on iPhone Without Jailbreaking It A few weeks ago, Japanese blogging site, Macotakara, reported that the iPad Pro 2 will be thicker than its predecessor. In fact, the blog even said that it will be thicker by three millimeters. This report is somewhat aligning itself with the newer leak about the in-built keyboard. If the chassis includes a keyboard in it, it does seem plausible that it will be thicker than usual. However, as mentioned earlier, these are just rumors. Nevertheless, rumors from sources like Macotakara sometimes come true, as shown by its leaks for the iPhone 7?s earphone jack-less design. READ ALSO: Apple Shifting More to Mobile Devices, Neglecting iMac and Mac Pro Whether these rumors are true or not, only time will tell. In a few months, Apple may be releasing the iPad Pro 2 in the market. If all goes well, consumers maybe seeing their favourite tablet with an in-built keyboard right out of the box. Until then, all that can be done is to wait for its impending release. For more updates on the iPad Pro 2, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

It is expected to be the latest iPad Pro 3 and its rumored specs are indeed interesting. So, here are the speculations about the device that you need to know. Although Apple has not released an official announcement yet about creating a new tablet, there are already speculations about it on the web. According to reports, it could possibly be an iPad Pro 3 or a refreshed iPad Pro 2. Whatever it is, here are the specs you should expect to be included on it. Based on reports, Apple should be upgrading the iPad Pro line the same way it did with the iPhone series. Should that be the case, then the device will be using the new A10X chip similar to the existing processor of the iPhone 7. It is the chip that Apple designed by combining high-power and low-power cores. Also read: Apple iPad Pro 2 Release Date in March with 3 Variants? Moreover, these cores can be activated depending on the difficulty of the task. Trusted Reviews reported that if it is an easy job, lower-power cores will do the job to save battery life. Also, iPad Pro 3 is expected to have larger storage space as compared to only the 2- and the 4GB models. It might sport a whopping 512GB internal memory if speculations are going to be precise. Furthermore, the upcoming iPad is said to have a 10.5-inch model with AMOLED displays. As of now, Apple is using standard LCD panels with LED backlight. This move of moving to AMOLED displays is somehow logical especially knowing that Samsung is already using OLED screens. This move will as well help the device in reducing power consumption. Also read: Apple iPhone 7, 7 Plus Christmas Deals You Shouldn?t Miss It can be recalled that the Cupertino-based company also introduced a dual-camera configuration on the iPhone 7 Plus. As a result, there are speculations that it will as well be applied on the upcoming premium iPad. Plus, a Touch ID fingerprint and a 3D Touch display could also be on the device as Apple scraps the Home button. With regards to the release of the new iPad, it is said to be some time in 2017. Although there are speculations that it could arrive early next year, consumers should not expect it as Apple has not confirmed it yet. How about you? When do you think the iPad Pro 3 will hit the market? Are these specs good enough for a premium iPad? Share your thoughts in the comment section below.

Apple's products are notoriously pricey, so if you've been waiting weeks to buy a new iPhone or iPad then this is your chance. The American tech giant was a bit stingy earlier this year on Black Friday, and it doesn't look like they're slashing much for Boxing Day either. However, several other UK shops are cutting the price of various Apple gadgets - so if you're quick there are some deals to be had. These are the ones that have caught our eye. If you spot any yourself that we haven't covered, feel free to mention it in the comments section below. iPhone 7 iPhone 7 Read More iPhone 7 review: More evolution than revolution Carphone Warehouse is dropping the price of a 32GB iPhone 7 on a 24-month contract. It's now available for ¬£79.99 upfront on a ¬£32 per month contract on Vodafone. That nets you 500MB of data per month and a saving of ¬£200. Alternatively, you can bag Apple's latest smartphone on Tesco Mobile, which is cutting its contract price from ¬£60.25 to ¬£56.25 each month for 24 months. That gets you a saving of ¬£96 and includes 5,000 minutes, 5,000 texts and a stonking 20GB of data each month. Mobiles.co.uk is also offering a decent iPhone 7 deal, giving you unlimited calls and texts and 5GB of data for ¬£34 a month. The handset has a ¬£150 upfront cost and it comes locked to Vodafone's network. iPad iPad Mini (Photo: Getty) UK network EE are offering an upfront saving of ¬£100 on an Apple iPad mini 2. It's available on the 24-month 20GB data per month 4GEE Max Plan. Currys are also dropping ¬£20 off the 32GB iPad Mini 2, bringing it down to ¬£239. MacBook Pro Apple logo (Photo: PA) Argos are dropping ¬£50 off the price of a 13-inch MacBook Pro with 4GB of RAM and a 256GB hard drive. It's now on sale for ¬£949. Apple Watch (Photo: REUTERS) You can get a 38mm sport version of the original Apple Watch ¬£60 cheaper at Argos thanks to the Boxing Day sales. It comes with a silver case and white band. The smartwatch has been knocked down from ¬£259 to ¬£199, saving you ¬£60. There are a few other Apple Watch deals on Argos' site, but this is the best one.

With so many lists out there, who has time to read all of them? Turns out: We do. But because you probably don't, we rounded up all the Top 10 lists we could find, smashed 'em together, and spit out overall Top 10 lists for the year's best¬†albums, songs, books and movies. You're welcome.¬† The Best Albums of 2016 10. Car Seat Headrest ‚Äî 'Teens Of Denial'¬† SPOTIFY / GOOGLE PLAY / APPLE MUSIC "Here was some of the year's most surefire guitar alchemy, full of revolving riffs and lyrics that flashed insights, slogans and jokes so quickly it erased any difference between them.... Like Nirvana building quiet and explosiveness into the same space, Car Seat Headrest knows how to be intimate and epic at the same time."¬†[Rolling Stone] ¬† 9. Angel Olsen ‚Äî 'My Woman'¬† SPOTIFY / GOOGLE PLAY / APPLE MUSIC "There‚Äôs a sturdy confidence within her that launches her songwriting to the next level, full of well-produced solos and goosebump-inducing howls, and it all stems from the conscious choice to strive for a better feeling. Angel Olsen has always been an artist of hidden complexities. My Woman is just the album that makes that visible to the public."¬†[Consequence of Sound]¬† ¬† 8. Kanye West ‚Äî 'The Life Of Pablo' SPOTIFY / GOOGLE PLAY / APPLE MUSIC "'Pablo' is messy. It‚Äôs not a statement album; it doesn‚Äôt have the heft of 'MBDTF,' or the tight, furious control of 'Yeezus.' Instead, it‚Äôs an album of rough edges filled with second guesses, an album where the strangest things reach out to grab you. And, above all else, it‚Äôs an album of moments. Chance the Rapper‚Äôs star turn on 'Ultralight Beam,' the drop in 'Father, Stretch My Hands Pt. 1,' the meme-as-song 'I Love Kanye' ‚Äî they‚Äôre among the most memorable instants of 2016." [Complex] ¬† 7. Radiohead ‚Äî 'A Moon Shaped Pool' SPOTIFY / GOOGLE PLAY / APPLE MUSIC "Collectively, 'A Moon Shaped Pool' proves that Radiohead has resumed its greatest winning streak in modern popular music. Not by flaunting any new tricks‚Äîjust by delivering their normal quota of catharsis." [Paste] ¬† 6. A Tribe Called Quest ‚Äî 'We got it from Here... Thank You 4 Your Service' SPOTIFY / GOOGLE PLAY / APPLE MUSIC "In a year of surprise releases, Tribe delivered a truly unexpected and essential modern classic that eviscerated all expectations, and will always be remembered and appreciated by us as a bright light in a dark and fucked up year." [Gorilla vs Bear]¬† ¬† 5. Solange ‚Äî 'A Seat At The Table' SPOTIFY / GOOGLE PLAY / APPLE MUSIC "Pop‚Äôs principal black female artists released statement projects in 2016 ‚Äî Beyonc√©, Rihanna, Alicia Keys ‚Äî but it was Solange who quietly anchored the conversation, with an album that arrived as a gift. In a year when emotional stability seemed largely elusive and darkness persisted, dragging us with it, Solange offered a timeless salve in the form of group therapy." [Spin] ¬† 4. Chance The Rapper ‚Äî 'Coloring Book' SPOTIFY / GOOGLE PLAY / APPLE MUSIC "In trying times, Chance the Rapper released the most optimistic album of the year, filled with honesty, confidence, and lush choir-and-horns compositions. This is the gospel-rap album Kanye never made." [Esquire] ¬† 3. Frank Ocean ‚Äî 'Blonde' SPOTIFY / GOOGLE PLAY / APPLE MUSIC "Although this is a sprawling project that seems to touch on every cultural cornerstone of what it's like to be alive in 2016, it still somehow feels and acts focused, confident in its ability to answer questions while still posing even more." [Noisey] Frank Ocean - 'Nikes' from DoBeDo Productions on Vimeo. ¬† ¬† 2. David Bowie ‚Äî 'Blackstar'¬† SPOTIFY / GOOGLE PLAY / APPLE MUSIC "'Blackstar'... is far from a funeral dirge... Rather, it‚Äôs a lively, inventive, wryly accepting rage against the dying of the light, a grand finale that takes the experimentalism of his vaunted Berlin years, the avant-garde stateliness of Scott Walker, and some shuffled fragments of random, contemporary inspirations like Kendrick Lamar, Death Grips, and Boards Of Canada, then filters them through a dizzying, electro-jazz sheen and explodes them, making for a sonically adventurous album that proves Bowie was always one step ahead ‚Äî where he‚Äôll now remain in perpetuity." [AV Club] ¬† ¬† 1. Beyonc√© ‚Äî 'Lemonade' APPLE MUSIC "'Lemonade' is brilliant on so many levels it‚Äôs hard to keep track. Separately, the songs are excellent, each one assembling a different subcommittee of experts and bending them to the will of one visionary talent. Together they are a monument to diversity within unity: swaggering rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll, sleek dance-pop, gospel piano balladry, deconstructed dancehall, foot-stomping country, futurist R&B, all of it somehow of a piece." [Stereogum] ¬† Honorable Mention 11. Bon Iver ‚Äî '22, A Million' Spotify / Google Play / Apple Music 12. Mitski ‚Äî 'Puberty 2'¬† Spotify / Google Play / Apple Music 13. Anderson .Paak ‚Äî 'Malibu'¬† Spotify / Google Play /¬†Apple Music More The 10 Best Songs of 2016 The 10 Best Books of 2016 The 10 Best Movies of 2016 A Note On Methodology We wish we could say there was a super fancy algorithm that combed the internet and did this for us.

Anything the company does seems to have that Midas touch that lesser companies seek to emulate in their product portfolio. Usually, the precedents that Apple sets are good: Touchscreens became usable after the iPhone, all-metal laptops and phones became a thing, fingerprint sensors have replaced passwords and more. In 2016, however, Apple set some precedents that, frankly, scare the life out of me. R.I.P. headphone jack Apple‚Äôs disaster of a MacBook Pro has somehow managed to push its killing of the headphone jack from our minds. But lest we forget, Apple did kill it. Citing ‚Äúcourage‚Äù for this silly decision, Apple decided that pulling the perfectly functional, completely unobtrusive and absolutely essential headphone jack from the iPhone 7 was a good idea. Here‚Äôs A Secret Hack To Get The Headphone Jack On The IPhone 7 https://t.co/w7Lkj4ZTao ‚Äî Write Elevated (@WriteElevated) December 22, 2016 Apple only commands about 17 percent of the smartphone market, but if you thought this crime would be limited to the iPhone, you‚Äôd be wrong. LeEco and Lenovo pre-emptively pulled the headphone jack from their phones just for the PR. Samsung is also rumoured to kill off the jack in their upcoming Galaxy S8 flagship and I don‚Äôt doubt that other manufacturers will soon follow suit. Lesser names like OnePlus are sensible enough to see the value of the jack, promising never to remove it, but there‚Äôs no way to ensure that anyone else will see sense. We‚Äôre in for a 3.5mm jack-less future, and only because Apple thinks that a ‚ÄúTaptic engine‚Äù is more important than convenience. Shame on you, Apple. Welcome to dongle-hell As mentioned earlier, I think the MacBook Pro is a disaster, and here‚Äôs why: Apple removed every, useful port and replaced it with Thunderbolt over USB-C. Apple‚Äôs fastest growing product category. pic.twitter.com/d1sel4N5Yc ‚Äî Drew Breunig (@dbreunig) October 28, 2016 Two years hence, such a decision might make sense. Today, the USB-C marketplace is a mess of poorly designed, uncertified products. Worse, you need dongles to connect anything to the new MacBook Pros. Anything. You want to connect your iPhone? Dongle. Want to connect a hard disk? Dongle. Want to connect an SD card? Dongle. Want to connect a projector? Dongle. Want to connect your TV? Dongle. Want to connect your mouse? Dongle. This is what ‚Äúcourage‚Äù looks like. Thank you #Apple pic.twitter.com/fg5CwZEFpx ‚Äî Troy Osinoff (@yo) December 19, 2016 That‚Äôs not good design. That‚Äôs sheer laziness. When did ‚ÄúPro‚Äù become ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù? Another quibble I have is that Apple‚Äôs redefined who a ‚Äúpro‚Äù is. A pro is a professional. They need the best of the best of the best, a system that works fast and efficiently. What a pro doesn‚Äôt need is a mainstream laptop that‚Äôs pretending to be a professional one. both the 13‚Ä≥ and the 15‚Ä≥ are capped at 16 GB of RAM. this is unbelievable. ‚Äî Adrian Kosmaczewski (@akosma) October 27, 2016 Since when did the iPad replace the PC? Why should he settle for a dual-core i5 with a low-end GPU when he can get a powerful Windows laptop for half the price? What‚Äôs a video editor got to do with 3-year old hardware? What‚Äôs a game developer to do with just 16GB RAM? You‚Äôre living in a different world, Apple. Size-zero is the only size In its blind quest to make devices ever thinner and with its newfound ‚Äúcourage‚Äù, Apple has thrown all semblance of caution to the winds. The new MacBook Pro is just as fast as the old one, is thinner and lighter, sells with fewer usable ports, dumps the superb MagSafe connector, has a much smaller battery and is much more expensive. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only going to work for a couple of hours tonight, kid.‚Äù ‚ÄúJust like the battery in my new MacBook Pro!‚Äù pic.twitter.com/CnOMae1yqb ‚Äî not Jony Ive (@JonyIveParody) December 24, 2016 That‚Äôs a rather bizarre combination of features by any measure. And why? To shave 3mm from the thickness of last year‚Äôs model? That‚Äôs just daft. I‚Äôd rather have a larger battery and working USB ports, thank you very much. In its quest for slimness, Apple has also started soldering down everything in its new laptops. No more upgradeable RAM or even HDD for you. Nothing. If your disk fails, you replace your motherboard (including CPU and RAM). The problem is that manufacturers are now falling over themselves to make even thinner, even more compromised products just because they feel they should. I can‚Äôt Esc The Escape key (Esc) is one of the most essential keys on any keyboard and it doesn‚Äôt seem to have occurred to Apple that removing it is a bad idea. It‚Äôs like removing the reverse gear on your car and dumping its functionality on a HUD under the speedometer. It‚Äôs perfectly possible to work without that key, as is reversing a car without a dedicated gear position, but it‚Äôs not practical. New Macbook arrived. No escape key, no charging led, new power supplies, adapters everywhere. Whee! ‚Äî matt blaze (@mattblaze) November 19, 2016 Wait! There must be a dongle for that, right? There‚Äôs no #escape for the Macbook‚Äôs escape key‚úñÔ∏è pic.twitter.com/fMHs655KEk ‚Äî Iana_Vassileva (@Iana_Vassileva) October 29, 2016 How long will it be, do you think, before someone decides to do this on a Windows laptop as well? Not long, I think. Removing the function keys and replacing them with a TouchBar is still more tolerable. Given the rest of my complaints, this last is a bit petty, I admit, but this is something I‚Äôd be fine with on a mainstream product like the MacBook or the MacBook Air, not on the Pro.

Apple has been ruling over the laptop market for years with its MacBook range. At the same time, Microsoft has also managed to sweep in with the biggest challenge to Apple‚Äôs authority in the recent years. However, the market dominance appears to be changing gradually. Apparently, many MacBook Pro users have made the switch to Microsoft‚Äôs Surface Pro. Microsoft in a recent announcement said that the month of November has been its best when it comes to the sales of its Surface Pro computers. ¬†"More people are switching from Macs to Surface than ever before.¬†Our trade-in program for MacBooks was our best ever, and the combination of excitement for the innovation of Surface coupled with the disappointment of the new MacBook Pro ‚Äî especially among professionals ‚Äî is leading more and more people to make the switch to Surface, like this," says Microsoft in a¬†blog post. "It seems like a new review recommending Surface over MacBook comes out daily. This makes our team so proud, because it means we're doing good work." This certainly isn‚Äôt a good news for Apple especially given the experimental change that the company has brought with MacBook Pro 2016 models that come without an SD card slot and other key hardware features used by professionals. ‚ÄúAs you can see, we‚Äôre proud of the momentum and progress we are making with our Surface line-up,‚Äù the post continued. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre learning a ton from Surface and Surface Hub customers and have an amazing team of hardware and software engineers dedicated to continually improving our products. You should expect the best and we expect to give you the best, today and tomorrow. We will continue to create new experiences for you that will change the way you create, collaborate and have an impact on your world in 2017 and beyond,‚Äù the blog concluded.

Image: Reuters. 6 By tech2 News Staff /¬† 26 Dec 2016 , 13:48 The fight between Apple and Nokia is turning ugly, which shows a major disagreement between the two companies over patents used in smartphones and tablets. Apple‚Äôs existing patent agreement with Nokia is about to lapse at the end of the year. As the deadline approached, Apple filed an antitrust case against Nokia, and Nokia responded with a patent infringement lawsuit. The legal battle sent Nokia shares tumbling. When Nokia announced that it had sued Apple, Ilkka Rahnasto, head of Patent Business at Nokia, said, ‚ÄúThrough our sustained investment in research and development, Nokia has created or contributed to many of the fundamental technologies used in today‚Äôs mobile devices, including Apple products. After several years of negotiations trying to reach agreement to cover Apple‚Äôs use of these patents, we are now taking action to defend our rights.‚Äù In a statement to Recode, Apple said ‚ÄúWe respect intellectual property and we‚Äôve always been willing to pay a fair price to secure the rights of patents covering technology in our products. Unfortunately, Nokia has refused to license their patents on a fair basis and is now using the tactics of a patent troll to attempt to extort money from Apple by applying a royalty rate to Apple‚Äôs own inventions they had nothing to do with.‚Äù The Withings Body Cardio Scale, one of the products pulled from Apple Stores. Image: Withings. Apple has pulled Withings products from Apple stores. Withings is a company that makes digital health products including blood pressure monitors and fitness trackers. Nokia had acquired Withings in April 2016, for¬†$191 million. Withings products such as the Body Cardio Scale, the Smart Body Analyzer, and a Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor are no longer available on Apple Stores or on the Apple web site, according to a report in Macrumours. Bose had sued Beats over noise cancellation patents. This is not the first time Apple has resorted to removing the products of competition from Apple Stores. 9to5Mac points out that Apple had previously used similar tactics when Beats and Bose¬†had disagreements over an exclusive NFL contract, and were involved in a patent spat. Bose and Beats agreed to settle the patent dispute for an undisclosed amount, and Bose products were re-introduced to the Apple Stores. After initially filing patent lawsuits in Germany and the US, Nokia expanded the patent litigation¬†in Europe and Asia. Nokia is suing Apple in Finland, UK, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, France, Hong Kong and Japan. There are 40 patents under suit now, across 11 countries.

Not this year. Consumer Reports, the product and review publication, said Thursday that its lab testing of three MacBook Pro models showed lackluster battery life and for the first time, it cannot recommend the product. Since it went on sale last month, the MacBook Pro has elicited consumer complaints about battery life on Apple‚Äôs online forum. The laptops are supposed to have 10 hours of battery life, but some users found that they could only use the device for three hours before having to recharge. ‚ÄúI ran the battery down in 3 hours last night only browsing the web,‚Äù posted one user. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt watching videos, just browsing. Is there something wrong with my laptop?‚Äù Related Articles January 5, 2017 Heard at CES 2017: T-Mobile‚Äôs CEO disses Dish during CES media event January 4, 2017 CES 2017: Useful or just bizarre, here are 4 new internet of things products January 4, 2017 Spotted at CES 2017: A gadget to protect your internet-of-things home January 2, 2017 Facebook virtual-reality tour makes immersive stop at Denver airport January 2, 2017 Savings app Upside pits gas stations against one another For its test, Consumer Reports bought three MacBook Pros from a retail store ‚Äì the 13-inch model that comes with Apple‚Äôs new Touch Bar, a 13-inch model without the Touch Bar, and a 15-inch model. The products‚Äô prices range from $1,500 to $2,800. Consumer Reports found inconsistent battery life. For example, the 13-inch model with the Touch Bar ran for 16 hours in the first trial and 12.75 hours in the second. By the third trial, it lasted just 3.75 hours. The same pattern was noted in the 13-inch model without the Touch Bar ‚Äî 19.5 hours in one trial but 4.5 hours in the next. And again with the 15-inch model, for which battery life ranged from 8 to 18.5 hours. Laptop battery life typically varies about 5 percent from one trial to another, the publication said. Why should this matter? Consumer Reports points out that the MacBook Pro series did well very well in other measures such as display quality and performance. But when it comes to laptops, not only does battery life matter but predictable battery life matters. A person using a computer on the go needs to have a sense of how long it will be before the device needs to be plugged into a power source. Consumer Reports said it contacted Apple and shared its research.The MacBook maker told the publication that ‚Äúany customer who has a question about their Mac or its operation should contact AppleCare.‚Äù Tags:¬† Apple consumer news More Business News The Mercury News Click for Digital & Home Delivery - 50% blog comments powered by Disqus More in Tech+ Heard at CES 2017: T-Mobile‚Äôs CEO disses Dish during CES media event January 06, 2017, 7:56 am The CEO of T-Mobile predicted that Douglas County‚Äôs Dish Network won‚Äôt be Dish anymore by the end of 2017 ‚Äî and he shared that notion with the crowd gathered for the company‚Äôs press conference at the Consumer Electronics Show.

Reuters/Robert Galbraith If latest reports are to be believed, Apple is not ready to take a break from the desktop segment. The Apple iMac 2017 is very much in the pipeline along with some great other Macs. Apple has been a winner in the smartphone segment with every one of its iPhones setting new records. Now that Microsoft has released its Surface Studio in October, the competition is stronger than ever before. As per a report on Fortune, Apple CEO Tim Cook has responded to concerns over the Mac line of products. Cook has told fans not to worry and also adding that amazing desktops are on the company‚Äôs roadmap. Cook reportedly did not reveal anything else about the desktops, including the iMac 2017 or when these will be unveiled. However, he did say that desktops still play a very important role in Apple‚Äôs business. ‚ÄúThe desktop is very strategic for us. It‚Äôs unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop‚Äîthe largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people,‚Äù Cook wrote an Apple employee discussion board, confirmed by Tech Crunch. Apple did hold a very Mac-specific event in October where the Cupertino-based tech giant only released a MacBook Pro featuring a Touch Bar just above the keyboard. The Apple iMac 2017 was not even mentioned then. Fans were left thoroughly frustrated as they were all expecting a brand new iMac all-in-one desktop, new Mac Mini and a high-end Mac Pro. Analysts and shareholders are pretty concerned about the Mac business. There has been a 17 percent decline in fiscal fourth quarter revenues, ending Sept. 24. Apple generated US$5.7 billion (AU$7.92 billion approx) in revenue and unit sales were down 14% to 4.9 million. In the fiscal third quarter, Mac revenue fell 13% and unit sales dropped by 11% year over year. Stay updated on IBT AU for more updates on the Apple iMac 2017 and other Mac products.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Industry¬† ‚ãÆ ¬†Mobile¬† ‚ãÆ ¬†Report iPhone 8 Sporting an OLED Display Depends Heavily on a Brand New Supplier By Omar Sohail Posted Dec 22, 2016 12Shares Share Tweet Submit Though Samsung has reportedly been tapped by Apple to be the chief supplier of the iPhone 8‚Äôs flexible OLED panels, mass incorporation of the display will also require the intervention of another supplier that resides in Japan. Canon Tokki Has a Near-Monopoly on Machines That Make OLED Panels ‚Äì iPhone 8 Could Benefit Greatly With a Brand New Partnership Canon Tokki and its 343 employees have spent more than two decades in perfecting the machinery that it takes to make OLED panels. According to a report from Bloomberg, Canon Tokki is having production backlog problems even after doubling output during 2016, meaning that the manufacturer has to cover up for several clients. With Apple entering into the fold, the company might not be able to cover up production, especially since the company sells more iPhones than any other manufacturer in a given quarter. In addition, if Canon Tokki wanted to acquire a new machine for greater output, it would take at least two years to make and cost about $85 million, and time is a luxury that Apple does not have on its hands right now. Chief Executive Officer Teruhisa Tsugami has said that the manufacturer is doing all it can to reduce the total waiting time: ‚ÄúWe are doing all we can to increase output and make that wait shorter.‚Äù Advertisement Apple was also reported to partner with LG Display for the production of flexible OLED panels; the company is attempting to have as many suppliers in the OLED production game as possible as their numbers will greatly influence whether or not the upcoming iPhone 8 will sport the new display. Additionally, it will also give Apple greater control as far as pricing negotiations are concerned. iPhone 6s Battery Issues Are Being Investigated by South Korean Authorities Apple has been using traditional LCD displays on its iPhones for quite some time and the introduction of OLED will mean that the manufacturer will have greater control on how to design its future phones. With iPhone 8 expected to feature a huge design overhaul, the flexible OLED panel will greatly contribute to this factor, due to the fact that the flexible plastic allows for a wider variety of shapes. It appears that Apple is attempting to snare as many suppliers as possible in its quest to make its iPhone 8 the game-changing smartphone of 2017. Do you believe Apple will be able to achieve this goal? Tell us your thoughts in the comments below.

Ever since their unveiling in September, the AirPods have been eagerly anticipated but repeatedly delayed. However, if you are thinking about getting a pair, you need to keep in mind the earphones are probably irreparable. iFixit, a website known for dismantling smartphones and accessories down to their basic components has¬†torn down the AirPods and found the earphones are not just irreparable, but that they may also be unrecyclable ‚Äî going against the Apple tradition of creating devices that don‚Äôt end up as e-waste. iFixit has given AirPods a reparability score of zero, a score it has given to very few devices in the past. It also claims¬†the AirPods are poorly constructed ‚Äî accessing any component of the device is impossible without destroying its outer casing. The reliance on glue to hold together the internal components is also an obstacle in repairing the earphones. Related Stories How Not To Lose Your AirPods: Apple's Wireless Earbuds Fit Into Earring Holes? Apple's AirPods Can Catch Fire If Not Recycled Properly ‚ÄúAs we begin to pull out the boards, cables, and other bits, we're reminded of a certain wearable repair nightmare. If jamming complex components into a small form factor and sealing it with a copious amount of glue were a game, Apple would be winning ... What remains in the earbud is a hot mess of cables and adhesive,‚Äù iFixit said. The website also found gaps in soldering, something that Apple was particular not to have in its earlier products. From all indications, it seems the earphones were rushed to market rather than being properly worked on. Apple has said it will offer new replacement AirPods for $99 if you lose your pair, but in case you damage¬†them, the only alternative seems to be purchasing new ones. In case you are thinking about an alternative, you can still get a 3.5-mm adapter and use the¬†iPhone 7/7 Plus with regular headphones.

A look at the best of this year‚Äôs bowl gifts SUNDAY, DEC. 25, 2016, 9:55 P.M. By Joe Reedy Associated Press Twitter Facebook ¬†Email ¬†Reddit ¬†SMS If coming up with the perfect present during the holidays for one person is stressful, try doing it for 250. That is the annual task that faces those trying to select the ideal gift package for college bowl participants. Most games try to avoid giving away the same thing. Most have watches, backpacks and hats but when it comes to the big gifts this is where the real competition begins. TOP GIFTS (NON-GIFT SUITE) For the 16 games that choose not to have gift suites, there are some interesting choices this year. Here are the top five: Apple Watch Nike + (Alamo Bowl): This is the only game that has announced it has the popular smartwatch as one of its gifts. Rick Hill, the game‚Äôs vice president of marketing, said they went up to the last-minute to make its decision and was in constant contact with Nike to make sure they could get them. While most companies offer a discount on bulk items, that is not the case with Apple watches, which have a retail value between $349-399. Finrod‚Äôs Festive Wear (Armed Forces Bowl): Brant Ringler, the bowl‚Äôs executive director, said he got the idea two years ago when he saw Illinois arrive in Texas for bowl preparations wearing ugly holiday sweaters. This year there are two colors, red and blue. Both feature the game‚Äôs sponsor‚Äôs logo, an F-35 jet, footballs and a goal post. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know if it was still popular but last week I was out and saw seven college kids wearing ugly sweaters and another in ugly suit. It is nice to see the trend continuing,‚Äù Ringler said. Red, inflatable ‚Äúbig-lazy‚Äù (Arizona Bowl): The Tucson-based game is only two years old but is developing a reputation for unique gifts. Last year it was a pair of Cowtown custom cowboy boots where each team had its own fitting sessions. The boots aren‚Äôt one of the gifts this year but the inflatable couch might get more use in a player‚Äôs dorm room or apartment. Whatever the Cotton Bowl gives: This is the only game that does not reveal what their gifts are before the players arrive. However, the gifts are usually the best of all the bowls. Last year Alabama and Michigan State received an Apple Watch and Amazon Fire TV. Two years ago it was Beats wireless headphones and three years ago it was an Apple TV and iPad Mini. Bobblehead (Taxslayer Bowl): These are not your standard mass produced bobbleheads. Each player will get one with their face, name and uniform number. TOP GIFT SUITE ITEMS This year 25 games are doing gift suites. In the case of the Fiesta Bowl, athletes from Clemson and Ohio State have the option of the gift suite or a PlayStation bundle that includes the game system and accessories. Jon Cooperstein, director of the sports marketing division for PAC, said the big-ticket items remain the most popular. Recliners: The leather chair, which includes two USB ports and a drink holder, remain the most popular item, no matter what position someone plays because it allows them to create their own home theatre system. Michael Kors watches: Most games supply watches as gifts but some prefer having something more stylish or get one to give to a family member or girlfriend. Mountain bikes: These have gained in popularity among the past year or two as athletes use them to commute around campus. Amazon echo: The internet-connected wireless speaker with the digital assistant named Alexa has gained in popularity the past two bowl seasons. Wireless headphones: Beats came out with a couple of new versions before the holidays, which will make them more popular than some of the outdated ones. Over the ear headphones instead of earbuds remain the more favored option.

If you‚Äôre looking for a reliable flagship device that won‚Äôt let you down for the next two years, the iPhone 7 Plus is your best bet. Apple iPhone 7 Plus is our winner of the best smartphone for 2016 iPhone 7 Plus‚Äô water and dust-resistant design is another advantage. More importantly, this one comes with a dual-rear camera system, unlike anything else we‚Äôve seen before. The ‚Äòbokeh-style‚Äô effects thanks to the combination of a wide-angle and telephoto lens resulted in some truly stunning smartphone photography for us during the review period. Apple iPhone 7 Plus also comes with 2X optical zoom and 10x digital zoom. Additionally, Apple has also made OIS common on the both the iPhone 7 Plus and the smaller iPhone 7, which gives another boost to smartphone photography. Based on all the phones we‚Äôve reviewed, there‚Äôs no doubt in our minds: iPhone 7 Plus is on top. Runner-up: Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Why:¬†Samsung got off to a great start for 2016 with the Galaxy S7 edge, which helped the company‚Äôs smartphone division get back into profit. The glass and metal design of the Galaxy S7 edge, along with the curved edge display make this a premium flagship phone unlike any other. Watch our video review of Samsung Galaxy S7 edge¬† In our review, Samsung Galaxy S7 edge delivered on performance, though the iPhone 7 Plus beat it quite easily later on. It‚Äôs also got a great battery life, which is another key feature in a flagship. Samsung Galaxy S7 edge remains a top-end Android flagship phone. The S7 edge with its dual-pixel 12MP rear camera was one of the best when it launched in the early part of 2016. The low-light performance of the S7 edge is only bested by the iPhone 7 Plus, which is why this device ends up being the runner-up. However, for Samsung 2016 remains a terrible year, thanks to the Galaxy Note 7 battery fiasco. If that phone was still in the running perhaps it could have beaten the iPhone 7 Plus. For those asking why we did not choose Google Pixel here, this is a far more stable phone. Best Android Phone: Google Pixel Why:¬†This year, Google turned into a smartphone player with its own Pixel series. The Pixel and Pixel XL were launched in October 2016 and come with a premium pricing, one that puts them in direct competition with the Samsung Galaxy S flagships, and yes the Apple iPhone. Pixel and Pixel XL‚Äôs are meant to highlight and showcase the best of Google; features include the Google Assistant which is exclusive to these phones for now, a superior camera where software is king, unlimited storage for photos, and the ability to transfer all data from your previous device, including an iPhone to the new Pixel. Google Pixel, Pixel XL is no doubt the best Android phone. But where Pixel really shone for us was in the camera department where it easily matched both the iPhone 7 series and the S7 edge. Google‚Äôs software wizardry has given this phone a great camera; be it shots in the bright outdoors or low-light settings, the Pixel doesn‚Äôt disappoint. Design-wise, the Pixel is still a work in motion, but Google says it is in for the long run with these smartphones. But as the first Google-only smartphone, there‚Äôs no doubt that Pixel ends up beating all the other Android phones in the market. Runner Up: OnePlus 3 Why:¬†OnePlus is a brand that has become synonymous with the motto ‚ÄòNever Settle‚Äô and wants its phones to be known as flagship killers. While flagships still have the edge, OnePlus 3 has certainly emerged as an affordable option with top-notch performance. If one considers the pricing (which is half of what most flagships cost) and the overall performance, OnePlus 3 is definitely a winner. OnePlus 3 lives up to the promises it makes and is a worthy flagship challenger. This phone impressed us with camera, overall performance and battery life. This smartphone proved you don‚Äôt need to pay a bomb to get a flagship-like performance. We‚Äôre going with the OnePlus 3, and not the 3T, simply because the earlier phone was available for most of 2016, while the latter has just launched in India. Also, both phones are similar in terms of performance and specifications, and 3T is technically a mid-cycle upgrade. Honorable mention Moto Z This was also supposed to be the year of phones with modular design, and if one company got it right it was Motorola. Moto Z sports an extra-slim form factor, and the Mods or extra modules can just be slapped onto phone, thanks to the 16 magnetic pins on the back of the phone. Be it extra battery, or a Hasselblad Zoom lens, or a projector or the JBL speaker, Mods are a simple yet innovative feature from Motorola. Moto Z is the company‚Äôs take on making modular phones more mainstream. Sure there‚Äôs the extra cost involved for the Mods, but Moto Z is still cheaper compared to other flagships in India. In our review, we‚Äôve loved the overall design, performance of the phone, but battery remains a concern.¬†For 2017, it will be interesting to see how this series evolves and what the next Moto Z and range of Mods end up offering. Nubia Z11 OnePlus might have emerged as the go-to option in the Rs 30,000 price range, but we expect more options to emerge in this price category next year. Nubia Z11 is another mid-range phone that launched in India just in December, but impressed us with performance. Nubia Z11 is one of the most stylish phones and has a bezel-less design. Nubia Z11 is one of the most stylish phones and has a bezel-less design, something you won‚Äôt get at this price in India. The phone also delivers on performance and camera department, just like the OnePlus 3. The only struggle will be for Nubia to establish itself as a brand in India. ¬© The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: Apple Google Nubia OnePlus Samsung Yearender 2016 Best of Express Model Code of Conduct: EC asks Govt to respond to Opposition's Budget delay demand EntertainmentOm Puri passes away after a massive heart attack, funeral at 6 pm EntertainmentDangal box office collection day 15: Aamir Khan film sets new benchmarks for industry EntertainmentSwami Om out of Bigg Boss 10 for peeing on contestants.

After promising fans that it will release the wireless earphones immediately, it then suffered massive delays in doing so. Now, the much hyped earphones are out and first day buyers already received their units. While the AirPods offer wireless music freedom, it may still be not the best pair of earphones in the market.

For those who are serious about their music would have to opt for earphones with bigger voice coils for better audio performance. This is where on-ear and over-the-ear earphones come to play.

Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What‚Äôs Hot Rumour Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Contact Us The Bitbag Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What‚Äôs Hot Rumors Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Computers Apple iMac 2017 Specs, Updates: Why Next Year‚Äôs iMac Will Be Boring By Kiko Antonio Posted on December 26, 2016 Share Tweet Share Share Email Since the introduction of the 5K display on the iMac a couple of years ago, the desktop remained the same. To date, it is still that big hunk of aluminum floating on what seemingly looks like a flimsy stand. To add insult to injury, Apple gave the iMac just a few bumps on the specs and called it a day. Now, rumor has it that the next iMac, the iMac 2017, will feature minute improvements compared to the previous model. According to a recent article from Bloomberg, Apple still has plans on releasing the iMac 2017 next year. However, fans may not see much difference as it will not include significant changes at all. READ ALSO: Apple iPad Pro 2 Specs, Release Date: Apple Will Unveil the iPad Pro 2 with iPhone 8 The best feature of an iMac is its display. Right now, the smaller version supports 4K native resolution while the bigger one is 5K. Putting everything into perspective, the 5K display offers twice as much pixels than its predecessor. While that may seem impressive, it will take many years before Apple updates this feature. Because of this, there may only be a few hardware items that can be upgraded on the iMac 2017. iMac (via apple.com) First and foremost, the processor is rumored to be the newest Intel chip, the Kaby Lake. A lot of people are now putting much praise on the upcoming chip. However, this is quite acceptable as the specs for the chip speak for itself. Unfortunately, this is something that is not worth getting excited about as every processor upgrade has its pros and cons. READ ALSO: Apple iMac 2017 Specs, Release Date: iMac 2017 to Remain 5K, Replacing USB with Thunderbolt 3 Another thing that is coming on the iMac 2017 is the Thunderbolt 3. This feature is natively supported by the processor. Although the speed increase is nothing short of unbelievable, the impending hardware change may not be very good at all. The newly released MacBook Pro 2016 is still receiving a lot of backlash from Mac users due to the USB Type-C ports that it sports. Many people are complaining about Apple?s decision to leave out older, legacy ports like the USB Type-B. Rumor has it that the iMac 2017 will feature the said interface and that will replace the current USB ports. This may be quite a bad news for anyone who still uses the older USB Type-B hardware. READ ALSO: Apple Shifting More to Mobile Devices, Neglecting iMac and Mac Pro Finally, there is the graphics. Many iMac fans will know that Apple does not really go all out when it comes to the desktop. Anyone expecting neck-breaking graphics spec for the iMac 2017 will be sorely disappointed. At best, it may feature support for basic virtual reality (VR) gaming, according to rumors. Other than that, there is a slim chance that 4K and gaming on ultra settings will be supported. Whether Apple will disappoint fans next year or not, perhaps it is still too soon to tell. However, many will sure be waiting when the tech giant will be releasing its upcoming hardware offering.

This year we saw so many gadgets exploding, how numbers game can change everything and tech giants going lengths to protect their egos(!). Here we listed the top seven tech stories that broke the headlines:¬† Apple Vs. US Government Apple‚Äôs defiance towards a request of FBI to unlock a phone of a terrorist was indeed one of the biggest incidents in first quarter of 2016. FBI wanted to access the iPhone 5C of the shooter of San Bernardino while Tim Cook, CEO legally refused the California court order stating this will create a unfortunate precedent which will act as a door way for trampling civil liberty. ¬†¬† Exploding smartphones This was the most disastrous year for Samsung, the tech giant that turned 78 in 2016. A few early adopters of Samsung Note 7 were reporting that their smartphone literally exploded while it was being charged. The exact causes of the battery faults are still not publicly known. Samsung tried to recall the devices but when things went out of hand it had to discontinue it permanently. There were other phones that exploded too, but more on it later. Device, device, device This year was the year of devices. From Google‚Äôs very own Pixel to Microsoft‚Äôs Surface to Apple‚Äôs Macbook Pro with touch bar- we saw a leap in device engineering and design. And these were not necessarily limited to mobile phones alone. From swarming drones to flexible OLED screens to 170 inch modular TV- what wasn‚Äôt there? We also saw particular growth in Internet of Things (IoT) devices as well.¬† Facebook or fakebook World largest social media and third most used search engine Facebook took quite a hit this year; both positively & negatively. We saw Facebook rolling out AIs, going deep with Free Basics and VRs. But most notably this year was the year of fake news on Facebook. It became such a nuisance for the company that they had to go back to the drawing board to chalk out ways to combat fake stories on timeline.¬† VR & AR all the way VR and AR- thanks to Facebook we all know what the terms are. This year we saw a dramatic rise in VR & AR content. Starting from mobile games to movies to educational content- everywhere VR is making a bold move. All the prominent device makers are stepping in this arena. We believe by 2018 at least 10% of the smartphone users will be interacting with some sort of AR or VR content on a regular basis. US elections & Data science We know Data can manipulate outcomes in many ways. But can we guess how much and what extent can? Look at the US elections. A series of damaging e-mails about Hilary Clinton were investigated at the right moment making the shift of public opinion from Democrat to Republican. And Trump and his team of data scientists exploited the numbers by delivering what people what to hear rather than what people need to hear. And the results of this data manipulation? Well we all know who the president-elect is now! Hacked off If you have been following the news then surely you know about the Yahoo hack. The security breach compromised more than 1 Billion user‚Äôs accounts ‚Äì making it the largest breach in the history. We also saw hackers engineering the Bangladesh bank heist, bitcoin exchange heist and hacking of major public figures including Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai, Jack Dorsey and many more.¬† And these are just the high profile ones that we are mentioning here.¬† ¬† Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action.

Tweet or Update Facebook with Siri If you have your twitter and Facebook accounts connected to the iPad you can hold the home button and say ‚Äúpost to Facebook‚Äù or¬†‚ÄúPost to Twitter.‚Äù Siri will then ask what you want to say, and you can dictate the message you want to share. Use the iPad with Hearing Aids There are seven types of iPad hearing aids that are designed to work with the iPhone and iPad. If you own one of these brands you can pair them to the iPad like a Bluetooth headphone and then control the volume for each ear. You can¬†even set the device in front of someone for a live listen feature that helps you hear what someone is saying. Check out more about the Made for iPhone and iPad hearing aids. This iPad tip turns the iPad into a second display for your Mac or Windows notebook or desktop. Use the iPad as a Second Display for your Mac or PC If you want to add a second monitor to your Mac or PC you can download Air Display 2, a $10 app that turns the iPad into a second display. After you download the app for the iPad, you need to run a program on your Mac or PC that will connect the two devices and you can then use the iPad as a wireless monitor for your Mac or PC. Avatron includes more details on setup and any troubleshooting, but in our experience it is pretty easy to use. Connect to Twitter and Facebook If you want to share to Facebook or twitter from the iPad you should connect the accounts to your iPad. This is essential to sharing photos from¬†the photos app and asking Siri to update your social network statuses. Go to Settings -> Twitter or Settings -> Facebook and login with your email or username and password. This is a good idea to do, even if you use another app like Tweetbot for Twitter, as it simplifies sharing photos and web pages. Charge the iPad Faster if you want to charge the iPad faster you¬†should turn on airplane mode. This will help it charge slightly faster than it will with all radios running.¬†You won‚Äôt notice a dramatic change in speed, but if you are pressed for time it will help. You should also make sure you charge it with the adapter that it came with, not just any USB adapter, since Apple provides one that can supply more energy than a typical USB charger. Find Your Friends If you install the Find My Friends app you can use the iPad to track down your fiends and family members, as long as they give you permission to track them. Download the Find My Friends App and log in with iCloud. Tap on Add -> Friends -> enter names, email addresses or phone numbers. They need to use an iPhone or iPad and they will need to grant you permission. After you have permission you can look at the map to see where people are, or you can ask Siri, ‚ÄúWhere is my wife?‚Äù for a faster lookup. Add Storage to the iPad If you need more storage to carry your movies and photos with you on the iPad you can buy a wireless hard drive that connects to the iPad and streams your movies, iTunes rentals and photos to the iPad even when you are driving down the highway. You can go with an option¬†like MobileLite¬†or pick up a LaCie Fuel to really add the storage you want to the iPad. 2 Responses 11/01/2015 Sunny Reply Help !

(Photo : Getty Images/David Paul Morris) Share This Tweet This The 13-inch Apple MacBook that packed 2.0GHz dual-core i5 processor, 256GB SSD and 8GB RAM, with the stylish and modern appearance is a pretty beastly partner for any computing needs. The 15-inch variant that houses 2.6 Ghz quad-core i7 processor, 256 GB SSD, and 16GB of RAM is even more beastly that users will not need to replace their machine for another year or two. But this is not how the Consumer Reports perceive the Apple Macbook Pro. Consumer Reports, one of the most thorough publications performing testing on laptops, said that Apple's new MacBook Pros have problems with inconsistent battery life. As such, it denied the device its recommendation, reported Business Insider. ‚ÄúFor instance, in a series of three consecutive tests, the 13-inch model with the Touch Bar ran for 16 hours in the first trial, 12.75 hours in the second, and just 3.75 hours in the third,‚Äù read Consumer Reports‚Äô rationale. ‚ÄúThe 13-inch model without the Touch Bar worked for 19.5 hours in one trial but only 4.5 hours in the next. And the numbers for the 15-inch laptop ranged from 18.5 down to 8 hours.‚Äù Advertisement Usually, a laptop‚Äôs battery life may vary from one trial to another by less than five percent. But with the wide difference of the result of the trials that CR has observed, the MacBook Pro 2016 became the first Apple MacBook to not receive a recommendation. CR‚Äôs decision was rooted from the fact that battery life inconsistencies inevitably cause problems to devices. This can lead into work disturbances, as the battery life expectancy of the machine is not constant. It can also lead to unexpected shutdowns, quick laptop battery depreciation, or some other hardware failures. Apple still has no statement for this issue, but some internet folks suggested that the fix for the battery life problem may come with Apple‚Äôs software updates on the MacBook Pro.

This year was the first time in 15 years that its sales and profit were less than the year before. That‚Äôs not to say Apple didn‚Äôt make a lot of money in 2016‚Äîit did. But it also released a bevy of new products across the year, including a new iPad Pro, Apple Watch, iPhone, and entirely new Mac laptops, that did not seem to capture the same level of excitement in consumers as previous models have. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ‚ñ≤ 117.91 +1.30 +1.11% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ‚ñ≤ 795.99 +15.54 +1.99% Even though it was always going to be difficult to keep the momentum from 2015 going, Apple had a very strong first quarter (which is actually its holiday 2015 quarter). The rest of the year, however, looked a lot like 2014‚Äînot terrible, by any stretch of the imagination, but just not as impressive as 2015 was. Sales of iPhones constitute the bulk of Apple‚Äôs revenue, accounting for anywhere between half and three-quarters of its revenue in any given quarter. So when iPhone sales slumped in 2016, so did Apple‚Äôs profit. Many considered the new iPhone 7 to be somewhat of a letdown, with a form factor that‚Äôs exceedingly similar to the iPhone 6 and 6S that preceded it, the lack of a headphone jack, and few upgrade-worthy features. Similar complaints were levied toward the new MacBook Pros, which replaced every single port that people have used over the last few years with future-proof USB-C ports. The machines were also seen as underpowered for the price. To get the top specifications available, you had to buy a machine with Apple‚Äôs new Touch Bar, a small touchscreen that replaces the traditional function keys atop the keyboard, which has also been as a hindrance for many who regularly use the physical function, escape, or volume keys. As a result, Apple had a middling year on Wall Street by its standards. Its stock began the year at about $103, and closed at roughly $117 on Dec. 20. That‚Äôs a healthy return of over 13%, and pretty much in line with how the S&P 500 fared over the same period, but far below the massive yearly gains Apple has had in years past. Some, including myself, have called Apple boring for its uninspiring product launches in recent years. In many ways, it seemed that 2016 was a year for Apple to regather itself. Nothing it released felt particularly new, even when it was. The iPhone looked the same, as did its new iPads and Apple Watches, and even the Macs were essentially the same design as the MacBooks unveiled in 2015. The only entirely new product it unveiled during the year was the AirPods, a set of wireless headphones‚Äîwhich is only the second entirely new product Apple has released during CEO Tim Cook‚Äôs six-year tenure. They‚Äôve been met with mixed review, and were delayed multiple times, only to eventually go on sale about a week ago. Full screen 1/6 SLIDES ¬©¬†Provided by Quartz What's next for Apple? 2/6 SLIDES ¬©¬†Provided by Quartz 3/6 SLIDES ¬©¬†Provided by Quartz 4/6 SLIDES ¬©¬†Provided by Quartz 5/6 SLIDES ¬©¬†Provided by Quartz 6/6 SLIDES ¬©¬†Provided by Quartz 6/6 SLIDES A new hope But 2017 may well be an entirely different ball game. Apple is, in some ways, starting afresh. It will be moving into its massive new spaceship-shaped headquarters in Cupertino, California, which will be an unending parade of indigenous trees, curved glass, and steel. It‚Äôll be a home for the Tim Cook-era Apple, and the staging ground for every new product the company will unveil in the coming years. And there‚Äôs a chance there may be a few in 2017. Next June will be the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone. Some analysts have surmised that Apple released an underwhelming iPhone 7 for two reasons: firstly, it‚Äôs getting more and more difficult to innovate in smartphones every year, and secondly, the company wanted to make a splash with its 10th-anniversary model. Analysts at Morgan Stanley have referred to 2017 as a ‚Äúsupercyle‚Äù upgrade, where nearly every product line will be updated in the year, anchored by the iPhone. There are rumors that the next iPhone will feature a curved glass screen with no home button, wireless charging, fingerprint scanning without a fingerprint scanner, and myriad futuristic-sounding technologies. These big changes could well convince those who have held off from upgrading their smartphones (or jumped ship from the iPhone) in recent years to spend big on the next iPhone. As Apple‚Äôs overall revenue is so inextricably tied to iPhone sales, a strong year for the smartphone will certainly translate into a big year for Apple. And the iPhone won‚Äôt be alone. There are rumors that Apple will update its Mac desktop computers (and its accessories) this spring for the first time in years. Cook has alluded to updates with recent comments¬†on internal Apple message boards, although it‚Äôs not entirely clear whether these will be complete overhauls, or just minor refreshes. Either way, Mac sales, along with Apple‚Äôs accessories business (which it lists as ‚ÄúOther Products‚Äù on earnings reports, and includes the Watch, Beats headphones, and routers) and its services (such as iTunes and App Store sales) are trending up. Whether Apple can reverse the slide in iPad sales, however, remains to be seen. Its smaller 9.7-inch iPad Pro, released in March, was regarded by¬†many¬†reviewers as the best iPad the company has ever released. But iPad sales were stagnant in 2016, while more traditional Mac sales crept up, suggesting that between a large iPhone and laptop, many people don‚Äôt have much use for a tablet. Recent rumors have suggested that the next iPad designs may look similar to what we‚Äôre hearing about the next iPhone, with a mainly edgeless display and no home button. It‚Äôs possible that some iPhone-excitement spillover may benefit the iPad in 2017, but it‚Äôs still looking to be the company‚Äôs weakest standalone product‚Äîassuming you count the Apple Watch as an iPhone accessory. And there may be much more beyond fancier iPhones and iPads. The company appears to be working on some sort of smart glasses that are relatively far along in their prototyping. It‚Äôs not entirely clear whether these would be like the Bluetooth video-recording glasses that Snap (of Snapchat fame) recently released, or something more like an Apple Watch for your face, with augmented-reality displays populating information over the real world. Either way, they will certainly sell by the truckload if Apple does release them, and they‚Äôre at least as useful as the Apple Watch, which likely shipped at least 12 million units in its first year. (Apple hasn‚Äôt released official sales figures.) Given the massive increase (in pure dollars) in Apple‚Äôs research and development spend in recent years, it‚Äôs likely that there could be other surprises along the way in 2017 and beyond. In the years between Steve Jobs‚Äô return to Apple and the release of the first iPhone, Apple spent roughly $4.8 billion on R&D‚Äîthat‚Äôs less than half as much as it spent in 2016 alone. So what else could Apple be working on? There‚Äôs talk of an Amazon Echo competitor, an internet-of-things controller and home speaker based on Siri, some sort of virtual reality system, another wearable, and of course, some sort of car. While it‚Äôs unlikely that Apple will unveil any sort of vehicle in 2017, it‚Äôs entirely possible that it could officially announce its automotive intentions next year, especially given that it often previews products before they‚Äôre available (as it did for the better part of six months with the Apple Watch), and its recent letter to the US government imploring for parity between companies that want to test autonomous vehicle technology. It seemed like a rather unnecessary letter to write if the company wasn‚Äôt seriously considering (and planning on testing) a self-driving car in the near future. But whatever Apple releases in 2017, it‚Äôll invariably be dissected in intricate detail, examined from every angle, and hyped across the internet. And we‚Äôll be there to see if Cook can make Apple great again. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem.

Hall did not lose a match in his final three seasons and graduated with the best career winning percentage of 98.5 (277-4) in state history. Outswimming her competition Visitation‚Äôs 200 medley relay team was disqualified in the preliminaries of the Class 1A state meet, costing the Blazers a potential 40 points. It turned out those points did not matter. Visitation scored 261 points and won 13 medals in 12 events to capture its fourth consecutive girls‚Äô swimming state championship. Lakers win in lacrosse state debut Having lost to Lakeville North in the regular season, the Prior Lake boys‚Äô lacrosse team found redemption in its 12-5 victory over the Panthers in the state championship game.

Nokia reignites Apple patent battle with a spate of new lawsuits Posted Dec 21, 2016 by Brian Heater (@bheater) 0 SHARES Next Story Apps for holiday¬†shopping Five years after burying the hatchet with Apple, Nokia‚Äôs back at it again. The one-time phone-making juggernaut announced this week that it‚Äôs ready to go back to court in a big way, filing multiple lawsuits aimed squarely at Cupertino. The company celebrated the filings with a press release detailing the claims, which stem from 32 patents related to a wide range of related technologies, including software, video coding, chipsets, display, UI and antenna, among others ‚Äî from the sound of it, just about everything apart¬†from the big shiny Apple logo on the back of the iPhone. According to Nokia, Apple has refused to play ball with subsequent patents following the 2011 settlement, which marked the end of a two-year fight. ‚ÄúSince agreeing [to] a license covering some patents from the Nokia Technologies portfolio in 2011,‚Äù the company said in a statement issued today, ‚ÄúApple has declined subsequent offers made by Nokia to license other of its patented inventions which are used by many of Apple‚Äôs products.‚Äù Nokia filed suits in three German cities, along with the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, the Walt Disney World of patent litigation. For its part, Apple also filed a suit this week in California, alleging that Nokia removed certain patents from the previous deal for the purposes of ‚Äúextorting excessive royalties‚Äù ‚Äî an alleged breach of contract. The previous settlement was reportedly valued at $720 million. Update:¬†We‚Äôve since spoken¬†with Apple in regard to the suit by the company¬†yesterday in California, in which it suggests that Nokia is working with a number of companies on the aforementioned royalty ‚Äúextort[ion].‚Äù ‚ÄúApple is about innovation and our teams are dedicated to making the best products on earth,‚Äù the spokesperson told TechCrunch. ‚ÄúWe respect intellectual property and we‚Äôve always been willing to pay a fair price to secure the rights of patents covering technology in our products.¬† Unfortunately, Nokia has refused to license their patents on a fair basis and is now using the tactics of a patent troll to attempt to extort money from Apple by applying a royalty rate to Apple‚Äôs own inventions they had nothing to do with.¬† We are standing up for inventors everywhere by fighting this flagrant anticompetitive practice.‚Äù We‚Äôve also reached out to Nokia for a comment about what‚Äôs shaping up to be another fierce battle stemming from some unfinished business between the two big tech names. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Nokia Founded 1865 Overview Nokia is a Finnish multinational communications corporation engaged in the manufacturing of mobile devices, network infrastructure, location-based technologies, and advanced technologies businesses worldwide.

Nelson01/14/2016 The new Apple Pencil stylus for the iPad Pro may be hard to find, but it isn‚Äôt hard to use. Its simplicity can be its downfall, however; when the¬†Apple Pencil stops working, it can be difficult¬†to figure out why. We‚Äôve put together a list of the most common Apple Pencil problems ‚Äì and their fixes. Advertisement It might seem like there‚Äôs nothing to be done if your Apple Pencil isn‚Äôt working right ‚Äì after all, there are no buttons or displays. That simplicity is actually a good thing, as it makes troubleshooting pretty easy. My Apple Pencil doesn‚Äôt work. If your Apple Pencil¬†never worked, you might not have paired it with your iPad, yet. Or you might have multiple iPads, and simply tried using it with the wrong device. To pair it with your iPad, pop off the cap, and insert it into the Lighting port on the bottom of your device. A pop up will appear on your iPad, asking if you want to pair the Pencil with this iPad; tap to agree, and your Pencil should start working. Also, be sure that your iPad supports Apple Pencil in the first place ‚Äì if you have anything other than an iPad Pro, you‚Äôre out of luck. The Pencil isn‚Äôt compatible with the iPad Air 2, iPad Air, iPad Mini 4, or anything older. Advertisement Advertisement My Apple Pencil stopped working. If your Apple Pencil¬†was working, but now it isn‚Äôt, the first thing to try is¬†tightening the tip of your stylus. Just hold the Pencil in one hand, and twist the tip with your other hand. You‚Äôll want to tighten it by twisting it clockwise. Occasionally, the tip can become invisibly¬†loosen, and the Pencil will stop working. Tightening this tip will usually fix the issue. You should also make sure that you have Bluetooth turned on. If you put your iPad into Airplane mode, for example, you might not realize that Bluetooth gets turned off. Just swipe up from the bottom of the screen to bring up Control Center, and make sure the Bluetooth icon is on (if it‚Äôs on, it should be mostly white, or lit up). You can also tap on your Settings icon, find Bluetooth in the list, and make sure that the toggle switch is on (it‚Äôll have a green background). If Bluetooth is turned on, but your Pencil still isn‚Äôt responding, you can might just be out of a charge. Most of the time, the iPad will tell you when your Apple Pencil is getting low on battery, but it waits until the Pencil reaches 5% before it pops up a notification to let you know. If you‚Äôre not within Bluetooth range when that happens, however, your Pencil can die and the iPad won‚Äôt be aware of it.¬†Simply pop the cap off the end of the Pencil, and plug it into your iPad Pro‚Äôs Lightning port at the bottom of the tablet. Leave it to charge for a few minutes, and up to half an hour. Then, pull it out, put the cap back on, and try to use it. If the battery is dead, your Pencil¬†should respond after¬†charging for just a few seconds ‚Äì Apple promises 30 minutes of use with just a fifteen-second charge. Advertisement You might try deleting the Apple Pencil from your iPad and re-pairing it. Don‚Äôt worry, this won‚Äôt delete any files, or any other work on your iPad that you might have done with your Pencil; it only removes it from your settings. To try this, go into your Settings app and tap on Bluetooth in the left column. On the right, you‚Äôll see a list of devices with which you‚Äôve previously paired your iPad. They‚Äôll say either ‚ÄòConnected‚Äô or ‚ÄòNot Connected‚Äô depending on proximity and power status; you might see either label next to your Apple Pencil entry. Tap on the little circle with a lowercase i at the end of the listing for your Apple Pencil. A new screen will show, reading ‚ÄòForget This Device.‚Äô Tap on that and, if asked, confirm. Then proceed as you would for a brand new Apple Pencil ‚Äì take off the cap, plug it into the Lightning port, and wait for the iPad to pair the stylus. The last¬†thing you can try is to reboot your iPad. Sometimes the Bluetooth radio on a mobile device can get a little mixed up, but a reboot will often clear things up. Simply hold the power button down until you see the screen change.¬†Slide the power button to the right, and your iPad will power down. After it‚Äôs finished, wait a few seconds, and hold the power button down again until you see the Apple logo appear on the screen. Once the iPad finishes turning on, try using your Apple Pencil ‚Äì if it still doesn‚Äôt work, repeat one or more of the steps above, since rebooting your iPad may have changed something. If none of the above steps work, you‚Äôll probably have to get a new Apple Pencil. You can take it back to the store you purchased it from, if new, or head into an Apple retail store where they‚Äôll probably just exchange it for a new one. I can‚Äôt tell how much battery life is left on my Apple Pencil. Normally, when you pair a Bluetooth device with your iPhone or iPad, you‚Äôll see a special battery icon appear next to the Bluetooth icon at the top of your screen ‚Äì that‚Äôs the battery life for whatever you‚Äôve got connected (usually a headset or headphones). With the Apple Pencil, however, that icon never appears, and instead Apple buries the option deep within your notification center. Advertisement To see how much battery life your Apple Pencil has left,¬†unlock your iPad and swipe down from the top of the screen. Tap on the button that reads ‚ÄòEdit‚Äô, then pick the ‚ÄòBatteries‚Äô widget to include on your Today View (just tap the plus icon on the left, and then¬†move it up and down by tapping and holding on the three lines to the right). Once finished, tap on the Done button in the upper right-hand corner.¬†You‚Äôll now see a listing for Batteries, with your iPad and Apple Pencil both listed. You can check it at any time by swiping down from the top of your screen. My Apple Pencil isn‚Äôt writing as well as it used to, or the tip doesn‚Äôt feel right. The Apple Pencil is engineered with a tip that will slowly degrade over time, as harder materials don‚Äôt feel as comfortable when you‚Äôre writing or drawing on a hard surface like the screen of your iPad. As a result, Apple ships a second tip in the box with your Pencil. Just find your Apple Pencil box, and look for the second tip inside. Unscrew the current tip on your Pencil by twisting it counterclockwise, and keep turning it until it pops off. You can throw this tip away, and replace it by pushing the new tip on, then turning it in a clockwise rotation until it‚Äôs tightened. If you‚Äôve gone through your second tip, or threw away your Apple Pencil box without getting the free second tip out,¬†you might be out of luck, as replacement tips aren‚Äôt yet available. Try stopping by an Apple retail store, or calling their support hotline, and explain the situation ‚Äì chances are good you‚Äôll leave with a new tip on your Pencil. Advertisement Did you burn through the list above and still can‚Äôt figure out what‚Äôs wrong with your Apple Pencil? Leave a question in the comments section below, and¬†someone might have an answer! 25 Responses 01/25/2016 Roberta Coren Reply I find after I‚Äôve paired my pencil it interferes with my ability to use previously paired items, like my Bose speaker for example. It also causes my podcast app to freeze. Even after I‚Äôve unpaired the pencil and ‚Äúforgot my device‚Äù it still give me trouble, I still have to reboot my iPad and occasionally I have to do a hard restart. This issue happens after every time I have paired my pencil. It‚Äôs very frustrating and too much time is wasted on this. Any suggestions? It‚Äôs a new pencil because my first one stopped working after 1 day. It hardly seems worth the effort/ 01/28/2016 J.R. Nelson Reply Whoa, that‚Äôs a pretty strange problem! I wonder if something is wrong with your specific iPad Pro, rather than the Pencil itself? I haven‚Äôt encountered any issues, and I stream to my Bluetooth headphones a lot while using the Pencil. 01/26/2016 Oscar Reply Mine pairs, charges and will open, close, select items so I can see it is functioning but it will not write. Tried new tip, tried repairing, rebooting etc but same problem‚Ä¶.no lines/drawing/text in any relevant app such as Notes or Mail. Did I get a dud? 01/28/2016 J.R. Nelson Reply Unfortunately, it sounds like you might have. 01/28/2016 Andrew Kin Wai Tsang Reply Mine stopped working after a week for no reason and i tried all the above steps. It is so annoying waiting 5 weeks for a replacement. I really hope i just got a dud and that it is not a common problem as i got the ipad pro just for the pencil and art apps. I took real good care of mine and carried it around in its original box and barely used it.i wish there was a hover cursor for better accuracy when using large brush sizes‚Ä¶the apps on ios are what really impress me so respect to the talented app developers‚Ä¶i love android for some things‚Ä¶but the app market still pales in comparison to the IOS app market. I think the lag on my wacom intuos is slightly faster for sketching‚Ä¶but i haven‚Äôt really had much time to try large brush sizes in different apps to see if it performs faster than my intuos. 01/28/2016 J.R. Nelson Reply If you‚Äôve got an Apple retail store near you, you should stop buy and tell them your issues ‚Äì even though Pencil stocks are still slightly limited, most of the time Apple keeps spares of devices in stores to swap out malfunctioning customer devices ‚Äì even if they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have any in stock‚Äù there‚Äôs probably a few in back for this exact reason. 02/05/2016 [email¬†protected] Reply My apple pencil seems to have a more obvious latency delay after only using it for a few days. I did drop it once but it does still work. I changed to the new tip and it still has the latency delay. Could I have damaged it only with a latency problem? 02/11/2016 Wouter Reply My Pencil also stopped connecting as well‚Ä¶it connects when stuck into the Lightning port, but is locked at 74% charged. Strange..anybody has a tip ? 02/13/2016 William Reply My is ‚ò† Expensive gadget! Light durability! 04/04/2016 Steven Reply Found a elegant wood case that holds the pencil, the cap, and the lighting adapter. I found it here:https://www.antiquecharacter.biz 04/19/2016 Jamie Reply Pencil cannot be used while it is charging; this caught me out today when I tried using my pencil with a flat battery and it wasn‚Äôt working (scratching head) so i plugged it into charge but it still wouldn‚Äôt work‚Ä¶ unplugged it for charge cable after a few minutes and it started working. 05/24/2016 Samie-Jo Reply Purchased an Apple Pencil today. Paired it to iPad Pro. It worked for about 30 seconds. I followed all the above steps. It‚Äôs connected and I can view how much charge it has, but it just won‚Äôt do anything. Left it for a while, charged it, did everything you could think of. Returned it to the store I bought it from, got a replacement straight away. This one did the same thing. Also as above mention mine is stuck on 74%. I‚Äôm not sure if it the pencil or my iPad Pro. But I have only had the iPad for around a month. 05/30/2016 jonathan Reply Recently bought iPad pro and pencil. It activates some functions including keyboard but won‚Äôt draw or write. I bought a spare whilst on holiday and it had the same problem‚Ä¶have tried re-booting and re pairing all as recommended. Any further ideas?? 06/09/2016 Needs2Cash Reply Kindly advise how to see the iPencil listed with the devices in Procreate. It lists Adonit Jot, Pencil by FiftyThree, Pogo Connect and Wacom Intuos Creative Stylus‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶but not my iPencil despite it being paired with my iPad Pro. 06/17/2016 Shivy Reply I‚Äôve had my pencil for a while, but only now has it stopped working. It‚Äôs stuck at 17% and won‚Äôt charge. I tried the Bluetooth reconnecting thing and ‚Äúforgot‚Äù this pencil, but now it‚Äôs not pairing with the device, for I haven‚Äôt received any notification that it has. So now I have a pencil that won‚Äôt charge OR connect with my iPad Pro. I‚Äôm probably gonna have to replace it. 07/04/2016 Koen Reply I tried and I tried. Pairing went ok, fully charged etc. The pencil was recognized, but still I could not write on the iPad. I was almost returning to the store when I screwed the tip of the pen a bit tighter and then it worked. Maybe this is also worth testing‚Ä¶ 08/22/2016 LadyGadget Reply Tightening the tip worked!!!!! After rebooting, I un-pairing and re-pairing, I simply loosed and re-tightened the tip. SUCCESS 09/19/2016 Rurik Halaby Reply I really enjoy my pencil, but have two problems with it. Once in a while it goes to sleep even if full. To wake it up you plug it in for a second or two and that wakes it up. The other problem is that with design trumping function it has no clip to secure it to your shirt pocket. I did find a purveyor of clips but it looks like hell. Too bad. 09/26/2016 James Reply When Apple Pencil is paired with my iPad Pro it causes the wifi to keeping dropping out despit full signal and in same room as router. Wifi is perfectly stable until I connect the pencil and then it keeps disconnecting. When it drops out often it does not reconnect automatically. I have to go to settings and press on my network to rejoin. Sometimes this works and it reconnects and sometimes it repeatedly asks for my wifi password despite entering the correct password. It is extremely irritating. I have heard of other people experience same issue when pairing other Bluetooth devices but no solutions to the problem have been found. 11/15/2016 camilomf Reply THANK YOU!

I used to switch off Bluetooth, WiFi before turning iPad screen off. Even though my pencil is paired, but every time I switch ON Bluetooth, I‚Äôve to plug pencil in the iPad port for connection.. Is this the correct way to plug pencil all the time you need to use it. Second option is that I keep my Bluetooth ON for all times. Are you all operate pencil like this?

At one point in¬†time, Oculus had support for OS X in the pipeline; in fact previous Rift dev kits supported Macs. As time went on, however, it was decided that the Oculus Rift would be Windows-only, at least initially. It‚Äôs with Luckey‚Äôs comments, and the lack of initial OS X support in mind, that I‚Äôve¬†decided to put together a Hackintosh machine that meets the minimum requirements outlined by Oculus, yet can still run OS X. In theory, this machine could support the Oculus Rift if the necessary software was¬†made available for OS X. It can run the Rift now if you install a Windows partition on it‚Ä¶ Minimum hardware requirements for Oculus Rift Here are the minimum requirements as outlined by Oculus: Intel i5-4590 equivalent or greater NVIDIA GTX 970 or AMD 290 equivalent or greater 8GB¬†of RAM HDMI 1.3 (or higher) video output Two¬†USB 3.0 ports Hackintosh build hardware As you can see, the hardware that I‚Äôve selected below meets the requirements outlined above. My goal was to build a Hackintosh for under $1,000¬†that met the requirements for Oculus. You can feel free to substitute other hardware in to save money. For instance, if you already have a USB 3.0 drive with at least 8GB of capacity, you can use that instead of purchasing a new USB drive. Keep in mind, however, that some items on this list were specifically selected because they meet the minimum requirements outlined for the Oculus Rift. In other words, you don‚Äôt want to stray too far, because compatibility issues can arise. Video overview Read Part II In the future, I plan on improving this build with additional RAM, better SSD, etc. Of course, I could always go with a faster graphics card as well, likely something from AMD since those cards provide noticeable performance increases for¬†apps like Final Cut Pro X. It can be tedious, but the beauty of building your own PC is that it‚Äôs totally customizable and can be upgraded over time. Intel Core i5-4590¬†(6M Cache, 3.3 GHz)¬†‚Äì¬†$198.99 I opted for an Intel Core i5 processor, because it was relatively inexpensive and still packed a nice punch. Although quite a few in the Hackintosh community have adopted¬†Skylake CPUs¬†to work in their builds, I wanted something that has been tested through and through. More importantly, the Core i5-4590 meets Oculus‚Äô recommended specs. Gigabyte H97 Extreme Multi Graphics Support UEFI DualBIOS Micro ATX DDR3 1600 LGA 1150 Motherboard¬†‚Äì¬†$82.99 The folks over at Tonymacx86 recommend this board, which is good enough for me. I decided to go with mATX for expandability, but I almost wish I would have stuck with my first inclination of going Mini-ITX, since it results in a smaller footprint. That said, it‚Äôs nice to know that the video card I selected would fit with no issues, and I have lots of room for additional RAM. Crucial Ballistix Tactical 8GB DDR3 1600 MT/s (PC3-12800)¬†‚Äì¬†$47.87 Ballistix Tactical RAM is proven to work well in Hackintosh builds. I opted for 8GB, which is Oculus‚Äô minimum requirement. EVGA GeForce GTX 970 4GB SC GAMING, Silent Cooling Graphics Card¬†‚Äì¬†$337.99 The GTX 970 meets Oculus‚Äô minimum spec for video cards. It‚Äôs also a card that works well in Hackintosh builds. I do plan on at least trying an AMD card since those cards work so much better for Final Cut Pro X. Samsung 850 EVO 250GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD¬†‚Äì¬† $86.99 I didn‚Äôt need a huge amount of space for a boot drive, so I opted for the 250GB Samsung 850. It‚Äôs a proven drive that plays nice with Hackintosh rigs. If you want to spend a more for a larger drive, there are 500GB and 1TB options available as well. TP-LINK TL-WDN4800 Dual Band Wireless N900 PCI Express Adapter,2.4GHz450Mbps/5Ghz 450Mbps¬†‚Äì¬†$36.95 Although the TP-LINK works well, it features an Atheros chipset which doesn‚Äôt work with OS X‚Äôs Continuity features. That‚Äôs not a huge deal in my eyes, but there are other options that I plan on considering sometime down the road. IO Gear Bluetooth 4.0 USB Micro Adapter ‚Äì $11.29 This little guy is cheap, and works out of the box with my Hackintosh build. It lets me connect my Magic Mouse to my Hackintosh with ease. Sentey Xplus Power Supply 725 Watt¬†‚Äì¬†$44.99 I went with this power supply because it was cheap and outputs plenty of power for my rig. I cheaped¬†out on this, but I wish I would have gone with a modular power supply that was a bit quieter. This supply works well, but there are cleaner¬†and quieter options available¬†that I plan on investigating in the future. Thermaltake CORE V21 Black Extreme Micro ATX Cube Chassis¬†‚Äì¬† $59.90 There is a ton¬†of room inside of this¬†case and plenty of room for multiple 2.5‚Ä≥ and 3.5‚Ä≥ drives. That being said, this case is a little larger than I expected. Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo CPU Cooler ‚Äì $29.40 I wanted a CPU cooler¬†that would keep my processor nice and cool, and I didn‚Äôt want to opt for the stock cooler that Intel included with the Core i5. The Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo has great ratings, and does a good job of keeping the CPU nice and chill. PNY Turbo 32GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive ‚Äì $9.99 The flash drive is used to house the software tools that you‚Äôll need to get your Hackintosh going. I like these, because they include LED activity lights. Of course, if you already have USB flash drives with at least 8GB of storage, you can skip out on this. Case Speaker for POST ‚Äì $5.49 The Thermaltake case lacks an on board case speaker, which is a necessity in my opinion. Having a speaker lets you hear beeps for POST, which helps you to troubleshoot the boot process. Since Hackintoshes usually require some granular tinkering, you should definitely add a case speaker to your repertoire¬†if your case lacks one. AmazonBasics Wired Keyboard¬†‚Äì $14.64 Unless your Bluetooth keyboard setup has access at the BIOS/UEFI¬†level, chances are you‚Äôll need a hard-wired keyboard. Amazon makes a cheap keyboard, but if you have a USB keyboard somewhere around the house, then just use that one instead. Approximate total¬†hardware cost (as of this post): $968. I‚Äôve created a full wish list that allows you to see all of the products outlined above on a single page. Keep in mind that hardware costs do fluctuate, so it‚Äôs entirely possible that the price may be a little bit higher or a little bit lower. Generally speaking, the price should lessen as time goes on. Software OS X El Capitan¬†‚Äì Free for Mac¬†users. Note: you will need access to a Mac to create the UniBeast boot disk. UniBeast¬†‚Äì Free (Registration required) MultiBeast¬†‚Äì Free¬†(Registration required) More to come My main motivation behind this build was to create a workable Mac that featured internal components capable of driving an Oculus Rift. While it‚Äôs true that Oculus isn‚Äôt planning on supporting the Mac at this time, the point is that there are ‚ÄúMacs‚Äù that feature the hardware required to drive the Rift, they just aren‚Äôt Macs in the traditional sense. We‚Äôre publishing this now, ahead of the build post, so that you can buy the parts needed for building your own and have them ship in time for the next video. In the next post in this series, I‚Äôll walk you through the software install¬†of this Hackintosh build, including any issues or errors that I encountered during the process. As it stands now, I‚Äôm fairly happy with this build. It takes patience, but building your very own Hackintosh is a doable feat. Keep in mind that you can also dual boot Windows, which makes for a more than capable gaming rig that can outright drive the Oculus Rift with no issues. Stay tuned for more posts in this series, including a software¬†how to, and additional exploration into the exciting world of Hackintosh.

First, apple machines may not have the most powerful components you can find, but they tend to use newer components than what is on the market. Sure you might find more powerful broadwell chips out there, but using skylake is just going to bump up the price. Second, compare apple‚Äôs prices to what sony used to offer and you‚Äôll find that apple was on par if not cheaper. No wonder why vaio went out of business. Third, look at the resale value. No custom build or pre-built rig gets the same return 5+ years later when compared to an apple product. With apple you don‚Äôt have to compromise, you just get what you pay for.

However I do like the implied purpose of this news story: Apple had better release a real desktop computer, not a laptop wrapped in a screen, or it is going to lose market share fast. VR is not some passing fad. It is going to be huge and you can‚Äôt do it on a Mac. LikeLiked by 1 person Rich Davis (@RichDavis9) - 10 months ago Reply I‚Äôm sure Apple will release new products that will have the proper GPU to run this, it‚Äôs just a matter of time. As far as VR? Right now, it‚Äôs a small market. I don‚Äôt really see it as taking over the world type of product. Look at the failure of GoogleGlass. It failed. Even Sony‚Äôs version hasn‚Äôt done anything. It‚Äôs just not needed by everyone. It‚Äôs a novelty gaming device, it reminds me of 3D TV, it was exciting in the beginning, but the reality is that people simply don‚Äôt really use 3D glasses when watching TV. I see it as a POTENTIAL device for engineering people, but for anything else? it‚Äôs more of a novelty type product. As far as Apple‚Äôs concerned, having the GPU is just a matter of time. Right now, Apple is just caught in that time period where they don‚Äôt have a computer with the GPU that Oculus requires, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they won‚Äôt. I‚Äôm sure the upcoming MacPro upgrade, when that hits the market, it will will. I also see future laptops and iMacs having powerful enough GPU‚Äôs to run things like this, but it‚Äôs just a matter of time on when they‚Äôll release those products. It‚Äôs not like people are lining up to buy these things. So, there is time, it‚Äôs not the end of the world by any stretch of the imagination. Well all see what new Macs are released in the upcoming months. Apple is in the middle of clearing out inventories of current Macs which happens right before a new product refresh. And if it makes you feel any better, I believe Apple is in R&D of their own similar product. When and if they make that announcement is anyone‚Äôs guess, but based on recent Tim Cook remarks, they might have something next year. Remember, all of this stuff is very much in it‚Äôs infancy. Even Microsoft is only taking orders for $3,000 Development versions of Halolens, and there really aren‚Äôt that many games to actually run, so it‚Äôs got many years until this market matures. I personally don‚Äôt have a NEED for these things. I also don‚Äôt know anyone that‚Äôs really that interested in them either. Gamers? They will buy anything they can brag about to their friends as that goes with the territory. What cracks me up is they are only using an i5 processor, how special is that? It‚Äôs just the GPU, which is forth coming. That‚Äôs the ONLY thing that Apple doesn‚Äôt have currently. By the end of the year, probably most, if not all, of their products will have been refreshed and we‚Äôll see which ones have the GPU‚Äôs to run this specific device, which is only one brand. To say that Apple doesn‚Äôt have a REAL computer is just nonsense. They have REAL computers, they just don‚Äôt have one with the GPU requirements of this specific device. They have computers with much better CPU‚Äôs than this thing needs, so that‚Äôs not the issue. It‚Äôs just the GPU and nothing else.

I would say that of ALL of the current PC‚Äôs that are owned and in use, that only less than 1% have the requirements to run this thing. That‚Äôs not saying much about the PC market either. Most PC‚Äôs don‚Äôt come with a proper GPU to run this device either, and there are a ton of PC‚Äôs that can‚Äôt run it. How many laptops are there that have the GPU requirements to run this device? Do you have a list of them? if there are, there‚Äôs not a lot of different models and they are most likely very expensive laptops that most people aren‚Äôt buying.

Also, don‚Äôt give away or reset your old phone until you are happy that all your information and content has been saved to your new phone. iOS to iOS Apple makes it very simple to switch to a new phone. If you haven‚Äôt got automatic backups to the cloud switch on your iPhone, you need to back up the phone to the cloud first or connect it to iTunes and back everything up to your laptop through iTunes. Depending on which option you choose, there will be certain things you will still have to redownload. With iCloud backups, for example, you won‚Äôt be able to back up things that are already in the cloud, such as your photos (if you use iCloud Photo Library), Touch ID settings, and your iCloud Music Library and App Store content. Music or apps you bought through iTunes can be redownloaded if needed, and the backup should take care of app data. With iTunes backups, you‚Äôll have to redownload iTunes and App Store content, unless you transfer purchases during your backup when prompted. You will also have to resync your music, videos and books you imported to your device through iTunes, and set up Touch ID again. Health, activity and keychain data will only be backed up if you choose encrypted backups. ADVERTISEMENT Once you have the backup sorted, it‚Äôs simply a case of telling iCloud (or iTunes) to hand over the backup. Through iCloud: Turn on your new device. You should see a ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen. Follow the on-screen prompts until you reach the wifi screen. Log into your local wifi network and follow prompts until you get to the Apps & Data screen. Tap Restore from iCloud Backup>Next. You‚Äôll be prompted to sign in with your Apple ID, and then choose a backup. You may be prompted to sign into iTunes or the App Store. Once you‚Äôve done this, the backup will start to install on your device. Leave it connected to wifi until everything has downloaded and you are happy all your content is there. Through iTunes: Switch on the new phone and wait for the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen. Follow the on-screen prompts until you reach the Apps & Data screen. Choose Restore from iTunes Backup>Next. Connect your new iPhone to the PC where you backed up your old phone. Open iTunes and click on your device icon. You‚Äôll be shown a screen with the option to restore backup, and shown a list of backups available. Yours will (most likely) be the most recent backup available. Then walk away, have a cup of tea, catch up on some Netflix and let the software do its work. You can then sync your iPhone with iTunes to get any content - music, movies, etc - that didn‚Äôt find their way back. This week we‚Äôre talking about . . . toys that spy on you Last minute tech gifts ‚Äì plus where to find them today Bitcoin heads for biggest weekly jump since June Android to iOS Given that Android and iOS are both trying to poach each other‚Äôs customers, there is no surprise that changing your phone from one to the other has become a simpler process. In 2015, Apple introduced a new app, Move to iOS, that would help to shift Android customers to Apple more quickly and easily. If your new device is running iOS 9 or greater - we‚Äôre up to iOS 10 now so it should - and your old Android device is Android 4.0 or greater, you can use the app to move everything across. Go to the Google Play store on your Android phone and search for Move to iOS. Install the app. On your new iPhone, begin the setup for the phone from the ‚ÄúHello‚Äù screen. But when you get to the Apps & Data page, select Move Data from Android. On your Android device, open the Move to iOS app. Tap Continue, check out the terms and conditions and tap Agree>Next. On your iOS device, you‚Äôll see a screen called Move from Android. Tap continue, then wait for the code to appear. Enter the code on your Android device, and you‚Äôll be directed to Transfer Data screen. Select the content you want to move - contacts, message history, photos, mail, calendars, free apps if available - then tap next, and leave the two devices to do their work. Wait until the loading bar on your iPhone finishes, regardless of what your Android device tells you. Once everything has transferred, continue to set up your iOS device through the onscreen prompts. iOS to Android You can bring your photos, music and contacts with you from iOS to Android, though any paid apps will unfortunately be left behind. To backup your images, all you need to do is download Google Photos. You will get 15GB of space between all your Google services, including Google Drive, if you want to keep the photos at their original resolution; accept a little compression and you can back up unlimited images to your Google account through Google Photos. Open the Google Photos app. If you have a Gmail account, sign in to the service with that username and password. Clink Menu in the top left corner, then select Settings>Backup & Sync and turn on backup & sync. All your photos will be uploaded to the cloud. ADVERTISEMENT To backup your iTunes music, you will need access to a PC where you have your iTunes account. Download Play Music manager here and install it on your PC. You will need to sign in with your Google ID. During setup, you will be asked where you store your music. Choose iTunes, and select upload all songs and playlists. Once you have it all installed and ready to go, you can upload up to 50,000 songs to your account, which can be accessed on any device, and you can still use your iTunes account if you wish. Contacts are the other thing everyone needs. As an iPhone user you‚Äôll likely have been using iCloud to keep your contacts synced, but you can transfer them to Google. On a desktop PC or laptop, open iCloud.com and log in with iCloud ID. Choose Contacts, which will open your list of numbers and email addresses saved to your account. Choose All Contacts, and click on the gear icon in the bottom left corner. Choose Select All. Then click the gear icon again, and select Export vCard. All your contacts will now be saved as a VCF file, which you can upload directly to your Google account. Log into your Google account on your PC. Go to Google.com/contacts and select Import from the menu on the lefthand side of the screen. Choose the location of the VCF file you saved, and click Import. You will now see a list of contacts in your Google account. Android to Android If you are moving to a new Android handset, it can be a relatively simple procedure. When you start the setup of your new handset, many will ask if you want to restore your information from a backup, and give you the option of specific backups in a drop down menu. That should bring settings, app data and so on over to your new phone. To make sure it is enabled on your old phone, go to Settings>Backup and reset and select back up my data. That will back up your phone to the cloud. Contacts and photos are likely to already be saved in your Google account, but if not, you can sync all your contacts on your old phone by going to Settings>Accounts>Google and choose your Gmail account address. Check Sync contacts is checked. You can also force a sync by pressing Sync Now. Images that are on your phone are probably already saved to Google Photos, but if not, you can set it up easily. If Google Photos isn‚Äôt included on your handset, download the app from the Play Store. Open the Google Photos app and tap the menu icon. Tap Settings>Back up & sync. Turn it on. To do an immediate backup, click Backup & sync>back up all. If all else fails, you can transfer contacts, photos, videos and other content by Bluetooth, although it can be a time consuming project. Apps that don‚Äôt make the cut can be redownloaded from the Play Store, or you can log in on a desktop, go to play.google.com/apps, log in to your Google account to see what apps you‚Äôve downloaded or bought in the past, and choose which ones you want to install on your new phone. Once your new handset has an internet connection, the download will start automatically. ¬† ¬† ¬† Topics: Apple Google Icloud Netflix Read More Irish parents warned over internet-connected toys The ultimate Christmas tech survival guide SME satisfaction in Government continues to fall Meath council ‚Äòcyberattack‚Äô was just old-fashioned fraud Nokia sues Apple in Germany and US for infringing patents Subscribe. ¬† More from The Irish Times Economy Nearly everybody paid their property tax last year Technology CES 2017: Anglers get a helping hand from PowerRay Pro12 Johnny Sexton cruises on return as Leinster hammer sorry Zebre Innovation Wexford teen creates iOS app for US software giant Salesforce Sponsored Making a difficult fertility journey a lot less lonely Redbreast Lustau: an old friend with a new whiskey perspective Infertility and the workplace: one woman's experience Do you know how much you‚Äôll save by switching health plan?

By Emily Bary October 17, 2016 Text Size Regular Medium Large You wouldn‚Äôt put discount tires on your new Tesla, so maybe you‚Äôre wary of using budget accessories for your fancy Apple products. But fear not, you don‚Äôt actually need to splurge on Apple‚Äôs own overpriced chargers and cables to take proper care of your iDevices. I learned that the hard way last week after dropping more than $300 on various Apple accessories for my new apartment, only to later find high-quality knock-offs on Amazon for only $125. It‚Äôs no secret that Amazon offers cheaper versions of most tech essentials, but many break easily, charge slowly, or pose safety hazards. Still, there are bargain cables and adapters that work like the originals and won‚Äôt break the bank. Here are four knock-offs that will save you money, and one Apple accessory where it‚Äôs worth it to splurge on the brand name. I ended up buying four USB power adapters from Apple, including a 12W one that charges the iPad efficiently. This came to $76, or $19 each. Here‚Äôs where I could have saved big: Barron‚Äôs has tested a $24 5-port USB charger from Anker for a year and found that it holds up well and charges devices quickly. The adapter plugs into the wall and can charge up to five devices at once while providing each one with the maximum amount of power that the device accepts. And, it only uses up a single wall outlet. I‚Äôd need to use up three outlets to charge my iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch at the same time, which would require a power strip, an additional cost, if I wanted them all to charge by my bed. Even without the power strip, I would have saved $50 by going with Anker‚Äôs cheaper, all-in-one solution. Lightning cables can be tricky. Third-party ones wear easily, but then again, so do Apple‚Äôs own cables. The key thing is to buy an Apple-certified cord, since others might damage your device or fail to charge it. Anker makes a popular one for $10, about half the price of Apple‚Äôs. I like charging my phone in a dock when it‚Äôs on my desk, so I can more easily see the phone screen while getting work done. Apple‚Äôs lightning dock costs $49, but the lightning cable and optional adapter are separate. For $20, I could have gotten G-Cord‚Äôs well-reviewed aluminum charging station for the iPhone, with an Apple-certified lightning cable included. The dock isn‚Äôt as spiffy as Apple‚Äôs, because it has G-Cord‚Äôs logo displayed on the front, but it is aluminum and it would have saved me $30. I also needed two HDMI cables for Apple TVs. Here there is absolutely no reason to buy the $19 Apple ones. Amazon‚Äôs 5-star cords come in at $9 dollars each. I‚Äôd save about $20 when buying two. Amazon sells cheap knock-offs of my MacBook Pro charger, for a little more than $25 instead of the $79 Apple charges. In this case, though, stick with the Apple version. Given how much power a laptop charger demands, it‚Äôs worth the extra cash to stick with a reputable company for safety reasons. As for Apple Watch chargers, there don‚Äôt appear to be too many third-party ones offered, and you don‚Äôt save much by getting one. Poweradd makes an Apple Watch stand that comes with a charging cable and costs about the same as Apple‚Äôs version. While the stand might be a nice touch, stick with Apple here too.

Man attacked by young woman outside Bridlington pub 1 When is Twelfth Night and why is it unlucky not to take... 1 Days out review: Yorkshire's Winter Wonderland 1 So, you've got that new smartphone or tablet you wanted and now you need to get busy filling it with the best apps. Only problem is, there are so many to choose from and the hype around big titles does not always match the reality. Take Super Mario Run, for example; despite being one of the most eagerly awaited games of 2016, from all reviews so far, it is only scoring two-and-a-half out of five in the Apple store. This year has also seen the rise of virtual reality apps, making use of new, cheap cardboard viewers. If you've picked up a set of VR goggles, then download Google Cardboard and check out the growing number of apps. As it is still early days for smartphone VR, some are more impressive than others, but you're unlikely to discover a better way of impressing gran this Christmas. So whether you're using the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store, here's our pick of the very best of 2016 which your new device really does need to include. Festive fun: Try our fiendish Hull Daily Mail sports quiz for 2016 Best Android apps for your new phone Beyond the usual suspects such as Snapchat and WhatsApp, Google's video-calling app Duo allows you to video call anyone on your contacts list who also has the app - a bit like Skype or Apple FaceTime. Another must-try app this year is Prisma, which uses artificial intelligence to turn your photos into authentic-looking paintings. Google's Top Android Apps of 2016 Google Duo: One-to-one video calling app MSQRD: Live filters and face-swap for video selfies Camera 360 lite version: Beauty camera app Keyboard: Emoji keyboard app 30 Day Fit Challenge Workout: Guided workouts for use at home On the games front, few people will be surprised to hear that this year's most downloaded app was Pokemon Go. If for some reason you've been living under a stone for the past few months, we can tell you that a) Google has awarded it the title of Best Game 2016; and, b) if you're not careful, it can very quickly take over your life. Just make sure you watch where you're going whenever you're near a major road.

With plenty of fantastic free filters built in, you'll be creating highly original, artistic selfies within seconds. Meanwhile, WhatsApp was the most downloaded free app, Face Swap Live was the best selling paid app, and Spotify was the top grossing app of the year. A couple of old favourites are also worth mentioning, especially when you have some time to spare during the holidays: Duolingo is a highly effective, free app that can teach you a foreign language in just five minutes a day - perfect for your lunch break. For the more active among us, Zombies, Run! turns your daily jog into an interactive adventure as you attempt to escape the zombies that are always at your heels, and also works with Apple Watch.

The fiendishly addictive and very surreal Reigns has also also been riding high in the charts this year and while it is one of the simplest games to play - you run a medieval kingdom by swiping left or right to make decisions - it is also one of the hardest, and most fun, to master.

Some apps can only breathe when they have the power and space of the iPad at their elbow. Among them is Heuristic Shakespeare, an interactive experience that helps demystify the works of the Bard with the help of world-class actors - perfect for that family member struggling with their GCSE English. At ¬£4.49 it is not one of the cheapest app, but for that you get Sir Ian McKellen, and for literature fans, it is a real treat. Another one to look out for during the holidays is the BBC iPlayer Kids, which allows you to download the best of CBeebies and CBBC - perfect if you need a bit of piece and quiet after all the Christmas Day madness. When it comes to iPad games, meanwhile, the game of the year was the incredibly cool-looking zombie adventure Severed, in which you take control of a one-armed warrior named Sasha, wielding a living sword on her journey through a nightmare world in search of her family. And for those with strategic minds, try Mini Metro, in which you have to design an underground railway for a growing city; and Invisible, Inc, in which you have to use agents to infiltrate the world's most dangerous corporations through the use of stealth, precision, and teamwork.

Several Withings iOS-compatible products ‚Äî mostly health-related connected accessories ‚Äî have been available at Apple Stores for nearly two years as part of a retail alliance, AppleInsider reported on Saturday. The Withings product sales continued even after the company was acquired by Nokia in April for nearly $190 million. The Withings brand was integrated into Nokia‚Äôs Digital Health unit.¬†‚ÄúNow, the devices made by the Nokia subsidiary are no longer listed on Apple‚Äôs website. Previously, Apple carried a wide range of iOS-compatible Withings devices in its retail stores, including the ‚ÄòBody Cardio Scale‚Äô and ‚ÄòWireless Blood Pressure Monitor,'‚Äù the report added. Five years after Apple and Nokia settled a lawsuit, the tech giants have again locked horns over patents with Apple filing an anti-trust lawsuit against third-party companies Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs) that act on Nokia‚Äôs behalf, and the Finland-based firm suing Apple directly earlier this week.¬†Nokia filed a suit in Europe and the US, claiming Apple is still infringing on Nokia patents. The lawsuit covers 32 patents, including display, user interface, software and video-coding technology.¬†Nokia said that since settling the initial case, Apple has ‚Äúdeclined subsequent offers made by Nokia to license other [parts] of its patented inventions, which are used by many Apple products.‚Äù In its lawsuit, Apple argued that Nokia already has agreements to license its patents for fair and reasonable terms, also know as ‚ÄúFRAND‚Äù (Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory). ‚ÄúBut Nokia is transferring these patents to PAEs in order to aggressively pursue money,‚Äù Apple argued.¬†According to the Cupertino-based tech giant, Nokia has been conspiring with PAEs patent assertion entities (Acacia Research and Conversant Property Management) in an ‚Äúillegal patent transfer scheme‚Äù to wring money out of Apple because Nokia‚Äôs cell phone business is failing. According to the AppleInsider report, Apple has now ‚Äúexpunged all mention of Withings and its product line from the Apple.com online retail database‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhether or not the recent Withings removal is related to Nokia‚Äôs shady legal dealings has yet to be confirmed, but Apple has in the past used its retail might as a retaliatory weapon,‚Äù the report added. In 2011, the two companies settled a patent fight over smartphone technology through a licensing agreement that committed Apple to make a one-time payment to the company and to pay regular royalties in the future, media reported.¬†The companies also agreed to withdraw complaints against each other with the International Trade Commission over the use of intellectual property.

By Charlie Osborne for Zero Day | December 22, 2016 -- 17:53 GMT (09:53 PST) | Topic: Security Roy Zipstein | Apple Apple has given app developers more time to turn on App Transport Security (ATS) after originally insisting that software submitted to the App Store utilize the feature by the beginning of 2017. According to a brief note posted on the Apple developer website on Wednesday, ATS, first introduced in iOS 9 and OS X v10.11, will now not become mandatory for apps to support by the 1 January 2017. Instead, Apple has decided to give developers "additional time to prepare" for the switch and so has extended the original deadline. ATS is a feature of Apple's iOS and OS X operating systems which ensure that applications do not load resources over HTTP connections, which are not secure and may be eavesdropped on by attackers. Instead, ATS requires that resources are loaded through HTTPS, a secure communication protocol often used by other services including online banks and e-commerce websites which encrypts data through Transport Layer Security Layer (TLS). Back in June at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), the tech giant revealed that the security feature would become non-negotiable by January 1, 2017. Currently, ATS is enabled by default but app developers do have the option of disabling the feature.

"This helps instil user trust that your app does not accidentally leak transmitted data to malicious parties." While developers can still create exceptions to the rule and do not have to implement ATS for every transfer, the company recommends that HTTPS should be used exclusively to protect user privacy and data. In 2015, Google faced criticism after bringing the spotlight onto methods to create exceptions for apps to connect to insecure domains -- for the sake of advertising -- despite ATS. While Apple already provided the way to do so in the developer notes, Google was accused of placing advertising above what could be construed as user privacy and interests. No new deadline has been set for developers to utilize ATS, but the iPad and iPhone maker has promised an update when a new date has been confirmed. 2016 Holiday gift guide: Top tech, gadgets...

Whether you've got a first or second-generation Apple Watch, changing and customising the watch face is a doddle. Apple provides a load of options when it comes to new faces, but there's also a bunch of third-party designs on offer to ensure your wrist looks as classy as possible. With that in mind, we thought we'd give you a quick rundown of the whole Apple Watch face thing, and provide all you wearable enthusiasts with some tips on how to quickly change Apple Watch faces and customise their design. Related: Apple Watch 2 review How to change the Apple Watch face First things first, how do you actually change the watch face? Well, it couldn't be any simpler. The easiest way is to swipe left or right, from edge-to-edge, on your watch face. That will cycle through the various watch face designs and you can simply stop when you see something you like the look of. Alternatively, you can hard press ‚Äì or 'Force Touch', to use Apple's terminology ‚Äì on the watch face and it will take you to the face-switching screen. From here, you can swipe left and right to scroll through the various designs. Once you see one you like, just tap it to set it as your new watch face. Related: CES 2017 Customising the Apple Watch face Once you've chosen a design you like, you'll be pleased to learn there are further customisation options you can use to tinker with the watch face design. How do you unlock these marvellous features? Well, it's pretty much the same process as before. Force Touch the watch face display to bring up the switching screen and just tap the 'Customise' button that appears below the watch face itself. Now, you should be able to swipe left and right to highlight a specific part of the watch face. Once you've highlighted the element you want, just turn the digital crown to customise it. This usually means you can change the colour of the specific part of the face you've highlighted. Related: Apple Watch review Apple also allows you to add what it calls 'complications' to the watch face. This term essentially refers to any area of the watch face that provides information other than the time. So, if your chosen face contains information such as the date, fitness data, or music details, you can customise that too. To do so, simply hard press the screen, tap 'Customise', then tap the particular complication you want to edit. Or you can tap 'Customise' then scroll all the way to the left to edit the complications from there. Whichever method you use, just press the digital crown to save the changes you've made, then tap the watch face to set it as your current face. It's also worth noting that not all watch faces are customisable, and not all allow you to add complications. Most designs come with some extra customisability, though. Adding complications The customisation doesn't quite stop there. You can also add more complications and other information from third-party apps to your watch face, depending on which design you've chosen. It's fairly easy to figure out which apps provide Apple Watch complications. Just open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone, tap the My Watch tab, and go to Complications. From here, you can add new complications by tapping the + symbol, or remove them using the - symbol and then tapping Remove. Once you've added a new complication to the Apple Watch app on your iPhone, you should be able to go into the customise screen on the watch itself, select the new complication, and customise it. Making Multiple versions of your watch face Managed to get your watch face looking just how you like? That's wonderful news, but perhaps you're intrigued to see what other breath-taking customisation designs you can come up with. In which case, you'll be delighted to hear you can make multiple versions of your chosen face. Related: Apple Watch tips and tricks All you have to do is hard press the screen when it's on the watch face, then scroll all the way to the right and tap the + symbol. Now, you can just turn the Digital Crown to choose a face, and tap the one you want. You can then customise the face by firmly pressing the display again and tapping Customise. Using this method, you'll be able to add multiple versions of the same watch face and customise each to look a bit different. Isn't technology wonderful? Deleting watch faces If you've had enough of your current watch face, you can always banish it forever. To delete a watch face, hard press the display, then swipe to the face you want to delete. Once you've found it, it's simply a case of swiping up and tapping Remove.

Consumer Reports published a surprise report Thursday saying it could not recommend any new MacBook Pro model due to its erratic, if not bad battery life.¬† "The MacBook Pro battery life results were highly inconsistent from one trial to the next," Consumer Reports said. This is the first time a MacBook hasn't received a "recommended" designation from Consumer Reports. Apple Senior Vice President Phil Schiller followed up with a tweet late Friday saying Apple is "working with CR to understand their battery tests. Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data." In his tweet, Schiller linked to a story from iMore that says Consumer Reports was just going for a pre-Christmas headline and should have done more testing. Consumer Reports' review says that in-house testing revealed wild fluctuations in battery life for unplugged MacBook Pro computers. In the case of the 13-inch model without a Touch Bar, for example, battery life ranged from 19.5 hours to just 4.5 hours. Apple says the devices should operate for up to 10 hours between charges. "The laptops did very well in measures of display quality and performance, but in terms of battery life, we found that the models varied dramatically from one trial to another," Consumer Reports said in a blog post about its MacBook Pro rating. It ended up giving the 15-inch MacBook Pro a score of 56 points out of 100. The 13-inch versions with and without a Touch Bar got 40 and 47, respectively, out of 100. "For the battery test, we download a series of 10 web pages sequentially, starting with the battery fully charged, and ending when the laptop shuts down," the Consumer Reports post reads. "The web pages are stored on a server in our lab, and transmitted over a Wi-Fi network set up specifically for this purpose. We conduct our battery tests using the computer's default browser -- Safari, in the case of the MacBook Pro laptops." The MacBook Pro laptops, released in the fall, haven't been as well-received as Apple would have hoped for due to issues ranging from battery life, cost, dongles required and even alleged staleness. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for more information about battery life tests and Schiller's tweet. Consumer Reports also didn't immediately respond to a requests for comment and confirmation that it's working with Apple.

Image Gallery for Big Apple Greeter reveals secrets and tips for first-timers in NYC Lightbox link Lightbox link Lightbox link Lightbox link Lightbox link As a native New Yorker, a licensed city tour guide and a volunteer Big Apple Greeter, I‚Äôve answered lots of questions from tourists over the years. Among them: ‚ÄúIs it safe to drink the water?‚Äù (Yes.) ‚ÄúWhat does ‚Äòcurb your dog‚Äô mean?‚Äù (Dogs should not use sidewalks as a bathroom.) And my favorite: ‚ÄúWhere are all the supermodels?‚Äù (I don‚Äôt know.) The Big Apple Greeter organization matches out-of-towners with locals for free neighborhood visits and other outings, and as a greeter, I‚Äôve also shepherded tourists from around the world on their first subway rides, visits to Harlem and Brooklyn, and tastes of local delicacies (like bagels). Along the way, I‚Äôve given lots of advice on enjoying the city while staying safe, having fun and sticking to a budget. Here are some tips. Safety Street food is safe to eat. Crime is very low, but safeguard your wallet from pickpockets and don‚Äôt drape your purse over your chair. Many people will accost you, trying to sell you things. Keep walking. It‚Äôs not uncommon to hear of pedestrians hit by bikes or even cars. Look both ways when crossing the street. Use seatbelts in cabs. The best things in New York are free ‚Ä¢Staten Island Ferry. Great views of the Statue of Liberty, Lower Manhattan and New York Harbor. Runs 24 hours a day. Beautiful at night with the city lit up. No. 1 subway to South Ferry or 4 or 5 trains to Bowling Green. ‚Ä¢ 9/11 park. A powerful symbol of the city‚Äôs resilience, with One World Trade rising above. Reflecting pools built in the footprints of the twin towers are a moving tribute to those who perished. Be sure to stop at the Survivor Tree. Check out the Oculus nearby, a cool and curious white-winged structure with shops and eateries inside. ‚Ä¢ Walk across the Brooklyn Bridge. Take the C or A train to the High Street stop on the Brooklyn side and walk back to Manhattan. ‚Ä¢ Central Park. New Yorkers live in tiny apartments. City parks are our collective backyards. Enter at 59th Street and Fifth Avenue, just north of the Manhattan White House, aka Trump Tower. ‚Ä¢ The High Line. This vertical park built on an old rail line 30 feet above the street runs for about a mile from 34th Street west of 10th Avenue to just below 14th Street. Expect crowds. ‚Ä¢ Grand Central, 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue. Notice the famous four-faced clock, cathedral windows, grand staircases and zodiac signs in the ceiling. A black rectangle in the northwest corner of the ceiling is a reminder of the days prior to a 1990s renovation when the entire ceiling was black from decades of tobacco smoke. ‚Ä¢ Times Square. New Yorkers hate this place. Under new rules, tip-hungry costumed characters and half-naked painted women must stay confined to a teal-colored zone. The subway It‚Äôs noisy, dirty and confusing but generally safe and efficient. Chances are you will encounter homeless people, panhandlers, musicians and trains so crowded you can‚Äôt get on. It runs 24 hours a day, though trains and riders thin out overnight. Trust your gut: If someone is acting strangely or aggressively, make like a New Yorker and walk away. If you bump someone accidentally, a sincere apology is expected. Get a free map from a manned booth. There‚Äôs also a map in every car of every train. Most New Yorkers can provide basic directions but this app is good for route-planning: https://citymapper.com/nyc . Trains are sometimes rerouted on weekends; see http://web.mta.info/weekender.html . Each one-way ride costs $2.75. Best deal is an unlimited seven-day pass for $31. Or put $20 on a regular pay-per-ride MetroCard and the machine will give you a free 11 percent bonus, $2.20, covering 8 rides total. If you pay in cash and don‚Äôt have exact change, you‚Äôll get coins back. If you pay by credit card and you‚Äôre from abroad, type in 99999 as your zip code. There‚Äôs a $1 fee for the card, but you can refill it. Prices are likely to rise in spring 2017. Attractions Buy online timed tickets for attractions when available. Otherwise arrive a half-hour before opening time to reduce your wait. Empire State Building, Top of the Rock or One World Trade observatories? I prefer the first two because they‚Äôre in the middle of Manhattan, whereas much of what you see from One World Trade is the harbor and New Jersey. Many museums schedule a few free hours each week. The Metropolitan Museum of Art lists a suggested admission but you don‚Äôt have to pay it. To me, the Museum of Modern Art‚Äôs permanent collection is worth the steep $25 admission (don‚Äôt miss Van Gogh‚Äôs ‚ÄúStarry Night‚Äù). Neighborhoods A few of my favorites: In Harlem, have a bite at Marcus Samuelsson‚Äôs Streetbird on 116th Street and walk across the neighborhood‚Äôs main street, 125th Street. Joe Shanghai on Pell Street in Chinatown is cheap, crazy, fun and good; be prepared to wait for a table and beware the hot broth inside the pork dumplings. From Chinatown, walk to Little Italy for dessert at Ferrara‚Äôs, 195 Grand St. Hang with the hipsters in trendy Brooklyn: Take the L train to Bedford in Williamsburg or Jefferson in Bushwick. Among many options for great pizza, I like Lombardi‚Äôs, C train to Spring Street.

By: Tech Desk | Updated: December 27, 2016 7:38 pm Consumer Reports‚Äô team conducted tests on the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar and a 15-inch MacBook Pro. Apple‚Äôs new MacBook Pro series did not receive recommended ratings from Consumer Reports. The site, which conducted several tests on MacBook Pro 2016 series to evaluate display, performance etc noted that battery life of the laptops were ‚Äòhighly inconsistent‚Äô. However, Apple‚Äôs Senior Vice President Phil Schiller said the results do not match company‚Äôs extensive lab tests. Schiller tweeted out saying, ‚ÄúWorking with CR to understand their battery tests. Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data.‚Äù He attached a link to an imore article as well. Consumer Reports‚Äô team conducted tests on the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar and a 15-inch MacBook Pro. The report insists they tested battery life on these laptops repeatedly and averaged those results together to come to a final battery score. ‚ÄúThe MacBook Pro battery life results were highly inconsistent from one trial to the next,‚Äù the report reads. Check out the tweet here: Working with CR to understand their battery tests. Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data. http://t.co/IWtfsmBwpO ‚Äî Philip Schiller (@pschiller) December 24, 2016 Consumer Reports has talked about its battery tests in detail: ‚ÄúFor instance, in a series of three consecutive tests, the 13-inch model with the Touch Bar ran for 16 hours in the first trial, 12.75 hours in the second, and just 3.75 hours in the third. The 13-inch model without the Touch Bar worked for 19.5 hours in one trial but only 4.5 hours in the next. And the numbers for the 15-inch laptop ranged from 18.5 down to 8 hours,‚Äù the report reveals. It adds the laptops fail to meet Consumer Reports‚Äô standards for recommended models, owing to disappointing battery results. It is worth noting these are the first set of MacBooks to not receive recommended ratings from Consumer Reports. The report revealed their methodology of conducting battery tests as well. It put out a step-by-step procedure of how they performed the tests. Consumer Report notes the performance of a device can be influenced by a software update and thus they performed¬†the battery tests again after macOS Sierra 10.12.2 was released. However, according to the report, the update did not make any difference in the results. Apple unveiled its new MacBook Pro series at its event on October 27. Apple‚Äôs newest MacBook Pro is the thinnest and lightest one yet. The function key on the keyboard in the new MacBook Pro has been replaced by a new ‚ÄòRetina-quality‚Äô multi-touch display known as the Touch Bar. Apple claims the MacBook Pro features the ‚Äòbrightest and most colourful Retina display yet‚Äô with 500 nits of brightness, which Apple claims is 67 per cent brighter than the previous generation. The device starts at Rs 1,29,900 for the 13-inch variant (256GB) without the TouchBar. The one with TouchBar costs Rs 1,55,900 for the 256GB version and Rs 1,72,900 for the 512GB storage option. The 15-inch display variant of Apple MacBook Pro is available in India at Rs 2,05,900 for 256GB storage variant. The 512GB option costs Rs 2,41,900. ¬© The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: Apple Best of Express Model Code of Conduct: EC asks Govt to respond to Opposition's Budget delay demand EntertainmentOm Puri passes away after a massive heart attack, funeral at 6 pm EntertainmentDangal box office collection day 15: Aamir Khan film sets new benchmarks for industry EntertainmentSwami Om out of Bigg Boss 10 for peeing on contestants.

Skip to content SAT Press Releases pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Submit the press release Our Team & Contact Posted on December 25, 2016December 25, 2016 by Monika Donimirska Nintendo Needs Apple, but Apple Also Needs Nintendo Image source: Nintendo. There‚Äôs a lot of Nintendo (NASDAQOTH: NTDOY) ¬†going on at Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) ¬†these days. Super Mario Run ‚Äî Nintendo‚Äôs first mobile app devoted to its signature side-scrolling gaming franchise ‚Äî made its debut exclusively on devices running Apple‚Äôs iOS last week with record-setting success. This week we saw Pokemon Go introduced for Apple Watch, also exclusively for Apple‚Äôs smartwatch. Nintendo reports that there were 40 million downloads of Super Mario Run through Apple‚Äôs App Store in its first four days of availability. The record-breaking pace followed a third-party report that just 25 million downloads had taken place in that time. Heavy initial activity doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean Nintendo has a financial hit on its hands. Super Mario Run is a free download, and a third-party report indicates that fewer than 10% of the players downloading the game have paid over the $10 price to unlock more features and loosen up restrictions. Super Mario Run is drumming up mixed reviews, but a lot of the knocks have to do with the limitations for the free account. There‚Äôs no doubt we‚Äôll be hearing mixed reviews for the Pokemon Go Apple Watch app, but in this case mostly on the restrictions of the small smartwatch screens in duplicating this summer‚Äôs hot app experience. An unlikely pairing Image source: Niantic Labs. It makes sense for Nintendo to team up with Apple to make sure that Super Mario Run and a smartwatch version of Pokemon Go hit the market on Apple devices first. Android has the wider established base, but Apple fans spend money. Aiming for iPhone and iPad owners with Super Mario Run is a bet that folks will pay $10 for a mobile game if it‚Äôs iconic enough. The Apple Watch move with Pokemon Go is simply a matter of riding the only smartwatch platform that matters. Still, it‚Äôs an odd partnership, considering where this relationship stood just a few years ago.¬†Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime had some choice words in attacking Apple back in 2010 , when it seemed as if Apple‚Äôs gadgetry was eating into the popularity of Nintendo‚Äôs portable system. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt look like their platform is a viable profit platform for game development, because so many of the games are free versus paid downloads,‚Äù Fils-Aime said at the time. Fils-Aime also dismissed mobile gaming as a niche where gamers were treated to just snacks instead of hearty meals. A lot has changed now that Nintendo is turning to Apple gamers first, and shareholders are seeing the difference. Nintendo stock soared 29% the day Apple unveiled Super Mario Run , a big deal since it stands to make a lot more money this time than it does with its minority stake in Pokemon Go . However, we can‚Äôt dismiss what Apple stands to gain here. Nintendo‚Äôs preference to iOS vindicates the premium consumers pay for Apple products. The $10 price point for the premium version of the game should also educate users to pay more for their mobile diversions. Both companies have a lot riding on this month‚Äôs new Nintendo iOS releases. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Now give me back my iPhone! Farhad Manjoo facebook SHARE twitter TWEET email google-plus linkedin reddit More Six years ago, Google launched an unconventional effort to gain a toehold in the growing smartphone business. Rather than make its own phones, the way Apple was beginning to do, the search company decided to make only half a phone: just the software to run the device, not the device itself. Google planned to give its operating system, called Android, to phone makers for free, and it would let them alter the OS in any way they liked. Google thought that in the long run, the plan would pay off in two ways. First, it believed a free OS would push phone makers to create better web-enabled phones, and better phones would let people spend more time on the internet. More time online means more opportunities to use Google's service and see Google ads - i.e., ka-ching! Android also provided a strategic benefit: if phone makers adopted Google's OS, the search company would retain some influence on the devices people used to get its services. If it weren't for Android, Google's customers would have been using devices controlled by Apple, Microsoft, Nokia or RIM, all of which had incentives to limit Google's reach. Android lets Google control its own destiny. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Superior: Apple's iPhone 5.¬† The strategy worked brilliantly. Android is now the world's most popular mobile operating system. It's unclear if Google makes much money from Android directly - by some estimates Google makes as much from ads on Apple's iOS devices as it does on Android machines. But there's no question that Android has helped lower the prices of smartphones across the globe, which can only help Google's ad business. It's hard to call Android anything other than a resounding success. Well, except for one small thing: most Android phones are lousy. As part of a New Year's resolution, I promised to trade in my beloved iPhone 5 for an Android phone sometime in 2013. I reasoned that, as a tech writer, I should spend more time with the world's most popular operating system. Phone makers and carriers have regularly sent me Android phones to test out in the past, but I'd never given most of them more than a passing look - I'd open them up, turn them on, get aggravated by their bad keyboards or poor touchscreens or frustrating add-on software, and I immediately package them up and send them back. This shouldn't be surprising - most Android phones are very cheap, and you get what you pay for. Over the last few months, though, I've been testing two of the most expensive, most advanced Android phones on the market, the Samsung Galaxy S4 and the HTC One. Actually, I've been doing more than that. I've been using two versions of each of these phones - the standard phone and a second "Google Play edition", which is a special version that features only the essential software you need on a smartphone. I've been switching among these four devices, using one or the other as my primary phone at all times. Except for the brief period during which I tested out Apple's new version of iOS, my iPhone hasn't been charged in weeks, poor guy. Altogether I experienced the best and worst of Android - and I saw, up close, Android's basic problem. I'd sum it up as follows. Google makes a fine mobile operating system. Some phone manufacturers make attractive, powerful Android handsets. These phones have the potential to be really wonderful machines, even as great as Apple's flagship phone. But then, at the last second, the phone makers and the world's mobile carriers snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. They ruin the phones' potential with unnecessary features and apps that lower the devices' battery life, uglify their home screens, and make everything you want to do extra annoying. Advertisement This is one of the most important advantages Apple has over Android devices. When you buy an iPhone, it works exactly as Apple intended; it's never adulterated by "features" that the company didn't approve. But when you buy an Android phone, even a really great one, you're not getting the device that Google's designers had in mind when they created the OS. You're not even getting the device that the phone manufacturer - Samsung and HTC, in this case - had in mind. Instead you're getting a bastardised version, a phone replete with software that has been altered by many players along the way, usually in a clumsy, money-grubbing fashion. I noticed this immediately when I first turned on the (US telco) Sprint-powered HTC One and Galaxy S4. When you run an iPhone for the first time, you've go through just a handful of steps to get up and running: choose a language, add a Wi-Fi network and log in to your Apple account. The same is true of the Google editions of the One and S4 - just a few prompts and you're good to go. But not the mobile carrier versions. I had to sit through more than half a dozen screens. I was pushed to sign in to several social-networking accounts. I had to create accounts with HTC or Samsung's own services. Then, when I thought I was at last ready to start using my phone, another prompt came on the screen to let me know that Sprint was installing some software of its own. After another five minutes, my phone was finally ready to use - but when I browsed through the menus, there was a whole bunch of software that I didn't need, including apps for Yahoo!, Amazon, the NBA, a Sprint app for watching TV and a White Pages app. Why these apps specifically? Not because Sprint believes that you'll find them really helpful, but instead because it received a promotional fee. Congratulations on your new phone - now look at all the ads. You might not consider these preloaded apps such a big deal. We're all used to getting crapware on new PCs; this is the same story, just on phones, and it's not such a big hassle to delete everything you don't need. But you shouldn't have to delete stuff just to get your phone looking like you want it. Plus, I suspect that many users probably don't even know how to delete these apps, so they just sit there, clogging up the home screen. The worst thing about Android phones isn't the crapware, though. It's the "skins" ‚Äì the modifications that phone companies make to Android's most basic features, including the dialling app, contacts, email, the calendar, the notification system, and the layout of the home screen. If you get the Play edition of these phones, you'll see Google's version of each of these apps, and you'll come away impressed by Google's tasteful, restrained, utilitarian design sense. But if, like most people, you get your phone from a carrier, you'll find everything in it is a frightful mess. Google's dialling app, for instance, uses a minimalist palette and big, readable, sans-serif numbers. Samsung's is a garish shock of mismatched colours, lines and shadows. It's not just hideous but less functional. In the contacts pane, Google's dialler smartly displays people's names and numbers; you can dial just by touching the number. In Samsung's dialler, you've got to tap a contact's name, which brings up a new screen, which you've got to tap again to make a phone call. Meanwhile, if you click on a number in the call log, Samsung's dialler doesn't do the obvious thing and dial the number ‚Äì¬†instead it shows you another screen, and to dial the number you've to press the green phone icon, which isn't immediately obvious. There are lots of annoying nuisances like this one, in which Samsung or HTC took Google's easy-to-use design and monkeyed with it for no good reason. Together, all these little bugs add up to a frustrating experience. In most cases, you can fix the problem; you can replace Samsung or HTC's apps with Google's version, you can remove the unnecessary stuff from your home screen, you can opt-out of flashy but terrible gimmicky features (such as the totally useless "eye tracking" system in the Galaxy S4). But doing so is too much of a hassle for people who just want a phone that works right out of the box. If that's what you want, you've got two choices. You can pay full price for a Play edition Android device (I'd choose the HTC One over the Galaxy S4, because it's much more attractive, physically). Or you can buy an iPhone. Because I'm eligible for an upgrade with my carrier, I'd rather not pay full price for a Play edition Android. So, New Year's resolution be damned, I'm sticking with Apple.

Today TRVL, a team of¬†a dozen staffers in Amsterdam and eight developers and designers¬†in Rotterdam, announces its updated app for iOS. The update¬†delivers more content, including photo galleries and four or five fresh¬†stories a¬†day (instead of one ‚Äúmagazine‚Äù every week, as before). The frequent crashes are supposed to stop. A search function has been added. Maps now load faster. And so forth. The three-year delay in updating the app is partly blamed on many of the tech team having been acqui-hired by Apple to help build out the launch of Apple News. Now they‚Äôre back in Europe and working on TRVL again. On the monetization front, TRVL will onboard its booking platform, which nets commissions on hotels and other travel products via Expedia Affiliate Network. In January it will add¬†Booking.com‚Äôs inventory of 1¬†million hotels. It will soon start comparing prices of Booking.com, Expedia, and Hotels.com in real-time with every search result. It will add five currencies, including the euro and the pound, for buying travel. An iPhone version will debut, too. Jochem Wijnands, founder and chief executive, summarized the bigger picture for Tnooz like this: ‚ÄúThis update is a first step to turning the TRVL app¬†into a place where you find inspiration, and our booking engine, and meet local experts that can recommend destinations/hotels/neighborhoods ‚Äòjust for you.‚Äô It will also be where your travel data lives.‚Äù TRVL remains significant as an experiment in presenting magazine-style content in the mobile-first era. In mere months after its debut, it quickly racked up a subscriber base that outpaced the (paying) readerships of many major national travel magazines, though the quality, diversity, and reliability of the content may not have been comparable. The latest changes suggest the final nail in the era of publishers dreaming of building app experiences that readers would pay subscriptions for and that would ‚Äúkeep‚Äù readers inside an app‚Äôs walls. The new TRVL is free, but it has dropped the magazine format pretensions. Soon TRVL will¬†also publish video. It says it will re-introduce long-form stories, but this will not be the same thing as the old dreams. For a while, traditional print publishers raced to create TRVL-like experiences, often by hiring Adobe, but largely without gaining traction with readers. In a Medium blog post, Wijnands notes that non-traditional¬†companies also struggled. ‚ÄúIn September 2015, after we shipped Apple News, I returned from Cupertino. By then, the world of digital publishing had changed dramatically. Newsstand no longer existed. Flipboard was on its way out. Facebook‚Äôs instant articles had launched and paid content as a business model for digital publications was officially dead‚Ä¶.‚Äù ‚ÄúSadly, the online magazine didn‚Äôt survive either.¬†TRVL might be the last manifestation of the hope that once possessed us all when the iPad was invented‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääie., that it was possible to publish online magazines to rival or even better print magazines both in popularity and revenue‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs not what happened. The launch of Newsstand‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbuilt to support legacy publishers‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwas the first sign that things were going wrong. Downloading a 500MB magazine that was nothing more than a PDF of the print version wasn‚Äôt a good experience. This wasn‚Äôt why people had bought an iPad‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúSo, while TRVL as a digital magazine didn‚Äôt seem to have much of a future, we decided that the premises that TRVL was built on most definitely did‚Ä¶.‚Äù Now the industry waits to see if the latest attempts to meet market demands will thrive.

Fitbit Charge 2 Review GO Fitbit Charge reinvented with new design and more features Dec 25, 2016 14:00 GMT ¬†¬∑¬† By Bogdan Popa ¬†¬∑¬† Share:¬† INTRO HARDWARE FEATURES CONCLUSIONS Fitbit continues to be number one in terms of wearable sales, as the company sold a total of 5.3 million units in the third quarter of 2016 for a market share of 23 percent, according to IDC data. Although Apple has improved a lot thanks to the Apple Watch, the Cupertino-based company is only fourth in Q3 2016 charts, with 1.1 million sold units (4.9 percent market share), while Xiaomi and Garmin take the second and the third place, respectively. But in the end, it‚Äôs very clear that Fitbit is by far the leading choice for those looking for new wearables. Earlier this year, the company revamped its product portfolio with new models, including an updated Charge version that it calls‚Ä¶ Charge 2. Built from the very beginning to be super-comfortable to wear, the Charge 2 incorporates Fitbit‚Äôs latest technologies that are also available on the more-expensive Blaze, including PurePulse heart rate monitoring, reminders to move, and SmartTrack for auto exercise recognition. The charge was Fitbit‚Äôs best-selling tracker, so the second generation is expected to continue the success of the original model, and even surpass it thanks to all these upgrades. But can it really do that? Is the Charge 2 worth the $150 (‚Ç¨160) price? Does it have what it takes to be used as a full smartwatch replacement? These are all questions that we‚Äôre going to answer in the next chapters. Fitbit Charge 2 and Fitbit Blaze HARDWARE First and foremost, the Charge 2 comes with an OLED display that provides you with information such as the current time, steps, heart rate, and calories burned. It can also be used for starting a new workout, and you can navigate either by touch or using the only side button. The screen has no colors, and this is particularly important for battery life because Fitbit paid particular attention to how long you can use the tracker. It features a lithium-polymer battery which Fitbit says that can last up to 5 days, but this obviously depends on a number of workouts, such as how often you exercise and how you use the device. The company, however, recommends ‚Äúcharging the device every few days to ensure that you‚Äôre always tracking,‚Äù so it‚Äôs better to charge it every 4 days. As for real-life performance, the 5-day estimate is not at all inaccurate, and during our test, the Charge 2 provided between 3 and 5 days of battery life, again depending on how it was used. The lack of a GPS sensor helps a lot because, on most wearables, GPS is the main battery hog. And thanks to the display and the battery optimizations implemented by Fitbit, the 5-day battery life is not at all far-fetched. The Charge 2 also comes with an optical heart rate tracker which powers what Fitbit calls ‚ÄúPurePUlse Heart Rate,‚Äù a catchy name for a heart activity monitoring with a few extras. There‚Äôs also an altimeter for counting floors, a vibration motor, and a 3-asix accelerometer. If you‚Äôre looking for features like GPS, speakers, microphones, or barometers, they‚Äôre not there because, at this point, Fitbit just wants to go with the essentials and make sure that these are working correctly. Fitbit Charge 2 charger The device comes with interchangeable bands, and you can choose from a large collection, including bands made from metal and from leather. The default one is made from elastomer, similar to what you can find right now on the majority of smartwatches, but it‚Äôs really comfortable to wear all the time. The design of the tracker also contributes to this, and it follows the shape of the wrist in a more natural way than the Microsoft Band 2, for example. There‚Äôs barely any pressure on your wrist, and the only thing that‚Äôs in contact with your skin all the time is the heart rate sensor. The band comes with a surgical-grade stainless steel buckle that keeps the tracker in place all the time, as long as you adjust it correctly. The Fitbit Charge 2 uses Bluetooth LE to connect to your phone, and it can work with iOS, Android, and even Windows smartphones thanks to the dedicated app available on all these platforms. FEATURES If you‚Äôre planning on buying the Charge 2 to use it as a smartwatch, you shouldn‚Äôt do it. Although it does come with some features that you typically find on smartwatches, the Charge 2 is first and foremost an activity tracker that‚Äôs supposed to monitor your workout sessions. It can alert on phone notifications, but support is very basic. For example, the Charge 2 vibrates on new calls, text messages, or calendar events, but it won‚Äôt show emails, WhatsApp or Facebook messages. And it doesn‚Äôt let you interact with calls or messages in any way, so its only purpose is to alert you and then it's up to you yo take further action on the phone. The Charge 2 also supports several clock faces, but there‚Äôs nothing to be super-excited about because most options are pretty basic. You can configure them from the companion Fitbit app on the phone, where you can also find alarms, should you want to use the tracker to wake you up in the morning. If in terms of smartwatch capabilities the Charge 2 does not excel, the activity tracking section is the one that Fitbit has been specifically focused on. Fitbit Charge 2 band First and foremost, the heart rate tracker, which Fitbit calls PurePulse Heart Rate, offers continuous and automatic heart rate monitoring providing statistics and analysis which the company says should help track health and manage stress. Truth be told, the tracker does offer heart rate zones support, which helps you better adjust workouts for cardio or fat burning (a feature that‚Äôs also available on other devices like the Microsoft Band 2 and Samsung Gear Fit 2), but it also comes with readings that could help improve health and fitness. The Fitbit app offers plenty of information on your heart rate statistics, as well as tips to improve cardio fitness and find the best exercises for each individual. As far as exercises are concerned, the Fitbit Charge 2 comes with SmartTrack, a feature that enables auto exercise recognition for a wide array of activities, including biking and hiking. Monitoring starts automatically, and you can always see essential stats on your display while you work out. ‚ÄúSuper comfortable all the time.‚Äù One important thing is that the Charge 2 does not come with a GPS module, but it offers what Fitbit calls ‚ÄúConnected GPS.‚Äù In other words, there‚Äôs no GPS in there, but the tracker can connect to your phone‚Äôs GPS module when a Bluetooth connection is available to provide mapping data and more accurate distance monitoring. This is a double-edged sword because while you can‚Äôt use the tracker without a phone to map your exercise, you actually get longer battery life, which for so many people is essential. The lack of GPS shouldn‚Äôt be a problem if you plan on doing activities like running or biking, as the phone can always be around or in the pocket. The tracker also provides reminders to move to stay in shape. The Charge 2 is configured to ‚Äúconvince‚Äù you to take 250 steps every hour, but the Fitbit companion app lets you disable these reminders. Auto activity tracking seems to be working quite accurately, and during our tests, the Charge 2 correctly tracked my running sessions every time without me manually starting a new workout. But as a general recommendation, it‚Äôs better to do this every time because this way you won‚Äôt lose any stats, as auto recognition might fail to kick in from the very beginning and it could miss a few minutes of your workout session. Fitbit companion app on iOS Sleep tracking is also one of the features that you could find very helpful, but again, we‚Äôve found this to be slightly inaccurate. Basically, sleep monitoring begins when laying down in bed and not when you actually fall asleep. So for example, if every night you‚Äôre watching a couple of episodes of Homeland before you go to bed, there‚Äôs a good chance that sitting relaxed on the couch and watching a movie is actually tracked as sleeping. The Fitbit app also lets you configure your sleep goals, and you can configure bedtime and wakeup time, as well as bedtime reminders to make sure you stick with your schedule. Another helpful feature is guided breathing sessions, which are similar to the Breathe app that‚Äôs available on Apple Watch starting with watchOS 3 update. The tracker guides you to breathe correctly and relax using instructions that are adapted to your real-time heart activity. You can choose between two-minute or five-minute sessions, and you can stop at any moment. ‚ÄúFrequent firmware updates.‚Äù A firmware update that was released in mid-December brought additional features on the Charge 2, including a vibration that guides you throughout the breathing session. Previously, the tracker was displaying visual guidance only, so with this update, the Charge 2's guided breathing feature works similarly to the one on the Apple Watch. Additionally, the same firmware update also brings a new face, but there's nothing to be super excited about because you only get basic information and nothing more. You can also toggle the tracker on silent by muting notifications straight from the device (and not using the phone, and see battery level on the screen (previously, this information was exclusively available on the device itself). THE BOTTOM LINE Let‚Äôs start by making this simple: the Charge 2 is one of the best trackers we‚Äôve tried so far. The best smartwatch? Not so much. Fitbit has never been into smartwatches, and the Charge 2 is the living proof, as it perfectly puts the company‚Äôs focus on activity tracking in the spotlight. There‚Äôs no doubt that the Charge 2 was designed to tackle buyers who are trying to lose weight, stay in shape, or simply adopt a more active lifestyle, but since the times are changing, Fitbit had no other option than to add a few smartwatch capabilities as well. Notification support is very limited, but it's only there because Fitbit absolutely had to do this, mostly because the majority of smartwatches are also expanding in the activity tracking world. So Fitbit did the same thing and tried to step into the smartwatch world with its own activity tracker. But it goes without saying that buyers aren‚Äôt necessarily interested in this, but more in how the Charge 2 keeps track of their workouts. And the device clearly doesn‚Äôt disappoint. The Fitbit Charge 2 offers premium build quality and it‚Äôs always comfortable to wear, although we‚Äôve missed waterproofing and swimming support. It has auto tracking for the majority of activities, such as running and cycling, and can also monitor sleep without any input from the person wearing it. And thanks to how soft the band is, the Charge 2 is quite easy to wear while sleeping, as it causes no discomfort during the night. In the end, the Charge 2 shows why Fitbit continues to be number one in terms of sales. It simply serves its purpose very well, even if it doesn‚Äôt come with military-grade aluminum, a super AMOLED screen, 3D Touch, or things like that. It‚Äôs a tracker that does its job and it‚Äôs hard not to be pleased with it if this is what you‚Äôre looking for. ¬† CHECK OUT THE GALLERY ¬†(37 Images) #Fitbit#Charge 2#activity tracker#smartwatch review#Fitbit review subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (37 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 Related ¬†¬∑¬† Hot right now ¬†¬∑¬† Latest news Samsung Gear S3 Frontier Review Apple Watch Series 2 Review Samsung Gear Fit 2 Review Fitbit Blaze Review - Jack of All Trades, Master of One Nokia E1 Could Be Unveiled at MWC 2017 Alongside Nokia D1, Here Are Its Specs 2015 VPN Android Bug Still There in Nougat (And It‚Äôs Pushing Users to iPhones) KillDisk System Destructive Malware Now Targeting Linux FBI Hack Most Likely a Hoax, CMS Maker Says Google Assistant on Pixel Phones to Get Support for Keyboard Input Galaxy S7 edge Blue Coral Variant to Land in Europe Soon Samsung Galaxy C5 Pro Allegedly Leaks in Live Blurry Image Google Calendar for Android and iOS Integrated with Fitness Goals 37 photos ¬†¬† Fitbit Charge 2 New Apps LangOver: Easily translate texts and search the Internet using Google by pressing hotkeys, with the help of this easy to use system tray application Portable Jutoh: Enables you to easily create electronic books in EPUB, MOBI, TXT, MP3, HTML and ODT formats, from existing files or from scratch SynciOS Data Transfer: Transfer contacts, messages, calendar entries or multimedia items directly from one phone to another or backup phone data to the computer WonderFox DVD Video Converter: Convert video and audio files to other formats, rip DVDs and download videos from the Internet with this powerful and intuitive application DreamPlan Home Design Software: Plan and design a house or condo for personal or professional use, with the help of multiple features such as texture settings, decorations or 3D renditions Moneydance: Keep up to date with your budget statements, transaction records and general financial trends, with this comprehensive application WifiHistoryView: Extracts information about the current and past wireless network connections of your computer, displaying a complete list you can export Reader comments Hands-On with the CHUWI Vi10 Plus Running Remix OS 2.0 more on: CHUWI i softpedia¬Æ ¬† ¬†¬†Like 202K ¬†¬†¬†+1 56K ¬† ¬†¬†Follow 13K ¬© 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Here‚Äôs how to get acquainted with it to ensure a two-to-four year lifetime, give or take, of happiness. Or just one, if you‚Äôre an annual upgrade person. When you turn on your new iPhone, you‚Äôll be greeted by the Setup Assistant, through which you‚Äôll establish essentials like your Wi-Fi network and six-digit passcode, Touch ID, your Apple ID and iCloud account, and whether you want to activate Find My Phone and Location Services. You‚Äôll also be asked if you want to set up Siri (you do!), which includes saying a few phrases so that she can get to know your voice. It sounds like a lot of decisions and inputs, but the whole process takes only a few minutes. Better yet, none of these choices are¬†binding; you can find them all again later under Settings. After you‚Äôre done with the basics, it‚Äôs time to make that matte black beauty truly yours, by topping it off with all of your contacts, apps, and content. You can do this the easy way or the hard way. Which path you choose will likely depend on whether this is your first iPhone or iPad. More iPhone 7 Fun Review: Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus iOS 10: Every New Feature Coming to Your iPhone What to Do With Your Old iPhone The 11 iMessage Apps You Should Download First If you‚Äôre an Apple vet, you can simply select Restore from iCloud Backup or Restore from iTunes Backup (speaking of which, make sure to back up your old device before you do this). Then enter your Apple ID and password, and go grab a peppermint mocha while your iPhone restarts with all of your settings, preferences, apps, and more in place. In other words, it‚Äôll be just like your old device, but‚Ä¶ newer. If this is your first Apple rodeo, or you just want a fresh start and like fiddling around in menus, select Set Up as New Phone, which will accomplish exactly what it sounds like. From there, it‚Äôs just a matter of personalizing to your preference. Want to add an email account? Go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Add Account. Want to fine-tune which apps refresh in the background (and drain your battery in the process)? Head to Settings > General > Background App Refresh and toggle your little heart out. Want to save time on Web forms? Go to Settings > Safari > Autofill and pre-load your contact info. One last recommendation: Get rid of the junk. For the first time, iOS 10 lets you delete Apple‚Äôs many, many stock apps. Do it! It feels great, I promise. Oh, and while you‚Äôre digging around in Apple‚Äôs preloaded apps, make sure to stop by iMessage and load up on stickers and games either to liven up your conversations, or send them spiraling into a pit of craven trollery. There‚Äôs no one right way to iOS, but hitting those basics should at least get you started on a sane path.

Let‚Äôs fire up that wristable the right way. Assuming your Watch is already on and charged, go ahead and open up the Apple Watch app on your iPhone, the one you‚Äôve tried to delete a few times but iOS wouldn‚Äôt let you. You‚Äôll need an iPhone 5 or more recent, running iOS 9 (if you have an Android phone, uh‚Ä¶ was there a gift receipt, perhaps?). Make sure you‚Äôve got Bluetooth and Wi-Fi toggled on as well. Select Start Pairing on the Watch, then direct your iPhone‚Äôs camera at the pretty blue pattern that has appeared on the Watch‚Äôs face. Congrats! They‚Äôre now bonded. If the automagic process isn‚Äôt working, you can also do this manually, by tapping the ‚Äúi‚Äù icon on your Watch and typing the six-digit code it coughs up into your iPhone. Dial in Those Settings Now that smartwatch and smartphone are one, tap Set Up as New Apple Watch on your iPhone, unless this is somehow your second or third Apple Watch, in which case you should select Restore from Backup, and also maybe pace yourself on the smartwatch purchases. Then choose whether you‚Äôll be wearing the Watch on your right or left wrist, and agree to the terms and conditions. Next, enter your Apple ID and password (this is all still on your phone, no text input on that tiny display during this process). Then decide whether you want to enable Location Services (yes), Siri (sure), and Diagnostics (meh?). Just keep in mind that your iPhone and Watch will mirror each other with these settings; change it on one device, and the other will as well. You‚Äôll then be given the option to create a passcode. You should do this, if only because without one you can‚Äôt use Apple Pay, which is currently one of the best parts of Apple Watch ownership. You can also save yourself some annoyances down the line by telling your Apple Watch to unlock along with your iPhone. Add Some Apps And now the homestretch! It‚Äôs time for apps. You can either click Install All to load up any app on your phone that has Watch capabilities, or you can go with Choose Later to winnow the field down to your chosen few. Honestly, you might as well just install them all and trim from there. Your choice, though! Your Watch! That‚Äôs basically it; from there you just need to wait for your iPhone and Watch to sync, which can take a good long while. Once they‚Äôre all synced up, you should go ahead and fiddle around in the settings, where you can set up Apple Pay (again, the best!), fine-tune your notifications to keep dozens of apps from constantly buzzing your wrist, unless you‚Äôre somehow into that. Other settings avenues to walk down? The Activity app, which is the one that tracks your movement throughout the day and tells you to stand up once in a while; the Sounds & Haptics settings, to dictate how loud and long the Watch tries to get your attention, and Glances, which provide bite-sized info from swipe to swipe. How you set each of those up is entirely your choice, but you‚Äôll probably be happier if you don‚Äôt just leave it up to stock. And that‚Äôs it! You‚Äôre now officially a Watch person. Don‚Äôt let it go to your wrist. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. apple Apple Watch how-to smartwatches Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

And delightfully simple to get started on. Setting up your Chromebook is literally a three step process, and that‚Äôs only if you include ‚Äúturn it on‚Äù as one of the steps. Ready? Here you go: 1. Turn it on. 2. Choose your language, connect it to your Wi-Fi network, and sign into your Google account. 3. Choose a profile picture or icon (I‚Äôd go with an icon, but I‚Äôm shy). OK, that‚Äôs it, you‚Äôre done. Life with a Chromebook after that is simply a matter of collecting the apps you need (it already comes with Calendar, Google Drive, the full suite of Google Docs applications, Google Play Music, Hangouts, and Chrome remote desktop). You can find those in the Chrome Web Store. Oh, and you might have heard that Chromebooks only work when they‚Äôre hooked up to the internet. That‚Äôs not quite true; there are plenty of Chrome apps that have an offline mode as well, including Gmail Offline, Google Drawings, and more.

Fortunately, Nest has a guide where you can check for yourself. The short version: If you have ‚Äúthick, stranded wires held together by wire nuts‚Äù under your current thermostat cover, this isn‚Äôt going to work out. If you have two labels for each wire‚Ä¶it might. Once you‚Äôve confirmed your Nest compatibility, go ahead and shut off power to your HVAC system for safety‚Äôs sake. Then you‚Äôre ready to roll up your sleeves and do some handiwork. Fortunately, everything you need‚Äîincluding a screwdriver‚Äîis included in the box. As far as home upgrades go, it‚Äôs pretty straightforward; you just remove your old thermostat, attach the Nest base, connect the wires, and attach the Nest display. There are enough steps within those steps that your best bet is to follow along with this video guide: Or better yet, if you don‚Äôt trust yourself with anything electrical, Nest makes it easy to find a professional in your area who can help. Once your Nest is installed and powered on, you‚Äôll need to connect it to your home Wi-Fi network. From there, just use it like you would any other thermostat. Within a few days, Nest will learn your habits and make those adjustments on its own. Physical installation is also just one part of the process. A lot of the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù in your smart thermostat comes from hooking it up with your phone. For that, just download the Nest app and create a Nest account. From there, you can use your smartphone (or computer) to change the temperature remotely and keep track of your energy usage. Go Back to Top.

Setting it up should be a breeze, but there are still a few things you‚Äôre going to want to consider. Placement We know, we know, you want to just plug it in and turn your brain off. But where you plug in your television matters more than you‚Äôd think, and there‚Äôs no one-space-fits-all solution. A lot of factors go into how crisp your television‚Äôs picture looks that have nothing to do with the settings (we‚Äôll get to those in a minute). You‚Äôll want to sit a specific distance from your set depending on how big it is, the aspect ratio, and the resolution. The basic rule of thumb is to sit within spitting distance of two times the diagonal length of your set. The higher the resolution, the closer you can sit without being able to discern individual pixels. It sounds complicated, but it‚Äôs really not so bad. Besides, that‚Äôs why charts and viewing calculators like these exist. Calibration and Settings The biggest mistake people make with new TVs is assuming it simply looks the way it does. Not so! There are lots of tweaks you can make right away to ensure an optimal viewing experience. You can find a more in-depth roundup here, but the short version should be enough to get you started. Picture Mode: If this is set to Demo or Showroom, switch it on over to Home or Standard. Aspect Ratio: Set this to ‚ÄúAuto-Adjust‚Äù or ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù if your picture looks stretched-out or collapsed. Motion Enhancement: This goes by many names (Clear Motion Rate, Motion Flow, etc) but it always results in making everything you watch look like a soap opera. Burn it with fire. Set-Specific Calibration: Your levels! Your levels are usually not ideal out of the box. You can tinker with your contrast and backlight and sharpness on your own, but we‚Äôd recommend hitting up the CNET HDTV Picture Setting Forum. There you‚Äôll find precise expert recommendations on most of the top sets on the market, and if you can‚Äôt find your specific boob tube, you can post yourself asking for help. Smart Start You could go through and sign into all your Netflix and Hulu and (shudder) Twitter accounts on your smart TV. But also maybe don‚Äôt! Get a Roku or a Chromecast or an Apple TV instead. Their interfaces are more reliable, their selections are much larger, and they‚Äôre cheap as all heck. It‚Äôll be the best present you ever gave yourself. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Whether it‚Äôs a Galaxy S7 or a Google Pixel, the process of getting started with Android is basically the same, and blessedly simple. Once you‚Äôve powered up your device, you‚Äôll be greeted with a series of set-up chores. This is where you‚Äôll set your language preferences, set up your Wi-Fi, enter your Google account details (in other words, your Gmail address and password), and set up a device password and/or fingerprint security, if your phone offers that feature. Being signed into your Google account makes it easy to set up a new phone from there, if you were already on an Android device. Just make sure that your old phone is backed up by going to Settings > Backup & reset. There, you‚Äôll see options for Back up my data (turn this on, if it‚Äôs not) and Automatic restore (toggle this to on as well), which combined will mean that not only will your apps be waiting for you on your new phone, their various settings should be as well. There are ways to transfer your photos and text messages as well, but your best bet is to use a cloud-based service, like Google Photos or Dropbox (or both), that will take your photos with you on any device, regardless of platform. As for texts, the same holds true if you use WhatsApp or GroupMe instead of SMS. Once you‚Äôve gotten your app and Google account situation squared away, you‚Äôll want to link some of your other accounts to your phone for seamless integration down the line. Just head to Settings > Accounts, select Add account, and enter your info for Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox, Skype, and whatever else you rely on on the regular. And that‚Äôs basically it! You can tinker in the settings to your heart‚Äôs content‚Äîthis is Android, after all‚Äîbut most of it just amounts to personal preference. One last tip? Keep an eye on Google Now, a personally assistant baked into Android that will learn from your search and location history to serve up timely information and articles. To make sure it‚Äôs on, go to Settings > Google > Search & Now, where you can customize the type of cards you see, which notifications you get, and what sort of voice activation you prefer, if any.

You‚Äôre about to enter the wonderful world of digital personal assistants. All you have to do is set it up. We can help. After taking your Home from the box and admiring its fine styling, download the Google Home app on your phone. Home will walk you through the typical steps of choosing a language, setting up the Wi-Fi, that sort of thing. You can do this in your sleep. Before long, the app wil ask where in your home you are placing your Home. Choose someplace accessible, like the bedroom or living room. Once that‚Äôs done, the app will prompt you to sign in to your Google account. This lets Home tap your calendar, your email, your flights and so much more, so Home can answer you when you ask, ‚ÄúOK, Google ‚Äî what time is my interpretive dance class?‚Äù Want to use Home to play music? Of course you do. You‚Äôll need a Chromecast, Chromecast Audio to make it work. Open the Home app and tap Menu in the upper left corner. Then choose¬†More Settings>TV‚Äôs and Speakers to add the device. With that, you can enjoy the convenience of playing music or watching TV without doing anything more than saying, ‚ÄúOK, Google‚Ä¶‚Äù from the comfort of your couch. Connect your smart lights to Google Home as well. For all the Philips Hue or Samsung SmartThings owners out there, you have full control when the lighting systems are connected with Assistant. ‚ÄúOkay Google, change the color of light in the living room.‚Äù This is perfect when you are stuck cooking and your date is coming over in ten minutes.

This slick little gadget is your first step toward creating a smarter home. Now that you‚Äôve got one, Alexa will help you do all kinds of amazing things, like order a pizza, summon an Uber, and tell you how to mix a perfect Manhattan. What she won‚Äôt do is set up your¬†Echo. Don‚Äôt worry. It‚Äôs dead simple. First, make sure your¬†Echo is charged. All set? Great. Turn it on and set up the WiFi connection by installing¬†the Alexa app on your phone. Fire up the app, and it‚Äôll walk you through configuring your Echo. No, really. It‚Äôs just that easy. The cool thing about Alexa is she learns from you. The more questions you ask, the smarter she gets. Use your Alexa app to get started by activating those apps and services you use. Definitely choose Uber, to make getting a car as easy as saying, ‚ÄúAlexa, get an Uber.‚Äù The Bartender is another useful one. ‚ÄúAlexa, as The Bartender who to make a Tom Collins.‚Äù Boom. Done. The first one is Ordering an Uber. Before asking Alexa to order you an Uber home, toggle the Uber app on through the Alexa app and link your Uber account. Now, you can order an Uber in the matter of seconds. Another useful skill is The Bartender, which you can add on the Alexa app. Be sure to spend some time exploring the Alexa app, because you can set up your Echo to do everything from play music and provide weather forecasts to play music, order flowers, and ‚Ä¶ well, any one of 3,000 tasks, really.

Here‚Äôs how to get acquainted with it to ensure a two-to-four year lifetime, give or take, of happiness. Or just one, if you‚Äôre an annual upgrade person. When you turn on your new iPhone, you‚Äôll be greeted by the Setup Assistant, through which you‚Äôll establish essentials like your Wi-Fi network and six-digit passcode, Touch ID, your Apple ID and iCloud account, and whether you want to activate Find My Phone and Location Services. You‚Äôll also be asked if you want to set up Siri (you do!), which includes saying a few phrases so that she can get to know your voice. It sounds like a lot of decisions and inputs, but the whole process takes only a few minutes. Better yet, none of these choices are¬†binding; you can find them all again later under Settings. After you‚Äôre done with the basics, it‚Äôs time to make that matte black beauty truly yours, by topping it off with all of your contacts, apps, and content. You can do this the easy way or the hard way. Which path you choose will likely depend on whether this is your first iPhone or iPad. More iPhone 7 Fun Review: Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus iOS 10: Every New Feature Coming to Your iPhone What to Do With Your Old iPhone The 11 iMessage Apps You Should Download First If you‚Äôre an Apple vet, you can simply select Restore from iCloud Backup or Restore from iTunes Backup (speaking of which, make sure to back up your old device before you do this). Then enter your Apple ID and password, and go grab a peppermint mocha while your iPhone restarts with all of your settings, preferences, apps, and more in place. In other words, it‚Äôll be just like your old device, but‚Ä¶ newer. If this is your first Apple rodeo, or you just want a fresh start and like fiddling around in menus, select Set Up as New Phone, which will accomplish exactly what it sounds like. From there, it‚Äôs just a matter of personalizing to your preference. Want to add an email account? Go to Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendars > Add Account. Want to fine-tune which apps refresh in the background (and drain your battery in the process)? Head to Settings > General > Background App Refresh and toggle your little heart out. Want to save time on Web forms? Go to Settings > Safari > Autofill and pre-load your contact info. One last recommendation: Get rid of the junk. For the first time, iOS 10 lets you delete Apple‚Äôs many, many stock apps. Do it! It feels great, I promise. Oh, and while you‚Äôre digging around in Apple‚Äôs preloaded apps, make sure to stop by iMessage and load up on stickers and games either to liven up your conversations, or send them spiraling into a pit of craven trollery. There‚Äôs no one right way to iOS, but hitting those basics should at least get you started on a sane path.

Let‚Äôs fire up that wristable the right way. Assuming your Watch is already on and charged, go ahead and open up the Apple Watch app on your iPhone, the one you‚Äôve tried to delete a few times but iOS wouldn‚Äôt let you. You‚Äôll need an iPhone 5 or more recent, running iOS 9 (if you have an Android phone, uh‚Ä¶ was there a gift receipt, perhaps?). Make sure you‚Äôve got Bluetooth and Wi-Fi toggled on as well. Select Start Pairing on the Watch, then direct your iPhone‚Äôs camera at the pretty blue pattern that has appeared on the Watch‚Äôs face. Congrats! They‚Äôre now bonded. If the automagic process isn‚Äôt working, you can also do this manually, by tapping the ‚Äúi‚Äù icon on your Watch and typing the six-digit code it coughs up into your iPhone. Dial in Those Settings Now that smartwatch and smartphone are one, tap Set Up as New Apple Watch on your iPhone, unless this is somehow your second or third Apple Watch, in which case you should select Restore from Backup, and also maybe pace yourself on the smartwatch purchases. Then choose whether you‚Äôll be wearing the Watch on your right or left wrist, and agree to the terms and conditions. Next, enter your Apple ID and password (this is all still on your phone, no text input on that tiny display during this process). Then decide whether you want to enable Location Services (yes), Siri (sure), and Diagnostics (meh?). Just keep in mind that your iPhone and Watch will mirror each other with these settings; change it on one device, and the other will as well. You‚Äôll then be given the option to create a passcode. You should do this, if only because without one you can‚Äôt use Apple Pay, which is currently one of the best parts of Apple Watch ownership. You can also save yourself some annoyances down the line by telling your Apple Watch to unlock along with your iPhone. Add Some Apps And now the homestretch! It‚Äôs time for apps. You can either click Install All to load up any app on your phone that has Watch capabilities, or you can go with Choose Later to winnow the field down to your chosen few. Honestly, you might as well just install them all and trim from there. Your choice, though! Your Watch! That‚Äôs basically it; from there you just need to wait for your iPhone and Watch to sync, which can take a good long while. Once they‚Äôre all synced up, you should go ahead and fiddle around in the settings, where you can set up Apple Pay (again, the best!), fine-tune your notifications to keep dozens of apps from constantly buzzing your wrist, unless you‚Äôre somehow into that. Other settings avenues to walk down? The Activity app, which is the one that tracks your movement throughout the day and tells you to stand up once in a while; the Sounds & Haptics settings, to dictate how loud and long the Watch tries to get your attention, and Glances, which provide bite-sized info from swipe to swipe. How you set each of those up is entirely your choice, but you‚Äôll probably be happier if you don‚Äôt just leave it up to stock. And that‚Äôs it! You‚Äôre now officially a Watch person. Don‚Äôt let it go to your wrist. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. apple Apple Watch how-to smartwatches Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

And delightfully simple to get started on. Setting up your Chromebook is literally a three step process, and that‚Äôs only if you include ‚Äúturn it on‚Äù as one of the steps. Ready? Here you go: 1. Turn it on. 2. Choose your language, connect it to your Wi-Fi network, and sign into your Google account. 3. Choose a profile picture or icon (I‚Äôd go with an icon, but I‚Äôm shy). OK, that‚Äôs it, you‚Äôre done. Life with a Chromebook after that is simply a matter of collecting the apps you need (it already comes with Calendar, Google Drive, the full suite of Google Docs applications, Google Play Music, Hangouts, and Chrome remote desktop). You can find those in the Chrome Web Store. Oh, and you might have heard that Chromebooks only work when they‚Äôre hooked up to the internet. That‚Äôs not quite true; there are plenty of Chrome apps that have an offline mode as well, including Gmail Offline, Google Drawings, and more.

Just make sure that your old phone is backed up by going to Settings > Backup & reset. There, you‚Äôll see options for Back up my data (turn this on, if it‚Äôs not) and Automatic restore (toggle this to on as well), which combined will mean that not only will your apps be waiting for you on your new phone, their various settings should be as well. There are ways to transfer your photos and text messages as well, but your best bet is to use a cloud-based service, like Google Photos or Dropbox (or both), that will take your photos with you on any device, regardless of platform. As for texts, the same holds true if you use WhatsApp or GroupMe instead of SMS. Once you‚Äôve gotten your app and Google account situation squared away, you‚Äôll want to link some of your other accounts to your phone for seamless integration down the line.

Blue Sky Innovation Technology How Apple alienated Mac loyalists Mac Pro Noah Berger / Bloomberg Philip Schiller, senior vice president of worldwide marketing at Apple, introduces the Mac Pro during a launch event in San Francisco on Oct. 23, 2013.¬† Philip Schiller, senior vice president of worldwide marketing at Apple, introduces the Mac Pro during a launch event in San Francisco on Oct. 23, 2013.¬† (Noah Berger / Bloomberg) Mark GurmanBloomberg To die-hard fans, Apple's Macintosh sometimes seems like an afterthought these days. Mac upgrades, once a frequent ritual, are few and far between. The Mac Pro, Apple's marquee computer, hasn't been refreshed since 2013. The affordable and flexible Mac mini was last upgraded in 2014. And when a new machine does roll out, the results are sometimes underwhelming, if not infuriating, to devotees. In October, after more than 500 days without an update, Apple unveiled the new MacBook Pro, with a slimmer design and louder speakers. The laptop garnered mostly favorable reviews from the technology press but grumbles from creative types, a key constituency, who said the device under-performed rival products. Interviews with people familiar with Apple's inner workings reveal that the Mac is getting far less attention than it once did. They say the Mac team has lost clout with the famed industrial design group led by Jony Ive and the company's software team. They also describe a lack of clear direction from senior management, departures of key people working on Mac hardware and technical challenges that have delayed the roll-out of new computers.

Apple unveiled long-awaited updates to its Mac computers Thursday, aiming to spark consumer interest in a product line often overshadowed by newer gadgets like the iPad and iPhone. The breakout feature is, as widely speculated, a new touch-sensitive panel on the MacBook Pro, Apple's top-of-the-line... (Tribune news services) While the Mac generates about 10 percent of Apple sales, the company can't afford to alienate professional designers and other business customers. After all, they helped fuel Apple's revival in the late 1990s. In a stinging critique, Peter Kirn, founder of a website for music and video creators, wrote: "This is a company with no real vision for what its most creative users actually do with their most advanced machines." If more Mac users switch, the Apple ecosystem will become less sticky-opening the door to people abandoning higher-value products like the iPhone and iPad. People now have more options. Microsoft, once derided by Mac loyalists for its clunky, buggy software, offers Windows 10, which provides the tablet type functionality Apple pioneered with the iPad. Microsoft's Surface computers offer Apple-esque quality and a well-reviewed creative paint program aimed at the Mac's audience. Sensing an opportunity, Microsoft called the MacBook Pro a "disappointment" and said more users than ever were switching to its Surface laptops. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. However, the company has said the Macintosh remains one of its most important products and denies it takes a back seat to other gadgets. Four years ago at Apple's annual developer conference, marketing chief Phil Schiller pledged to keep the computer front and center in the company's product arsenal. "Nobody turns over their entire line as quickly and completely as we do at Apple," Schiller said. "We're really proud of the engineering team and the work they do to do this quick so you can get the exact product you need." Two years later, the company held a 30th birthday party for the Macintosh, a splashy event that featured a OneRepublic concert at Apple's Cupertino, California headquarters. The company also created a website celebrating the Mac's history. Nokia sues Apple to escalate mobile-patent licensing battle Nate Lanxon, Ian King and Joel Rosenblatt Nokia sued Apple saying the iPhone maker infringed several mobile patents, turning simmering tension between the companies into a bitter public legal battle on multiple fronts.

(Nate Lanxon, Ian King and Joel Rosenblatt) To be fair, Apple depends on Intel Corp., which still makes key chips for Macs. Like the rest of the PC industry, Apple's innovation and product cycles are sometimes constrained by when Intel produces new chips-a process that's getting more difficult. Making a laptop stand out is also harder these days. But when Apple has tried to leapfrog the competition, it has fallen short. Take the company's attempt to create a longer-lasting battery for the MacBook Pro. Apple engineers wanted to use higher capacity battery packs shaped to the insides of the laptop versus the standard square cells found in most machines. The design would have boosted battery life. In the run-up to the MacBook Pro's planned debut this year, the new battery failed a key test, according to a person familiar with the situation. Rather than delay the launch and risk missing the crucial holiday shopping season, Apple decided to revert to an older design. The change required roping in engineers from other teams to finish the job, meaning work on other Macs languished, the person said. The new laptop didn't represent a game-changing leap in battery performance, and a software bug misrepresented hours of power remaining. Apple has since removed the meter from the top right-hand corner of the screen. In the Mac's heyday, people working on new models could expect a lot of attention from Ive's team. Once a week his people would meet with Mac engineers to discuss ongoing projects. Mac engineers brought prototypes to Ive's studio for review, while his lieutenants would visit the Mac labs to look at early concepts. Those visits have become less frequent since the company began focusing more on more-valuable products like the iPhone and iPad, and the change became even more obvious after the design team's leadership was shuffled last year, according to a person familiar with the situation. In another sign that the company has prioritized the iPhone, Apple re-organized its software engineering department so there's no longer a dedicated Mac operating system team. There is now just one team, and most of the engineers are iOS first, giving the people working on the iPhone and iPad more power. That's part of a broader shift toward making Macs more like iPhones. Apple prioritizes features, like thinness and minimal ports, that sell its iPhones and iPads, which generated about 75 percent of revenue this year. Those are contrary to professional needs, like maximum computing power. Early prototypes of the 12-inch MacBook used the iPhone's Lightning connector, although this was ditched for a more standard USB-C port. There was even a gold MacBook Pro planned, but this was shelved because the color didn't look good on such a large product. The inside story of Apple's $14 billion tax bill Gaspard Sebag, Dara Doyle and Alex Webb "The Maxforce" is the European Union team that ordered Ireland to collect billions of euros in back taxes from Apple Inc., rattled the Irish government, and spurred changes to international tax law.

"The Maxforce" is the European Union team that ordered Ireland to collect billions of euros in back taxes from Apple Inc., rattled the Irish government, and spurred changes to international tax law. You'd think it might have earned the name by applying maximum force while investigating alleged... (Gaspard Sebag, Dara Doyle and Alex Webb) In recent years, Apple managers have also become more likely to float two or more competing ideas, meaning designers and engineers must work on more than one concept at a time. In the past, managers pushed a more singular vision. Engineers are now "asked to develop multiple options in hopes that one of them will be shippable," a person familiar with the matter said. When the company was developing the first 12-inch MacBook, Apple tested two primary prototypes. One, known internally as Stealth Fighter, was lighter. The second, a slightly less ambitious design known as Stealth Bomber, was heavier. The lighter model prevailed, but with engineers developing and testing two competing concepts, they had less time to figure out how to cram all the electronics into a thin slab of aluminum that would hold together. In the end, Apple shipped the laptop in 2015, months after its 2014 goal. For a 2016 MacBook update, some Apple engineers wanted to add a Touch ID fingerprint scanner and a second USB-C port (which would have made some power users happy). The update instead included a new rose gold color option alongside a standard speed increase. The internal turmoil has taken a toll. More than a dozen engineers and managers working on Mac hardware have left for different Apple teams or other companies in the past year and a half, said people familiar with the situation. Some were looking for a less all-consuming work environment, while others felt the future of Mac hardware was unclear in a world of iPhones and iPads. In 2013, Apple launched a redesigned Mac Pro, a black cylinder with bright white LED lights. It was a powerful desktop machine created partly to cast a halo over the entire Macintosh lineup. The Mac Pro was also the first Apple computer in years to be assembled in the U.S. Under pressure from politicians to create manufacturing jobs at home, Apple was looking to score political points. The decision caused production headaches though. The Mac Pro's glossy exterior and chrome beveled edges meant Apple had to make its own manufacturing tools and then train people to run those machines in an assembly plant. This slowed production and constrained Apple's ability to make enough computers to meet demand. Three years on, the Mac Pro is ripe for an upgrade with its chips and connector ports lagging rival products. Because of the earlier challenges, some Apple engineers have raised the possibility of moving production back to Asia, where it's cheaper and manufacturers have the required skills for ambitious products, according to a person familiar with those internal discussions. The political environment is tougher for such a move now. During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump hammered Apple for building most of its products overseas and since his election he has pushed other companies to keep some jobs in the U.S. Still, Apple hasn't given up on Macs. In a recent company Q&A session, employees asked whether Mac desktop computers remain strategically important. "We have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that," Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said, according to a transcript of the discussion obtained by Bloomberg News. The latest MacBook Pro has a "Touch Bar," a thin touchscreen built into the keyboard that lets users quickly access app shortcuts, change system settings, and pick emojis. The laptop also has Touch ID to speed up online purchases and a giant trackpad for easier gesture control. Apple designers are already exploring standalone keyboards with the touch strip and a fingerprint reader for desktops. Apple will decide whether to release these based on how well the features do on the MacBook Pro. Mac fans shouldn't hold their breath for radical new designs in 2017 though. Instead, the company is preparing modest updates: USB-C ports and a new Advanced Micro Devices Inc. graphics processor for the iMac, and minor bumps in processing power for the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro. Cue the outrage. Privacy Policy Copyright ¬© 2017, Chicago Tribune Apple Inc. Apple iPhone Microsoft Corporation Microsoft Surface Intel Corp.

Our new stockbroker advises us to sell 100 of our 200 shares of Apple and all of our Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF shares. He wants us to buy shares of Digital Realty Trust and General Dynamics with the proceeds. Please tell us what you think of these trades. ‚Äî LS, Oklahoma City Dear LS: Money is the root of all wealth, and your broker may have picked the right stocks to participate in the Trump economy and increase your wealth. What took you so long to sell that bond fund? Bond funds will surely perform poorly in a market with rising interest rates, and Apple‚Äôs future growth may be disappointing because the company has lost some of its core. Digital Realty (DLR-$95) is a real estate investment trust. REITs have been laggards since October because investors fear that higher interest rates will infect dividends and earnings growth. Logically, that makes sense; higher rates mean higher borrowing costs, which translate into lower earnings. Well, I‚Äôve been a serious investor for 54 years and observed that REITs actually perform well during periods of rising rates. That‚Äôs logical, too, because higher rates often follow improving economic growth, which translates into higher occupancy rates, making it easier for REITs to raise rents. Although, in today‚Äôs market economy, I‚Äôd shy away from hotel REITs, which are facing a glut of new construction plus competition from Airbnb. And stay away from apartment REITs, especially those that are required to include low-income housing units in their upscale properties to qualify for zoning and mortgage money. Your broker‚Äôs recommendation of Digital Realty seems to be spot on. DLR owns, acquires, develops and manages technology-related properties, including internet gateway data centers and technology manufacturing facilities. DLR owns 162 properties in 11 countries, spanning four continents, and boasts a 92.5 percent occupancy rate. The $3.52 dividend, yielding 3.7 percent, has been raised in each of the past 10 years, and revenues have exploded to $2.1 billion in 2016 from $281 million in 2006. Earlier this year, DLR acquired an $875 million portfolio from Equinix, which included eight high-quality data centers in London, Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt. And the 692 clients using these centers are new customers for DLR. DLR continues to see revenue growth on the Continent, even with Britain‚Äôs decision to exit the European Union. Meanwhile, net profit margins have impressively improved in each of the past 10 years, from 7.5 percent in 2006 to an expected 14.3 percent this year; and some analysts expect 18 percent by 2021, when DLR‚Äôs revenues may reach $3 billion. This is a solid growth REIT! Vanguard, American Funds, BlackRock, Fidelity, State Street and Bank of America probably agree, because they own 35 percent of DLR‚Äôs 160 million shares. This is a grand issue paying a fine dividend, and Wall Street thinks it could trade at the $130 level in the coming four years. Buy it. General Dynamics (GD-$175) is a $31 billion aerospace and defense company with 101,000 employees. Its information systems and technology business group provides technologies, products and services that support a wide range of secure mobile communications systems. Its marine systems group designs, builds and supports submarines and surface ships for the U.S. Navy. Its combat systems group is a global leader in tracked and wheeled military vehicles, and it also produces high-performance weapons systems and munitions. Finally, GD‚Äôs aerospace group has a solid reputation for superior aircraft design, quality, performance and reliability. All this morphs into potentially impressive revenue and earnings growth. The $3.04 dividend yields 1.9 percent and has been raised in each of the past 18 years. Net profit margins of 9.4 percent are at their highest level, and long-term debt has declined by over 50 percent in the past few years. Analysts believe that defense spending will be encouraged by the Trump administration, and GD looks to be the best pure-play company among defense contractors, with a return on equity over 25 percent. Some expect GD to split 3-for-1 in 2017 and foresee shares of the split stock trading between $80 and $85. Buy it. Malcolm Berko addresses questions about stocks. Reach him at P.O.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile ¬´ Patently Apple Wishes our Friends and Colleagues a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year | Main | The Irish Ministry Disagrees that a recent EU Court Tax Ruling in a Spanish Case Spells bad news for Apple ¬ª December 25, 2016 Nokia's Second Patent Infringement Lawsuit against Apple Covers Qualcomm RF Technology, Siri and the iPhone's Design ¬† Yesterday Patently Apple posted a report titled "Part 1: Nokia Files an 8 Count Patent Infringement Case against Apple Primarily Focused on the H.264 Standard." In Part two I uncover a second patent infringement case that was filed by Nokia Technologies Oy and Alcatel-Lucent USA Inc. that contains a basket of ten patents referred to as Nokia's Patents-in-Suit. Unlike their first Infringement lawsuit that basically focused on the H.264 standard, their second lawsuit is a shotgun approach with every patent covering a different aspect of technology. ¬† In this lawsuit Nokia attacks Apple on several technical fronts including the iPhone's use of RF technology from Qualcomm, various Siri services including "Find my iPhone" and the actual industrial design of the iPhone that includes the cutout for its backside camera. ¬† Apple purchases specific parts for their iPhone 6s from Qualcomm and one such part that is highlighted in this case is presented to you further below in this report. Nokia basically claims in their filing that the technology that Qualcomm uses in their part infringes a Nokia patent. So why is Apple being sued for alleged patent infringement on a Qualcomm part? Shouldn't Nokia be suing Qualcomm first to make that determination a fact of law? To be sure this is an overreach by Nokia to be accusing Apple of this patent infringement rather than Qualcomm. ¬† With a lawsuit overreaching as it is, you can understand why Apple decided to pull all Withings products from their retail and online stores out of retaliation. The Withings brand is now integrated into Nokia's Digital Health unit, according to MacRumors who broke the story on Friday. ¬† Apple's Alleged Infringing Products ¬† Nokia lists the alleged infringing Apple products as being the following: the Apple iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 5s, iPhone SE, iPad Pro (LTE), iPad Air 2 (LTE), iPad Air (LTE), iPad Mini 4 (LTE), iPad Mini 3 (LTE), and iPad Mini 2 (LTE) (collectively, the "247 Accused Products"). ¬† In a partial highlight found in Nokia's lawsuit relating to Qualcomm's RF part found in the iPhone 6s Nokia notes that "For example, as shown below, the iPhone 6s includes a Qualcomm MDM9635M baseband processor that, on information and belief, includes a digital signal processor. On information and belief, the Qualcomm MDM9635M produces a digital baseband quadrature signal that represents the information to be transmitted via the Qualcomm WTR3925 RF transceiver. ¬† According to Nokia all of Apple's "accused products" that use this Qualcomm part infringe their '247 patent. "Additionally, Apple provides instruction manuals that instruct users of the '247 Accused Products to use the '247 Accused Products in a manner that infringes the '247 patent, such as by making cellular telephone calls." ¬† It would appear that giving consumers the ability to make cellular phone calls on a cellular phone is owned by the Nokia gods. Their arrogance in making such an absurd claim is astounding. Don't they lock up people in rubber rooms for less? ¬† Some of the other Apple features challenged by Nokia relate to Siri and Find my iPhone. Nokia even challenges the iPhone's shape and camera cut-out on the rear side of the iPhone as infringing their patent 9,473,602 as noted below. As for Siri, Nokia's lawsuit claims that many aspects of Siri services infringe their '294 patent. The filing specifically points out that Siri uses a series of processes that infringe Lucent Technology patents over the use of databases and tables that interact with web-based applications like music and mail. Overall, Nokia further claims that Apple's iOS 10 specifically infringes claim #7 of the '294 patent. ¬† At the end of the day, to better understand this case from top to bottom requires that you review all of the materials available to you. Below are links to the patents that Nokia is using in this case and further below is a copy of the full patent lawsuit as was presented to the court in Texas. For the legal beagles and patent sleuths among us, enjoy. ¬† The Ten Counts of Patent Infringement against Apple ¬† Patent 7,415,247 entitled "Method and Arrangement for Transmitting and Receiving RF Signals through Various Radio Interfaces of Communication Systems." ¬† Patent 9,270,301 entitled "Method and Arrangement for Transmitting and Receiving RF Signals through Various Radio Interfaces of Communication Systems." ¬† Patent 8,036,619 entitled "Oscillator Having Controllable Bias Modes and Power Consumption." ¬† Patent 6,393,260 entitled "Method for Attenuating Spurious Signals and Receiver." ¬† Patent 6,480,700 entitled "Apparatus, and Associated Method, For Operating a Communication Device at Reduced Level of Current Consumption." ¬† Patent 7,653,366 entitled "Hybrid Switched Mode/Linear Power Amplifier Power Supply for Use Patent in Polar Transmitter." ¬† Patent 6,826,391 entitled "Transmission and Reception Antenna System for Space Diversity Reception." ¬† Patent 9,473,602 entitled "Portable Electronic Device." ¬† Patent 6,208,725 entitled "Arrangement for Controlling Remote Telephones." ¬† Patent 6,701,294 entitled 'User Interface for Translating Natural Language Inquiries into Database Queries and Data Presentations." ¬† 2. Nokia v. Apple Case 01441 - Patent Infringement Case - Patently Apple by Jack Purcher on Scribd ¬† In the end it's difficult to understand how one lawsuit can cover such a quantity of varying aspects of a smartphone to be argued at one time before a non-technical jury. ¬† Perhaps Nokia's strategy is to completely overwhelm and frustrate a jury of non-technical members in the hopes that they'll just throw their hands up in the end and decide on a verdict by saying "Eeny, meeny, miny, moe" and give Nokia one or more wins out of sheer frustration to make it seem that they're fair jury members. ¬† It's a crazy legal system and Apple is going to have to spend a lot of money and time to try and make this simple for a jury to digest. But in the end, I'm not sure that will suffice. They should move all patent cases out of patent troll friendly Texas and send them to Vegas ‚Äì because it's really now become a game of playing the odds of an outcome of a trial rather than winning on the merits of the patents. It's a joke. ¬† The patent infringement case 2:2016cv01441 presented in today's report was filed in the Texas Eastern District Court. The Presiding Judge in this case is noted as being Judge Rodney Gilstrap. ¬† In case you missed it, see Part One: Nokia Files an 8 Count Patent Infringement Case against Apple Primarily Focused on the H.264 Standard ¬† Notice: Patently Apple presents only a brief summary of certain legal cases/ lawsuits which are part of the public record for journalistic news purposes.

As consumers wait for the release of the iMac 2017, let us take a quick look on its rumored specs and compare it to the upcoming Aspire C-series. It has been a while since Apple updated its iMac. This is the main reason why consumers are eagerly waiting for the release of the iMac 2017 early next year. With regards to its specs, reports state that it will boast a 27-inch 5K Retina display similar to the 2015 model. But the difference is, it will be capable of supporting an OLED Touch Bar. Furthermore, instead of a Kaby Lake chipset, iTechPost mentioned that the future iMac will use an Intel Xeon processor. It is considered as one of the most powerful processors in this generation. High-end PCs are the usual gadgets that Xeon is supporting as it is capable of reducing programming errors. Also read: Acer Aspire C vs Microsoft Surface Studio Also, the iMac 2017 is sporting a Touch ID and will support USB Type-C Thunderbolt ports. But the most interesting addition to the desktop?s features is it will now support Virtual Reality (VR). Alongside the VR is a powerful GPU that will improve the user?s experience. But, all these new features will also have its downside. Because there are a lot of new interesting specs added to the iMac 2017, consumers should expect its price to increase. These features would not come for free and they will certainly add to the device?s cost. Now, for those who are not willing to spend more money for a desktop but are looking for a great deal, you might consider buying the Acer Aspire C-series. The new desktop series will cost from $450 up to $700. Price of the iMac 2017, on the other hand, has not yet been announced but it is expected to be much more expensive than the C-series price list. Also read: Microsoft Surface Phone 2017 Specs & Updates: Phone To Have Foldable Display Meanwhile, the upcoming Aspire C-series will feature the sixth-generation Core i3 processors. It will as well sport 1TB HDD storage and an 8GB of DDR4 RAM. Moreover, reports stated that its display will come in two sizes ‚Äì 21.5 and 23.8 inches. Both are capable of full HD resolution so you can pick any of those. For those who will buy the new Acer Aspire C-series, you can choose between Windows 10, Linux and FreeDOS for its system. Although these specs are nothing compared to the ones iMac 2017 has, still, the device?s price is the deal-breaker. How about you? Which one do you prefer the most?

The long overdue refresh for the iMac lineup has been expected since Apple?s iPhone 7 events. Following the no show at Apple?s October 27 event, reports point toward the all-in-one desktop refresh in 2017. iMac 2017 Launch KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says the new iMac 2017 will release March 2017. CEO Tim Cook confirmed the same stating big changes are coming to their desktop lineup . He reassured the staff and tech enthusiasts that despite no recent updates, Apple is not done with its creative computer market. ?The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world,‚Äù Mr Cook said. ?Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we?re committed to desktops.?

However, speculations point toward a new design update for the iMac 2017 aside from the introduction of game changing features.

Other sources suggest that further delay in the Kaby Lake series will force Apple to incorporate Intel Xeon processors. AMD Graphics Apple iMac 2017 will pack AMD graphics chips, either of high-end Polaris 10 or Polaris 11 cards. AMD had won a contract with Apple to supply the discrete graphics chips for future high-end 27-inch iMac and 15-inch Retina MacBook Pros.

Best iPhone deals Best iPad deals Best MacBook deals Best iMac deals Best Apple Watch deals Best tech deals Boxing Day Apple sales buying advice We'd highly recommend knowing what you want before you shop. It'll help you spend your money wisely, because it's easy to fall into the trap of seeing something cheap and assuming it's a bargain. Think about what you really need in terms of specs too: how much storage and power do you really need? It's also worth setting yourself a realistic budget. Sales are marketing events, designed to get you to spend money that you would otherwise keep safely hidden away in your pocket. Also make sure you're staying safe online. Make sure you only buy from reputable retailers, ensuring that they have a UK street address, a good returns policy and good user reviews. Plus, if a deal looks too good to be true, it probably is. And if you're almost completely confident but have even the smallest of doubts, it's worth paying by credit card. That way any money you lose is the bank's money so they'll do their best to help you get it back.

Several Withings iOS-compatible products ‚Äî mostly health-related connected accessories ‚Äî have been available at Apple Stores for nearly two years as part of a retail alliance, AppleInsider reported on Saturday. The Withings product sales continued even after the company was acquired by Nokia in April for nearly $190 million. The Withings brand was integrated into Nokia‚Äôs Digital Health unit. ‚ÄúNow, the devices made by the Nokia subsidiary are no longer listed on Apple‚Äôs website. Previously, Apple carried a wide range of iOS-compatible Withings devices in its retail stores, including the ‚ÄòBody Cardio Scale‚Äô and ‚ÄòWireless Blood Pressure Monitor,‚Äô‚Äù the report added. Five years after Apple and Nokia settled a lawsuit, the tech giants have again locked horns over patents with Apple filing an antitrust lawsuit against third-party companies Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs) that act on Nokia‚Äôs behalf, and the Finland-based firm suing Apple directly earlier this week. Nokia filed a suit in Europe and the US, claiming Apple is still infringing on Nokia patents. The lawsuit covers 32 patents, including display, user interface, software and video-coding technology. Nokia said that since settling the initial case, Apple has ‚Äúdeclined subsequent offers made by Nokia to license other [parts] of its patented inventions, which are used by many Apple products.‚Äù In its lawsuit, Apple argued that Nokia already has agreements to license its patents for fair and reasonable terms, also know as ‚ÄúFRAND‚Äù (Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory). ‚ÄúBut Nokia is transferring these patents to PAEs in order to aggressively pursue money,‚Äù Apple argued. According to the Cupertino-based tech giant, Nokia has been conspiring with PAEs patent assertion entities (Acacia Research and Conversant Property Management) in an ‚Äúillegal patent transfer scheme‚Äù to wring money out of Apple because Nokia‚Äôs cell phone business is failing. According to the AppleInsider report, Apple has now ‚Äúexpunged all mention of Withings and its product line from the Apple.com online retail database‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhether or not the recent Withings removal is related to Nokia‚Äôs shady legal dealings has yet to be confirmed, but Apple has in the past used its retail might as a retaliatory weapon,‚Äù the report added. In 2011, the two companies settled a patent fight over smartphone technology through a licensing agreement that committed Apple to make a one-time payment to the company and to pay regular royalties in the future, media reported. The companies also agreed to withdraw complaints against each other with the International Trade Commission over the use of intellectual property. tags from this storyUnited States follow this tag on MGNApple follow this tag on MGNNokia follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessCompanies tagsUnited States follow this tag on MGN+¬†MGNApple follow this tag on MGN+¬†MGNNokia follow this tag on MGN+¬†MGN Also In CompaniesQatar‚Äôs IHG plans acquisitions after IPO Business Gallery Business: 2016 in review Highlights: Guangzhou Auto Show 2016 Business Videos PlayAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures 01Iran okays 29 companies for oil and gas projects 02Dubai Investments starts work on Dh3b project 03DWTC awards contract to Al Futtaim Carillion Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 Play Emirates opens SkyPharma in Dubai Sep 18, 2016 14Images Trump casino closes in Atlantic City Oct 11, 2016 2Images Google Glass is getting glasses Jan 28, 2014 32Images 32 things to do this Dubai Shopping Festival Jan 05, 2012 15Images Inside a Russian precious metals plant Oct 26, 2016 Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee World, UAE Markets Data OverviewGccEuropeAsiau.s.

As for its reasoning, Consumer Reports explained that the inconsistent, yet sometimes impressive, battery life was too big of an issue to overlook. Now, Apple Marketing executive Phil Schiller says that the company is working with Consumer Reports to ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù the tests. Working with CR to understand their battery tests. Results do not match our extensive lab tests or field data That‚Äôs what‚Äôs so ironic about this: Consumer Reports reported a three¬†and a half hour test on the MacBook Pro, which if you‚Äôve used one like me, know is completely possible with some serious CPU-intensive tasks.¬†But then again tested in the 18-19+ hour range which is totally unbelievable, even if just the screen was on. So if anything, this test is in Apple‚Äôs favor. Schiller claims that the results obtained by Consumer Reports, which saw battery life of anywhere from 3.5 hours to 19.5 hours, do not match Apple‚Äôs lab tests or field data. Apple, of course, extensively tests battery life in-house and in real-world use to come up with its own estimates. It also has some ‚Äúfield data‚Äù from devices out in the wild. For its part, Consumer Reports explained that it‚Äôs normal to see battery life time vary less than 5 percent between tests, making the performance of the MacBook Pro models highly abnormal. In a series of three consecutive tests, the 13-inch model with the Touch Bar ran for¬†16 hours¬†in the first trial, 12.75 hours in the second, and just 3.75 hours in the third. The 13-inch model without the Touch Bar worked for¬†19.5 hours¬†in one trial but only 4.5 hours in the next. And the numbers for the 15-inch laptop ranged from¬†18.5¬†down to 8 hours.¬† While the lack a recommendation may seem arbitrary on the surface, Apple uses the results from the organizations like JD Power and Consumer Reports heavily, specifically in retail stores and marketing. While it seems unlikely that Consumer Reports will reverse its recommendation without Apple somehow fixing the battery life issues, it‚Äôs noteworthy that the company has approached them directly about the data. Ben Lovejoy noted earlier today that something definitely seemed ‚Äúodd‚Äù about the data Consumer Reports found. Many other tech reporters added onto Ben‚Äôs report but he was the 1st to lay out the claim. ¬†It‚Äôs possible that the results revealed a software-side problem that‚Äôs affecting battery life, in which Apple is likely working with publication to obtain more information and potentially work towards a fix. In the meantime, Apple has yet to address the new MacBook Pro‚Äôs battery life in a software update, aside from removing the antiquated (/s) ‚ÄúTime Remaining‚Äù statistic. In our tests, we were unable to get the Touch Bar MacBook to last much beyond 8 hours using the same tests Apple quoted for 10 hours.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Microsoft feted to be the first trillion dollar tech company 3 by Surur¬† @mspoweruser Dec 25, 2016 at 17:00 GMT2 weeks ago There was a time when it appeared Apple was well on its way to being the first tech company to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization, reaching a high of $775 billion in February 2015. Since then however weakness related to its inability to produce another hit product has become evident, and its market cap has since receded to $617 billion. Now Michael Markowski from financial¬†publication Equities.com has postulated that Microsoft is on track to take that crown, despite being third in line behind Apple and Google. Market Capitalization Apple $617 billion Alphabet $548 billion Microsoft $492 billion Amazon $359 billion Facebook $333 billion Markowski notes that unlike a hardware company a digital company like Microsoft had a more scalable business model that could reach more consumers, and ¬†better cash flow and higher margins. The author notes that from the short list Microsoft had the highest free cash flow, and that its acquisition of LinkedIn boosted its PE multiple significantly, as social network companies are traditionally valued much higher despite lower earnings, making Microsoft, even at $492 billion, significantly undervalued. Also due to its high dividend yield of 2.5%¬†the downside for its share price is limited. He also note that Microsoft only paid LinkedIn around¬†$60 per user, compared to Facebook‚Äôs¬†$218¬†per user, and that professional users tend to be worth a lot more than regular users, again suggesting a lot of upside is possible for Microsoft, especially if¬† the emerging Social Investing Community (SIC) industry, which allowed companies to crowd fund from social media, comes to fruition. Markowski notes that Microsoft‚Äôs only competition in the race is Alphabet/Google, noting both Microsoft and Google had more than double the annual cash flow of Amazon and Facebook. After a decade of stagnation under Steve Ballmer Microsoft‚Äôs share price has gained more than 50% over the last three years.¬†Markowski postulates another doubling, which will likely not take place without the narrative around Microsoft changes drastically, which should be an interesting change for loyal fans used to seeing Microsoft left out of the conversation.

(Money Sharma/AFP/Getty Images) It‚Äôs the end of 2016, and the most popular smartphones in China‚Äîa nation of 700 million smartphone users‚Äîaren‚Äôt made by Apple, Samsung, or even Chinese cult brand Xiaomi. Oppo and Vivo, two little-known companies in the West, have come to dominate the Chinese smartphone market using seemingly antiquated marketing strategies. As of the third quarter 2016, Oppo held the biggest smartphone market share at 16.6 percent, with Vivo closely behind with 16.2 percent. Huawei and Xiaomi came in third and fourth, with 15 percent and 10.6 percent respectively, according to market research firm Counterpoint. Apple was a distant fifth with 8.4 percent market share. The two companies came out of seemingly nowhere to sell millions of smartphones. Oppo‚Äôs sales were 84 percent higher than last year, mainly on the popularity of OnePlus, a line of smartphones with edgy designs, high-end specs, and low prices. Vivo relies on simple but solid designs and rock-bottom prices, a formula that propelled its sales 114 percent higher than prior year‚Äôs. A Vulnerable Xiaomi The phone market in China is fairly simple to enter, but difficult to dominate. Related Coverage Can China‚Äôs ‚ÄòHomegrown Apple,‚Äô Xiaomi, Succeed Abroad? At the high end of the market, Apple still reigns. Around $60 billion of Apple‚Äôs total sales were generated from China alone last year, and it wasn‚Äôt too long ago that Apple vied with Xiaomi‚Äîwhich hailed itself as China‚Äôs own Apple‚Äîfor top smartphone market share. While Apple still has a stranglehold on the top end of the market, its position has eroded over the last year due to Beijing‚Äôs blockage of iTunes, a slowing Chinese economy, Xi Jinping‚Äôs anti-graft measures, and a flood of cheaper but high-quality alternatives. (Source: Counterpoint Research) It‚Äôs the middle range of the market that‚Äôs more interesting, and it‚Äôs where Oppo and Vivo have recently excelled. This is a market that has seen numerous winners emerge over the years such as Lenovo, Huawei, and most famously, Xiaomi. Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun styled himself as a China version of Steve Jobs, focusing on design, high-end specs, but at a lower price point than Apple. Xiaomi‚Äîpopular with urban millennials‚Äîwas known for its high-profile launch parties and until recently, an internet-only sales model. But Xiaomi runs a version of Google‚Äôs Android operating system. And without an app ecosystem to lock in users, companies found that customer loyalty was almost non-existent amongst commodity-like smartphones that run Android. Even a brand with cult status like Xiaomi was susceptible to newer entrants. Going Brick-and-Mortar Oppo and Vivo are both owned by Guangzhou-based BBK Electronics, a company started by billionaire investors and entrepreneur Duan Yongping. Both brands have similar approaches to selling phones. They observed that Xiaomi was a favorite of urban millenials‚Äîat least those who want a cheaper or Android-based alternative to the Apple iPhone. Xiaomi until recently only sold phones directly via its website, and promoted each phone release via hip launch parties. Oppo and Vivo saw an opening in working with retail stores, where two out of three phones are still sold in China. The companies especially targeted stores outside of large cities and in rural areas, where consumers are more price-sensitive, have less access to the internet, and place more reliance on local technical and customer support. Oppo and Vivo partnered with retail sales professionals in small vendors and offered sizable affiliate sales commissions and subsidies to sales reps. Related Coverage Spy Software Found Preinstalled on Lenovo, Huawei, and Xiaomi Smartphones Apple Walks a Thin Line on User Privacy While Dealing With China ‚ÄúOppo and Vivo are willing to share their profit with local sales,‚Äù Jin Di, an analyst at market research firm IDC, told Bloomberg. ‚ÄúThe reward was an extremely active and loyal nationwide sales network. They‚Äôre doing something different‚Äîthey do local marketing.‚Äù It‚Äôs an antiquated strategy, but it‚Äôs a fit with Chinese consumers outside of major cities. The small vendors serve as the companies‚Äô local salesmen, technical support, and customer support. With the added incentives, they help promote the products to friends and consumers on WeChat, and steer sales away from competitors toward Oppo and Vivo phones. Their other killer app? Oppo and Vivo phones often carry powerful, zoom-enabled front cameras for selfies. Xiaomi, meanwhile, has moved up market in recent years. It now manufactures a variety of other products such as video cameras and ‚ÄúInternet of Things‚Äù home devices in an effort to position itself as China‚Äôs homegrown Apple.

Nokia may have forgotten that business common sense or was just willing to throw Withings under a bus when it sued Apple over patent infringement. Not only did Apple counter with a lawsuit or its own, it also pulled all of Whithings smart health devices from its online stores. Why? Because Nokia now owns Withings and its smart bathroom scales and smart thermometer, which Apple now refuses to sell because of Nokia. It‚Äôs a classic ‚Äúhe said, she said‚Äù type of patent squabble. Nokia says Apple refuses to pay it what is due for patents in a wide range of technologies, from networking to video encoding. Nokia has filed lawsuits in more than just the US, now including the UK, Germany and France, among others. Apple countersued Nokia and practically called it a patent troll. It says that it was more than willing to pay Nokia if and only if it charged reasonably for those patent licenses. However, Apple says Nokia is demanding too much and is now using patent troll tactics to get it to pony up the cash. As always, it‚Äôs the users that get caught in the middle. In this case, Withing‚Äôs would be users. By removing those products from its stores, Apple is showing that it is definitely willing to call Nokia‚Äôs bluff. Of course, people can still buy Withing‚Äôs products from elsewhere. This isn‚Äôt the first time Apple made a similar strategy. It onceonce banned Bose‚Äôs audio accessories from its online stores after a period of intenseintense rivalry with Beats, which Apple owns now. This isn‚Äôt Apple‚Äôs and Nokia‚Äôs first patent squabble either. The two eventually settled the last one and there‚Äôs a chance things could be resolved before they get ugly. But if you‚Äôre itching for a new smart bathroom scale, best to look elsewhere for now.

The competition over which mobile OS is better sees no end as iOS and Android continue to improve.¬† ( Apple ) Advertisement For 2016, Apple and Google both released some great updates for their respective native mobile operating systems: the iOS 10.2¬†and Android Nougat¬†7.1.1. This only goes to show that the competition remains heavy between the two tech giants, especially in software development. After all, technology is always improving, and it is necessary for the current operating systems to continuously improve along with it to usher in a host of new developments. Speaking of improvements, both iOS and Android were given some nifty updates to allow users to express themselves more creatively. While the Android OS dominates the market because it is used by more mobile phone manufacturers and iOS is exclusive to Apple devices, iOS refuses to back down from the competition. Take a look at some of the improvements iOS and Android released early in December. Android Nougat 7.1.1 The Android 7.1.1 update¬†was released on Dec. 5, promising stability and performance improvements, as well as new features and emojis. So what exactly are these "improvements" to the Android OS? Google says "communication" is the keyword. The Nougat 7.1.1 features an easier way to access installed applications on Android devices by allowing users to access shortcuts from the main screen. All a user has to do is press down on the shortcut of the app they need, and a quick launch menu where they can choose an action would pop up. To put it simply, if a user wants to watch some YouTube videos, instead of opening the YouTube app and doing everything from there, a user can simply press long on the YouTube app shortcut and it will give them the option to see what's trending, search for a video, or view their subscriptions. The same goes for other applications. On the more creative side, the Nougat 7.1.1 now has new emoji. The new emoji set features more professions for both male and female emoji. Try searching for that female rockstar! "We included gender counterparts for emoji that previously only had male or female representation. Now there are female welders and men getting haircuts," Google announced. Not only that, but users can now send GIFs straight from their keyboards. iOS 10.2 Apple also refuses to back down from the battle of the best mobile OS because it also released some great improvements by way of iOS 10.2¬†on Dec. 12. iOS 10.2 is a major update but, like the one for Android, iOS also gave some focus on creative expression. For starters, there is a new batch of emoji available, and some of them throw in professions for gender equality. Then there is the "preserve settings" option for the camera that lets users keep their favorite camera settings instead of resetting them each time the Camera app is launched. There is also an awesome new pre-loaded TV application that allows users to pull content from whatever source. A user can simply launch the "TV app," including the provider in the settings, and manage all video content from there instead of installing multiple applications for different subscriptions. Best Mobile OS Of 2016: Android vs iOS Apple saw growth¬†in its iOS shares after the release of the iPhone 7 and despite the criticism the new model received. However, Android still dominates more in terms of market share due to the large number of devices using the system. Competition may have been close this year. However, with the iPhone celebrating its 10th anniversary¬†in the consumer market in 2017, many believe that Apple has something fantastic in the pipeline. For now, let's just sit back and enjoy the improvements. TAG iOS, Android, iOS 10.2, Android Nougat ¬© 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.

It shows beautiful, drifting scenes from around the world (you can spot New York, San Francisco, London, Hawaii, China, and the list goes on). It's even synced up with the time of day, so if it's evening where you are, you see evening scenes...and so on. Programmer John Coates has ported the screensaver to the Mac, and it's free. It downloads the same video files directly from Apple that the Apple TV screensaver does, so you'll see exactly what you get on Apple TV. Installation is easy: visit this page and scroll down to the "Installation" section. The three steps are: download, unzip, and double-click the "Aerial.saver" file. Boom! (In my case, on that last one I had to control-click, and then click "Open" to get past security settings on my Mac.) So head on down to Screensaver Town.

September 14th 2016 4 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/Entertainment/ Find that inner peace and body strength with the Yoga Studio app on Apple TV. Rod ChesterNews Corp Australia Network FROM exercise lovers strapping on their new Apple Watch to grandmothers who new can use their new iPad to keep in touch with family, for many people Christmas Day meant a shiny new Apple device. The recent Hitwise consumer insights report found that Apple products made up seven of the top 10 products people were searching for and clicking on in the lead up to Christmas. But whether you got that iPhone 7 you really wanted or the iPad you‚Äôre not quite sure how to use, the first step in getting to know your new gadget is to download apps you will want to use. Breaking it down, here are five apps you should download whether your Christmas present was the Apple Watch, the iPhone, the iPad or an Apple TV. There are plenty of options for those who got an Apple Watch.Source:Supplied Apple Watch Was the Apple Watch the big selling item this Christmas? Apple CEO Tim Cook says it ways, saying it ‚Äúlooks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts‚Äù and ‚Äúsales growth is off the charts‚Äù. The good news for those who got an Apple Watch this Christmas is that a lot of the annoyances about the first generation Apple Watch have been fixed, and apps now don‚Äôt take forever to open on your device. Here are five apps you‚Äôll want to have on your Apple Watch ‚Äî and our tip is to open the Watch app on your iPhone and put your favourite apps in the Dock so you can open them quickly with one push of the side button. RunGo / Free If you‚Äôre looking at running as your New Year‚Äôs Resolution or just want to discover new routes, this app gives you turn-by-turn navigation on the iPhone with prompts on your watch on which way to go. Sweat with Kayla / Free with in-app subscription While you‚Äôre thinking about fitness, it‚Äôs hard to go past this Aussie-made app with exercise routines by Kayla Itsines. Apple liked it so much it declared it the Watch app of the year. TripIt / Free No matter if your holiday plans are a family road trip or you‚Äôre jumping on a flight to Europe, this travel itinerary app can be your best friend. Put in your details from flights to hotel addresses and it will help take out some of the pain of travel. Notifications on your wrist can help you make sure you don‚Äôt miss your flight. Pocket Weather Australia / Free The Bureau of Meteorology at last has a very good app but this remains our favourite weather app for layout and features. You can edit the complications on your Apple Watch face so that you can always see the temperature and forecast at a glance with a tap to delve into the week ahead. HeartWatch / $4.49 One of the selling points of the Apple Watch is the 25/7 heart rate sensor. This app takes that data and adds a layer of statistical analysis that lets you drill down to what your heart rate is when you‚Äôre exercising or just hanging around. Pocket Weather is still one of the must-have apps, particularly on an Apple Watch.Source:Supplied Apple iPhone Prisma / Free The ability to give your photos that painting look isn‚Äôt new, but this app takes that concept to a new level. This will transform your social media photo stream with personal works of art. A recent change to the app means you now no longer are limited to just creating square images. Instagram / Free Yes, it seems an obvious one but Instagram is one of the most popular apps on the iPhone for a reason. In the past six months, Instagram has become even better with features inspired by Snapchat including the ability to share your story. Snap a photo, add a filter and enjoy the warm glow of likes. Audible / Free Audible, now owned by Amazon, has driven the charge in transforming the daggy audio book of the past into a must-have item on the iPhone. Transform your daily commute or exercise workout with a gripping tale. This is the most used app on our iPhone. Streaks / $5.99 The hard part of making a resolution and sticking to it is making that transition from something you want to do and something you do out of habit. This app rewards you for ‚Äústreaks‚Äù of your habits, no matter if you‚Äôre committing to walking the dog everyday, reading a book for 10 minutes or ringing your mother. Filmborn / Free There are plenty of great photo editing apps, including Snapseed, Lightroom, Pixelmator and even the editing controls within the native Photos app. This app offers something a little different, with popular film emulations and a powerful but simple photo editing including custom curves adjustment. The Freeview app needs improving but it should still be on your ‚Äúmust download list‚Äù.Source:Supplied Apple iPad Star Walk 2 / $4.49 Think of it as taking an astronomer with you when you go out for a walk at night. Either point it at the night sky to identify what you‚Äôre looking at or turn to the app to find out how the sky will look later that night. With Star Walk 2 you can point and learn.Source:Supplied Freeview / free There are still a few annoying quirks with this app that needs improvement, but let‚Äôs look at the big picture. This is one app that offers live streaming from 19 free-to-air channels plus catch-up TV. Yes, you probably still want to download the app for each free-to-air channel but start first with this one. Day One Journal / $7.99 This digital journal has the motto ‚Äúcapture life as you live it‚Äù. A great one to download as you‚Äôre about to start the new year, this lets you record each day using text, photos and location. It sounds simple but the overwhelmingly positive reviews from users is proof of the power of simplicity. Procreate / $9.99 The price puts it beyond the typical app purchases and if you have no artistic ability or interest you might want to give this a skip. But assuming you‚Äôre willing to invest the money and want to create your own artwork, this award-winning app could let you draw some amazing artworks. It‚Äôs wasted on those of us who struggle to draw stick figures, but for anyone who likes to draw its fantastic. Severed / $5.99 The blurb may not sound like your cup of tea: take control of a one-armed warrior as she wields her sword looking for her family in a nightmare world. But that aside, the artistic graphics are great and those who love it certainly love it a lot, with five-star reviews being the norm. We should also mention it picked up the App Store editor‚Äôs award for best iPad game of the year. Apple TV voice recognition put to the test0:25 Take a look as Rod Chester road tests voice recognition on Apple TV. October 29th 2015 a year ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ Apple TV Zova / free with in-app purchases If you just want to download one app on your Apple TV to see the potential of an App Store on the big screen, this is the one. This Australian-made app offers videos of workouts you can do in your own home. Great for those who want to work out more but find gyms intimidating. Netflix / free with in-app purchases Yes, when you get your Apple TV you will want to download all of the streaming services to give them a try. With Netflix, aside from the content, the app both looks great on the Apple TV format and works with the native search tool. Just hit the Siri button on your remote and ask for a movie or TV show to see if it‚Äôs in the Netflix library. Riptide GP: Renegade / $4.49 One of the first games on the Apple TV when the fourth-generation device was launched and still one of the best examples of using this tiny box as your games console. Basically, you race a hydrojet ‚Äî that‚Äôs all you need to know. Alto‚Äôs Adventure / $5.99 A case where the beautiful artwork helps to set it above the typical endless runner games. Alto is a snow boarder who travels through landscapes that have a wonderful minimalist design. Yoga Studio / $5.99 Next to Zova, this is our favourite wellness app on the Apple TV. It has easy to follow simple classes that you can fit into your busy life. Choose classes from 10 to 60 minutes long and customise classes to suit your own needs. It has been called the ‚Äúperfect yoga app‚Äù and we are happy to agree.
