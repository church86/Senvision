Wed, 07/27/2016 - 16:40 Apple AR Future: Tim Cook Believes Augmented Reality Could Be Next 'New Computing Platform' Bloomberg reports Apple is preparing the first major overhaul of its MacBook Pro line in more than four years, and that the new laptops will include a secondary display above the keyboard. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple will reveal new 13- and 15-inch models of its high-end, retina display laptop soon, although this announcement isn’t expected to coincide with the September announcement of the iPhone 7 (which may actually be called the iPhone 6SE). However, TechCrunch “could see Apple introducing the new laptop in October.” The MacBook Pro line hasn’t seen an update of any kind in well over a year, and according to Bloomberg, part of the reason for the overhaul is that the iPad is no longer the reliable cash-cow it once was; sales were down 23 percent in the last year. “Consumers are taking longer to buy or replace iPads,” Gurman said. “Apple research suggests customers upgrade iPads roughly every three years, while they buy new iPhones every 18 to 24 months.” Perhaps the most significant design change to the new MacBook Pros comes in the addition of a secondary OLED display above the keyboard, replacing the function key row. “Instead of physical keys, a strip-like screen will present functions on an as-needed basis that fit the current task or application,” Gurman said. It’s not yet clear how the OLED strip will work, though TechCrunch predicts it could go beyond basic laptop functions to “display shortcuts and information depending on the app you’re using.” What do you think of the potential of a revamped MacBook Pro?

A Bloomberg report says Apple is planning to launch the most substantial refresh of the MacBook Pro in more than four years. “If the details are correct, it’s a really compelling upgrade,” said Jerry Zigmont, owner of MacWorks, an Apple partner based in Madison, Conn.. [Related: 5 Apple Products That Need A Refresh This Fall (Besides The iPhone)] As reported by Bloomberg, the new version of the MacBook Pro would be thinner with a wider trackpad and offer improved graphics processors. it will integrate USB-C connectivity and Touch ID fingerprint technology, and, perhaps most notably, add a touch screen “strip” above the keyboard in place of the typical row of function keys. The touch screen strip would provide functions that are tailored to the needs of the application currently in use, according to the report. “The programmable strip across the top could be a game-changer for people,” Zigmont told CRN. For instance, graphic designers might be able to customize the strip for saving time on cutting, pasting, adding new layers and other functions.  Regardless of whether or not the touch screen strip is included, upgrades to specs and hardware on the MacBook Pro would be very welcome, said Michael Oh, CTO of TSP LLC, a Cambridge, Mass.-based Apple partner. The most current version of the laptop uses Intel's previous generation of processors, for instance. “Certainly it should be a pretty big change in terms of processing and graphics power, and hopefully the form factor as well,” Oh said. “They’ve been using the same case form factor for [the past] four years. Which has actually held up really well. But it’s time for Apple to make a change.” Pages 1 2 next › last » Printer-friendly version Email this CRN article Slide Shows CRN Exclusive: HPE CEO Whitman On Cisco's 'Weakness,' the Arista Partner Opportunity, Server Sales Issues, And The Starboard Value Investment In HPE Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman spoke with CRN about competing against Cisco, HPE's partnership with Cisco rival Arista, server sales execution issues in the channel and the Starboard Value fund's investment in HPE. 12 Things To Know About Presidio's IPO Filing Here are 12 things to know about solution provider Presidio's IPO filed on Tuesday around its strategy, revenue drivers and market concerns.

Apple’s recent foray into this field is already bringing out the wolves, with one offering double if you don’t tell Apple what you know. Last week, Apple announced a bug bounty program targeting kernel exploits and data security. It’s top-end payout is $200,000 for exploits related to boot firmware, and scales down to around $25,000 if you discover an issue with its sandboxing process. TNW Answers Your questions answered by founders, experts and thought leaders in business, design and tech. Join a chat It’s fairly run-of-the-mill stuff; hackers discover a problem, report it back to the company and make money for their work while helping the community at-large. A company named Exodus will pay over double — $500,000 — for exploits, but is vague about what might earn you that much cash. The company operates on behalf of private firms, and has no apparent interest in the greater good. That’s made more evident by its payout structure. On top of whatever the company will pay upfront, Exodus offers to pay quarterly if a discovered hack goes unnoticed by others. It even pays via Bitcoin, and has a ‘hitlist’ for “software targets of immediate interest.” All told, Exodus wants hackers to become hired guns. Exodus also doesn’t say why they’d pay so much or keep paying if a vulnerability went unnoticed. It’s likely the company is simply shoring up exploits its customers (which Motherboard reports pay up to $200,000 to retain Exodus’ services) may have before selling your discovery to Apple themselves, but that’s speculative.

Apple will pay up to $200,000 USD to researchers who discover and report iOS and iCloud bugs and security vulnerabilities. Apple is also offering successful researchers the option to donate bug bounty payments to charity which, at the company’s discretion, the company will match donations. Apple’s upcoming bug bounty program will initially be invite only with a select group of researchers providing reports on discovered bugs and security vulnerabilities. Screenshot of Apple iCloud - Image Credit: Apple Apple has categorized iOS and iCloud bugs and security vulnerabilities included in the program into five specific categories although the company may consider paying for other critical vulnerabilities. The highest paying category is “secure boot firmware components” which pays up to $200,000 USD. Researchers will need to report in detail the bugs and security vulnerabilities they discover and bounties will be based on a number of factors such as severity, how the bug or vulnerability is triggered, and how well the researcher describes the flaw. Apple is lagging behind when it comes to bug bounty programs as numerous technology companies including Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Uber have been offering bug bounties for quite some time now. A great many companies have benefitted from their bug bounty programs providing financial and other types of incentives for white hat hackers to help improve the security of devices and applications. Apple plans on launching its new invite-only bug bounty program in September. Apple is starting out small with its bug bounty program; however, the program may be open to a greater number of participants in the future.

Share Tweet Share Tags : Motorola-Motorola+ Samsung-Samsung+ Windows-Windows+ iOS-iOS+ LG-LG+ Apple-Apple+ Android-Android+ Huawei-Huawei+ Xiaomi-Xiaomi+ Kantar WorldPanel released its second quarter market share report today, and it showed that in the U.S. iOS rose 1.3 percentage points. That means that the Apple iPhone was responsible for 31.8% of smartphone sales in the country from April through June. Apple had the top selling device in the U.S. during that period as the Apple iPhone 6s and Apple iPhone 6s Plus combined to snag 15.1% of U.S. smartphone sales. Not far behind was the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 edge with a combined 14.1% share. The Apple iPhone SE was third with 5.1%. The new 4-inch handset helped iOS rack up the numbers it did during the quarter. Android's share in the U.S. dropped by less than a percentage points to 66.5%, remaining on top by a comfortable margin. Windows continued its long descent toward oblivion as its share nearly dropped in half from 3% last year to this year's 1.6%. In the U.S., Samsung remained on top with 35% of the smartphone market. Apple was next with 32%, followed by the 14% slice of the pie owned by LG. Motorola was next with 5%. The figures mean that LG has doubled its position in the U.S. market over the last two years. Motorola has seen its share slump by 50% from the 10% it snagged last quarter. 38% of current Motorola owners plan on switching brands in the next year. While 58% are loyal to the brand, that is well behind the 92% loyalty rate earned by Apple and the 85% owned by Samsung. In China, iOS lost 1.8pp in the quarter and now has a market share of 17.9%. Android gained 2.1 percentage points to 81.4% While the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are on top of the sales charts in the country, the Huawei Mate 8, Huawei P9, Xiaomi Redmi Note 3, Xiaomi Mi 5 and Oppo R9 are squeezing Apple's sales. The Apple iPhone SE had only 2.5% of Chinese smartphone sales in the quarter. That was the opposite of what took place in Great Britain in the second quarter. The iPhone SE had a leading 9.2% share followed by the 9.1% garnered by the iPhone 6s. Overall, in the country iOS rose 3.1pp to 37.2%.

Samsung is taking chances, and it's paying off. These so called gimmicks (curved screens, S-Pen), are now household names, and awesome features. Samsung is doing the most right now. posted on 10 Aug 2016, 21:58 1 Reply 12. kiko007 (Posts: 3019; Member since: 17 Feb 2016) +1 for an unbiased assessment. Samsung has Apple by the balls right now. I just got confirmation that ZTE is unlocking the Axon 7 bootloader, so I'm probably going for that instead of the iP7.

Market share will fluctuate time to time due to gimmicks by cheap OEMs. Curved screens for mere looks, waterproofing partially, wireless slow charging etc.. Those will never prevail when people realize they don't get much out of those much but they get stuck in cheap android mud in the name of those gimmicks. I use a S7. I used to have an iPhone 5. So I see this everyday. I don't use any of those fancy useless gimmicks ever. I find them boring. Only upside is having better low light camera quality due to a larger sensor. That's not so ground breaking by any mean for me. posted on 11 Aug 2016, 04:17 0 Reply 24.

Particularly the logo at the back and the button on the front. Its so simple, Stylish, Luxury and grand. All other phones are trying to catch up with iPhone design and I know nobody would agree with me and I would be bashed for this. But this is my personal opinion. Apple is the most respected company because their products speak. Good job Apple. No matter its .6 or .1. Lead is lead. Awesome job apple once again and you deserve this. posted on 11 Aug 2016, 05:48 0 Reply 28. ColinW (Posts: 148; Member since: 04 Jun 2014) Their products are very much mediocre, this is why their sales and market share is falling. The iPhones design is falling way behind too, not leading. Others pack in much more into more compact, lighter and better looking bodies. The looks may be an opinion, but the rest is fact. posted on 11 Aug 2016, 15:34 0 Reply 30. cdgoin (Posts: 538; Member since: 28 Jul 2010) Im a Windows Phone Fan and even I saw this coming but not even I thought it was going to be this big of a change.

Sensor Tower, an app intelligence firm, is predicting that by 2020, the Apple App Store will boast over 5 million apps, more than doubling its size in just four years. The App Store, which launched in 2008 with five thousand apps, now has more than two million different apps. There’s something for everyone: dating apps, weather apps, and even an app to help prevent shark attacks. But games are the bread and butter of the App Store. Because most games have a short shelf life, developers have to constantly create new games to maintain interest. Of the apps added to the store in 2016, 43 percent were games. Related: Apple’s next wearable might be able to monitor your blood sugar level The challenge that users run into with so many choices is how to find the right app for their needs. Apple is allowing developers to purchase ads in the search results. This is a great way for new apps and developers to get exposure. It’s even more important because more than half of the apps downloaded are found from the search results. Apple is also redesigning the way the App Store homepage looks. Instead of presenting users with a bunch of apps that they have already downloaded, they will only see new apps. The Categories section will be coming back to better help people find what they need. Despite the addition of all these new apps, users still only use a few applications regularly. Based on Sensor Tower’s analysis, users download 1.5 applications on average per month. The most popular applications that are accessed on a daily basis include many of the apps that come preloaded on your device. This means that smaller developers are competing heavily with big-time apps that have the advantage of not requiring downloading.

Reports: MacBook Pro Is Getting a Makeover By Richard Adhikari Aug 10, 2016 3:54 PM PT The long wait for a MacBook Pro refresh appears to be nearing an end, if the latest rumors are correct. The new MacBook Pros expected to launch this fall will feature a Touch ID power button and a touch-sensitive OLED strip that will replace the physical function keys on the keyboard, both 9to5 Mac and Bloomberg reported this week. The strip reportedly will bring up functions appropriate to the application that's in use. For example, it may display media playback controls when a user opens iTunes. It also might display editing commands, such as cut and paste, when a word processing program is running. The strip may allow Apple to add new buttons through software updates rather than hardware refreshes. Innovation Mandate "If you're a new user or a younger or more flexible and adaptable person, you'd think [the strip's] great," said Laura DiDio, principal analyst at ITIC. "Media playback controls when iTunes is open... editing commands during word processing... I can see kids catching fire with this," she told TechNewsWorld. However, "there's still that not-so-silent contingent of traditionalists out there who want to remain with the status quo," DiDio cautioned. Still, "you have to constantly reinvent yourself as a vendor," she said. The new MacBook Pros will be slightly thinner than current models, and have a smaller footprint, according to Bloomberg's report. The thinner form factor is generating interest, DiDio said. "You might see some people bringing the new MacBook Pros with them on the road." The possibility that Apple will bring Touch ID fingerprint technology to the MacBook Pro line also would be well received, she suggested. The new MacBook Pros will use one of AMD's "Polaris graphics cards, which are more than 20 percent thinner than predecessors, and will include USB C ports, according to Bloomberg. That is significant, DiDio said, and "it's good for AMD." Time Is Right Apple last refreshed the MacBook Pro in December 2013. "I think the MacBook lineup in general is due for a major refresh," remarked Linn Huang, a research director at IDC. "That's not to say that the products are bad in any way, shape or form," he told TechNewsWorld. "Apple's still a leader in design and, of course, [OS X] keeps their lineup insulated from the rest of the PC market," Huang noted. "However, Apple cannot afford to have their lineup get stale, given that the other PC OEMs are rapidly closing the gap, if not outright exceeding Apple in design leadership." Dell and HP both have launched "fantastically designed ultra-slim notebooks in the last couple of years," he pointed out, "and, of course, there's much exciting innovation occurring between the lines as tablets and PC form factors emerge." One idea that has gained some traction is that Apple is refreshing the MacBook Pro line to offset falling iPad sales. "I'm not sure that's Apple's intention, given that the two categories exist in different stratospheres," Huang said. "The new iPad Pro line is Apple's intended shot at reinvigorating iPad refreshes," he remarked. "I just think the MacBook look and feel hasn't evolved much as of late, and is due for a major update." Apple's Overall Strategy The MacBook Pro refresh -- assuming the reports are accurate -- would suggest "we're into the Tim Cook years, driven by pragmatic business decisions rather than the flash and genius that we came to know from Steve Jobs," suggested ITIC's DiDio. "Even Steve Jobs couldn't be Steve Jobs every quarter and come out with the next big thing." Apple "had a run of eight quarters of consecutive strong year-over-year growth of its MacBook lineup starting in Q4 2013," Huang pointed out. "After an underwhelming Q4 2015 holiday and what will now be two disastrous quarters to open 2016, perhaps Apple feels the pressure to make that update now."

Malik didn’t mince words when it came to discussing Apple’s perceived lack of focus, its Hollywood connections, and entertainment aspirations. “You were asking me what is the problem with Apple? Not the lightning port — this kind of stupidity of building a TV show around apps. It’s like, what? Somebody needs to make friends in Hollywood and so we should do a show like this? This is just such nonsense. They should be building better products and not stupid TV shows around those products. Back in mid-July, Apple issued an open casting call for its reality TV show Planet of the Apps. The show, which has been rumored to be in the works since earlier this year, will feature Hollywood actress Gwyneth Paltrow, who will serve as a mentor to contestants. Musician will.i.am will work in an advisor role, as will Gary Vaynerchuk, better known as Gary V. Although Apple’s Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services, Eddy Cue, has stated that the company has no interest in creating additional original television shows, Apple did recently acquire the viral Late Late Show segment ‘Carpool Karaoke’. Malik, however, thinks that Apple could do a better job of acquiring entertainment properties: “They want to do entertainment content? Buy damn Netflix and move on from there. Do it properly if you want to do it. Don’t try and do this stupid penny ante stuff which adds no value to the company, absolutely none.” Listen to Om Malik talk about Apple beginning at 31:05 In a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Cue stated that Apple is interested in boosting Apple Music, not competing with Netflix: “We are only going into the content business [with projects] that we think are really tied to our products. Right now, that’s Apple Music.” In the meantime, Apple’s Mac lineup has languished as customers await new hardware. With the exception of the 12″ MacBook and the iMac, Apple’s computers haven’t seen significant updates in well over a year, with the Mac Pro going on three years without an update since the “Can’t innovate anymore my ass” launch. This trend hasn’t gone unnoticed by many Apple reporters, including Malik: “If you want to do something for the shareholders make interesting damn MacBooks, which people can buy. You want to do something nice? Make a better phone, which people want to keep buying. Nobody cares if you do Planet of the Apps.” Eddy Cue at Oracle Arena Om had even stronger words for Eddy Cue: “You look at Eddy Cue; the guy was hanging out at the playoffs when iCloud was burning for 6 hours. You know, he wouldn’t have survived a day if Steve was around. I’m sorry, that’s what gets me worked up about this company…they have all these wrong priorities.” For the record, Eddy Cue has been with Apple since 1989, and was there prior to Jobs’ return to the company. Eddy worked a long time under Steve’s watch, and played key roles in the creation of Apple’s online store, the iTunes Store, and the App Store. Back in December of 2015, Cue’s duties of overseeing App Store and iBooks Store leadership were handed off to Apple’s SVP of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, amid developer discontent. Despite this executive move, Cue retains many responsibilities. He still oversees the iTunes Store and Apple Music, as well as Apple Pay, Siri, Maps, iCloud, and Apple’s in-house productivity apps. Industry critics have always existed, but this strikes me as the harshest public criticism of the post-Steve Jobs Apple that we’ve seen thus far. This isn’t some random commentator with an opinion on Apple’s current state. This is a well-respected industry veteran who’s been writing about Apple and the rest of the industry for many years. For what it’s worth, Apple is planning a substantial update to the MacBook Pro, which is rumored to include a Touch ID power button, an OLED touch-panel, a bigger trackpad, and a smaller, thinner footprint, among other likely changes. That’s not all that the GigaOM founder had to say about Apple. Says Malik, speaking of Apple’s entertainment aspirations, “All those things are nice, but in the end, they just need to build systems of tomorrow, not keep doing things of today.” Apple is obviously not pulling engineering resources off of projects to push forward its entertainment initiatives, but the argument can be made that it sets the wrong tone when considering the current state of the Mac lineup. What do you think? Is Apple spreading itself too thin by pursuing these entertainment ventures, or is it much ado about nothing? Be sure to watch the full video, as Leo Leporte, Om Malik, Philip Elmer-DeWitt, and David Coursey chime in during the discussion.

In a note on its website, the company said that as of the start of the 2016 school year, there are 32,145 students at underserved public schools in the US that are learning on iPad through the program. As the 2016-2017 school year kicks off, there are now 32,145 students at underserved public schools across the country who are learning, creating and exploring on iPad through Apple’s ConnectED commitment.  Today, 701 students in Indianola, Mississippi, were introduced to iPad as Carver Elementary School became the 66th ConnectED school — and the first of the school year — to transform its classrooms with Apple’s cutting edge teaching and learning technology solutions. In addition to the 32,000+ student iPads, Apple has also donated over 9,000 iPads and Macs to teachers, and provided schools with professional learning, wireless infrastructure and other support. Apple has pledged $100 million to ConnectED, an initiative announced by President Obama in 2014.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides finally embrace iPad split-view Chris Davies - Aug 10, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google’s Office apps have finally – finally – embraced iOS 9’s split-view support, ending one of the most confusing feature hold-outs ever to plague Apple’s mobile platform. Split-screen multitasking was one of the most-anticipated aspects of iOS 9, addressing in one fell swoop criticisms that the platform was unsuitable to properly replace a laptop or Windows tablet that had plagued it since the first iPad. However, while Apple’s native apps for iPad were updated along with iOS 9 to support the feature, it was left up to individual developers to code support into their own software. That has taken Google longer than expected. In fact, Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, the company’s word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation apps, were arguably the most obvious candidates for split-screen support, making the company’s tardiness to update them even more confusing. Good things do apparently come to those who wait, though, and today updates pushed out to Docs, Sheets, and Slides bring with them, among other things, the oft-requested feature. It works just as you’d expect. Swiping in from the side of the screen while you’re using Google Docs pulls in a sidebar which can be used to view a second app; dragging that divide further across splits the screen into two. When holding the iPad in portrait orientation you have a single split option, 60/40, while in landscape you get a choice of two, both 70/30 and 50/50. Unfortunately you can’t have two instances of the same app visible at the same time, though, which means there’s no way to see two Google Docs documents simultaneously and flick between them. NOW READ: Making the iPad Pro 9.7 work for work Still, even with that limit in place, this is a long-anticipated improvement. Rival word processing apps, like Microsoft’s Word and Apple’s own Pages, have ticked that box some time ago, but many people are heavily wedded to Google’s services and couldn’t justify – or stomach – switching platforms. You can find the new Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides versions in the App Store, where they’re free downloads. In addition to split-view, the new Google Docs supports inserting images and page breaks; like Google Sheets and Slides, it also has a number of bugfixes.

The company today announced that its ConnectED efforts have helped the company reach more than 32,000 students throughout the United States. Most recently, Carver Elementary School in Indianola, Mississippi joined the ConnectED program, becoming the 66th school to which Apple has provided iPads. For those unfamiliar, ConnectED is a program started by the Obama Administration to provide cutting-edge technology to teachers and students. In 2014, Apple pledged $100 million in iPads, computers, and other technology to the education program. Currently, Apple is providing some form of aid to 114 schools. Apple today says that it has delivered iPads to 32,145 students as part of its ConnectED efforts, as well as to 9,042 teachers. Additionally, 4,434 hours of “Apple Professional Learning” have been taught by Apple representatives at the schools, while 189 miles of internet cable has been installed. As the 2016-2017 school year kicks off, there are now 32,145 students at underserved public schools across the country who are learning, creating and exploring on iPad through Apple’s ConnectED commitment. Today, 701 students in Indianola, Mississippi, were introduced to iPad as Carver Elementary School became the 66th ConnectED school — and the first of the school year — to transform its classrooms with Apple’s cutting edge teaching and learning technology solutions. In addition to providing an iPad to every student and teacher, Apple’s ConnectED grant also includes professional learning, wireless infrastructure upgrades and ongoing support. The ultimate goal of Obama’s ConnectED is to connect 99 percent of students in America to high-speed internet service within 5 years of 2014. In addition to Apple’s contributions, Verizon and Microsoft have also aided in the efforts, as has Sprint and a variety of other companies Apple gave a brief update on its ConnectED efforts in late 2014, noting that it was working with Pearson, Scholastic, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Lexia, and other educational content partners to provide schools with up-to-date learning information. It’s important to note that Apple has efforts outside of ConnectED when it comes to education, selling Macs and iPads to a variety of schools around the world. You can read more Apple’s ConnectED efforts on its website, while the White House website also provides details on the reach of the initiative.

Priced from $399, the iPhone SE crams in the brainpower from the iPhone 6s (Apple A9 processor, M9 motion processor) into the body of the iPhone 5s. Given that the iPhone 6s starts at $649, the iPhone SE represents a pretty good bargain if you’re firmly entrenched in iOS land. The latest research from Kantar confirms the iPhone SE’s popularity, at least in two regions around the globe: Europe and the United States. During the second quarter of 2016 in Great Britain, the iPhone SE managed to grab the first-place spot in smartphone sales with a 9.2 percent share (just ahead of the iPhone 6s with 9.1 percent). Brisk iPhone SE sales helped iOS grow its share of the mobile OS market by 3.1 percent (to a total of 37.2 percent) in Great Britain. Apple saw gains in France, where its share of the smartphone market rose to 21 percent. Apple also saw an increase in iPhone sales for the first time in nearly a year in Germany, taking its share to 14.2 percent. Overall, Apple’s overall smartphone share in the EU5 (Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Spain) rose 0.7 percent during the second quarter to 18.2 percent. The iPhone SE was the third best-selling smartphone in the United States with a 5.1 percent share behind the first place iPhone 6s/iPhone 6s Plus (15.1 percent) and second place Samsung Galaxy S7/Galaxy S7 Edge (14.1 percent). The iPhone SE’s lower price point allowed it to gobble up nearly 23 percent of all iPhone sales. However, that lower price point also led to a lower average selling price (ASP) for iPhones. The ASP for iPhones was nearly $700 six months ago. But in Apple’s most recently completed quarter, the ASP fell to just $595, which is an incredibly steep decline for the company. It should also be noted that the iPhone SE hasn’t been a success everywhere. The smartphone was only able to capture 2.5 percent of the critical Chinese market, where Apple is facing tremendous pressure from homegrown OEMs that continually spit out higher-spec’d smartphone for less money. And the 4-inch form-factor isn’t exactly a hot seller in the region. “With strong demand for the iPhone SE throughout the second quarter, it will be interesting to track whether iOS growth will continue through the third quarter, assuming that supplies become less constrained,” writes Kantar analyst Lauren Guenveur. “Anticipation for the newest iPhone, usually released in late September every year, typically means a weaker summer period for iOS.” Speaking of the next flagship smartphone from Apple, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are expected to debut next month with A10 processors, 3GB of RAM (on the Plus model), a touch sensitive home button and dual cameras (again, only on the Plus model).

But game developers have taken advantage of the device’s ability to run third-party apps, and a decent number of games have been produced for Apple’s home-media box. I received a new Apple TV as a Christmas gift last year. The stock Siri Remote that comes with the new Apple TV can be used for game play. But I found the gaming experience with the Siri Remote to be lacking. That’s why I decided to pick up a SteelSeries Nimbus wireless game controller. SteelSeires Nimbus box SteelSeries Nimbus unboxing SteelSeries Nimbus unboxing The Nimbus is powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery. The controller uses a Lightning port for charging. There’s a series of four LEDs at the top of the controller that indicate how well the battery is charged. I was pleased to discover that my new Nimbus was fully charged. SteelSeries Nimbus lights The Nimbus is a Bluetooth controller. Pairing it with the Apple TV was pretty simple. Turn both devices on. Open the Apple TV’s Settings app, navigate to Remotes and Devices, select Bluetooth, and the Nimbus should appear under Other Devices. From there, you can select the Nimbus for wireless pairing to the Apple TV. Apple TV Remotes and Devices Menu Apple TV Bluetooth menu Apple TV Bluetooth screen Nimbus connected to Apple TV Once the Nimbus was paired to the Apple TV, it was smooth sailing. I found that the game controller replicated most of the functions of the Siri Remote and that I could use it to navigate around the main Apple TV screen just like the remote. I selected the game Dragon Mania Legends. As the game loaded, a screen came up that I hadn’t seen before with instructions on how to use a game controller with the game. Game controller instructions (Curiously, the game controller depicted in the instructional graphic looks similar to a Playstation Vita. Not sure what’s going on there.) I’ve found that most games will provide a screen like this. For the ones that don’t, working out the controls is usually not a problem. The Nimbus is a comfortable and familiar controller that resembles an Xbox controller in design. The buttons, D-Pad, and joysticks work well, and the Nimbus really does make for a much more enjoyable experience when it comes to Apple TV gaming. Here’s to hoping that some clever game designers will now make some really good games for the Apple TV. It seems much more likely with controller options like the SteelSeries Nimbus.

 Apple’s explanation for its secrecy is a thinly veiled jab at its biggest competitors Steve Kovach Aug. 10, 2016, 7:03 PM 11,323 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple SVP Eddy Cue took a subtle shot at competitors in a recent interview.Getty If there's one negative theme that follows Apple more than anything, it's the odd expectation that it should be pumping out some kind of world-changing, breakthrough product every four years or so. Otherwise, the company is hosed. While Google, Facebook, Amazon, and other rivals are pumping out futuristic product categories and products ranging from speakers infused with artificial intelligence to autonomous drones that beam the internet from the sky, Apple's product portfolio feels stuck in the present. But there's something critics often miss. Unlike some of its rivals, Apple is allergic to discussing its future plans until it feels confident they're polished enough to be shown in a well orchestrated product unveiling. That philosophy was perfectly illustrated in a recent interview Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue gave to Fast Company. And it's a thinly veiled jab at Apple's rivals that constantly release half-baked technologies. Here's Cue, emphasis ours: We don’t want to tell the world what we want to solve, what we’re trying to solve. Why? Because we haven’t solved it. Other than trying to make ourselves look cool or good, what’s the purpose of that? I don’t understand that part of it. So, yeah, there are a bunch of things we’re working on that we’d like to solve—some we’ve been working on for years and we haven’t solved, for that matter. I don’t feel like we should be tooting our own horns that we’re trying to solve that problem, when we haven’t really solved it. So it may seem like Apple is only modestly iterating on iPhones, iPads, and Macs every year, but behind the scenes it's working on a lot of other "problems" as well. We just won't see the results of that work until Apple believes it's ready. Meanwhile, we've seen a string of headline-grabbing technologies from other companies this year that hold little promise, don't work well, or have no clear direction. Facebook's Oculus VR headset is great for hardcore gamers willing to spend $1,000 or more on a high-end PC, but the company has been fuzzy about what it can do next with the technology. Social networking? Movies? Shopping? It's all of the above! Or some of the above. Who knows? Chatbots were another buzzy technology trumpeted by Facebook, Microsoft, Google, and others this spring under the unproven assumption people would rather text with a computer to book a flight or buy flowers. So far, those experiments are off to a rocky start. And finally, there's AI, which following Google's I/O conference in June caused some to question Apple's longevity if it doesn't catch up in the space. (I later reported that Apple is sitting on some really impressive AI tech.) But it's way too early for any one company to claim it's winning the space or to prove that AI has fundamentally changed how we use technology. Cue's comments were a jab at all the half-baked tech we've seen Apple's rivals introduce over the years, from Google Glass to the Amazon Fire Phone. Meanwhile, you'd be insane to think Apple's not noodling with everything from augmented reality to driverless cars in its R&D labs.Business Insider In fact, Apple's R&D spending has never been higher, and as independent analyst Neil Cybart wrote a few months ago, that spending hints at a huge pivot coming for the company, likely in transportation. In Cue's words, so much of what we've seen from Apple's competitors just look "cool or good." Apple waits until its cool stuff actually solves a problem before releasing it.

While details on the new device are scarce and entirely unconfirmed, you ought to know by now that it doesn’t stop the tech press from working themselves into a violent thrum teasing out every rumor until Apple validates or invalidates them. However the launch plays out early next month, the seventh generation of Apple’s ubiquitous smartphone is bound to look a lot like the sixth, just with more stuff you didn’t know you wanted. It feels a little played out. If you want to pay attention to a more exciting source of technology rumor and speculation, you need to be looking at the Apple Watch. RELATED: 7 New Tricks to Find on the iPhone 7 Released in April 2015, Apple’s first-generation wearable gadget took the public by storm, so you can rest assured there’s going to be a lot of thought going into its 2.0 revamp. It will reportedly be released “later this year,” and here’s the buzz on what tech pundits and analysts are expecting it to bring with it. It might have a two-lens camera. Already expected on the iPhone-7-to-come, an Apple patent outlines how a higher-quality two-lens camera system can be adapted to work on your wristwatch. The perpetual disclaimer on patents, however, is that companies like Apple will file patents often, whether or not they ever intend to implement them. It might be GPS-enabled. Forget pulling out your smartphone and firing up Google Maps to figure out where you are — the second-generation Apple Watch is rumored to be able locate you at a glance. RELATED: My Week With the Apple Watch It might have a barometer. A barometer simply measures air pressure, but the data it generates can be used to determine someone’s altitude. If Apple includes a barometer in the watch, it will be indispensable for athletes who want to measure their climbs and descents, whether by foot or by bike. It’s expected to be more waterproof. Swim with your fantasy gadget? Why not? A more water-resistant Apple Watch leaves you less worried about drops, spills, or even just the weather. RELATED: Apple Watch: 10 Things You Need to Know Better battery life is on the way. Most Apple Watch wearers have to recharge at the end of the day, adding yet another thing you have to charge at night. If Apple can implement a less power-intensive chip — as many suspect it will — Apple will be able to punch through the one-day battery barrier. It will not have a wireless LTE connection. Those looking to replace their smartphone entirely with a watch will have to wait to do so. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says an Apple Watch with its own data connection won’t be on the consumer radar until next year. Add a Comment Sign Up for the Men's Journal Newsletter!

National World Business Tech Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Profile Settings Sign Out technology Search Digital Living Gadgets Games Social Networking Apps Apple said to plan first pro laptop overhaul in four years MARK GURMAN Last updated 08:26, August 11 2016 AP Members of the media and Apple guests get a look at the new MacBook which was released in March 2015. Apple is preparing the first significant overhaul of its MacBook Pro laptop line in over four years, according to people familiar with the matter, using one of its older products to help reverse two quarters of sliding sales. The updated notebooks will be thinner, include a touch screen strip for function keys, and will be offered with more powerful and efficient graphics processors for expert users such as video gamers, said the people, who asked not to be named. The new computers have been in advanced testing within Apple since earlier this year, said one of the people. The MacBook Pros aren't likely to debut at an event currently scheduled for September 7 to introduce next-generation versions of the iPhone, according to one of the people. Apple spokesman Bill Evans declined to comment. READ MORE: * Review: Sierra, Apple's new Mac operating system * Apple opens up its walled garden * Why Apple should buy Tesla Apple co-founder Steve Jobs heralded tablets as possible laptop replacements by calling the iPad a "post-PC" device after it launched in 2010, but products like the MacBook Pro have shown surprising resilience. Sales of Macs, including the Pro line, rose 6 per cent to US$25.5 billion in the last fiscal year, while iPad sales fell 23 per cent to US$23.2 billion. This year's MacBook Pro overhaul is aimed at increasing notebook sales at a time when consumers are taking longer to buy or replace iPads. Apple research suggests customers upgrade iPads roughly every three years, while they buy new iPhones every 18 to 24 months, according to a person familiar with Apple's strategy, which helps explain why iPad sales numbers have fallen from a peak in 2013. The most significant addition to the new MacBook Pro is a secondary display above the keyboard that replaces the standard function key row. Ad Feedback Instead of physical keys, a strip-like screen will present functions on an as-needed basis that fit the current task or application. The smaller display will use Organic Light-Emitting Diodes, a thinner, lighter and sharper screen technology, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said earlier this year. Apple's goal with the dedicated function display is to simplify keyboard shortcuts traditionally used by experienced users. The panel will theoretically display media playback controls when iTunes is open, while it could display editing commands like cut and paste during word processing tasks, the people said. The display also allows Apple to add new buttons via software updates rather than through more expensive, slower hardware refreshes. The new top-of-the-line MacBook Pros will be slightly thinner than the current models but are not tapered like the MacBook Air and latest 12-inch MacBook, one of the people said. The new MacBook Pros have a smaller footprint than current models and the casing has shallower curves around the edges. The pressure-sensitive trackpad is also slightly wider, the person added. An option for a version featuring a higher-performance graphics chip from Advanced Micro Devices will be available, another person familiar with the matter said. It's unclear which provider Apple will use for the main processor, but Intel has supplied this in the past. Apple is using one of AMD's "Polaris" graphics chips because the design offers the power efficiency and thinness necessary to fit inside the slimmer Apple notebook, the person said. The new graphics card is more than 20 per cent thinner than its predecessor, AMD said earlier this year. AMD declined to comment, referring inquiries to Apple. The new design will include USB-C technology, a multifunctional type of port that can handle charging, data transfers, and display connectivity, one of the people said. Apple has also considered bringing gray, gold, and silver colours to the new line, as it has done with other products like the iPhone, iPad, and the 12-inch MacBook, a person said. It's unclear whether coloured Pro laptops will be available when the new line is released. Apple is planning to bring over its Touch ID fingerprint technology from the iPhone to the new MacBook Pro line. Apple has tested versions of the upcoming laptops that integrate the scanner beside the new function key display, according to one of the people. The sensor would allow users to log in more quickly and theoretically authenticate Apple Pay purchases. Like with iPhones, the new Pro laptops will encrypt fingerprint data so it can't be removed from the devices. Apple will also release a new version of its Mac operating system named Sierra this fall that brings Siri, new messaging and photo-management features, deeper iCloud integration, and more efficient file storage to Apple's desktops and laptops, the company said in June.  - The Washington Post Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next Gadgets story: 4K ultra-high definition is television like never before Technology Homepage Comments technology headlines Internet cable milestone No proof?

Turns out, Apple's iPhone SE is super popular across the pond, and sales of the 4-inch handset aren't too shabby here at home, either. According to new smartphone sales data from Kantar Worldpanel ComTech, the iPhone SE was the top-selling device in Great Britain for the three months ending June 2016, accounting for 9.2 percent of smartphone sales, followed by the iPhone 6s at 9.1 percent. The handsets helped Apple's iOS grab 37.2 percent of Great Britain's smartphone market in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 3.1 percentage points compared to a year earlier. That put Apple's mobile OS in second place behind Android, which captured 57.3 percent of the market. Back in the US, iOS accounted for 31.8 percent of smartphone sales in Q2, a 1.3 percentage point year-over-year increase. Android, meanwhile, came out on top of the market despite facing a "small decline," with its share dropping to 65.5 percent from 66.1 percent a year ago. Together, the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus accounted for 15.1 percent of smartphone sales during the period, overtaking the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, which grabbed a combined 14.1 percent. The iPhone SE came in third in the US at 5.1 percent. //Related Articles iPhone SE vs. iPhone 6s: Specs and Design Compared In China, meanwhile, Apple's faces increased competition from local manufacturers and "continued supply constraints," Kantar said. There, iOS continued its streak of year-over-year declines during the second quarter, dropping 1.8 percentage points to 17.9 percent of the market. That pushes Apple behind Huawei at 25.7 percent and Xiaomi at 18.5 percent. Despite that setback, the future looks bright for Cupertino and its iPhone SE overall. "Anticipation for the newest iPhone, usually released in late September every year, typically means a weaker summer period for iOS," Kantar said. "However, sales data shows that 49 percent of US iPhone owners and 51 percent of Chinese iPhone owners own an iPhone 5s or older. This represents a large opportunity to upgrade these consumers to the latest four-inch iPhone."

The company wants Australians to be able to pay with their iPhone via its NFC payment service, but Australian banks are resisting because they want access to the NFC antenna. The Cupertino company has rejected the banks’ proposal, and has now filed a complaint to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). In a formal complaint submitted late last week, Apple claims that giving into the demands of these Australian banks would be extremely detrimental to customers. Updated on 8-30-2016 by Lulu Chang: Apple formally responds to Australian bank demands  Three of Australia’s biggest banks — the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank, and Westpac Banking Corp — want their own digital wallets on iOS, but for that they need to be able to use the NFC antenna on the iPhone. In July, these banks, joined by Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, filed a request in July to the ACCC asking for permission to “join forces” and negotiate with Apple to gain access to the NFC antennas. Related: Here are all the places that support Apple Pay, including nine countries But Apple doesn’t allow this kind of access, as it reportedly would diminish the security of the smartphone, according to Australian news site Financial Review. “Apple upholds very high security standards for our customers when they use Apple devices to make payments,” Apple says in its complaint to the ACCC. “Providing simple access to the NFC antenna by banking applications would fundamentally diminish the high level of security Apple aims to have on our devices.” Moreover, the Cupertino-based giant says, giving into the banks would only worsen an existing virtual monopoly. Apple quoted the ACCC’s chairman, noting, “It’s fair to say that, even though you’ve got four main players, they do have about 85 to 90 per cent of the market share and the competition between them is not as intense as you’d expect.”  Furthermore, Apple says that the banks’ proposal would stymie progress. “The only effect that the proposed collective bargaining/boycott could have is to further delay, or even block, the expansion of Apple Pay in Australia,” the company said in its filing. “This will put a brake on new competition, with respect to digital presentment methods and retail banking services more broadly, by stifling the incentive for existing players to develop innovative new solutions that build upon and compete against the security, privacy and convenience of Apple Pay.” The banks do not want to forfeit the millions of dollars they would earn through interchange fees — which would go to Apple — but Apple says the banks want Apple to bend to their terms, such as by allowing them to charge people who opt to use Apple Pay. One bank reportedly refused to enter into a confidentiality agreement with Apple for preliminary discussions about terms for participating in Apple Pay. Related: Apple Pay is dominating the contactless payment market in the U.S. The ACCC is looking to announce a decision on NFC later this month, but Apple says the commission should wait and extend its review to a six-month period. And as for the banks, they have responded to Apple’s ACCC filing, with a spokesperson noting that, “Apple’s submission to the ACCC makes it clear that Apple does not want to give iPhone users the ability to choose an integrated third party wallet of their own preference. Unlike users of Samsung and Android, Apple is blocking access to the NFC function and wants to leave iPhone users with no choice but to use Apple Pay. Their submission to the ACCC claims this lack of choice is in the best interest of Australian consumers. The applicants disagree. Instead, they want to negotiate with Apple so there is an opportunity to offer other integrated wallets alongside Apple Pay.” Supermarket giant Coles has separately expressed its support for the Australian banks. “We believe the ability to tailor solutions for customers and provide them with greater value should be the driver for customer choice and not a technical lockout,” the retailer said in its own submission to the ACCC. Read More Apple Pay is currently available in Australia, but through limited means. Australians with American Express cards can use the service, but AmEx cards that have been co-branded with banks won’t work. ANZ Banking Group also made a deal to participate in Apple Pay, while reportedly giving some interchange fees up to Apple. The terms of the deal have not been disclosed. On a similar note, Android Pay launched in Australia recently and while it is compatible with ANZ and more than 25 banks, lack of support from the other top three banks was a noticeable issue. Westpac initially said it would support Android Pay last year, but it didn’t make the cut when the payment service officially launched in July. With this NFC issue now arising with Apple, don’t expect the banks to jump in any time soon. Here are all the places that support Apple Pay, now extending to nine countries Apple Pay is dominating the contactless payment market in the U.S. BrewArt lets homebrewers concoct their favorite beers from their smartphones Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Donald Trump’s advisors are lying to him Quartz iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech A laser pointer from the stands helped the Oakland Raiders beat the Texans BGR News T-Mobile has some of the best Black Friday deals we’ve seen BGR News Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo News Network

Over the past few months, Apple’s car team has ballooned to nearly 1,000 members. In turn, Apple over the last year and a half has hired a number of venerable auto industry veterans with deep experience across all facets of the car development and manufacturing process. Because Apple is particularly interested in developing an electric car, the company has specifically brought on a number of engineers with expertise in battery related technologies. DON'T MISS: The worst thing about the iPhone 7 might be the iPhone 7 Plus With that in mind, the Korean-based ETNews is reporting that Apple recently inked a deal with an unnamed South Korean battery company as part of its ongoing interest in bringing an Apple-branded car to market. Intriguingly, the mysterious company is reportedly made up of about 20-25 employees who are said to be “expert technologists in batteries.” Even more intriguing is that the company is said to be perfecting a new type of innovative battery technology wherein the batteries themselves are hollow at the center. Because batteries create most heat from the center due to chemical reactions, this company has created batteries where air flow and cooling are smooth in the center of batteries and this can minimize installation of separate cooling device or a device that prevents over-heating. They are also advantageous in high output. By utilizing this space, it is easy to design parallel connection, which is to expand battery capacity, in these batteries. Apple did not choose standardized circular or rectangular batteries that are widely used for current electric vehicles, but it is planning to develop its own independent batteries for electric vehicles based on this Korean company’s hollow battery technology. “Because we made a NDA with Apple, we cannot discuss any information regarding this project.” said a high-ranking official from this Korean company. Notably, Apple recently brought back longtime executive Bob Mansfield to lead up Project Titan, lending even more credence to the notion that Apple is dead serious about entering the unforgiving and cutthroat auto market.

For the first time in the history of the iPhone, Apple unveiled two new models at the same time in September 2014, the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus, following the exact same recipe in 2015. This year, the company is also expected to have two brand new smartphones in stores come September – though until recently, Apple may have considered launching three distinct devices. However, there’s one huge change coming to the new iPhone this year that will annoy plenty of longtime Apple fans. DON’T MISS: Everything new in iOS 10 beta 5 and iOS 10 public beta 4 A new report this week detailed some of the hot new features coming in the iPhone 7. Even though the device will keep the design of the iPhone 6 virtually unchanged, it’ll have some interesting new tricks up its sleeve. The rear camera is getting a huge update, for example… but only if you get the right model. “The dual cameras on the larger new iPhone will produce brighter photos with more detail, according to a person who has used a prototype version of the upcoming device,” Bloomberg reported earlier this week. “Both sensors, which each capture color differently, simultaneously take a picture, and the device produces a single, merged photograph, said the person.” “The dual system sharpens photos taken in low-light environments, the person said,” the report continued. “The combination of the merged photos from the two camera sensors also allows users to zoom while retaining more clarity, the person added. The smaller version of the new phones will not include dual lenses, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said earlier this year.” For the first time since 2014, the two iPhones coming in September will not be alike. They’ll share most of the same specs, but the camera on the back of the iPhone 7 Plus promises to be vastly superior to the one on the iPhone 7. Moreover, reports said the iPhone 7 Plus may receive a bump in RAM to handle the dual rear cameras. Looking at early iPhone 7 rumors, I already concluded that Apple is going to force me to buy a new iPhone that I don’t really want this year. And it looks like I might not be the only person who doesn’t appreciate these rumors. “It sounds like the plus-sized iPhone really will be the only model with the dual lens camera. Depressing if true,” Apple fan John Gruber concluded, after reading the same Bloomberg report. The worst thing about the iPhone 7 will be the iPhone 7 Plus is that the 4.7-inch model won’t be the best iPhone Apple can offer, especially when it comes to camera performance — which is one of the iPhone features Apple values most. That’s something that didn’t happen in previous years when the only thing that separated the two devices was optical image stabilization on the phablet model.

Aug 10, 2016 By Reem The iOS 10 beta 5 version has recently been released as a tribute to the developer section of people. The official version cannot be launched to Apple immediately as much work is still remaining. But with the next event schedule on September first week , it is understandable that Apple is running it spending processes as soon as possible so it can launch the iOS 10 around that date. Now, with  I O S 10 private beta and the iOS 10th public beta ready, a lot of hassles have conceived of working on many last moment changes and reports of problems with the beta version. The iOS 10 beta version 5 and 4 have quite a lot of  energy. IOS 10 beta 5 and Beta 4 are quite different from each other although to the normal user, both the firmware updates would seem insignificant. From the looks department it is true that the iOS 10 beta 5 will have major changes. But if it is closely analyse then you would be able to see that almost all the bugs at work created when a person was using the iOS 10 beta 4. 7th September will mark a date when the Cupertino giant is expected to lift the curtain from over the operating system finally. This would be in sync with the other devices that are being planned. Everything is pretty hush hush at this time, so we do not know for sure which devices are being added. But we do know for sure that the company will be adding a couple of laptops in the pro range, that will have retina displays with 13 and 15 inch screens. Apart from this, news also points to the high possibility of a new phone getting launched on this day. We expect that to be iPhone 7, and if it really is, then we will be able to get the operating system along with it. The phone will be revealed now and  is expected to hit shelves by the month of January in 2017. No words about the price or ETA on the Laptops have been given.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) Speaking as a guest on CNBC, Grasso started off by saying many investors like to jump on the Apple "bandwagon when it serves their purpose" but also "love to hate it when it serves their purpose as well." Grasso continued that investors are looking forward to the iPhone 7 launch, but he believes it can "only disappoint." Related Link: Apple's $300 Billion Opportunity "iPhone sales as a whole are decreasing," he explained. "The company is still relying on iPhone sales and I would be a seller on any short term strength." When asked to press if his view is short-term in nature, he answered that Apple's stock has actually underperformed relative to the technology ETF and investors looking for growth in the technology sector should buy shares of Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) or Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). "The ECB and the Fed have pushed people into risk assets," he added. "Apple's really not a risk asset - it's just benefited from everyone getting pushed into the market."

The patent seemed out of place for an electric car, and it turns out that’s the case because the law firm handling patents for Apple says it was accidentally assigned to the wrong company thanks to a clerical error. typographic error gave Apple a military vehicle patent The Morrison and Foerster law firm filed a Request for Certification of Correction on August 9th stating Apple was unintentionally named as the patent assignee due to a “typographical error.” The patent actually belongs to military vehicle maker BAE Systems, which makes much more sense. Yesterday’s patent assignment was seen as more proof Apple is working on a car. The patent spurred discussions about how articulated joints fit into Apple’s vehicle plans, and was even a topic we discussed on our Daily Observations podcast. We speculated Apple could be looking at mass transit vehicles like busses, was obfuscating their real intentions, or simply patented an idea that came up during the car design process. In other words, there wasn’t an obvious use for the patent—and now we know why. Apple’s electric car development program is still unconfirmed, leaving it open to rumor and speculation. TMO’s sources say the company is serious about its car, dubbed Project Titan. Bob Mansfield, Apple’s go-to guy for secret projects and engineering wizard, was recently put in charge of Project Titan—a sign the company is serious about getting into the automotive market. Mr. Mansfield has been working as a behind the scenes figure at Apple for the past few years, and has a reputation for bringing products to market, or killing them if he thinks they’re a dead end. Since Apple isn’t going to be a contractor for military vehicles, the big question is how do you get from Apple Inc to BEA Systems with a typographical error? Morrison and Foerster very likely have a computerized template system for generating the patent filing forms for their many clients. There’s probably shortcut codes assigned to each client, and the codes for Apple and BAE Systems are just close enough that someone accidentally typed the wrong one. Patently Apple noted the patent application was filed in July 2015, which left plenty of time to notice and correct the error. Either no one was paying attention, or the law firm felt it was or faster to correct the error after the patent was granted. Either way, we won’t be seeing any Apple Tanks on the battle field.

This is true of the MacBook Pro, Apple’s more powerful portable computer aimed at professionals, as well as its compact premium 12-inch MacBook. But save for a few physical changes (a pressure sensitive trackpad, the 12-inch MacBook’s redesigned keyboard), using an Apple laptop made in 2016 isn’t much different than using one from five years ago. This may change when Apple introduces its next MacBook Pro. That device is said to be getting a strip-like touchscreen just above the keyboard where the function keys currently sit, according to reports from Bloomberg and others. Unlike a normal keyboard, the rumored touch panel would be able to change its appearance based on context, Bloomberg reports. When iTunes is open it might display playback controls, while switching to word processing software would turn them into editing shortcuts. The overall goal is to simplify keyboard shortcuts, eliminating the need to remember key combinations for each app or program you use. The rumored addition makes sense given some of the similar features and products Apple has recently released. Take the iPad Pro’s Smart Keyboard, for example. It pulls up on-screen keyboard shortcuts for the app currently in use when users hold down the command key. The miniature touch panel reportedly coming to the MacBook Pro seems like an evolution of that idea. Likewise, Apple has been adding new capabilities to its iPhones and iPads to make them more contextually aware. Swiping to the right of the iPhone’s touch screen will pull up a list of suggested apps. Plug in your headphones and your iPhone will automatically nudge you to launch Spotify or Apple Music. A smart command key row would allow Apple to bring similar context-aware features to the Mac in a way that makes sense. That said, such a move would be indicative of Apple’s relative resistance to mess with its laptops all that much. As Windows-based manufacturers are experimenting with all kinds of touchscreen hybrid laptop-tablet designs, Apple has shown no sign of doing anything similar (The firm’s CEO, Tim Cook, famously called PC vendors “confused” back in 2013). Sure, there’s the iPad Pro, but that’s more of a tablet with some laptop-like functionality. And new features like Handoff have tied the Mac and iPhone software more closely together, but Apple shows no sign of going so far as to blend the two device’s operating systems, as the Windows world has done. For now, a row of touchscreen keys might be the most Apple is willing to experiment with its laptops. Some might call this a lack of innovation. But the Windows hybrids have done little to revive the flagging PC business — so Apple is probably wise to keep its focus elsewhere. Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Interested users can get up to a $160 discount on the refurbished tablets, which will come with the same one-year warranty offered to purchases of brand new ones.  ( Apple ) Advertisement Apple has added the 12.9-inch iPad Pro to its official refurbished online store, as it usually does for products that reach certain points in their lifetime. The massive tablet was launched into the market 10 months ago. By adding the 12.9-inch iPad Pro to the refurbished store, interested customers will be able to acquire units at discounted prices that can lead to savings of up to $160. On the online store, Apple has listed the 32 GB model of the Wi-Fi only 12.9-inch iPad Pro at $679, which represents a $120 discount to the tablet's original price tag of $799. For the 128 GB model of the Wi-Fi only version of the tablet, the listed price is $809, which is $140 less than the original price of $949. Lastly, the 128 GB model of the Wi-Fi and Cellular version of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is also up at the store, at a price of $919 which places a $160 discount on the tablet's original price of $1,079. For all three models, users can choose from the three color options of gold, silver and space gray. Users can choose to pick up the refurbished iPad Pro units they order, or they can also avail of free shipping. All the refurbished iPad Pro units will include the same one-year warranty offered to purchases of brand new iPad Pro units, as well as all the accessories and manuals. The refurbished units will also be coming with a new battery and outer shell, along with a new white box, which is all a part of what Apple describes as a rigorous refurbishment process. The inventory levels of Apple's officially refurbished products fluctuate depending on the available supply though, so users interested in acquiring second-hand 12.9-inch iPad Pro units at lower prices should definitely take advantage of the offer as soon as they can. It should be noted, however, that there are some retailers that are selling brand new units of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro at a discount, with some prices going even lower than the ones Apple is offering for these refurbished units. It could also be wise to wait around and see if such an offer comes up, though settling for the refurbished units of Apple is not a bad choice either. Apple, in a new advertisement, has pushed the iPad Pro as a replacement for computers, with the tablet offering customers a more flexible platform compared to traditional desktop computers.

The SE performed exceptionally well in the U.K. Kantar estimates that it was the country’s “top selling smartphone” with a 9.2-percent market share, a sell-through rate brisk enough to land the diminutive handset slightly ahead of the Apple’s pricier iPhone 6s, which also had a 9.2-percent share. Furthermore, it contributed to the growth in Apple’s U.K. device sales to 37.2 percent — up 3.1 percent from the corresponding quarter a year ago. Related: iPhone sales plummeted, but Apple Music saved the day Elsewhere in Europe, Apple’s gains were decidedly more modest. In France, its share of the handset market grew 21 percent, and in Germany, iOS devices constituted 14.2 percent of the country’s phone sales over the period. Overall, iOS device market share reached 18.2 percent in the region — an increase of 0.7 percent compared to the same period a year ago. A hop and skip over the pond in the U.S., the iPhone SE did just fine, too. According to Kantar, the handset accounted for 5.1 percent of all smartphone sales in the U.S. — an amount that saw Apple’s year-on-year market share climb 1.3 percent to 31.8 percent. But the SE remained firmly behind Apple’s iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s, which ended June with a 15.1 percent share, and Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, which commanded a 14.1 percent share. The SE’s traction — as much as 23 percent of total iPhone sales, market research firm RBC Capital Markets estimated — may seem like cause to celebrate. Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri implied as much in an interview with Bloomberg in June. “Customer demand for our products was significantly stronger than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter,” he said. “We were not able to fulfill iPhone SE demand throughout the quarter.” But TechCrunch concluded that the results were a mixed bag: the SE’s comparatively low price point drove Apple’s gross margins, or the difference between the company’s revenue and production costs, down significantly this past fiscal quarter, below 38 percent. That’s down from the second quarter of 2015, when it stood at 40.8 percent. Related: Apple and Samsung are ruling smartwatches Worse, the device wasn’t a sales success everywhere. The SE visibly struggled in China, where Kantar reports it made up a mere 2.5 percent of phone sales. Two factors were to blame, apparently: “supply constraints” and “fierce competition.” The latter continues to dog Apple — local firms like Xiaomi and Huawei have proven formidable competitors in the budget handset space. All told, Apple’s market share in the country came in at around 17.9 percent by the end of last quarter, down from 19.7 percent year over year. The decline is in line with a broader slowdown in the smartphone market. According to analysts at IDC, phone shipments are expected to grow just 3.1 percent in 2016 — a meteoric decrease from 2015’s 10.5-percent growth and 2014’s 27.8-percent growth. China, in particular, will suffer from the symptoms of saturation: IDC estimates the country will see “low single digit growth rates” this year. Related: Apple gains notebook market share in 2015, but can’t top HP and Lenovo But despite the doom and gloom, Apple’s future looks bright. IDC believes that low-cost devices like the SE and efforts like trade-in programs will “bring the iPhone back to growth.” And according to Kantar, plenty of folks in the past few months chose to hold off on upgrading from an older iPhone. “Anticipation for the newest iPhone, usually released in late September every year, typically means a weaker summer period for iOS,” said Kantar. “This represents a large opportunity to upgrade these consumers to the latest four-inch iPhone.” That will be welcome news to investors, no doubt. In its earnings report ending June 2016, Apple reported lower sales of iPhones, iPads, and Macs not only compared to the previous quarter, but the same quarter a year ago. And in China, it saw a 33-percent decline in revenue. But the company’s services division picked up some of the slack — sales of Apple Music subscriptions, apps in the App Store, and iCloud storage plans jumped a collective 19 percent.

While sales of Android devices still outstrip Apple’s iPhone as much as four to one in some countries, the US company’s market share has returned to growth for the first time since late last year. According to statistics from market insight specialists Kantar Worldpanel ComTech, iOS accounted for almost 32% of smartphone sales in the US and just over 18% of sales in the big European markets of Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Spain during the second quarter of the year.  “In Great Britain, the iPhone SE was the top selling device in the quarter at 9.2%, followed by the iPhone 6s at 9.1%,” said Dominic Sunnebo, business unit director for Kantar Worldpanel in Europe. “Together they contributed to iOS growth of 3.1 percentage points to 37.2% in the second quarter of 2016.” He aded that Apple accounted for one in five smartphone sales in France, while Germany also improved.  “These three markets combined, plus very slight declines in Italy and Spain, led iOS to grow across the EU5 by 0.7 percentage points,” said Mr Sunnebo. “This represents the first period of increase since the three months ending November 2015.” The latest figures will provide a boost to the US giant as it battles to tackle the march of Android phones, particularly the cheaper Far East brands such as China’s Huawei. iOS saw year-on-year declines in China, where it fell to third spot behind Huawei and another local brand Xiaomi.Kantar Worldpanel noted that half of US consumers and half of Chinese own an iPhone 5s or older and have yet to upgrade, representing a “large opportunity” for Apple. Kantar reported: “With strong demand for the iPhone SE throughout the second quarter, it will be interesting to track whether iOS growth will continue through the third quarter, assuming that supplies become less constrained.

According to a report, in the last week or so, more than 10 counterfeit bitcoin apps have made it into the App Store, with some of them designed to steal bitcoin from users that are worth thousands of dollars. Apple told Motherboard, according to the report, that all of the apps have since been removed from the App Store. The apps were pretending to be legitimate bitcoin wallets, like BitGo, Breadwallet and Coinbase, even using some of the same source code to appear to look just like them. The Breadwallet clone ended up losing customers $20,000 or more, with half of it from one victim alone. It’s not clear how the apps made it past the screening at Apple. Bitcoin developers will, in some cases, make their source code public to boost transparency, but that makes it easier for hackers to spoof the apps, the report noted. Hack attacks in the bitcoin market have become more commonplace in recent weeks. Last week, Bitfinex, a Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange was hacked, requiring the company to put a hold on all trading and deposits while it investigates the breach. The hack allegedly led to a $65 million theft of virtual currency. Bitcoin’s trading price dropped by around 20 percent that day. Meanwhile, in June, the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) was hacked, with the bad guy(s) able to steal $50 million in digital currency from the project that has otherwise been gaining some attention in the space because of its venture capital funding. Ether, which is a relatively newer digital currency on the market that runs on the Ethereum network, has been gaining some popularity up until this hack. Following the reports of the hack, Ether took a big hit.

The iPhone maker has argued that if it gives into the Australian bank’s demands for access to the Near Field Communications (NFC) chip on the iPhone, it would set a “troubling precedent” that could undermine the iPhone’s security. Apple was responding to a July application to the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC), by three of Australia’s big four banks: National Australia Bank (NAB), CommBank (CBA), and Westpac (WBC). The banks sought special permission to join forces in talks with Apple concerning access to the NFC chip on iPhones. The petition was filed three months after ANZ — which is not participating in the ACCC application — broke ranks to become the only 'big four' Australian bank to support Apple Pay. While Apple is a dominant player in Australia’s smartphone market, Apple argues in its response that Apple Pay is a new entrant to a payments market otherwise dominated by Australian banks. The three Australian banks are contesting interchange fees that occur between the bank that issues cards to consumers and the acquiring bank that handles a merchant’s transactions. The banks also want access to the iPhone’s NFC chip so that their digital wallets can use Apple Pay with equivalent functionality to Apple’s own wallet — the only wallet that does have access to the iPhone’s NFC chip. The banks argued that Apple’s stance on NFC access set it apart from Google, Samsung, and Microsoft, which do provide access to NFC chips on certain devices. They also cited the experience in Switzerland of the recent Apple Pay roll out: a digital wallet called Twint, backed by Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, uses Bluetooth to achieve comparable contactless functionality, but it is constrained by the fact that Bluetooth at payment terminals isn’t as widely supported as NFC. The banks frame Apple as a monopolistic third-party digital wallet provider, which due to its scale and control over hardware and software, “could be in a position to negotiate terms that would be likely to result in reduced competition and innovation, and increased risk in the security and transparency of mobile payments.” Read more Google doubles Android update to cope with rash of Qualcomm bugs Apple’s reply, penned by Marj Demmer, a former senior exec in ANZ’s cards and payments division, said the complaining banks didn’t understand Apple Pay. “The applicants rely on innuendo and misstatements to support their application. Most have little direct insight into Apple Pay or Apple’s terms,” wrote Demmer, who called out one bank for refusing to sign a non-disclosure agreement that would have given them privileged access to Apple Pay’s technical details. “Now they ask the ACCC for explicit permission got negotiate with Apple as a collective group. The goal of which is to force Apple and the third party providers to accept their terms, allow them to charge consumers that choose to use Apple Pay, and force Apple to undermine the security of its mobile payments service by opening access to the NFC antenna.” Read More: Apple: $1m price for iOS exploit says we’re doing a good job As applications redefine the perimeter, is encryption protecting it too well?

Wednesday, August 10, 2016 - 3:08 pm · Reply If Apple knows its product pipeline and believes its share price will ultimately increase in the long-run, and if Apple intends to continue to pay out (increasing) dividends, then it is easy to see that Apple’s purchase of its own shares on the open market are a smart investment. Apple is essentially able to use its strong financial position to purchase its shares for the equivalent of bargain basement prices. As Apple has more cash than it needs for operations and long-term investments, and since the return on cash is essentially zero these days, it looks like a smart investment to me.

Someday though Flunkie you might be able to afford Apple stock – probably when pigs can fly. Even an idjit galoot varmint like you can dream though right? Meanwhile I’ll just cash in my dividend gains tomorrow and think of what I might spend it on this time while you continue to live unabated still under the poverty line with zero prospects. DailyBread Wednesday, August 10, 2016 - 4:47 pm · Reply I love and care much for the quarterly AAPL dividend! Besides i usually reinvest it in another AAPL product or accessory! BOB Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 2:24 am · Reply The only reason to do a buy back is to reduce the number of outstanding shares, not to return value to a shareholder. By reducing the number of shares owned by other entities, the company reduces the amount of money paid out in a dividend. Also, in buying back those shares it would allow a company to get the number of shares down in order for a company to be taken private. Sneaky, if done slowly the share price does not rise to quickly. If a company wants to offer value to the shareholders, all the company would have to do is increase the dividend. Two things would happen, the desire to own the stock would increase, and the share price would increase. Stockholders would receive more money from the larger dividend.

Weiss  |  Posted 2016-08-09 Print               The next-gen Apple Watch will also have a faster processor and is expected to be released in the second half of 2016, according to reports. Apple's long-awaited next-generation Apple Watch 2 is now rumored to be unveiled in the second half of 2016 with a myriad of improvements, including built-in GPS, a barometer, improved waterproofing and a longer-lasting battery. The latest rumors come from a research note issued to investors by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who regularly publishes his take on details about upcoming products based on supply chain orders and activity. Kuo's latest information was published in an Aug. 7 story by MacRumors. The next Apple Watch, which could be called the Apple Watch 2, is expected to feature the same screen sizes and thicknesses as existing Apple Watches (pictured), even though they will incorporate thinner displays, the story reported. The next devices will not incorporate LTE cellular capabilities, despite earlier rumors, Kuo wrote in his note. Kuo's predictions also say that "upgraded first-generation Apple Watch models will [also] debut in the second half of 2016 with similar processor and waterproofing upgrades, but likely without the Apple Watch 2's most significant additions like a GPS and barometer," the story reported. He also "expects another Apple Watch price cut once the new models are launched," the report continued. The launch of an updated Apple Watch has been rumored since at least June of 2015, but has not yet appeared, according to earlier eWEEK stories. Rumors at that time suggested that an updated Apple Watch would include a built-in FaceTime video camera, more independence from accompanying iPhones and additional models at varying price levels. The original Apple Watch, which went on sale in April 2015, starts at $349 for the Apple Watch Sport version, which is available with a silver or space-gray aluminum body and with wristbands in many colors. The standard Apple Watch starts at $549 for a 38mm-wide version or $599 for a 42mm-wide model. Prices for the 38mm version can rise to $1,049, while prices for the 42mm model can go up to $1,099, depending on the watchband selected. The regular Apple Watch can be purchased with a fluoroelastomer band or one of three different leather bands. Several luxury versions are also available. Since its release, the Apple Watch has already received an updated operating system, watchOS 2, which delivers a wide range of new features and options as well as new tools to allow developers to add more future functions. The updated watchOS 2 software gives developers the ability to build faster, more powerful apps running natively on the Apple Watch, while also offering new watch faces and new communications capabilities in the device's Mail, Friends and Digital Touch apps. In April, Kuo issued an earlier research note that predicts a 25 percent drop in Apple Watch shipments in 2016 as consumers wait for the next version and for the company to make the devices more independent of their accompanying iPhones, according to an earlier eWEEK report. Kuo also said that his sales drop forecast was also due to a lack of killer apps for users and limited battery life. In January, a Juniper Research report found that the Apple Watch quickly captured 52 percent of the global smartwatch market in 2015, even though the first Apple Watches didn't go on sale until April of 2015. The popularity of the Apple Watch eclipsed the shipments of competing products from rival companies in less than a year, according to an earlier eWEEK report. In comparison, smartwatches running Android Wear made up less than 10 percent of sales in 2015. At that time, the lack of a strong use case for smartwatches caused consumer sales to lag, the report stated.           LATEST MOBILE ARTICLES   Apple Starts Program to Repair iPhones With 'Touch Disease' for $149 Google Touts Encryption Support On New Pixel Android Phones MobileIron Adds Single Sign-On to Box, Office 365, Salesforce Apple And PayPal Enable Payments Through Siri Voice Commands Revamped Google Play Music to Use Machine Learning to Suggest Songs                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Google’s Chrome Browser to Block Flash By John Voorhees Yesterday, Google announced that its Chrome browser will begin blocking Flash that runs in the background of webpages in September and make HTML5 the ‘default Chrome experience’ in December. According to Google: Today, more than 90% of Flash on the web loads behind the scenes to support things like page analytics. This kind of Flash slows you down, and starting this September, Chrome 53 will begin to block it. HTML5 is much lighter and faster, and publishers are switching over to speed up page loading and save you more battery life. You’ll see an improvement in responsiveness and efficiency for many sites. … In December, Chrome 55 will make HTML5 the default experience, except for sites which only support Flash. It has been more than six years since Steve Jobs penned an open letter titled ‘Thoughts on Flash,’ in which he concluded: Flash was created during the PC era – for PCs and mice. Flash is a successful business for Adobe, and we can understand why they want to push it beyond PCs. But the mobile era is about low power devices, touch interfaces and open web standards – all areas where Flash falls short. The avalanche of media outlets offering their content for Apple’s mobile devices demonstrates that Flash is no longer necessary to watch video or consume any kind of web content. And the 250,000 apps on Apple’s App Store proves that Flash isn’t necessary for tens of thousands of developers to create graphically rich applications, including games. New open standards created in the mobile era, such as HTML5, will win on mobile devices (and PCs too). Perhaps Adobe should focus more on creating great HTML5 tools for the future, and less on criticizing Apple for leaving the past behind. Jobs’ open letter was controversial when it was published. In 2010, Flash was everywhere, serving much of the video on the web and acting as a platform for online gaming. HTML5 was making headway, but it was the clear underdog. Adobe’s initial response to Jobs came from none other than Kevin Lynch, who was the CTO of Adobe in 2010, but is now a Vice President of Technology at Apple, leading the development of watchOS. Lynch announced that Adobe was shifting its focus away from the iPhone and iPad in favor of implementing Flash on Android and other mobile platforms. Flash never got a firm foothold in the mobile world. Roughly eighteen months after Jobs’ open letter, Adobe abandoned Flash for mobile and began to embrace HTML5. Since then, HTML5 has been incorporated into many of Adobe’s products and Adobe has actively participated in its development. The decline of Flash on PCs has been slower, but is likely to accelerate given Chrome’s browser market share, which, according to NetMarketShare, exceeds 50%. Chrome is notoriously hard on laptops’ battery life. In what struck me as a significant understatement, Google says that: Aside from [being prompted to enable Flash on Flash-only sites], the only change you’ll notice is a safer and more power-efficient browsing experience. In a consumer PC market dominated by laptops, better battery life and safety may be the ‘only’ benefits users will notice, but they are nonetheless significant.

Apple Responds to Australian Banks’ Request to Collectively Boycott and Negotiate Over Apple Pay By Graham Spencer Late last week Apple made a preliminary submission to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in relation to the request for permission from various Australian banks to boycott Apple Pay and collectively negotiate with Apple. Apple's submission is comparatively brief at just three pages, but it clearly highlights the approach Apple will take in opposing the banks' request. In its submission, Apple is quick to highlight the collective dominance of the banks in Australia which account for 66% of credit card balances in Australia, whilst characterising itself as the "new entrant to the Australian market" having only launched Apple Pay in November 2015. The other angle of attack from Apple is more surprising, and in the submission it appears quite clear that Apple is asserting that the closed nature of the NFC antenna in the iPhone is pivotal to maintaining the security of its users. Now they ask the ACCC for explicit permission to negotiate with Apple as a collective group. The goal of which is to force Apple and other third party providers to accept their terms, allow them to charge consumers that choose to use Apple Pay, and force Apple to undermine the security of its mobile payment service by opening access to the NFC antenna, placing at risk the consumer experience of a simple, secure, and private way to make payments in store, within, applications, or on the web. Apple notes that it will make a further, more comprehensive submission, at a later date. But a key purpose of this prelimary submission was to persuade the ACCC that the banks should not be given any interim approval, and that the ACCC should take the "normal 6 month statutory period for assessment". A few other interesting tidbits from Apple's submission: Apple's discussions with Australian banks in relation to Apple Pay began in "late 2014". Apple Pay launched in the US in October 2014. One of the applicant banks "has refused to even enter into a confidentiality agreement with Apple to allow for preliminary discussions about the terms under which it would participate in Apple Pay". Apple argues that "interim authorisation of a collective boycott will have a lasting and irreversible impact on the adoption of Apple Pay and other third party wallets, and the Australian payment market". Apple suggests that Apple Pay is not a competitive threat to the banks; "Unfortunately, and based on their limited understanding of the offering, the applicants perceive Apple Pay as a competitive threat". Apple writes "These banks want to maintain complete control over their customers", I would wager the banks would say the exact same thing about Apple.

"I think it's going to underperform perpetually," Grasso said. Apple shares have had a mediocre year, but rebounded nicely following an impressive earnings report. In fact, the stock is the Dow Jones industrial average's best performer over the past month, rising almost 12 percent. Yet for Grasso, the company's reliance on the iPhone is problematic. When Apple reported earnings in late July, it exceeded analysts' expectations in part because of the success of the iPhone SE model. But there remains a concern among analysts that not as many people as expected will upgrade to the iPhone 7. "Right now everyone is looking forward to the iPhone 7. ... I think it can only disappoint," Grasso said Tuesday on CNBC's "Trading Nation." Grasso added that he would be a seller of any short-term strength in Apple stock. "If you're looking for growth, you go with Facebook, you go into Amazon," he added. "The ECB and the Fed have pushed people into risk assets. Apple's really not a risk asset; it's just benefited from everyone getting pushed into the market." Craig Johnson, technical analyst at Piper Jaffray, conceded that investors looking for a stock to grow their money shouldn't expect that from Apple. However, he still likes the now-$108 stock at current levels. "The stock has been very resilient, it's found support four times at that $90 level," Johnson said on "Trading Nation." "[There's] more upside to come, but again this isn't going to be one of those big long-term winners." He sees the stock eventually rising to $122.

Cue explained the continuing issues with Maps,  “it just never ends”. Ironically, this isn’t something Apple had initially envisioned. Cue notes that Maps is a dynamic project with businesses opening and closing, POIs, and streets changing on a daily basis. With that said, Cue says Apple now uses data from customer iPhones to improve the Maps experience. For example, Apple can figure out if a new golf course has opened by tracking App Store downloads. If a ton of iOS users start downloading golfing apps in the same location, Apple can safely assume a new POI has been setup. On top of this, Cue also mentions that crowd-sourced data is only the first step. From there, the company then verifies the existence of the golf course by doing a web search or in the ‘worst case’ Apple will send people out to the location. Federighi says that it uses crowd-sourced data to figure out fluctuations in traffic flow or highlighting closed bridges or new roads. Predictably, both execs quickly point out that all user information remains anonymous and cannot be used to trace individual users. Your device may learn your commute patterns, it may learn when you go to the office and when you go home, so that locally on the phone it could tell you that you need to leave early because there’s a lot of traffic on your way home. Well, that’s something that is personal to you and provides value to you, but we don’t want Apple to know when you go to work. So we keep that intelligence on the device, but we can anonymously track things like traffic patterns. Cue makes an interesting point saying that the Maps project is rather expensive for Apple, with thousands of employees working on the project. Cue says this may be the reason why only Apple and Google even bother making Maps applications on a large scale. Cue also says that Apple Maps is super expensive and does not bring in any notable revenue for the company. Both Cue and Federighi are disappointed in the public perception of Apple Maps. Most of which came from the initial launch of the app back in 2012. They both insist that Apple Maps is up to speed now and will continue to get better down the road. They say the reason why we’re seeing a public beta now is because of the Maps debacle in iOS 6. Cue also touches on his relationship with Steve Jobs and now Tim Cook. He says that while the two CEO’s take different approaches, the end goal is still the same. I never wanted to disappoint Steve. I never want to disappoint Tim. And I have that with, like, my dad. I was here with [former Apple CEO Michael] Spindler and those guys, and I didn’t have it with them. That’s a quality that makes them unique. Now, their approach is very different. Steve was in your face screaming, and Tim is more quiet, more cerebral in his approach. But you have the same feeling. And when you disappoint Tim, even though he isn’t screaming at you, you get the same thing. [They both laugh knowingly.] That part comes through loud and clear. The full interview can be found here.

The laptops are already ‘in advanced testing’ but will unfortunately launch after the iPhone event in September. The report also mentions that the new MacBook Pro will also include an OLED touch bar to replace the current function keys. Instead of physical keys, a strip-like screen will present functions on an as-needed basis that fit the current task or application […] Apple’s goal with the dedicated function display is to simplify keyboard shortcuts traditionally used by experienced users. The panel will theoretically display media playback controls when iTunes is open, while it could display editing commands like cut and paste during word processing tasks, the people said. The display also allows Apple to add new buttons via software updates rather than through more expensive, slower hardware refreshes. Of course, Bloomberg also confirms that the new machine will carry USB-C ports. Though it doesn’t specifically mention how many ports, or if any other ports are included. The report also goes on to say that Touch ID will be included and will be beside the new touch bar. We expect the sensor to allow Apple Pay purchases on the web without the need of an iPhone or Apple Watch. While it doesn’t mention which models, the new Pros will have AMD’s Polaris GPUs inside. If history is any indication, this will be reserved for higher-spec’d models. An option for a version featuring a higher-performance graphics chip from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. will be available, another person familiar with the matter said. It’s unclear which provider Apple will use for the main processor, but Intel Corp. has supplied this in the past. Apple is using one of AMD’s “Polaris” graphics chips because the design offers the power efficiency and thinness necessary to fit inside the slimmer Apple notebook, the person said. The new graphics card is more than 20 percent thinner than its predecessor, AMD said earlier this year. AMD declined to comment, referring inquiries to Apple. Lastly, the report says that Apple has ‘considered bringing gray, gold, and silver colors to the new line’ but that it is ‘unclear’ whether or not Apple will make the move.

The company says Australia’s three largest banks have formed a monopolistic cartel, dictating the payment methods customers are allowed to use. Apple has also rejected the banks request to allow them to have access to the iPhone’s NFC chip to create alternate payment systems on the OS level. The iPhone maker says doing so would compromise the security of its platform. Apple has been working on introducing the service in Australia for some time now. Though major banks are not agreeing with Apple’s terms and claim that they would be losing millions of dollars in transaction fees. Australian banks argue that Apple Pay purchases are more expensive for the consumer. Of course, Apple shut that down. To the consumer, Apple Pay is free to use in every region it’s available in. With that being said, Apple Pay in Australia is currently available to American Express and ANZ cards. The purpose of Apple’s formal complaint is to rebut the request of banks asking for access to the NFC chip, and is also to encourage competition. Apple pointed to the market power in cards and payments of the incumbent banks and said “given their scale and market share, the applicants are essential to Apple’s ability to offer Apple Pay on a meaningful basis within Australia”. However, it said one of the banks that has brought the application has refused to even enter into a confidentiality agreement with Apple to allow for preliminary discussions about the terms under which it would participate in Apple Pay. The competition commission will be weighing in later this month. Apple, of course, doesn’t want this and is asking the commission to extend its review for another six months.

The updated notebooks will be thinner, include a touch screen strip for function keys, and will be offered with more powerful and efficient graphics processors for expert users such as video gamers, said the people, who asked not to be named. The new computers have been in advanced testing within Apple since earlier this year, said one of the people, who didn't want to be identified discussing products before their release. The MacBook Pros aren't likely to debut at an event currently scheduled for Sept. 7 to introduce next-generation versions of the iPhone, according to one of the people. Apple spokesman Bill Evans declined to comment. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs heralded tablets as possible laptop replacements by calling the iPad a "post-PC" device after it launched in 2010, but products like the MacBook Pro have shown surprising resilience. Sales of Macs, including the Pro line, rose 6 percent to $25.5 billion in the last fiscal year, while iPad sales fell 23 percent to $23.2 billion. This year's MacBook Pro overhaul is aimed at increasing notebook sales at a time when consumers are taking longer to buy or replace iPads. Apple research suggests customers upgrade iPads roughly every three years, while they buy new iPhones every 18 to 24 months, according to a person familiar with Apple's strategy, which helps explain why iPad sales numbers have fallen from a peak in 2013. The most significant addition to the new MacBook Pro is a secondary display above the keyboard that replaces the standard function key row. Instead of physical keys, a strip-like screen will present functions on an as-needed basis that fit the current task or application. The smaller display will use Organic Light-Emitting Diodes, a thinner, lighter and sharper screen technology, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said earlier this year. Apple's goal with the dedicated function display is to simplify keyboard shortcuts traditionally used by experienced users. The panel will theoretically display media playback controls when iTunes is open, while it could display editing commands like cut and paste during word processing tasks, the people said. The display also allows Apple to add new buttons via software updates rather than through more expensive, slower hardware refreshes. The new top-of-the-line MacBook Pros will be slightly thinner than the current models but are not tapered like the MacBook Air and latest 12-inch MacBook, one of the people said. The new MacBook Pros have a smaller footprint than current models and the casing has shallower curves around the edges. The pressure-sensitive trackpad is also slightly wider, the person added. An option for a version featuring a higher-performance graphics chip from Advanced Micro Devices will be available, another person familiar with the matter said. It's unclear which provider Apple will use for the main processor, but Intel Corp. has supplied this in the past. Apple is using one of AMD's "Polaris" graphics chips because the design offers the power efficiency and thinness necessary to fit inside the slimmer Apple notebook, the person said. The new graphics card is more than 20 percent thinner than its predecessor, AMD said earlier this year. AMD declined to comment, referring inquiries to Apple. The new design will include USB-C technology, a multifunctional type of port that can handle charging, data transfers, and display connectivity, one of the people said. Apple has also considered bringing gray, gold, and silver colors to the new line, as it has done with other products like the iPhone, iPad, and the 12-inch MacBook, a person said. It's unclear whether colored Pro laptops will be available when the new line is released. Apple is planning to bring over its Touch ID fingerprint technology from the iPhone to the new MacBook Pro line. Apple has tested versions of the upcoming laptops that integrate the scanner beside the new function key display, according to one of the people. The sensor would allow users to log in more quickly and theoretically authenticate Apple Pay purchases. Like with iPhones, the new Pro laptops will encrypt fingerprint data so it can't be removed from the devices. Apple will also release a new version of its Mac operating system named Sierra this fall that brings Siri, new messaging and photo-management features, deeper iCloud integration, and more efficient file storage to Apple's desktops and laptops, the company said in June. --- Ian King and Alex Webb contributed.

The system was developed by a Swedish company named BAE Systems Hagglunds Aktiebolag, and the patent application was filed this July. The application and grant were published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, along with 79 other newly issued patents. The idea behind this patent is a permanent or semi-permanent pivoting joint in an articulated vehicle. The kind of vehicle described is usually employed in military applications, and the company that developed it manufactures and markets military vehicle systems. As Patently Apple notes, there is no foreseeable benefit for Apple to own this patent in the future, but we covered the subject because it is related to vehicles and to the Cupertino giant, which keeps getting involved in the automotive world. It is worth noting that the kind of pivot patented by Apple and the Swedish company is used in a different form in various heavy equipment. However, this does nothing to help anyone provide a reasonable explanation as to why Apple would patent an element that has nothing to do with its business. Regardless, let’s talk about the patented device itself. It is a system that has been engineered to provide a smaller turn radius for tracked vehicles with trailers. It might also improve the handling and speed of the said category of transportation means. Since the military usually employs this kind of heavy-duty vehicles, we do not expect Apple to become a supplier for any army shortly. On the other hand, the Swedish company is already in this business, so we expect the patent to suit their future needs. The steering unit even has a device that can heat the air around its housing, helping eliminate any snow or ice that might affect its operation. In layman’s terms, the device pivots on demand, to ensure improved steering efficiency for the two vehicle bodies linked with the unit.

Apple Evan Selleck Contributing Editor | August 10, 2016 18 shares 10 4 0 3 0 0 1 0 0               One of the major accessories that was meant to tag along with the 12.9-inch iPad Pro was the Smart Keyboard. A keyboard case, Apple wanted to make it simple enough to get some work done on the big iPad, which isn’t really a computer but it could be close enough if you squint, and the accessory has been given positive enough reviews ever since it was released. The same can be said for the Smart Keyboard accessory that launched along with the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. When Apple unveiled the smaller cousin of the bigger variant, expectations were high that Apple would also unveil a keyboard case for the device, too. And sure enough the company did just that, and the case has seen plenty of praise since landing on store shelves. I’ve been using the Smart Keyboard for a bit of time now, and while I can understand where the positive remarks are coming from –after all, it is a solid keyboard– but the missing elements on the ’board, especially when compared to the competition, are just too blatant for me to ignore. First up, the missing music playback controls for music, and volume level adjustment. These are basically my biggest gripes of the Smart Keyboard, to be honest. The case is decently sized, and it’s easy to type on. But the fact that there aren’t keys to skip back, skip ahead, or pause music is crazy to me. The same goes for being able to adjust the volume of music/video playback on the iPad Pro. These are keys that should be easily reachable. Just tilting the hand a bit further than usual. But now it means reaching up to the tablet (which isn’t all that far, obviously), and then activating Control Center. Which means, in some apps, having to swipe up twice to get it to work within different apps. Adjusting volume means reaching up to the top of the iPad and hitting the physical keys – or, again, activating Control Center. Simply adding in keyboard shortcuts for these things would be pretty great, even. The real rub here isn’t so much that the keyboard is missing these things –like a dedicated Home button!– but more so that the competition has them. It seems, at best, silly, and, at worst, ridiculous, that competitor’s make “better” keyboard cases for Apple’s own tablet. Apple has its reasons, of course. And I’m sure they’re legitimate enough. And I also have no doubt that we’ll see a second-generation Smart Keyboard, for both the 9.7- and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models, that have all of these things that are missing in the current version. Still, while the Smart Keyboard has its strengths, the missing elements have me considering alternatives. What about you, though, iPad Pro owners? Did you give the Smart Keyboard a shot, but ultimately go with something else? If so, why? Or, if you’ve kept the Smart Keyboard, what made you avoid a competitor’s option? Let me know!

So what can you expect from the new iPhone 7 and what are people predicting for one of the biggest product launches of 2016? And when will it be released? We've searched the internet to bring you the lowdown on the new iPhone 7 before it gets an official launch. The home button. Is it staying or going? According to Bloomberg Technology , the new iPhones will use pressure-sensitive technology from Macbook computers for the home button. © Provided by Manchester Evening News "Current home buttons are switches that physically press into the phone, but the new models will have a pressure-sensitive button that provides feedback to the user via a vibrating haptic sensation rather than a true physical click," it claims.. Taking Apple's release date history into account, it's likely we'll see the iPhone 7 officially revealed in September 2016. Both the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6 were revealed in September and Apple has no reason to change its strategy. Some internet leaks have speculated on September 16 2016 - although no solid evidence exists. Others suggest September 6, the daty after the end of Apple's “back to school” promotion on its online store which offers free Beats Wireless headphones when buying a Mac, iPad or iPhone. Rumours suggest Apple is planning to upgrade its base model from 16GB to 32GB, keeping the iPhone 6 options of 64GB or 128GB storage. If true, it's likely Applie will stick with the £619 and £699 prices. While most people expect Apple's next iPhone to be called the iPhone 7, some leaks suggest that Apple may opt for the name "iPhone 6SE". Apple fans will be familiar with rumours suggesting the next iPhone will have a larger camera lens and a USB Type C connection at the bottom that will double up as the new headphone slot. But in terms of size and design, the iPhone 7 is expected to be very similar to the existing iPhone 6s . This video - by Unbox Therapy - may also hold clues to the new iPhone 7 design, claiming to have a mock up from the Chinese manufacturer. Features include a dual lens camera, twin speakers and a Smart Connector. And it comes in metallic blue... Because the new iPhone will likely arrive with Apple's iOS 10 software and an upgraded processor, it will offer even more power and better efficiency. Likely to be boasting a processor called the A10 chip, the iPhone 7 will surely boast more power - although it's anyone's guess as to how much this will translate into actual usage. At the moment, we don't know what kind of battery the iPhone 7 will use - but at least there's now a Low Power Mode built into iOS 9 to help it last even longer. We expect this will continue into an updated version of iOS. A photo claiming to be of the iPhone 7 Plus has surfaced on Chinese website Bastille Post , adding fuel to rumours that the smartphone will feature a dual-lens camera. The advantage of a dual camera is that it could allow iPhone users to snap SLR quality photos and 3D images on a smartphone. Last year, Apple bought an Israeli smart camera company called LinX Computational Imaging, which builds smartphone and tablet cameras with sensors that provide depths of field. According to a report in the China-based Commercial Times , Apple is working on a new "compound material" that repels water for use in its forthcoming smartphone, which it is thought will be called the iPhone 7. This new material will also reportedly remove the need for the two strips of plastic that run across the back of the current generation of iPhones to allow mobile signals to reach the antennas. This suggests that the body of the next iPhone may not be made from metal at all, but some other kind of material that allows radio waves to pass through it. There has also been some suggestion that the iPhone 7 could include a cutting-edge technology known as LiFi , that is capable of transmitting information at 100 times the speed of WiFi. However, this is unlikely, given that LiFi is still in the early stages of development, and researchers don't expect it to be ready for commercial use before the end of the decade.

Pestano   |   Aug. 10, 2016 at 1:17 PM Follow @upi Comments | License Photo CUPERTINO, Calif., Aug. 10 (UPI) -- Apple's iconic MacBook Pro laptop line is expected to receive its first major upgrade in four years in order to reverse two financial quarters of decreasing sales. Bloomberg reported the updated notebooks will be thinner, packed with more power and efficient graphics processors, and will include a touch screen strip, citing anonymous sources. One of the sources said the updated laptops are not expected to be revealed in Apple's Sept. 7 event, when the next-generation of iPhones are expected to be unveiled. Apple also hopes to simplify keyboard shortcuts by replacing a standard function key row usually found above the keyboard with a strip-like touch screen that will display different functions depending on what application is open. Apple's Touch ID fingerprint technology is also expected to be featured in the upgraded MacBook Pro line. Users will be able to log in more quickly and authenticate Apple Pay purchases. The upgraded MacBook Pro line is aimed at diminishing the damage from low iPad and iPhone sales, which led to Apple stock to lower to $90.34 a share -- the lowest in about two years. Amid rumors of the upgraded MacBook Pro laptop line, Apple stock opened at a three-month high of $108.81 a share on Tuesday.

Apple is expected to officially unveil the iPhone 7 next month and it looks like most of the rumors and leaks leading up to its release may already have been confirmed. The three biggest changes that are expected to be part of this year's iPhone lineup are the dual-camera system, removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack and the addition of a new pressure-sensitive home button, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Rumors of a new pressure sensitive home button for the iPhone 7 first popped up back in June. The new button will be flush on the face of the handset and it will not actually click down when pressed. Instead, the new home button will give off a haptic feedback providing the sensation of a real click. With Bloomberg reporting the same details regarding the iPhone 7, it looks like the addition of the pressure-sensitive home button on the upcoming device is almost certain. Apple's dual-camera system will only be part of the larger 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus. The new camera setup will be able to produce brighter photos with more detail. Each camera comes with a different sensor that would enable it to capture colors differently.  The two images captured by the sensors will be merged as one to produce a single image with better color reproduction, brightness and detail even in low lighting conditions, according to Bloomberg's source who was able to use an iPhone 7 Plus prototype. The iPhone 7 Plus will also feature better camera zoom because of the dual camera sensors, as pointed out by The Verge. The smaller 4.7-inch iPhone 7 won't come with dual cameras, but it will still have improvements over its predecessor. The most unsurprising development of the iPhone 7 is the removal of the analog headphone jack. Apple wants users to privately listen to audio with Bluetooth headphones instead, or with new headphones equipped with the company's proprietary Lightning connector. Sources say that Apple decided to remove the headphone jack so that it can place a second speaker. Some have reported previously that Apple also removed the headphone jack in order to make the iPhone 7 even thinner than the iPhone 6s.   (Photo : 9To5Mac)   Finally, the previous rumor of a new space black color option may have already been confirmed thanks to a newly-leaked photo of the iPhone 7's chassis, as originally reported by 9To5Mac this past Monday. The new color option appears to be quite similar to the space black color option that's available for the Apple Watch. What's unclear is whether this new iPhone color option will replace the space grey option. Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus this September 7, with a rumored release date of September 16.

According to the report, sourced to “people familiar with the matter,” the long-rumored touchscreen device will replace the function keys and advanced AMD graphics cards will bring graphics capability to Apple’s long-neglected laptop line. The Macbook Pro, as sold today, hasn’t really seen a design refresh since 2012, and it shows. The Pro line is heavy, underpowered, and expensive relative to the competition. To fix this, Apple needs to change a bunch of things at once, which is part of why so many rumors are circulating. Related: Neglected again, Apple’s dusty MacBooks are outdated, underpowered and overpriced This latest Bloomberg report suggests that Apple is doing just that. The laptop has reportedly been in testing since earlier this year. Here are the changes specifically mentioned in the article. New Macbook Pros will be thinner overall. A touchscreen will replace the function keys at the top of the keyboard. The trackpad will be slightly wider. Advanced graphics will be offered by an AMD “Polaris” chip, which Apple is choosing for its low power consumption and thin form factor. The laptop will use USB type-C port for charging, data transfers, and display connectivity. Apple may bring gray, gold, and silver models to market, similar to the 12-inch Macbook, the iPhone, and the iPad. Touch ID is coming to the MacBook Pro. Most of these statements have been floating around for months now, and even align with supposedly leaked photos of the new model.  The sheer volume of rumors, and the interest in them, really speaks to the extent to which Apple needs to refresh its flagship laptop line. Related: MacBook 2016 Rumors: What does Apple have up its sleeve this time? But this is all going to remain rumor for a while more. Bloomberg’s report suggest the Macbook Pro refresh won’t be announced during Apple’s September 7 event, which will focus on the iPhone. Apple officials wouldn’t comment on that specifically, however, so as always we’re left guessing. It will be interesting to see which rumors turn out to be true.

Weiss  |  Posted 2016-08-10 Print               The MacBook Pro line hasn't been drastically updated in four years, but big changes are expected this year, according to a new report. Since May, rumors have been swirling that Apple is working on a major overhaul of its MacBook Pro laptop product line, which hasn't received large-scale changes in about four years. Those rumors, however, remain persistent and just received more potential verification after an unnamed source confirmed that Apple has been performing advanced testing with redesigned MacBook Pro machines "since earlier this year," according to an Aug. 10 report by Bloomberg. "The updated notebooks will be thinner, include a touch-screen strip for function keys, and will be offered with more powerful and efficient graphics processors for expert users, such as video gamers," several sources said, according to the article. The machines are not, however, likely to be unveiled at Apple's scheduled Sept. 7 announcement event, where the latest iPhone 7 smartphones will be unveiled, the story continued. Also expected in the next MacBook Pro machines are Touch ID fingerprint scanners, which are used in iPhones to increase security for users, the story reported. The anticipated touch-screen secondary organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display, which would replace the standard function key row, has been rumored since May, according to an earlier eWEEK story. The new touch-screen display strip would "simplify keyboard shortcuts traditionally used by experienced users" while also allowing the virtual keys to be used for different functions when they are being used with different applications, such as iTunes or word processing software, according to Bloomberg. In addition, the latest rumors confirm earlier reports that the upcoming MacBook Pro machines "will be slightly thinner than the current models but are not tapered like the MacBook Air and latest 12-inch MacBook," the story reported. The machines also are expected to have smaller footprints than current models and shallower curves around the edges of the exterior cases. Also rumored is a MacBook Pro version with an optional high-performance graphics chip from Advanced Micro Devices, the report continued, as well as USB-C ports and the possibility of gray, gold and silver colors to the new devices. Apple executives hope that a major refresh of the MacBook Pro line can help the company boost its revenue and profits, which have taken hits in the last two consecutive quarters. In July, Apple announced that in the third-quarter its global iPhone sales were down 15 percent from 2015, taking down overall revenue and profits with them. The company reported $42.36 billion in revenue, down 15 percent from $49.6 billion a year earlier, and $7.8 billion in net income, a drop from $10.7 billion. Apple's year-over-year declines in revenue and net income for two straight quarters contrast with the company's prior string of 13 years of quarterly revenue reports without a decline, dating back to 2003. That streak was brought to a halt when the company reported revenue of $50.6 billion in the second quarter ended in April, 13 percent lower than the $58 billion the company posted a year prior. Hitting the company's revenue and net income hard in the third quarter were a 15 percent drop in global iPhone sales to 40.4 million units from 47.5 million a year earlier. In this interval, sales of iPads dropped 9 percent to 9.95 million from 10.9 million, while Mac sales fell by 11 percent to 4.3 million from 4.8 million one year ago. Apple's third-quarter revenue from U.S. sales fell 11 percent to $18 billion from $20.2 billion one year ago, while its revenue in China dropped 33 percent to $8.8 billion from $13.2 billion in this interval. In April, Apple did update its 12-inch MacBook with a round of improvements, including the latest Intel Core M processors, faster graphics performance and flash storage, and as much as an hour of longer battery life, according to an earlier eWEEK story. The latest MacBooks feature sixth-generation dual-core Intel Core M processors with up to 1.3GHz speeds and faster 1,866MHz memory, as well as new Intel HD Graphics 515 graphics processing units for faster graphics performance. In addition, the new MacBooks offer improved battery life for up to 10 hours of Web browsing and up to 11 hours of movie playback. In addition, all 13-inch MacBook Air computers now get 8GB of memory standard from Apple. Also in April, Apple unveiled its smaller 9.7-inch iPad Pro tablet, which followed its 12.9-inch enterprise-aimed iPad Pro tablet that was launched in November 2015. Apple's earlier 15-inch MacBook Pro, released in May 2015, received the company's Force Touch trackpad as well as faster flash storage, longer battery life and faster discrete graphics. Force Touch includes built-in force sensors and a Taptic Engine that delivers haptic feedback, allowing users to click anywhere on the pad for a uniform feel.             LATEST MOBILE ARTICLES   Apple Starts Program to Repair iPhones With 'Touch Disease' for $149 Google Touts Encryption Support On New Pixel Android Phones MobileIron Adds Single Sign-On to Box, Office 365, Salesforce Apple And PayPal Enable Payments Through Siri Voice Commands Revamped Google Play Music to Use Machine Learning to Suggest Songs                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

By PYMNTS Posted on August 10, 2016 Is Apple stretching sponsor rules at the Olympics in Rio? Share Tweet Share Share Share Email What’s the hottest Olympics-inspired merchandise at this year’s Rio Games? Well, according to this piece from Reuters, it’s not any of the countless officially licensed Olympic products from any of the formal Olympic sponsors (who can sometimes pay sponsorship fees of up to $100 million over a four-year period for the rights to market products alongside the games) but rather unofficial and unsanctioned special-edition bands for the Apple Watch that Apple is selling exclusively at the nearest Apple Store to the main Olympic park. The bands do not feature the highly recognizable Olympic rings logo or mention the word “Olympics” anywhere on the product — because that would be a trademark violation by Apple — but they are available for about $93 in the colors of 14 national teams, including the U.S., Canada and Brazil, the host nation of this year’s games. Despite not being an officially sanctioned Olympic product, Apple’s bands have already proven quiet popular in Rio de Janeiro, both with tourists and Olympic athletes themselves. Several Olympic athletes, including U.S. sprinter Trayvon Bromell, have already taken to social media to share photos of themselves at the games with their new Apple Watch bands. Samsung, one of Apple’s biggest competitors in the smartphone market, secured the rights to be the official mobile phone sponsor of the Rio Games and can sell its phones at official Olympic venues. Most experts agree that Apple’s not breaking any rules with its creative marketing campaign, but it could be pushing the line. “While they don’t appear to be breaking any rules, they appear to be getting really close to the edge of ambush or guerilla marketing,” Jeff Benz, a former general counsel at the U.S. Olympic Committee, who arbitrates disputes for the international dispute-resolution firm JAMS, told Reuters.

Black and white wallpapers for macOS and iOS   skip to main content skip to main menu     India’s finance minister ratifies a proposal that’d let Apple run retail stores in the country By Christian Zibreg, Aug 10, 2016 Tweet 6 Comments Apple is one step closer to opening first-party retail stores in India, its increasingly significant market with population of 1.3 billion people, with a new Bloomberg report claiming that India’s finance minister Arun Jaitley has approved a proposal that clarifies how Apple could open retail stores without initially having to source components locally. Last month, the cabinet of Prime Minister Narendra Modi approved a three-year extension on local-sourcing rules that require foreign firms wanting to run their own local retail stores to source at least 30 percent of components within the populous country. The proposal would let India’s Information Technology Ministry label a retailer of a single brand as a “provider of cutting-edge technology,” basically giving Apple a three-year exemption from local sourcing rules imposed on foreign retailers. Appel can now reapply to open stores in India with “greater odds of winning the waiver” because of the latest decision. The move is an effort to clear up the confusion whether or not Apple products are cutting edge. Thus far, the Cupertino firm has sold its products in India through local retailers and partners, such as Redington India Ltd.

An “A10” processor would be the natural progression if Apple is to follow its past pattern of processor upgrades for new iPhones. Apple currently uses its “A9” processor in the iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, and iPhone SE, and it introduced the “A9X” with minor upgrades for the iPad Pro line in November. It usually uses the “X” variants for new iPad models, and it traditionally introduces a new numbered version for the introduction of new iPhones each year.  The images, first posted on Chinese social network Weibo (via Techtastic), follow images of logic board components from the same source over the weekend: The leak doesn’t offer any details on what might be new with the A10 chip, but the internal hardware upgrades are expected to come alongside the much rumored improved camera system and a redesigned home button. Most leaks have also pointed to a largely unchanged physical design from the iPhone 6s apart from repositioned antenna lines and the expected removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack.

Many can't wait that long though, and the internet has been creaking with rumours of what the next incarnation - the iPhone 7 - will look like and new features that might be included. Industry commentators and Apple fan forums have been full of chatter - fuelled by what many think are leaked images of the new smartphone. So what can you expect from the new iPhone 7 and what are people predicting for one of the biggest product launches of 2016? And when will it be released? We've searched the internet to bring you the lowdown on the new iPhone 7 before it gets an official launch. Latest news The home button. Is it staying or going? According to Bloomberg Technology , the new iPhones will use pressure-sensitive technology from Macbook computers for the home button. "Current home buttons are switches that physically press into the phone, but the new models will have a pressure-sensitive button that provides feedback to the user via a vibrating haptic sensation rather than a true physical click," it claims.. Release date Taking Apple's release date history into account, it's likely we'll see the iPhone 7 officially revealed in September 2016. Both the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6 were revealed in September and Apple has no reason to change its strategy. Some internet leaks have speculated on September 16 2016 - although no solid evidence exists. Others suggest September 6, the daty after the end of Apple's “back to school” promotion on its online store which offers free Beats Wireless headphones when buying a Mac, iPad or iPhone. Price Rumours suggest Apple is planning to upgrade its base model from 16GB to 32GB, keeping the iPhone 6 options of 64GB or 128GB storage. If true, it's likely Apple will stick with the £619 and £699 prices. Name While most people expect Apple's next iPhone to be called the iPhone 7, some leaks suggest that Apple may opt for the name "iPhone 6SE". Design Apple fans will be familiar with rumours suggesting the next iPhone will have a larger camera lens and a USB Type C connection at the bottom that will double up as the new headphone slot. But in terms of size and design, the iPhone 7 is expected to be very similar to the existing iPhone 6s . This video - by Unbox Therapy - may also hold clues to the new iPhone 7 design, claiming to have a mock up from the Chinese manufacturer. Features include a dual lens camera, twin speakers and a Smart Connector. And it comes in metallic blue... Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now Specs Because the new iPhone will likely arrive with Apple's iOS 10 software and an upgraded processor, it will offer even more power and better efficiency. Likely to be boasting a processor called the A10 chip, the iPhone 7 will surely boast more power - although it's anyone's guess as to how much this will translate into actual usage. At the moment, we don't know what kind of battery the iPhone 7 will use - but at least there's now a Low Power Mode built into iOS 9 to help it last even longer. We expect this will continue into an updated version of iOS. Camera A photo claiming to be of the iPhone 7 Plus has surfaced on Chinese website Bastille Post , adding fuel to rumours that the smartphone will feature a dual-lens camera. The advantage of a dual camera is that it could allow iPhone users to snap SLR quality photos and 3D images on a smartphone. Last year, Apple bought an Israeli smart camera company called LinX Computational Imaging, which builds smartphone and tablet cameras with sensors that provide depths of field. The Apple Logo on a storefront Waterproof iPhone According to a report in the China-based Commercial Times , Apple is working on a new "compound material" that repels water for use in its forthcoming smartphone, which it is thought will be called the iPhone 7. This new material will also reportedly remove the need for the two strips of plastic that run across the back of the current generation of iPhones to allow mobile signals to reach the antennas. This suggests that the body of the next iPhone may not be made from metal at all, but some other kind of material that allows radio waves to pass through it. There has also been some suggestion that the iPhone 7 could include a cutting-edge technology known as LiFi , that is capable of transmitting information at 100 times the speed of WiFi. However, this is unlikely, given that LiFi is still in the early stages of development, and researchers don't expect it to be ready for commercial use before the end of the decade.

The Apple notebook, however, will not release at the iPhone event next month.  ( Sean Gallup | Getty Images ) Advertisement Rumors pertaining to the 2016 MacBook Pro have been swirling online for some time and the latest murmur is that the Apple laptop will get a major overhaul. The MacBook Pro 2016 will reportedly be unveiled soon, but not alongside the iPhone 7 in September. The latest news comes courtesy of Bloomberg, which reveals that Apple will not take the wraps off its new MacBook Pro 2016 lineup at its Sept. 7 event, where it is anticipated to introduce the new iPhone and Apple Watch. This will be the first major overhaul to the laptop since 2012. "Apple Inc. is preparing the first significant overhaul of its MacBook Pro laptop line in over four years, according to people familiar with the matter, using one of its older products to help reverse two quarters of sliding sales," notes the publication. The report also confirms the assertion by Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst with KGI Securities, that the MacBook Pro 2016 will sport an OLED touch bar in place of the function keys. It will also boast Touch ID and be sleeker than its predecessors. The sources of the publication also confirm that the overhauled notebooks from Apple will have a wider trackpad, as well as a more efficient GPU that can be put into good use by gamers. One of the models will likely have the AMD Polaris graphics chip. Apple has reportedly tested different variants of the impending laptops, which will integrate a "scanner beside the new function key display." The MacBook Pro 2016 will not only benefit from Touch ID fingerprint reader, but also USB Type-C support. The overhauled device's most exciting inclusion, however, will be the secondary screen or OLED touch panel, which will be placed above the keyboard and replace the function keys. This screen, according to the current report, will look like a strip and show off functions based on tasks. This panel will serve to simplify the shortcuts for keyboards. It could possibly show the media controls when a user opens the iTunes or copy/paste commands on MS Word. Rumors have also suggested that Apple's MacBook Pro 2016 could replace the MacBook Air for good. Apple is also said to be considering different color options such as gold, silver and gray for the MacBook Pro 2016. The new MacBook Pros are also rumored to house Intel's Skylake CPU, which will be an upgrade over the Haswell and Broadwell processors on the existing models. The MacBook Pro 2016 was previously rumored to launch in June. We will now have to wait and watch if Apple announces any special event for its MacBook Pro 2016, which will finally get a refresh after four years.

This gave Apple a 31.8% share in the U.S. and 37.2% in the UK. In the USA, the iPhone 6s/6s Plus outsold the Samsung Galaxy S7/S7 edge to make the iPhone the best-selling device in the quarter at 15.1% against Samsung’s 14.1%, with the iPhone SE taking third place at 5.1% … Surprisingly, the iPhone SE was the best-selling smartphone in the UK for the quarter, at 9.2% of the market, just ahead of the iPhone 6s at 9.1%. There was less good news in China, where Apple’s share dropped 1.8% to 17.9%, putting Apple behind both Huawei and Xiaomi, both companies offering handsets at a wide range of prices. However, Apple remained the market leader in individual handset terms. While the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus remain the top selling smartphones in the region, pressure from Huawei’s Mate 8, P9, Xiaomi’s RedMi Note 3 and Mi 5, and Oppo’s R7 has led to increased competition in the market. With the continued supply constraints of the iPhone SE, that model was not able to make the expected impact, accounting for 2.5% of smartphone sales in the second quarter. Apple suffered a bigger fall in Japan, dropping 4.2% to 38%. Despite concern at the lack of a significantly new design for the iPhone 7, Kantar is optimistic about Apple’s prospects through Q3 and Q4. With strong demand for the iPhone SE throughout the second quarter, it will be interesting to track whether iOS growth will continue through the third quarter, assuming that supplies become less constrained. Anticipation for the newest iPhone, usually released in late September every year, typically means a weaker summer period for iOS. However, sales data shows that 49% of US iPhone owners and 51% of Chinese iPhone owners own an iPhone 5s or older. This represents a large opportunity to upgrade these consumers to the latest four-inch iPhone. Rumors suggest that the iPhone 7 will go on sale on September 16, earlier than usual, Apple perhaps hoping to maximize the number of sales in calendar Q3 to change the narrative from falling sales. The full set of Kantar data can be seen below.

The four-year-old has returned to the Big Apple for a round of treatment he and his family hope will see off his neuroblastoma for good. His first visit to the Big Apple was in July. He was home for only a few days before he went back for another round of treatment. His mam Kat Musgrove, 28, wrote on Kian’s Facebook page, Caring for Kian, that he awoke in the middle of the night on Wednesday with serious pain. She had to carry him to the bathroom because he was not able to walk by himself. So far Kian is doing well with his treatment and Kat said this round “wasn’t anywhere near as bad as all other times beforehand”. She worries Kian not being in so much pain might not be a good sign. It could be a sign that his immune system is fighting off the treatment and that will prevent it from working. Kat Musgrove holds up her son Kian Musgrove at the Well Pharmacy in Consett, Durham. The pharmacy raised £500 for Kian's cancer treatment (Photo: Well Pharmacy courtesy of Tangerine Comms) She said: “If he’s not feeling much pain it could mean he is HAHA Positive. “If this is what it is then this means Kian will need more chemotherapy to wipe out his immunity.” Kian was first diagnosed with cancer October 2013 after doctors found a tumour in his adrenal gland. After an eight month battle there was no sign of cancer in his body but in December 2015 he relapsed. Kat has been spearheading fundraising efforts since she first learned of her son’s illness and even has raised hundreds of dollars while in New York City. The Well Pharmacy in Consett, Durham recently raised £500 for Kian’s treatment. Cheryl Hedley, the NPBM of Well Consett, said the team has been committed to helping out Kian and his family. She said: “We’re proud and honoured to be helping raise money for Kian. “His incredible strength and bravery is an inspiration to all of us within the community and across the North East. “Here at Well we are determined to do all we can to help raise money.” To help go to kapipal.com/caringforkian Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @EveningChron Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On Kian Musgrove Consett news all Most Read Most Recent WallsendMum of Wallsend one-punch attack victim left angry as attacker walks free for another offence James Widdowson started the tragic chain of events that saw Billy Close left with catastrophic injuries Newcastle City CentreCCTV released after man was punched to the ground in Newcastle city centre A 31-year-old man had to be taken to hospital after he was punched in an early morning attack in Newcastle city centre - police want to trace this man Rafa BenitezRafa's North East: Newcastle United boss takes in the sights on a special tour of the region Newcastle United manager Rafa Benitez made the most of a day off training to explore his favourite North East places WallsendFancy living in Sting's old house? his teenage home is on the market for £260,000 Sting moved from Wallsend to Cullercoats in his teens, the home's current owner found his school athletics certificate when she moved in HebburnUnbelievable - See how a Hebburn mum of three shed a staggering 12st and changed her life Alison Berry, 57, dropped from a size 32 to a 14 in just two years after a request from her family sparked her into life North East NewsSee Newcastle lit up for Christmas - scroll through our photo gallery to soak up the atmosphere Our photographers have been out to capture the festive fun as thousands of Christmas bulbs light up the city ChristmasRemember Geordie Jeans and Shephards of Gateshead? 15 shops you went to at Christmas Those of a certain age bought their toys from Shephards and Parish's and their Christmas clothes from Geordie Jeans and Sgt Peppers Royal Victoria Infirmary NewcastleThis baby was seconds away from death after contracting a deadly illness Baby Coby was born blue and his terrified parents were left fearing he would not pull through - but just look at him now JesmondWoman pushed over by robber who stole her bag at Jesmond Metro station Police are looking for a suspect who pushed a 51-year-old woman over and stole her bag at Jesmond Metro station on Tuesday evening A69Calls to dual A69 rejected by the Government - but dualling of the A66 will go ahead Government rejects calls to dual the A69 despite appearing to promise the scheme would go ahead Most Read Most Recent Newcastle United FC'Moussa 'Article 50' Sissoko' - Newcastle United fans revel in midfielder's Champions League exit Sissoko's Tottenham Hotspur were dumped out of the Champions League last night and Magpies fans weren't the most sympathetic Newcastle United FCNewcastle United news LIVE: Rafa will be staying, Matz Sels is wanted by former club All the latest from the Newcastle United camp as the Magpies prepare for the visit of Blackburn Rovers this weekend WallsendMum of Wallsend one-punch attack victim left angry as attacker walks free for another offence James Widdowson started the tragic chain of events that saw Billy Close left with catastrophic injuries Newcastle City CentreCCTV released after man was punched to the ground in Newcastle city centre A 31-year-old man had to be taken to hospital after he was punched in an early morning attack in Newcastle city centre - police want to trace this man Rafa BenitezCan Newcastle and Benitez break Keegan's 24-year win record?

 Apple is reportedly working with a South Korean company to make batteries for its secretive car project Danielle Muoio Aug. 10, 2016, 11:27 AM 2,293 facebook linkedin twitter email print Mike Nudelman/Business Insider Apple has teamed up with a South Korean company to make the batteries for its self-driving, electric car project, according to a report by South Korean technology news website Etnews. The anonymous official working for the South Korean company declined to provide its name because the company recently signed a non-disclosure agreement with Apple. But, according to the Etnews report, we do know that the South Korean battery company is comprised of roughly 20 employees and holds international patents for hollow batteries. The lithium-ion batteries are cylindrical and have a hollow center with a thickness of "two fingers," according to the report. As MacRumors points out, it's possible the batteries are made by Korean Company Orange Power, which has a patent application for a hollow-type rechargeable battery. Orange Power has 33 employees total, 25 of which specialize in research and development. But it's still to early to tell if Orange Power is, in fact, a partner of Apple's. Apple declined to comment for this story.  Because batteries create most of their heat in the center, having a hollow center that supports air flow and cooling could minimize the need for a separate cooling device, Etnews points out. The parallel connection is advantageous because it expands the battery capacity. According to the Orange Power patent application, the hollow battery design allows the batteries to be stacked in parallel or in series without any welding process.  The hollow battery design in the Orange Power patent application. European Patent Office Apple isn't the only company looking to re-think battery design to advance its electric cars. Start-up Faraday Future is arranging its batteries in rows, or as the company calls it, "strings" so it's easy to change the battery capacity by adding or removing the strings. Tesla is also investing heavily in battery technology through the construction of its giant battery factory the Gigafactory. Apple recently tapped Bob Mansfield to lead Apple's car project after former head Steve Zadesky left the project in January. Apple has also been known to hire former Tesla engineers to work on the car.

Anyone with even a passing interest in mobile is keeping at least one eye on rumors around the Cupertino firm’s newest handset, with tidbits like dual cameras and, for the first time, a move away from a physical home button all among the whispers, but the big question is always around when we can see the iPhone 7 for real. According to Bloomberg’s sources, there’s not long to wait. The well-connected Mark Gurman suggests September 7th is Apple’s big announcement day, though the phone almost certainly won’t go on sale immediately. Instead, the actual iPhone 7 release date is more likely to be a little more than a week later. Apple traditionally has its new iPhone in-store on a Friday – so that, among other things, it can capture an extended weekend of sales and announce “record demand” later on – which suggests September 16th. Interestingly, Bloomberg writes, the almost equally-anticipated MacBook Pro refresh won’t share the spotlight at the iPhone 7 launch. Instead the notebook – which is said to have a touchscreen OLED function key bar, that can be dynamically changed to suit different apps and uses – will be revealed at a different point, presumably to give both important products separate time to shine. As for the iPhone 7, what we’re expecting is part evolution, part revolution over the existing iPhone 6s. The new phone is expected to retire the physical home button, a feature of iPhones since the very first model, in favor of a pressure-sensitive pad that would do away with moving parts yet still support Touch ID. Haptics, similar to those in use by the Apple Watch and the Magic Trackpad, would be implemented to give the iPhone 7 home button a “kick” like a physical button might. NOW READ: After iPhone 7, the all-glass iPhone? Meanwhile dual cameras on the rear of the smartphone could combine their snaps to make a single, high-quality image, in an expansion of sorts on the HDR photography mode that current iPhones offer. Though Apple is expected to launch two sizes of the iPhone 7, as is the case now, the smaller phone may well lack the twin camera rig. Most controversial, of course, is the idea that the iPhone 7 headphone jack will be retired in favor of connecting either via the proprietary Lightning port, or using a wireless standard such as Bluetooth. Doing away with the 3.5mm jack would allow Apple to reclaim no small amount of space inside the phone, though critics point out that it would also force a widespread update of existing, perfectly functional headphones unless people were content to use an adapter. Such an adapter is tipped to be in the box with the new iPhone, though Apple is also said to be planning new Lightning-connected EarPod headphones in time for the iPhone 7 release.

This prompted speculation that Apple would host its annual iPhone unveiling event a few days before preorders start, on either September 6th or 7th. A new report that focuses on this year’s major MacBook Pro release has apparently let it slip that the new MacBook won’t be unveiled during Apple's upcoming big iPhone 7 press conference, which will apparently take place on September 7th. DON’T MISS: Google’s new Nexus phones will be just as fast as the Galaxy Note 7 "The new [MacBook Pro] computers have been in advanced testing within Apple since earlier this year, said one of the people, who didn’t want to be identified discussing products before their release," Bloomberg said in a report on Wednesday morning. "The MacBook Pros aren’t likely to debut at an event currently scheduled for Sept. 7 to introduce next-generation versions of the iPhone, according to one of the people. Apple spokesman Bill Evans declined to comment." A few days ago, Bloomberg did provide more details about the features expected in the upcoming iPhone series but did not offer a date for Apple’s fall iPhone event. Well-known leaker Evan Blass said recently that the iPhone 7 will be released on September 16th. https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/756941371416518656 He then said that preorders will start on September 9th: https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/758497414227464192 Independently of that, Apple enthusiasts John Gruber also predicted a few days ago that the iPhone 7 keynote event would likely take place on September 7th. https://twitter.com/gruber/status/760288450163552257 Apple may not have given Bloomberg any insight on its MacBook or iPhone 7 release date plans, but it evidently appears that people with knowledge of the matter have September 7th listed as the date for this year’s iPhone unveiling.

(NASDAQ: AAPL)’s $200 million acquisition of machine learning and artificial intelligence company Turi may seem like small potatoes. However, Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry believes the deal could ultimately create a $300 billion opportunity for Apple. Chowdhry said the acquisition is “solid and smart and makes Apple Machine Learning the most comprehensive offering with ML Models, Algorithms-Optimization, and Developer Ecosystem.” Related Link: S&P 500 Will Hit 2,350 Within 15 Months Chowdhry estimates the intelligent software applications market will be a $300 billion market, and believes Turi puts Apple in prime position to cash in. He notes that Turi has a wide lead on the competition when it comes to its ML developer ecosystem, which includes more than 40,000 data scientists and developers. Chowdhry also points out that Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) CEO Jen-Hsun Huang have both consulted Turi co-founder Carlos Guestrin on autonomous driving and machine learning, In addition, Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and General Electric Company (NYSE: GE) are just three of Turi’s many high-profile customers. With iPhone sales declining in back-to-back quarters for the first time ever this year, Apple shareholders certainly welcome potentially massive AI and ML growth opportunities in years to come.

At the launch event in San Francisco, the company revealed an upgraded iPhone that, while aesthetically similar to the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, has several important differences, including a pressure-sensitive home button, better camera, a faster processor and improved battery life, as well as having no headphone jack. It also comes in a new range of colours and a starting size of 32GB. Apple iPhone 7 Plus - hands on Play! 01:37 Now available for pre-orders Pre-orders for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have opened online. Many models of the phone are already in high demand, with pre-orders pushing back shipping dates on Apple’s website. How long until I can order the iPhone 7 or 7 Plus? The handsets are due to start shipping on September 16, but the company's site listed the jet black iPhone 7 Plus as shipping in November just hours after orders opened, with other colours set to take 2-3 weeks.  Before orders opened reports suggested that supply could be limited at launch, with the Nikkei Asian Review claiming that problems with faulty components could lead to the phone being sold out.  Wireless Airpods for the new iPhone 7 Credit: EPA How much will it cost? For the last two years the cheapest model of the latest iPhone has cost £539 but the new iPhone 7 price will start at £599 for the 32GB model. The iPhone 7: £599 for 32GB £699 for 128GB £799 for 256GB The iPhone 7 Plus: £719 for 32GB £819 for 128GB  £919 for 256GB apple profit counter in £ What are the new features? The most significant changes on the new phone include an upgraded camera, a new home button and the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack.  Apple's wireless AirPod headphones - hands on Play! 00:22 Instead of the traditional headphone connection, iPhone packages will now come with earphones that fit into the phone's Lightning port, currently used for charging and data transfer. The bigger "Plus" model has an even-more powerful "dual-lens" camera, explained below. The Apple iPhone 7 and AirPods  Credit: Reuters Killing the headphone jack One of the most controversial decisions has been to remove the headphone jack,  instead shipping the phone with a pair of Lightning EarPods - which connect through the charging port - and wireless Apple AirPods, powered by a W1 chip. Infared sensors detect when each pod is in your ear and motion sensors control the headphones to use Siri and detect your voice. An attendee wears the Apple AirPods  Credit: Reuters The AirPods provide five hours of listening which, with the compact charging case,  delivers 24 hours of total battery life. Apple has faced opposition over changes before, such as when it introduced the lightning connector with the iPhone 5 in 2012. Apple will also supply an adaptor that enables traditional headphones to continue to plug into the iPhone, but it will not allow for charging at the same time. Apple AirPods | Pros and cons The pods can connect to Apple watches, laptops and iPads. Beats have also released two versions of wireless headphones for the iPhone 7 models. Credit: Beats The iPhone 7 will also come with stereo speakers for the first time, with speakers now placed at the top and bottom of the device. Watch: Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus key features Play! 01:58 Upgraded camera The camera has been revamped to enhance low-light capabilities and take even sharper photos. The smaller 4.7-inch device has a f/1.8 lens that lets 50 per cent more light onto the lens, a new 12MP sensor that's 60 per cent faster and 30 per cent more energy efficient. Closeup view of the iPhone 7 Plus' dual cameras Credit: Getty Images A 5.5-inch version of the handset has a dual-lens camera. This allows a huge increase in quality when zooming in on a photo, a problem that has plagued Apple for years. The iPhone 7 Plus has two 12MP cameras, one of which is a wide angle lens and the other a telephoto lens that can zoom 2X in high quality without using any software. The telephoto lens means the camera can zoom to 10X with optical and soft zoom. iPhone evolution Cameras on both models will also have 12 megapixel sensors as well as 4K video recording capability. It also enables live editing of video files and with wide colour capture. It also has image stabilisation and a new camera flash to improve photos shot in low-light. Apple has also doubled the number of LEDs to four - two cool, two warm - in order to create a more effective flash. That gives 50 per cent more light. It also has a flicker sensor that makes the flash look like natural light. The front camera has also been upgraded to 7MP from 5MP for FaceTime and selfies.  Example of selfie taken on an iPhone 7 front camera  Credit: AP Appearance Apple has introduced two new colours for the iPhone 7 to replace space grey.  The new models are available in five different colours including two new shades of black. A matte "black" and a glossy black will join silver, gold and rose gold in the colour options for the iPhone. The new shiny "jet black" finish will be offered exclusively on the 128GB and 256GB models.  The new handset look very similar to the current iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, but with the antenna bands moved from the back of the device to the edges. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will be available in five colours Credit: Reuters Battery life The models will have the longest battery life ever in an iPhone. An iPhone 7 lasts, on average, two hours longer than an iPhone 6s and an hour longer than iPhone 6s Plus. The battery on the iPhone 7 lasts 14 hours when using WiFi and 12 on 4G. The iPhone 7 Plus meanwhile lasts 15 hours on WiFi and 15 on 4G.  Connecting USB Fan to Mobile Battery Has Interesting Results Play! 00:17 Internal performance The model will be powered by a new Apple A10 Fusion which has a 64-bit 4 core CPU. Forty percent faster than A9 of iPhone 6s and double the speed of the A8 processors. It also has a ramped up graphics performance which is also 40 percent more powerful than the A9. 14 alternatives to Apple's default apps that will supercharge your iPhone Water-resistant The new iPhones are also water-resistant with an IPX67 rating which means the hardware can withstand immersion in up to 1 metre of water for 30 minutes. Apple’s high standards for waterproofing have impacted the supply chain and lowered total production of iPhone 7. How Apple is making itself smarter Play! 01:23 The company is believed to have slashed production levels of the iPhone 6s and partner unit the 6s Plus by a third amid fears of slowing demand for the 'fallow year' s models, despite initial sales of more than 13 million units within three days of availability. KGI is forecasting 65 million iPhone 7 units will be shipped by the end of the year, a 20.7 pc decrease compared to iPhone 6s in the same period last year. Home button The home button has been given a vibration-based taptic feedback system so it now vibrates when touched to give users feedback. The feature is already in use on the firm's MacBook laptops. The new iPhone model features a water-resistant design, upgraded camera system and faster processor Credit: Bloomberg What can we expect next year? The big changes Apple is rumoured to be saving for the 2017 iPhone include its chassis being made entirely from glass. It could have an edge-to-edge display with an OLED screen, a significant step forward from the LCD screens the company currently uses.

These banks want to maintain complete control over their customers. The present application is only the latest tactic employed by these competing banks to blunt Apple’s entry into the Australian market,’ said Apple in a document signed by Marg Demmer, a former cards executive at ANZ Banking Group.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: As we wrote last month of the Australian banks’ demand for NFC access: Apple could simply argue “No” on the simple and obvious ground of protecting iOS user’s security.

Personally I’d give them what they want, then walk in and take over their businesses when they’re all inebriated and hungover. Derek Currie Wednesday, August 10, 2016 - 1:06 pm · Reply I love Apple, mostly. Here they are shooting silver arrows into the heart of blatant CORPORATOCRACY. And Apple’s a corporation! …Allowing the banks to form a cartel to collectively dictate terms to new business models and services would set a troubling precedent and delay the introduction of new, potentially disruptive technologies Obviously. The Aussie banks are pulling a CLASSIC corporatocracy move, this time within the realm of corporations. Fall on your bums Aussie banks and have a good pouting tantrum.😛 Farmer Tomato Wednesday, August 10, 2016 - 1:55 pm · Reply Whenever we’ve been in Australia, the locals have always advised us to minimize contact with the banks there as much as possible. They are not trusted, and wisely. Bad management, lax IT security, horrible treatment of customers. Bravo, Apple. Don’t let them pull you down to their level. emmayche Wednesday, August 10, 2016 - 4:39 pm · Reply When Apple has decided that something is never, ever going to happen is when they “argue” simply “No.” You can bet, however, that the NFC transceiver in the iPhone and Apple Watch will be opened up for other uses down the road, most notably for transit applications, but possibly for other “secure ID” applications. It’s too valuable a capability, and too well-positioned, to be restricted only to touchless payments forever. I’m sure that the apps which are given access will be required to go through the computer equivalent of an Apple colonoscopy, just to make sure that no holes into (or out of) the Secure Archive appear, but feel free to iCal it – you can bet that these other apps will appear, and relatively soon. But Apple, no one else, will be firmly in control. Road Warrior Wednesday, August 10, 2016 - 5:22 pm · Reply When this topic appeared a little while ago I made a post with a bona fide Commonwealth Bank Commercial (one of a series) that ran down under as an indication as to how negotiations would look like. The post was removed for reasons beyond me. It’s a bit like the Cassandra effect for me. I’m excellent at predicting future trends, but convincing others of the validity of my predictions is like pulling teeth. In light of this, I respectfully ask MDN to let this post and the commercial stand. So Wednesday, August 10, 2016 - 5:24 pm · Reply The issue of course is that not only do the largest banks have an enormous collective market share, but each one of them is enormous in its own right on a global scale. Commonwealth yesterday declared their full year profits at AU$9.45 billion. I’d say that the activity of Australia’s banks is in many areas very well regulated, but cartel behaviour is clearly unacceptable for companies this large. crikey mate Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 11:48 am · Reply The Aussie banks will not fold. They are without a doubt the most secure, stable banking establishments in the world. Australia was the only country not to go into recession 2013. 26 years of growth. Now, do you really believe APPLE will get their way?/ Not in a million years. Apple are still bitching that they are forced to give 2 years warranty on their phones. Australia is one country Apple has little power. geff Thursday, August 11, 2016 - 12:22 pm · Reply So Apple want to stop all banks from using their own apps to tap and pay? Apple wants to collect all the transmit fees also?? NEVER GONNA HAPPEN APPLE, NOT IN AUSTRALIA. You may think its you that can demand change, not here mate. Take your apple pay and bugger off.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion Samsung Edge News: Korean Company Will be Outdone by Apple's Curved-Edge Display Patent? [DETAILS] By Mariel Peralta Aug 10, 2016 | 5:12 AM Samsung has expressed that they like the idea of curved display phones so much that they're willing to make it their company's signature. The Korean company's latest Samsung Edge phones have appealed to the masses for its unique designs. However, Apple has a curved-edge display patent that will seemingly outdo Samsung's in terms of not just uniqueness but in actual usefulness. Apple Curved-Edge Display Patent While Samsung has made its curved-edge ideas known to the public by releasing them with their smartphones, Apple has been taking their time with their own version. Samsung's Edge smartphones only have the curved displays up to the front but Apple plans to wrap the display around their future iPhones. Apple's patent would also include buttons and switches on the side of the phone, a feature not found in Samsung's Edge smartphones. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit BGR points out that instead of physical buttons, there might be virtual buttons or other indicators on the sides of Apple's future curved display iPhones. Furthermore, the user may also have the ability to know what function is running on the sides. Apple may not also be eliminating the current functions on their iPhones but rather replace them with something else in order to do away with physical buttons. 9to5 Mac adds that Apple's curved edge display smartphones may have some sort of divider for the front and side. This means that the edge of the smartphone will be square-like despite having a curved display underneath. Curved-Edge Displays – Who Came Up with it First? Samsung released its first curved-edge display smartphone through the Galaxy S6 Edge. However, Apple had filed a patent for the same in May 2014, several months before the Korean company released their line. Apple was just recently granted the patents by the US Patent and Trademark Office, according to Patently Apple. The website notes that Apple has been actively editing and improving their patent in the past year and this indicates that they are working on it. The published patent revealed that maybe it was Apple after all who came up with the curved-edge design idea. With Apple's ongoing rivalry with the Korean company, do you think Samsung will ask for permission to use Apple's concept or make one of their own and make it more impressive?

Resend activation e-mail Infinite Loop / The Apple Ecosystem Report: Thinner MacBook Pros to have touchscreen function keys, TouchID, more An AMD "Polaris" GPU option and USB Type-C are also on tap. by Andrew Cunningham - Aug 10, 2016 2:50 pm UTC Login to bookmark Andrew Cunningham Apple hasn't updated its pro laptop lineup in well over a year, and rumors about refreshed models have been floating around for months. USB Type-C, an OLED touchscreen that replaces the row of function keys, and a thinner design are all expected at this point, and a new report from Bloomberg's well-sourced Mark Gurman reiterates all of those points while offering a couple of new details. Past reports have suggested that the touchscreen function keys will allow Apple and app developers to offer keyboard shortcuts that change based on what you're doing or what app you're using, and the Bloomberg report offers no new details here. It does, however, say that Apple plans to bring its TouchID fingerprint sensors over to the Mac for the first time and that "Apple has tested versions of the upcoming laptops that integrate the scanner beside the new function key display." The upcoming macOS Sierra update already allows users to unlock their Macs with their Apple Watches, but a TouchID option would offer easy authentication that didn't require separate hardware. The report also says that the laptops will be thinner, include slightly larger trackpads, and have smaller footprints than the current MacBook Pros, though they won't switch to a tapered design like the ones used for the MacBook or MacBook Air. As expected, USB Type-C is also on tap, though it's still not clear whether those Type-C ports will also be Thunderbolt 3 ports. Finally, some models will allegedly offer a dedicated GPU option based on AMD's new Polaris architecture. Dedicated GPUs are usually confined to the larger 15-inch Pros, leaving other models to make do with Intel's integrated GPU offerings. Gurman suggests that the laptops won't be unveiled at Apple's expected iPhone event, which rumors suggest will happen on September 7. Apple hasn't talked about Mac hardware onstage since it introduced the MacBook in March of 2015. That was also the last time the 13-inch Pro was refreshed. The 15-inch MacBook Pro was refreshed in May of 2015, but they included the same processors as the 2014 models. Neither design has been updated since the original Retina models were introduced in 2012.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is planning the first major update in four years to its Macbook Pro laptop line, according to a Bloomberg report. The company’s Macbook Pros have remained unchanged in terms of design and footprint since their launch back in 2012. But big changes are on the horizon, according to several people familiar with the matter. From Bloomberg: The updated notebooks will be thinner, include a touch screen strip for function keys, and will be offered with more powerful and efficient graphics processors for expert users such as video gamers, said the people, who asked not to be named. The new computers have been in advanced testing within Apple since earlier this year, said one of the people, who didn’t want to be identified discussing products before their release. The MacBook Pros aren’t likely to debut at an event currently scheduled for Sept. 7 to introduce next-generation versions of the iPhone, according to one of the people. Apple spokesman Bill Evans declined to comment. So while the new line probably won’t even be announced — let alone hit shelves — this fall, it’s possible we could see them in Q1 or Q2 of next year. With such a large gap in between major updates, the company likely expects millions of users to take the plunge and upgrade to the newer models. Along with faster components, the laptops will reportedly also feature a second screen with touch capabilities. Back to Bloomberg: The most significant addition to the new MacBook Pro is a secondary display above the keyboard that replaces the standard function key row. Instead of physical keys, a strip-like screen will present functions on an as-needed basis that fit the current task or application. The smaller display will use Organic Light-Emitting Diodes, a thinner, lighter and sharper screen technology, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said earlier this year. We wrote recently that Apple’s laptops were in dire need of an upgrade, and now we’ve gotten some solid confirmation that major updates are in fact coming soon. A tell-tale sign that an announcement is imminent will be when Apple cuts the prices of its existing laptops, which it typically does in conjunction with a new product launch. With iPhone sales lagging, Apple is looking for other areas like services and Macbooks to pick up the slack. And speaking of iPhone, an update to that flagship device is expected to be announced on September 7. Apple shares, which have risen 3.37% since the start of 2016, were mostly flat in premarket trading Wednesday.

Private Firm Outdoes Apple, Offers $500K To Hackers Who Find Flaws In iPhone Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Private Firm Outdoes Apple, Offers $500K To Hackers Who Find Flaws In iPhone Image courtesy of David Menidrey August 10, 2016 10:39 am EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler Bug Bounty Bidding Battle a bigger payout bug bounty apple Exodus Intelligence finding security flaws security vulnerability flaws A week after Apple finally announced its first bug bounty program, promising to hand over up to $200,000 to hackers who find and alert Apple about security flaws, a private exploit trading firm is offering security researchers a better deal for their vulnerability intel on the tech giant: up to $500,000.  The Verge reports that Exodus Intelligence unveiled a new program for collecting vulnerabilities in tech company products, including the operating systems for Apple, Google, and others. Exodus is specifically looking for vulnerabilities targeting iOS 9.3 and up, and promising to pay up to $500,000 for that intel. While it’s not uncommon for private firms to pay so-called bug bounties for information about company’s security, Exodus’ program is noteworthy because it comes on the heels of Apple’s first ever program and offers more than double what the tech company does for information. Last week, Apple announced it would provide specifically invited researchers up to $200,000 when the program officially launches in September. Once companies like Exodus collect the vulnerability reports, it adds the information to a database that customers, like Apple or Microsoft, can pay a subscription to access. The company also sells the information to security firms and antivirus vendors looking to defends users, The Verge reports, as well as to clients who want to find their way into protected systems, like government agencies.

Photograph: GS/Gallery Stock Eamonn Forde Wednesday 10 August 2016 10.13 EDT Last modified on Friday 11 November 2016 15.40 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close The normal route is for a TV show to build an audience and then launch an app as they’ve been told it extends their “engagement”. Shazam, the music recognition app, could have just flipped that thinking to become the first app to be made into a TV show. Beat Shazam has been picked up by Fox in the US where it will be produced by British executive Mark Brunett, and is basically a modern spin on Name That Tune, where contestants play against the music identification app to try and identify a song first. It has been a long and curious journey for Shazam but, unlike many of its peers, it is still going after 15 years, which is several lifetimes in digital music. Back in 2001, the only real use for your Nokia 3310, beyond calling and texting people, was playing Snake. That January, I got a demo of an early version of Shazam at Midem, the annual music industry conference in Cannes, where the developers held up their handset in a crowded bar as music played over the PA and, five seconds later, an SMS arrived telling us what the song was and who was singing it. It worked on proprietary acoustic fingerprinting technology and remains the most jaw-dropping deployment of nascent software I have ever experienced. It felt like magic. When it fully launched in 2002 in the UK initially, Shazam had to rely on the 2580 short code to work (deliberately picked as the numbers made up the middle row of a handset’s keypad and therefore would be easy to remember); but then you’d have to go to an actual shop and buy the CD as iTunes did not exist then. Some experimentation with mobile operators’ portals followed, where you could download tracks straight to your phone but that was the first real white elephant of digital music retail as “mobile content” then was ostensibly polyphonic ringtones and few handsets could handle MP3s. Shazam’s spotlight moment, however, arrived in 2008 with the debut of the Apple app store and it featured as one of the early apps in Apple’s marketing around both the store and the iPhone. Just as bands having a track used in iPod ads a few years earlier found, being associated with an Apple product could catapult you from the margins and into the mainstream. By the end of 2014, Shazam had reached 120 million monthly users and was dealing with 20 million tags a day. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Chris Barton, founder of Shazam, and a very old cellphone. Photograph: Frank Baron for the Guardian There have been multiple competitors that came in its wake – notably SoundHound and Sony’s own TrackID – but they have been overshadowed by Shazam’s enormous user base (it has more than 100 million monthly users). The post-iPhone business model then was relatively straightforward. The app was free to use but users could link through to buy identified tracks from iTunes – and later other retailers as it developed apps for every major mobile operating system – with Shazam taking an affiliate cut of every download. At its peak, the company was reporting that around 10% of tagged tracks resulted in a purchase. (There was also a paid version of the app that allowed unlimited tagging and extra functionality, but the company soon realised it had to be free at the point of initial use to get on to as many smartphones as possible – 500 million and counting.) That was to prove a short-lived gold rush as the download market started to decline, first in the US in 2013, and now Shazam, in a telling indication of the changing of the guard, links through to streaming services like Apple Music, Deezer and Napster. It remains an important marketing platform for the record industry, where acts and labels promote tracks in-app and ensure that as soon as pre-release tracks go to DJs, Shazam has it in its database in advance. I was once told, off the record, how one major label was sent into a flap after scoring a sync on a major ad campaign but had forgotten to send the track to Shazam and had to panic-mail the file over so that Shazam could ingest it and ensure there were no more failed tags. Shazam, at that point, was seen by labels as a second wind in marketing a track after it was used in an advert. Fifteen years is a long time in technology and Shazam has had to evolve beyond music identification, developing trending charts and also working with TV/film companies, brands and advertisers (where posters are “Shazamable”) to extend it beyond just music. It has been involved with the Super Bowl ad break as well as American Idol, plus it has evolved its technology to let users “tag” TV shows. It has been a part of the background of shows, but Fox is hoping its brand is known and powerful enough to be parlayed into a show in its own right. Shazam is also proof that, even with scale, it does not follow that digital companies become profitable. The company may have raised $30m of new investment at the start of 2015 to give it a market valuation of $1bn, but it is still losing money. For example, in 2014, it ran up losses of £14.8m ($19.3m) according to its filings at Companies House in the UK. It is not alone in this regard, with both Pandora and Spotify currently grappling with this exact scale/profitability conundrum. In many ways, the Beat Shazam TV show sees it returning to its music roots. Like Hoover and Google, Shazam is that rare instance where a proper noun becomes a verb – but that can only carry you so far in terms of building a viable business. Contestants on the show stand to win “big money prizes” and Shazam itself is no doubt crossing its fingers for a similar windfall. This article was amended on 12 August to clarify that Chris Barton is the founder of Shazam and not it’s current CEO, that position is held by Rich Riley.

Black and white wallpapers for macOS and iOS   skip to main content skip to main menu     Will overhauled MacBook Pros debut alongside iPhone 7 in September or in October? By Christian Zibreg, Aug 10, 2016 Tweet 13 Comments In an article this morning, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman rehashed much of the previous rumors regarding Apple’s widely expected MacBook Pro refresh with Touch ID, AMD GPU, an OLED touch strip replacing the row of function keys and more. As per the report, these new MacBook Pros “aren’t likely” to debut alongside the new phones at the September 7 iPhone media event. Which brings me to our question of the day: will the new machines launch in September, October or maybe even later? Let us know what you think in the comments. First and foremost, it doesn’t make sense from a marketing standpoint to unveil two major hardware refreshes simultaneously (though Apple’s done just that in the past). In and of itself, the iPhone 7 is a big enough news to warrant a media event of its own. Given the pent-up demand, the rumors and the fact that the next-generation MacBook Pro is apparently the most significant refresh to Apple’s professional notebook family in four years, I don’t see how the new MacBook Pro could debut alongside the iPhone 7. Were Apple to unveil both the new phone and notebook next month, press coverage of the notebook would inevitably get drowned in a sea of iPhone 7-related news. Let’s not forget that—in most cases—Apple prefers holding two media events in the Fall: one in September, solely dedicated to a next-generation iPhone (occasionally with other hardware refreshes), and the other in October, usually for new iPads and Macs. In September 2014, Apple launched the iPhone 6s and previewed the Apple Watch. However, the iPad Air 2 and the 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display debuted at another event, in October 2014. Mind you, the same “iPhones in September, Macs/iPads in October” pattern can be traced back to calendar years 2013, 2012 and 2010. On the other hand, the September-October timeframe broke last year as Apple launched a bunch of updated hardware at a single mega-event in September—the iPhone 6s, the new Apple TV, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro—without a second event in October. Given the 2015 release schedule, we can speculate that the new MacBook Pros might arrive alongside new iPhones come September 7. But if history is anything to go by, the refreshed notebooks (and maybe a next-generation Apple TV?) should see the light of day at a media event of their own, in October 2016. When do you expect new MacBook Pros to be unveiled, during the iPhone 7 presentation next month or at a separate media event some time in October?

Then in October they’ll release the new macs, ipads and software updates for both along with possibly IOS 10.1 Tommy Gumbs Yea……you should of written the article because what you wrote sounds about right….at least plausible. Iskren Donev Yep, event one: iPhone-Watch-TV, event two: Mac-iPad. I remember several years when the iPad and Mac announcements were bundled together so it makes sense. Anonymous So it’s not that I do not think your idea will pan out, but to consider the opposition maybe apple would use the iPhone event to announce the new MacBook Pro, as a way to help shield the media from bashing over the lack of the iPhone audio jack… this is also assuming they do remove the audio jack. What do you think about that? Tony That could happen as well, there’s going to be some “heat” from people because of the audio jack. But I don’t think you’ll hear it from the crowd at the event itself. Now in reviews for the device it’s going to be a heavy hitter. I have no doubt in nearly every review it’s going to be front and center. I can definitely see Apple poking fun at the leaks for the jack, simply because Samsung threw the gauntlet down about it being included on their new device. Alan Aurmont Apple would never combine iPhone release with a major Mac release. That would be a sacrilege. Steve would explode. KarmaSonofJesus I feel like this year’s iPhone will break 2-year refresh cycle of iPhones by seeing only minor, mostly-internal upgrades for the iphone rather than a full hardware redesign. That being the case, it makes sense to balance this potentially disappointing news with a major macbook upgrade. We’ll just have to wait and see. PhoneTechJay I hope the macbook line finally let you change the keyboards backlight color.. mrgerbik doubt it… not apples thing to allow much user customization PhoneTechJay I know, I hate that part.. But we’re getting there with more color options i.e. black, gold, rose gold, and white.

Citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported that the next iPhone's home button will respond to pressure with a vibrating sensation rather than a click as it does currently. That would make it similar to Apple's 3-D Touch feature on the iPhone 6s, which activates a haptic feedback sensation when you apply pressure to the screen.   Bloomberg's sources also confirmed two other widely-circulated rumors: the next iPhone will come without a headphone jack and will include a dual camera system to capture brighter photos with more detail. A purple iPhone prototype that Unboxing Therapy showed off last week also corroborated those changes. The absence of a headphone jack is widely rumored and has caused much consternation, though some early prototypes have included one. There's also been no shortage of theories about how Apple will pipe audio out of the device. In addition to its similarity to 3-D Touch, the new haptic feedback home button will closely resemble the capabilities of the trackpad on Apple's 2015 MacBook, signaling Cupertino's commitment to continue investing in the technology. It's not clear from Bloomberg's report what additional features a haptic feedback home button would provide. Whatever physical features end up being included -- or abandoned -- on the new iPhone, its software capabilities won't be a surprise. Apple has extensively touted the features of its next mobile operating system, iOS 10, which it unveiled at WWDC in June. It overhauls Messages and includes a new version of Siri that supports third-party integrations, among other changes.

The mid-range device was launched in April in a bid to attract more Android converts and first time smartphone owners. It recycles many of the components of other iPhones and has a four-inch screen that is smaller than Apple’s current flagship iPhone 6S handset. And it appears as though the strategy is working. iPhone devices accounted for a third of all sales in the US during the second quarter of 2016 and 18.2 percent across Europe’s five main economies. iPhone SE The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus are America’s favourite smartphones, commanding a 15.1 percent share, ahead of the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge (14.1 percent), with the iPhone SE in third with 5.1 percent. But it seems as though the UK love its even more. “In Great Britain, the iPhone SE was the top selling device in the quarter at 9.2 percent, followed by the iPhone 6s at 9.1 percent. Together they contributed to iOS growth of 3.1 percentage points to 37.2 percent in the second quarter of 2016,” said Dominic Sunnebo, analyst for Kantar Worldpanel ComTech Europe. “iOS also experienced continued momentum in France, at 20.2 percent of smartphone sales. In Germany, iOS sales increased for the first time since the third quarter of 2015, up one percentage point to 14.2 percent of smartphone sales from 13.2 percent in the June period last year. What should be the biggest consideration when devising a mobile strategy? Security Compliance Connectivity Applications Education Infrastructure Other View Results  Loading ... “These three markets combined, plus very slight declines in Italy and Spain, led iOS to grow across the EU5 by 0.7 percentage points. This represents the first period of increase since the three months ending November 2015.” The iPhone SE also hoped to attract buyers in emerging markets but supply constraints in China meant Apple fell behind both Huawei and Xiaomi. However analysts are hopeful that the huge number of iPhone owners in the US and China with older iPhones means Apple has a huge opportunity – if it can entice them to upgrade and it solves its supply line problems.

According to Kantar Worldpanel, whose research is based on responses from a worldwide panel of consumers, the proportion of people plumping for a new iOS handset rather than an Android in the US and in Europe’s five main countries, has jumped noticeably over the past three months. Just under one-third (31.8 per cent) of US smartphone sales were of the iOS variety while 18.2 per cent of consumers in the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Italy also went for an iPhone. In Great Britain, the iPhone SE was the top selling device in the quarter at 9. per cent followed by the iPhone 6s at 9.1 per cent,” said Dominic Sunnebo, Business Unit Director for Kantar Worldpanel ComTech Europe. But as well as being a standout hit in the UK, Apple’s smallest current handset is proving a global hit, behind only the iPhone 6s/6s Plus and the Samsung Galaxy S7/S7 Edge in terms of sales. “The iPhone SE became the third best-selling phone at 5.1 per cent, contributing to the overall growth of iOS during the period,” said Lauren Guenveur, Consumer Insight Director for Kantar Worldpanel ComTech. However, while Apple has taken another small bite out of Android’s market share in the US and Europe, its popularity is waning in China and Japan. “In contrast to the growth in the US and EU5, iOS continued to post year-over-year declines in Urban China,” said Tamsin Timpson, Strategic Insight Director at Kantar Worldpanel ComTech Asia. “While the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus remain the top selling smartphones in the region, pressure from Huawei’s Mate 8, P9, Xiaomi’s RedMi Note 3 and Mi 5, and Oppo’s R7 has led to increased competition in the market.” However, Kantar notes that sales of the iPhone SE were restricted in the region over the last quarter. “[It] was not able to make the expected impact, accounting for 2.5 per cent of smartphone sales in the second quarter,” said Timpson. — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week How Apple lost China to two unknown local smartphone makers Facebook reportedly built a censorship tool for China (VIDEO) Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Facebook in crosshairs as fake news battle heats up Twitter boss briefly suspended from his own network Facebook in crosshairs as fake news battle heats up Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Three Star Wars drones to land before Christmas (VIDEO) Facebook fake news writer on how he possibly influenced the US election Zuckerberg says he’ll take steps to solve Facebook fake news Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: China goes global as Trump puts America first Reuters Video: Facebook crafts censorship tool to re-enter China, says NYT Kids and parents react to 'Beauty and the Beast' MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants MMOTV: A Red Shirts supporter hurls abuse at Bersih supporters Related Articles iPhone SE review: Smaller, yet as powerful as they come Forget the new iPhone; for Apple, it’s all about the dollar Pre-orders open for iPhone SE, new iPad Pro Apple bets new 4-inch iPhone to draw big-screen converts in China, India The next big thing in phones may not be a phone Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

The decision to release a new MacBook Pro – a line that hasn’t seen a new release in four years – comes as Apple deals with lagging iPad sales, suggesting the company may turn to an old favorite to help pull it out of this rut. New report has surfaced today, giving us additional details about what to expect if this supposed MacBook does indeed exist. Like previous rumors, this one from anonymous Bloomberg sources seems to confirm that the MacBook Pro for 2016 will feature TouchID compatibility, support for USB Type-C, and a touch-enabled secondary OLED screen above the laptop’s physical keyboard. This secondary screen will apparently offer contextual functions depending on what sort of program is being used on the computer itself, and it could allow Apple to add new functionality to the keyboard without having to develop an entirely new MacBook. This new MacBook is rumored come in 13 and 15-inch varieties, a while they will be thinner than the current Pro models being offered, it won’t be on the same level as something like the MacBook Air, meaning no tapered edges on the device. In fact, the new MacBook is said to have shallower curved edges than even the current Pro and smaller bezels around the display, lending to the new computer’s smaller overall footprint. While details about internal hardware have been rather slim, Bloomberg says users will have the option of including a graphics chip from AMD‘s “Polaris” line, potentially giving gamers and other users who want their MacBook to be more of a workhorse extra graphics power. Apple was drawn to the Polaris line due to the fact that it manages to pack a respectable amount of power into a relatively small package, giving the company the ability to achieve the thinness factor it’s looking for in the new MacBook Pro. Obviously, we’ve heard some of this before, but this report serves to back up earlier rumors about the 2016 MacBook Pro while sprinkling in some new tidbits of information. There’s still no word on when Apple would reveal the device – a showing at next month’s event seems unlikely – but considering that sales began to swing away from iPad and into Mac’s favor last year, it wouldn’t be surprising to hear that Apple is plotting a new MacBook release. Hopefully more details will make their way to the surface soon, so stay tuned.

Its soaring stock Google’s latest moonshot? Its soaring stock Posted on Wednesday, August 10, 2016 by CNN in Business News Google isn’t just the 800-pound gorilla of online search. It’s now an $800 stock too. Shares of Google parent company Alphabet hit an all-time high Tuesday of more than $813 a share. The company is now worth $555 billion. Only Apple, with a market value of $586 billion, is worth more. (Google was briefly the most valuable company in the world earlier this year.) Alphabet’s stock is up just 4% this year though, in line with Apple. So Google has lagged the performance of two other members of the so-called FANG of four in tech. Amazon — also at an all-time high — is up nearly 15% while Facebook has soared almost 20% this year. Netflix is the only laggard in the group. Shares are down about 20% so far in 2016. But even though Google/Alphabet hasn’t surged as much as some other big techs, there is no denying that it is doing extremely well. Part of that has to do with the fact that investors are embracing most large tech stocks in general. The Nasdaq hit an all-time high Tuesday — its first since July 2015. But Google (is it OK if I just call it Google?) isn’t just riding the Nasdaq’s coattails. The company is still growing at a rate that would make most companies envious. Analysts are forecasting that profits will increase more than 15% this year and that sales will be up 20%. That’s truly remarkable when you consider just how colossal Google is. Sales are expected to top $88.5 billion this year and exceed $100 billion in 2017. It has now been a year since Google announced that it was reorganizing into Alphabet. Since then, the company has continued to post solid gains in its core Google search business, as well as YouTube and Android. But the startups in the Alphabet empire — companies that the company classifies as “other bets” — continue to lose money, despite healthy revenue growth. The “other bets” division includes the Google Fiber Internet access business, connected home device unit Nest and its life sciences division Verily. Investors continue to express hope that many of these so-called moonshots will eventually pay off handsomely. But investors also seem less worried that Google will continue to plow money into unprofitable businesses indefinitely. That’s because the company’s chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, has promised more fiscal discipline at the company. Porat, who Google hired away from Wall Street investment bank Morgan Stanley last year, has won raves from analysts and investors. She, along with executive chairman Eric Schmidt, are viewed as the financial reality checks for the pie-in-the-sky dreams that Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin continue to have. Along those lines, Google is widely reported to be working on a deal to sell its Boston Dynamics robotics division to Toyota. So Google may have more room to run. And while many investors are more enamored with Amazon and Facebook because of how rapidly they are growing, Google is no slouch either. The company has more products (seven) with at least a billion users than Facebook, whose Messenger service just became the fourth Facebook feature to reach the billion user milestone. (Google’s core search business, Android, YouTube, Maps, Chrome, Google Play and Gmail each have more than a billion users.) It won’t be a huge shock if Google’s stock crossed the $1,000 level within the next few years either — rarefied air that only a few companies, including Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, trade above. Wall Street analysts currently have a consensus price target of $943 for Google. That’s nearly 20% higher than current levels. At that price, Google would be worth nearly $650 billion. It’s why some think Google could be the first U.S. company to one day top the (say this like Dr. Evil) ONE TRILLION DOLLAR mark.

Black and white wallpapers for macOS and iOS   skip to main content skip to main menu     Craig Federighi and Eddy Cue on learning from Maps debacle and improving the service By Christian Zibreg, Aug 10, 2016 Tweet 10 Comments Monday, Fast Company interviewed CEO Tim Cook and other Apple executives, with Cook revealing that public iOS betas actually exist to help improve the Maps service, which was widely panned and ridiculed over egregious inaccuracies shortly after its September 2012 debut. Today, the publication interviewed Eddy Cue, Apple’s boss of Internet Software and Services, and Craig Federighi, who is Apple’s chief of Software Engineering, on learning from Maps failures. Here’s what they had to say about improving Maps over the years. Noting no one is developing maps “in a significant” way except Apple and Google, Eddy Cue said that everyone else, including Nokia, TomTom and Uber, is doing it “with a very narrow focus.” In Apple’s view, Maps is a crucial component of the user experience, basically “a core organizing structure for the physical world in which you interact.” Because many apps use maps, Apple’s executive team had to make the decision and they knew they didn’t want Apple to depend on a third-party like Google for mapping. Maps development and maintenance is a very time-consuming process which never stops, said Cue, because each and every day businesses are opening and closing, streets are changing, highways are being built and so forth. “Here’s another thing about Maps: It’s expensive,” said Cue. Apple has thousands of people working on Maps, he revealed. It’s very, very expensive, and it doesn’t have a direct revenue stream. So when I say it’s only Google and us who are developing it, well, that’s part of the reason why. You can’t be a company going out and developing maps to make money; at least no one’s figured that out. To ensure the accuracy of Maps, Apple is crowd-sourcing data from iPhone users. Cue described this data-gathering process by giving the following example: Let me give you a good example: a golf course. How do we know when a new golf course opens up? We’re not exactly driving around looking for golf courses. But we know it’s there, because there are all these golf apps that get used at a golf course. If we see that all these golf apps are being used at a particular location, and we don’t show that as a golf course, we probably have a problem. You can discover that pretty quickly. It’s not as if you need a year, or anything like that. To confirm important places like golf courses and airports, Apple’s so-called ground truth specialists use a variety of sources, including the web, satellite images and more. “In a worst-case scenario, you would have to drive by,” he quipped, adding: Airports are the same thing. Runways get developed, but you don’t always really know because many are private. Roads closing, bridges closing—these are really all data problems, because the truth is we don’t really need anyone to tell us that the bridge is closing. The moment a bridge is actually closed, you can immediately see the effect. When it comes to personal information, an iOS device learns your commute patterns so that it could tell you that you need to leave early because there’s a lot of traffic on your way home, but that intelligence stays locally on the device and is never sent to Apple or synced with iCloud. “So we keep that intelligence on the device, but we can anonymously track things like traffic patterns,” said Federighi. Was the team embarrassed by the 2011 Maps debacle? You bet, said Cue. Look, the first thing is that you’re embarrassed. Let’s just deal with that one fact of emotion. I mean, these things mean a lot to us. We work really hard, and so you’re embarrassed. In the case of Maps, what it causes you to do is ask: How important is this? Is this a place where we need to triple down or quadruple down, or did we make that mistake because it’s not that important to us? A big part of the Maps equation is third-party data that Apple obtains for the service from a number of providers, and much of it is inconsistent. “You’ll get a feed from someone who provides information about restaurants, and they’ll refer to location in a different way, in terms of latitude and longitude, from your base map,” said Federighi. “There’s a huge data-quality issue there, and I don’t think we initially appreciated all the kinds of technology we would need to do that on an ongoing basis. Going through that lesson in a very public way gave us all the motivation we needed to say we’re going to do this really well.” The whole piece is a fascinating longform read and you’re wholeheartedly recommended to enjoy it in your own time, or you can save the article for later in Safari’s Reading List, Pocket or some other read-later service.

Prasoon Singh I really want to try Apple Maps but I just don’t trust it. Rowan09 Where do you live? It’s gotten a lot better and i really have no issue with it. Google still has more POIs but Apple isn’t as far behind like it once was anymore. Bill I’ve travelled across the US a lot and haven’t had too many issues with Maps. On rare occasion it directs me to a place that no longer exists. I reported said locations, included a picture of them being clearly empty and closed, and opted for email followup. A week or so later those locations no longer showed on Maps. No service is perfect but we can all help make them better the more we use them. Rowan09 So true. I went to store that was closed and did the same thing and in 2 days the area was no longer showing for that location, instead it was labeled closed. Marcus I live in Southern California and I’ve been using Apple Maps since it’s initial release. I’ve driven all over California and I don’t think I’ve ever had problems with it. I probably use it 15-20 times a year too. I guess I’ve just gotten lucky. CltrAltDelicious Apple Maps is great in NYC. No complains! edwilk55 It just sux how they are still lagging behind in basic mapping features. * Having a quick link to Home and Work. Why the hell do I have to type Home or Work to get directions? * Searching and Adding multiple stops along route. * Alternate routing, such as highway avoidance. I wish they’d make basic functionality job one as well as accuracy so it could become my go to mapping app. Hell, I have Car Play in my truck and still use Google Maps 99% of the time. I know GM has just recently added in some of these features, but they NOW have them. And they’ve had the accuracy. SMH @ Apple! Rowan09 It does alternating routing automatically now and in IOS 10 as you stated you can avoid highways and tolls. I would like them to put an option to avoid parkways for truck drivers or commercial vehicles here in NY. You also don’t need to type home or work because it’s in favorites but I get your point. I never tried to add a favorite on the home screen yet on IOS 10 QP Just deleted that useless app after it gave me wrong direction to reach a place, now i only use googlemaps.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines This Mac app lets you switch between recently used apps via Touch Bar A running list of great iOS and macOS apps on sale this week President-elect Trump promises tax incentives for Apple to build “Made in USA” iPhones Apple could slash prices of next year’s 4.7″ and 5.5″ iPhones with legacy LCD technology iPhone 8 to hit mass production late in the third quarter of 2017   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: ClearClockView, PullOver, & more… PullOver lets you pin an app to your screen for easier multitasking Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more… EmojiSuggest brings iOS 10-like emoji suggestions to the predictive keyboard WiJoin lets you know what Wi-Fi network you’re connected to iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2016.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries ePaper Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Apple said to plan first pro laptop overhaul in four years Wednesday Aug 10, 2016 at 10:03 AM Mark Gurman Bloomberg Apple is preparing the first significant overhaul of its MacBook Pro laptop line in over four years, according to people familiar with the matter, using one of its older products to help reverse two quarters of sliding sales.  The updated notebooks will be thinner, include a touch screen strip for function keys, and will be offered with more powerful and efficient graphics processors for expert users such as video gamers, said the people, who asked not to be named. The new computers have been in advanced testing within Apple since earlier this year, said one of the people, who didn't want to be identified discussing products before their release. The MacBook Pros aren't likely to debut at an event currently scheduled for Sept. 7 to introduce next-generation versions of the iPhone, according to one of the people. Apple spokesman Bill Evans declined to comment. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs heralded tablets as possible laptop replacements by calling the iPad a "post-PC" device after it launched in 2010, but products like the MacBook Pro have shown surprising resilience. Sales of Macs, including the Pro line, rose 6 percent to $25.5 billion in the last fiscal year, while iPad sales fell 23 percent to $23.2 billion. This year's MacBook Pro overhaul is aimed at increasing notebook sales at a time when consumers are taking longer to buy or replace iPads. Apple research suggests customers upgrade iPads roughly every three years, while they buy new iPhones every 18 to 24 months, according to a person familiar with Apple's strategy, which helps explain why iPad sales numbers have fallen from a peak in 2013. The most significant addition to the new MacBook Pro is a secondary display above the keyboard that replaces the standard function key row. Instead of physical keys, a strip-like screen will present functions on an as-needed basis that fit the current task or application. The smaller display will use Organic Light-Emitting Diodes, a thinner, lighter and sharper screen technology, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said earlier this year. Apple's goal with the dedicated function display is to simplify keyboard shortcuts traditionally used by experienced users. The panel will theoretically display media playback controls when iTunes is open, while it could display editing commands like cut and paste during word processing tasks, the people said. The display also allows Apple to add new buttons via software updates rather than through more expensive, slower hardware refreshes. The new top-of-the-line MacBook Pros will be slightly thinner than the current models but are not tapered like the MacBook Air and latest 12-inch MacBook, one of the people said. The new MacBook Pros have a smaller footprint than current models and the casing has shallower curves around the edges. The pressure-sensitive trackpad is also slightly wider, the person added. An option for a version featuring a higher-performance graphics chip from Advanced Micro Devices will be available, another person familiar with the matter said. It's unclear which provider Apple will use for the main processor, but Intel Corp. has supplied this in the past. Apple is using one of AMD's "Polaris" graphics chips because the design offers the power efficiency and thinness necessary to fit inside the slimmer Apple notebook, the person said. The new graphics card is more than 20 percent thinner than its predecessor, AMD said earlier this year. AMD declined to comment, referring inquiries to Apple. The new design will include USB-C technology, a multifunctional type of port that can handle charging, data transfers, and display connectivity, one of the people said. Apple has also considered bringing gray, gold, and silver colors to the new line, as it has done with other products like the iPhone, iPad, and the 12-inch MacBook, a person said. It's unclear whether colored Pro laptops will be available when the new line is released. Apple is planning to bring over its Touch ID fingerprint technology from the iPhone to the new MacBook Pro line. Apple has tested versions of the upcoming laptops that integrate the scanner beside the new function key display, according to one of the people. The sensor would allow users to log in more quickly and theoretically authenticate Apple Pay purchases. Like with iPhones, the new Pro laptops will encrypt fingerprint data so it can't be removed from the devices. Apple will also release a new version of its Mac operating system named Sierra this fall that brings Siri, new messaging and photo-management features, deeper iCloud integration, and more efficient file storage to Apple's desktops and laptops, the company said in June. --- Ian King and Alex Webb contributed.

Interviewed by Rick Tetzeli, Cue explains the problems Apple encountered with Maps: “it just never ends”. Cue says that Maps is an endless task as businesses open and close, POIs and streets change, etcetera. Initially, Apple’s engineering processes did not account for this kind of dynamic activity. However, Cue says Apple now uses data from customer iPhones to constantly make Maps better. For example, Apple can find out if a new golf course has opened by tracking user App Store downloads. If a burst of iOS users start downloading golfing apps in the same location, Apple can reasonably assume a new POI has been setup. Cue says that it uses the crowd-sourced data as a starting point. It then verifies the existence of the golf course, for example, by other means. This could be via a web search to verify the location or in the ‘worst case’ Apple will send people to drive to the physical place for ground truth research. Similar crowd-sourced data can also be used to detect changes in traffic flows, highlighting closed bridges or new roads according to Federighi. However, the execs are quick to stress that this information is anonymous and cannot be traced to individual users. The proactive hyper-local suggestions remain private and only stay on the local device: Your device may learn your commute patterns, it may learn when you go to the office and when you go home, so that locally on the phone it could tell you that you need to leave early because there’s a lot of traffic on your way home. Well, that’s something that is personal to you and provides value to you, but we don’t want Apple to know when you go to work. So we keep that intelligence on the device, but we can anonymously track things like traffic patterns. Another interesting point raised in the interview is that Cue says Maps is expensive for Apple with thousands of employees associated to the product. Cue speculates this is why only Apple and Google even bother to attempt Maps on a grand scale. Cue says Apple Maps is incredibly expensive and has no discernible revenue stream. Obviously, Maps is an indirect feature of the products Apple sells; its hardware. Cue and Federighi are disappointed with the public feeling around Maps, much of it caused by the initial blunders of its release in 2012, but insist it is up to speed now and will only continue to get better. They refer to Apple Maps as a foundational element of their platforms, Federighi says they “tripled down” on it. They were embarrassed by the iOS 6 debut of Maps and changed many of their processes to prevent future mistakes. They say that the reason iOS 10 is now in public beta is because of Maps. Cue and Federighi declined to tease specifics of Apple’s future direction for Maps (some of which has to be related to Apple’s car efforts) but gave a few examples of proactive enhancements they would like Maps to accomplish going forward: Here’s a problem Maps should solve: I’m about to get on a red-eye and go to New York. I don’t go there that often, but I’ve gone to places I like. I never remember the name of restaurants. Today you solve that by remembering the type of food, and maybe the neighborhood, but there should be a better way of solving that problem. The executives say that Apple is not perfect and they “are going to make mistakes” in some areas. Cue says that he believes Apple’s products to have fewer mistakes than they did in the past but appreciates they are being held to ever-higher standards of quality. They are always striving for perfection. Cue also makes the point that the iPhone is an anomaly in terms of market size. Anything Apple does is compared to the iPhone but very few things can ever come close to that level of success. Federighi reiterates the usual points about Apple building an ecosystem of technology that create great experiences. We think in terms of experiences. We all use these devices every day, and we think about what we’d like them to do for us. Those aspirational experiences lead us down all sorts of roads technologically, to all kinds of problems that we need to solve. So we think, “Oh, we’d like your Watch to unlock your Mac,” because we need to unlock our Macs every day. It doesn’t start with, “Hey, we’ve been doing development in wireless and they want something to use their technology for.” Cue says Apple cannot judge all of its efforts in comparison to the smartphone, though. He says if that were true, Apple would never do anything else because most stuff will never be as big. He says the company would have never bothered to make Apple TV if it only ever aimed to beat the iPhone. Despite its flagship success, suggestions that Apple is slowing down on iPhone innovation are untrue according to Cue and Federighi. Federighi says that it’s a pillar of what Apple does and remains the biggest “value creation opportunity” for its users. The interviewer also touches on the executive relationship with Steve Jobs and Tim Cook. Cue said the environment hasn’t changed: both Cook and Jobs are demanding, even if their approaches are different. I never wanted to disappoint Steve. I never want to disappoint Tim. And I have that with, like, my dad. I was here with [former Apple CEO Michael] Spindler and those guys, and I didn’t have it with them. That’s a quality that makes them unique. Now, their approach is very different. Steve was in your face screaming, and Tim is more quiet, more cerebral in his approach. But you have the same feeling. And when you disappoint Tim, even though he isn’t screaming at you, you get the same thing. [They both laugh knowingly.] That part comes through loud and clear.

APFS: New Apple File System Changes Everything August 9th, 2016 APFS, or Apple File System, is one of the biggest changes coming to every new Apple device beginning next year. Backing up your files is our job, so we think a new file system is very interesting. Let’s take a look at APFS to understand what it is and why it’s so important. File systems are a vital component of any computer or electronic device. The file system tells the computer how to interact with data. Whether it’s a picture you’ve taken on your phone, a Microsoft Word document, or an invisible file the computer needs, the file system accounts for all of that stuff. File systems may not be the sexiest feature, but the underlying technology is so important that it gets developers interested. Apple revealed plans for APFS at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June. APFS thoroughly modernizes the way Apple devices track stored information. APFS also adds some really cool features that we haven’t seen before in other file systems. APFS makes its debut in macOS 10.12 Sierra, currently in development with a release this fall. APFS is optional for developers to use right now, but Apple expects to make it mandatory to use in the future. Since our Mac client is a native app, we like many Apple developers, are boning up now on APFS and what it means. What is APFS? Apple hasn’t defined the P in APFS, but that differentiates it from Apple File Service (AFS), a term used to describe older Apple file and network services. APFS is designed to scale from the smallest Apple device to the biggest. It will work with watchOS, tvOS, iOS and macOS, spanning the entire Apple product line. It’s designed from the get-go to work well on modern Apple device architectures and offers plenty of scalability going forward. APFS won’t change how you see files. The Finder, the main way you interact with files on your Mac, won’t undergo any major cosmetic changes because of APFS (at least none Apple has told us about yet). Neither will iOS, which largely abstracts file management. This is under-the-hood stuff that tells the computer where to put and how to work with data. The first implementation of APFS is available to Apple developers in the beta of macOS Sierra 10.12. That’s in the hands of testers now, with a general release planned for this September. Apple isn’t making APFS mandatory today, so don’t worry about this getting in the way if you plan to upgrade to 10.12 once it’s out. Apple plans to deploy APFS across product lines beginning in 2017. This should be a pretty smooth transition that will make work for developers working on apps, and it’s certainly keeping Apple engineers burning the midnight oil, but we’re not expecting a lot of disruption on your end of things. Though some behaviors are changing in how files are stored on disk which will have an effect on you. So read on for details. Why did Apple make APFS? The current file system Apple uses is HFS+. HFS was introduced in 1985, back when the Mac was still new. That’s right, more than thirty years ago now. (HFS+ came later with some improvements for newer Macs.) To give you an idea of how “state of the art” has changed since then, consider this. My first Mac, which came out late in 1984, had 512 KB of RAM (four times the original Mac’s memory) and a single floppy drive that could store 400K. This computer I’m writing from now has 8 GB of RAM – almost 16 thousand times more RAM than my first Mac – and 512 GB of storage capacity. That’s more than 1.2 million times the capacity of that early machine. Think about that the next time you get a message that your drive is full! Given the pace of computer technology and development, it’s a bit startling that we still use anything developed so long ago. But that’s how basic and just how important a file system is to a computer’s operation. HFS+ was cutting-edge for its time, but it’s designed for computers with floppy disk drives and hard drives. Floppies are long gone. The vast majority of Apple devices now use solid state storage like built-in flash and Solid State Drives (SSDs), and those store data differently than hard drives and floppies did. Why is APFS better? APFS is designed from the start to better suit the needs of today’s and tomorrow’s devices. It’s thoroughly optimized for devices that use solid state storage – flash and SSDs. These storage technologies work differently than spinning drives do, so it only makes sense to optimize the file system to take advantage. Apple’s paving the way to store lots more data with APFS. HFS+ supports 32-bit file IDs, for example, while APFS ups that to 64-bit. That means that today, your Mac can keep track of about 4 billion individual pieces of information on its hard drive. APFS ups that to 9 quintillion. That’s a 9 followed by 18 zeroes (actually, much more than that, because of hexadecimal values). Even though APFS can keep track of orders of magnitude more data than HFS+, you’ll see much faster performance. When you need to save or duplicate files, APFS shares duplicate data between files whenever possible. Instead of duplicating information like HFS+ does, APFS updates metadata links to the actual stored information. Clones, or copies of files or folders can be created instantly. You won’t have to sit and watch as gigabytes of files are duplicated en masse, wasting egregious amounts of space in the process. In fact, clones take up no additional space, since they’re pointing back to the original data! You’ll get much better bang for your storage buck with APFS than HFS+ can manage. Speaking of space, Space Sharing is another new feature of APFS. This helps the Mac be more effective at managing the free space on its hard drives. You can set up multiple partitions, even multiple file systems, on a single physical device, and all of them can share the same space. You presently have to jump through hoops if you’re resizing partitions and want to re-use de-allocated space. APFS views individual physical devices as “containers,” with multiple “volumes” inside. Networking is vitally important for almost all computers and computing devices. Over the years there’s been a lot of emphasis on tuning operating system performance for maximum throughput. That’s helpful to developers like us, because we store data in the cloud. But that’s not the whole story. Latency – the amount of time between you telling your computer to do something and when it actually happens – also has a big effect on performance. Has “the Beachball of Death” ever plagued you? You’ll click a button or try to open something, and the cursor changes to a spinning disk that looks for all the world like a beachball. Apple’s doing a lot more with APFS to make beachballs go away. That’s because they’re prioritizing latency – the amount of time between when you ask your device to do something and when it actually does it. Apple has found other ways to improve performance wherever possible. Take crash protection, for example. HFS+ uses journaling as a form of crash protection: It keeps track of changes not yet made to the file system in log files. Unfortunately, journaling creates performance overhead. Those log files are constantly being written to and read from. APFS replaces that with a new copy-on-write metadata scheme that’s much more efficient. Apple is very concerned with user privacy. Their protection of their users’ privacy has occasionally put Apple at loggerheads with governments and individuals who want information off machines. Apple’s taking your privacy seriously with APFS, thanks to much more sophisticated encryption options than before. Apple’s FileVault technology is its current encryption scheme. FileVault is what’s known as “whole disk” encryption. You turn it on and your Mac encrypts your hard drive. That encrypted data is, for all intents and purposes, unrecognizable unless you enter a password or key to unlock it. The problem is that FileVault is either on or off, and it’s on or off for the whole volume. So once you’ve unlocked it, your data is potentially vulnerable. APFS still supports whole disk encryption, but it can also encrypt individual files and metadata, with single or multi-key support. That provides additional security for your most sensitive data. As a backup company, one feature of APFS we’re particularly interested in is its support of snapshots. Snapshots are a pretty standard feature of enterprise backups, but we haven’t seen them yet on the Mac. A snapshot contains pointers to data stored on your disk, providing fast access to data stored on the disk. Because the snapshot contains pointers, not the actual data, it’s compact, and accessing it is very fast. There’s a lot more under the hood in APFS, but that gives you a broad overview of what it is and why we’re excited. We hope you are too. We’ll be bringing you more details about APFS, and if you have questions, please let us know. Over the course of the next few months, we‘ll go behind the scenes of our engineering department to show you the impact and opportunity the change to APFS and other new technologies creates for Backblaze. Since our Mac client is a native app, this promises to be pretty cool. Stay tuned. Bio Latest Posts Peter Cohen Peter will never give you up, never let you down, never run around or desert you.

Sean “APFS also adds some really cool features that we haven’t seen before in other file systems.” — Yeah, like what? 64-bit “file IDs” (I assume you mean inodes): ZFS uses 128-bit, so this isn’t exactly revolutionary. Using 128-bit ensures that in *another* 30 years, when storage companies like Backblaze can talk about a zettabyte of data with a straight face and actually contemplate possibly having one on a single logical filesystem, ZFS will be able to support it, long after APFS has gone the way of HFS. Pretty much *all* modern filesystems (ReFS, btrfs, ZFS) are using at least 64-bit inodes. Cloning: This is basically just dedup. ZFS and a few other filesystems have supported this for a long time. Latency: Wouldn’t this be more related to the I/O scheduler algorithm of the XNU kernel, than the filesystem? It’s not like other filesystems completely ignore latency as a factor, anyway… File-level crypto: Supported for years on everything from NTFS to any filesystem on GNU/Linux desktop. Snapshots and COW: Another feature pioneered by ZFS that is now seeing wider adoption with btrfs and ReFS. Since ZFS was a thing on Mac OS X a long time ago, this isn’t even the first time most of these things are being done *on a Mac*. The only real innovation here is optimizing for SSDs (which I assume is perhaps a little more than just enabling TRIM support), which is only done in a very limited capacity on ZFS, ext4, btrfs, etc. Depending on exactly what SSD optimizations they’re doing, they could genuinely be introducing new filesystem tech. But we’ll have to wait and see. Noteworthy is that OpenZFS on FreeBSD has supported TRIM since 2012. In short: almost everything APFS does is not new to the filesystem world at large, and isn’t even really new to the Mac when you consider that ZFS was supported on the Mac starting in 2008-2009 or so. If Apple had proceeded full steam with adopting ZFS as their primary filesystem, or even started investing engineering resources into the OpenZFS project to make it better and improve on some of the limitations they identified at the time, then Apple users could have had an APFS-like filesystem much earlier, perhaps as early as 2010. What’s old is new again. Steve__S Sean, your comments are valid, but they are missing the point. For starters, I don’t believe Peter framed APFS as breaking entirely new ground as compared to other files systems available. To be fair, his focus is comparing APFS to HFS+ and the laundry list of modern features included have generally been done elsewhere first. I don’t think anyone is surprised by this. That said, Peter is a journalist, not really a technologist. His overview of features is pretty much what you’d expect from a journalist… it’s essentially the regurgitation of Apple press coverage. So…. maybe you can cut him a break. ZFS is certainly a full featured file system. However, that doesn’t make it the best choice for Apple’s needs. ZFS really shines in server environments where storage pooling, data integrity and data redundancy are key design features. However, Apple’s new file system has to be optimized for everything from work stations down to mobile devices. ZFS is not the best fit for Apple’s design goals. ZFS has more overhead, it’s not really a fast performer either. Really, do you think ZFS would be a good choice for say… the Apple Watch? APFS is largely playing catch-up with the rest of the industry, but there are a few areas where it is rather cutting edge. For example, ZFS does encryption, but APFS was designed from the ground up around security. In terms of the level of granularity to the single and multi-key encryption, APFS has a clear advantage here. The things APFS is doing with space sharing and containers is rather novel as well. Even in terms of performance, the integration with the FTL (flash translation layer) is optimized for SSD performance. The point is, Apple has rather unique opportunities here since they control the entire technology stack. Simply porting over ZFS wouldn’t have allowed them to meet their design goals in the same way. That’s not a knock on ZFS. Rather, it’s an acknowledgement that ZFS and APFS were designed with different goals in mind. RustyDreams The APIs (Application Interfaces) that apps use to communicate with the file system will not change, with the exception of 4 of them. Almost all apps will have NOTHING to do to run on APFS volumes, their apps will just work. If an app uses one of the 4 APIs not supported, they’ll have a little bit of work to do, but is should not be a major headache to them. Disk Utilities will have to support APFS with all brand new code, and they’ll have to wait until APFS is finished, which it is not, to really get much done on all that new code. Discpad Peter Cohen: One huge question I have is, will APFS have a built-in feature to cut down on write amplification on SSD’s? See “The Cleaning Lady and Write Amplification” at: http://www.anandtech.com/show/2829/4 This is a problem when running any version of Windows NT (a/k/a OpenVMS for kiddies), and is why you need a 3rd party file defragger such as Raxco PerfectDisk to manage it. See: “How to Extend the Life of Your SSD Hard Drive” at: blog.raxco.com/2012/12/28/how-to-extend-the-life-of-your-ssd-hard-drive-part-1/ Dan Schwartz, Editor, The Hearing Blog http://www.TheHearingBlog.com Discpad Just a quick correction: HFS+ is not supported on floppy disks. This I know because I still support a Quadra 650 running System 7.6.1 (with AFP/IP from MacOS 8.0) for Pagemaker 7! SteveBlowJobsSucksDickInHell So what. Yet another stupid crApple post from backblaze’s own hipster iSheep douche. Why no article about ReFS or Btrfs or ZFS? But as soon as crApple finally gets around to making a modern file system after everyone else already did many years ago, you praise them as if they are doing something innovative. crApple has been behind all other tech companies for almost ten years now. Just stop with all the crApple ass kissing already! Milk Manson You’re doing the same exact thing, just pushing in the other direction. Who cares. Get a life. pixelmixture does this mean that backblaze boxes will be ported to osx ? Peter Cohen Not at this point – we’re quite content managing multiple operating systems for our hardware depending on our needs. APFS certainly paves the way for us to do interesting stuff with the client software in the future, though! One of our founders, Brian Wilson, explained a number of years ago his own philosophy towards writing cross platform code. Here’s a link to it if you’d like to read it. https://www.backblaze.com/blog/10-rules-for-how-to-write-cross-platform-code/ Stefan Does this mean that all programs have to be rewritten to work with the new file system? Tex No. It’s all behind the scenes. About the only thing that MIGHT have to happen, is the programs need to account for case in paths/file names. Stefan OK – thanks.

Apple's 40-year legacy began with this 'Eureka' moment 0 Tech Culture by Jessica Dolcourt August 10, 2016 5:00 AM PDT @jdolcourt Up Next Pokemon Go tracking finally goes live and actually works A lot's happened in 40 years. Back in 1976, co-founder Steve Wozniak built Apple's first-ever computer, the Apple I, after showing it off to a ragtag group of geeky misfits. Fast forward to 2016: Apple sold its billionth iPhone. That's an enormous achievement for a company that's become both status symbol and everyday icon. In the four decades since the Apple I, co-founder Steve Job has passed away, Wozniak has moved on to other pursuits, and Apple bumps along with the ups and downs of the consumer tech space it helped to so solidly forge. And to think, all that grew from the seed of this first "Eureka" moment. Enlarge Image The black-and-white photo from 1976 shows Steve Jobs (right) with co-founder Steve Wozniak.

You may know Steve Wozniak as the nerdy sidekick behind Apple's late co-founder and charismatic leader, Steve Jobs. But without "Woz," there would be no Apple. And without the Homebrew Computer Club of Silicon Valley, introverted Woz may never have been motivated to show off, or even build, the very first Apple computer, the Apple I. Attending that first Homebrew meeting was, Wozniak remembers, "a 'Eureka' moment for me". It was a moment that would help change the technology landscape forever. The Homebrew club was a casual gathering of hobbyists, like Wozniak, who were interested in building their own computers. Its enthusiastic members traded the hardware, software and the ideas necessary to help kickstart today's billion-dollar PC industry and put a computer in virtually every home. In 1975, when Homebrew formed, computers of the era filled half a room and you had to be part of a university, military or think tank to use one for a few hours at a time. It was a meeting that grabbed my attention for life. Steve Wozniak Having a computer for your own, anytime-use, was a radical thought and technological challenge. Like now, a personal computer then meant extraordinary freedom: of information, of higher mathematical power (the "computing" part), of exchanging ideas. Computers then weren't just nerdy; they were also a political emblem that, for some, echoed the protests of 1960s and 70s social liberation movements. A year before Homebrew formed, a book called "Computer Lib" envisioned personal computers as emblems of social freedom, proclaiming "Computer power to the people!" Woz's interest may or may not have been more technical, but he was well aware that the idea of a personal computer could change the world. "I intended to blow [Homebrew members] away with how so few and affordable chips could make a computer," Woz said in an email to CNET. "I figured that all these people who spoke about changing society [through communication and education] would build their own for $300." Here, Wozniak geeks out about his first machines, what made him join the club, and why he'll never forget his first Homebrew meeting. Question: You attended the Homebrew Computer Club's very first meeting on March 5, 1975. What drew you to the club? Frankly, it was a stroke of luck for me. I didn't know what the club was really about. I was not aware of the Altair 8800 at all [the first personal computer, which sold to hobbyists in a kit]. I was not into the general microprocessors that made such machines possible. I had played with early microprocessor data sheets (4004 from Intel), and it was too limited to lead to a useful computer, but I had not kept up with microprocessors after that. My friend Allen Baum knew that I had built a home terminal with a keyboard and using my own TV to dial up and access the ARPAnet when there were only about six universities on it. That night the full image of the Apple I popped in my head and I knew that I'd have my own useful computer. Steve Wozniak Allen called and told me about a club that was into video terminals and the like. I figured that I'd take mine and be some sort of star there. I was also not aware that there had been another TV Terminal project in this hobby community, by Don Lancaster, and featured in Popular Electronics. But my design was very good. At the club the talk was about the Altair 8800, using the 8800 microprocessor. I felt shy and out of place, not knowing that this was the driving sentiment of these hobbyists. Nonetheless, it was a meeting that grabbed my attention for life. It was a Eureka moment for me. Since early college I had wanted my own computer, but it had to include a programming language, which meant at least 4K of memory and human input and output to type in programs, even if on punched cards. I had built a processor five years before this, of my own design, with switches to enter zeros and ones individually. This was what the Altair was. My machine had 256 bytes of solid state RAM (chips). It was the heart of a computer but not a really useful or usable one. The Altair was this stage of processor, basically right off the Intel data sheet. That's why it had static RAM, which was prohibitively costly for 4K bytes. But it was expandable in normal computer fashion. You could add a card of chips that would talk to a teletype, which cost as much as a car or two, for input and output. Basically, I'd been past this stage since high school. But these club attendees had tremendous interest in this 'starting' point machine. 12 PC greats come out for Homebrew Computer Club reunion (pictures) At the club meeting, a data sheet for the 8008 processor was passed out. I took this data sheet home and was shocked to find that the microprocessor had gotten to the point of being a complete processor of the type I'd designed over and over in high school. That night the full image of the Apple I popped in my head, and I knew that I'd have my own useful computer, [for] basically no money. I'd just add a microprocessor to my terminal, which had the human input and output. I'll never forget that first night. The Apple I was your baby, your pet project. What did it mean to you to have built this computer in a time when micro-computers were strictly a hobbyist activity? I'd been at the 'build-it-yourself' processor stage of the hobbyists for a long time. But I worked at HP [Hewlett-Packard] on calculators. Our calculators had a custom processor. When you turned the calculator on it began running a program that looked at what keys you pressed. That led me to the idea that my computer would start up running a small program that let you type data in, saving the entire front panel of switches and lights, which my Cream Soda computer (five years prior) had sported. This was the "voila" step. I wanted a computer as normal and human to use as a typewriter or calculator. I [passed] out my design, hardware and software, for free without any copyright or company intent. Steve Wozniak Once I had my design built and working, I brought it to the club. I was shy, but communicated with my technical projects, just like many "makers" do. I intended to blow them away with how so few and affordable chips could make a computer that could run a programming language without a lot of other expense or surplus connections. I even passed out my design, hardware and software, for free without any copyright or company intent. I figured that all these people who spoke about changing society (communication, education, importance of geeks) would build their own for $300 cost. Few took me up on that, maybe only one. The formula for the personal computer was out to anyone looking over my shoulder. Others would have hit on it eventually, but I was first in this sense of an affordable useful computer that worked for normal people. Every computer before this one had a front panel with switches and lights. Every computer after this one had a keyboard and video display. Steve Jobs was in another state and wasn't even aware of this computer until he came into town and I took him to the club to see what it was all about. What do you think the Homebrew Computer Club's legacy is today -- that is, what should the current generation know about the club? The Homebrew Computer Club represents that well-intentioned hobbyists and makers can truly change the world of technology. None of us had resources, like money. We were people who knew about computers and wanted our own, but we had no money saved. Our ideas meant a lot to us, but not to profit-driven companies. Today the Homebrew Computer Club is an inspiration to a lot of young people that their projects can kick off great markets when established businesses disdain them as hobbyists and tinkerers.

Photo: AFP mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 9:00 PM, August 10, 2016 Updated: 11:39 PM, August 10, 2016 SAN FRANCISCO — Apple is preparing the first significant overhaul of its MacBook Pro laptop line in over four years, according to people familiar with the matter, using one of its older products to help reverse two quarters of sliding sales. The updated notebooks will be thinner, include a touch screen strip for function keys, and will be offered with more powerful and efficient graphics processors for expert users such as video gamers, said the people, who asked not to be named. The new computers have been in advanced testing within Apple since earlier this year, said one of the people, who didn’t want to be identified discussing products before their release. The MacBook Pros aren’t likely to debut at an event currently scheduled for Sept 7 to introduce next-generation versions of the iPhone, according to one of the people. Apple spokesman Bill Evans declined to comment. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs heralded tablets as possible laptop replacements by calling the iPad a ”post-PC” device after it launched in 2010, but products like the MacBook Pro have shown surprising resilience. Sales of Macs, including the Pro line, rose 6 per cent to US$25.5 billion (S$34.1 billion) in the last fiscal year, while iPad sales fell 23 per cent to S$23.2 billion. This year’s MacBook Pro overhaul is aimed at increasing notebook sales at a time when consumers are taking longer to buy or replace iPads. Apple research suggests customers upgrade iPads roughly every three years, while they buy new iPhones every 18 to 24 months, according to a person familiar with Apple’s strategy, which helps explain why iPad sales numbers have fallen from a peak in 2013. The most significant addition to the new MacBook Pro is a secondary display above the keyboard that replaces the standard function key row. Instead of physical keys, a strip-like screen will present functions on an as-needed basis that fit the current task or application. The smaller display will use Organic Light-Emitting Diodes, a thinner, lighter and sharper screen technology, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said earlier this year. Apple’s goal with the dedicated function display is to simplify keyboard shortcuts traditionally used by experienced users. The panel will theoretically display media playback controls when iTunes is open, while it could display editing commands like cut and paste during word processing tasks, the people said. The display also allows Apple to add new buttons via software updates rather than through more expensive, slower hardware refreshes. The new top-of-the-line MacBook Pros will be slightly thinner than the current models but are not tapered like the MacBook Air and latest 12-inch MacBook, one of the people said. The new MacBook Pros have a smaller footprint than current models and the casing has shallower curves around the edges. The pressure-sensitive trackpad is also slightly wider, the person added. An option for a version featuring a higher-performance graphics chip from Advanced Micro Devices will be available, another person familiar with the matter said. It’s unclear which provider Apple will use for the main processor, but Intel has supplied this in the past. Apple is using one of AMD’s “Polaris” graphics chips because the design offers the power efficiency and thinness necessary to fit inside the slimmer Apple notebook, the person said. The new graphics card is more than 20 per cent thinner than its predecessor, AMD said earlier this year. AMD declined to comment, referring inquiries to Apple. The new design will include USB-C technology, a multifunctional type of port that can handle charging, data transfers, and display connectivity, one of the people said. Apple has also considered bringing grey, gold, and silver colours to the new line, as it has done with other products like the iPhone, iPad, and the 12-inch MacBook, a person said. It is unclear whether coloured Pro laptops will be available when the new line is released. FINGERPRINT SCANNERS Apple is planning to bring over its Touch ID fingerprint technology from the iPhone to the new MacBook Pro line. Apple has tested versions of the upcoming laptops that integrate the scanner beside the new function key display, according to one of the people. The sensor would allow users to log in more quickly and theoretically authenticate Apple Pay purchases. Like with iPhones, the new Pro laptops will encrypt fingerprint data so it can’t be removed from the devices. Apple will also release a new version of its Mac operating system named Sierra this fall that brings Siri, new messaging and photo-management features, deeper iCloud integration, and more efficient file storage to Apple’s desktops and laptops, the company said in June.

More like this Why I ditched the iPad Pro 12.9 for the iPad Pro 9.7 iPad Pro early adopters share pros and cons Does Apple's ecosystem lock in users? Video 5 Weirdest iOS Keyboards When Apple released the iPad Pro, it made a point of touting it as “more than the next generation iPad.” The company noted that the iPad Pro puts “incredible power that leaps past most portable PCs at your fingertips.” Apple has really pulled out all the stops in trying to convince folks that the iPad Pro should be their next computer, and you can see that in the tone of this recent iPad Pro ad: I love my 12.9-inch iPad Pro but it’s not a laptop replacement I have a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and it’s a fantastic device. I love mine, but after using it since it’s release, I’ve come to realize that it simply couldn’t replace any of my Macs for work. The iPad Pro works great for consuming content, but try as I might I couldn't warm up to it for work. When I’m working, I have multiple application windows and many tabs open in Safari. iOS, for all its virtues, just doesn’t allow me to do what I can do in macOS. Lining up two apps, side by side, simply doesn't cut it for my work needs. I need the ability to have a slew of application windows open at the same time. If I had to travel for work I’d take my MacBook Pro with me, not my iPad Pro. The MacBook Pro can do so much more for me than my iPad Pro, and I find myself being so much more productive with the MacBook Pro. I think I'd be very frustrated if all I had available to work on was my iPad Pro. Believe me, I’ve tried to use the iPad Pro for work. But I cannot seem to adjust to using iOS in a way that matches my productivity in macOS. I know that there are some folks out there who can do it, but iOS feels claustrophobic to me. It takes me forever to get things done on my iPad Pro compared to my Macbook Pro. Is age a deciding factor in using the iPad Pro instead of a laptop? My own experience with macOS and iOS makes me wonder if perhaps I’m just part of an older generation that has a harder time adjusting to using iOS for productivity purposes. I suspect that younger people, who didn’t grow up on the desktop/laptop paradigm, might have an easier time of it. So with the iPad Pro, Apple might be laying the groundwork to attract a younger generation of users while the Mac keeps us older folks happy. This is just speculation on my part mind you, but age does play a role sometimes in how people use devices. I’m in my 40s now, so of course I have been using desktop and laptop computers for work my whole life. Trying to adjust to iOS clashes with all of that experience from the last 20 years or so. It's not easy to just cast all that previous experience aside, and start using a mobile OS like iOS that can't do everything that macOS can do. The iPad Pro is still a great device Perhaps it’s just as simple as individual preference. Some folks can hop right into using the iPad Pro instead of a laptop, and can be quite productive with the tablet. These people swear by their iPad Pros and couldn't imagine going back to a Mac. Others like me find iOS to be too restrictive and limiting in how it can be used. So we stick with macOS, and it works great for our needs. We like the iPad Pro, but we consider it to be an additional device for content consumption and light computing tasks. It will be very interesting to see if the iPad Pro consumes more of Apple’s laptop sales in the years ahead. It’s still quite early in the development of iOS itself, and additional features could eventually put it on par with macOS. But for now, I will stick with my MacBook Pro for work and use my iPad Pro for content consumption. That way I get the best of both worlds from macOS and iOS. What people are saying about the iPad Pro as a laptop replacement Many people have expressed their thoughts about the iPad Pro as a laptop replacement in various online discussions. The topic came up recently in a thread on Reddit. I’ll leave you with a sampling of some of the comments in the thread from the Apple subreddit: Note3tmo: “…what would make you consider an iPad Pro a laptop replacement, if anything at all? Better specs? More powerful apps?” SoccerChimp: “I don’t think it’ll ever really be for those who consider themselves “pro.” For example people who are developers, make music, edit video etc, will usually need access to things like peripherals, accessories, and and a file system. That’s just not who the iPad is geared towards. Someone like me however could replace a laptop for it. I’m a student and planning to go into academia or med school. I already see fantastic uses for the iPad Pro when it comes to taking notes for example. Even doing research And writing basic papers is doable. And this area is where more powerful apps could help the iPad cement its position. For example more powerful versions of ms office so I can write a thesis or a more powerful excel to analyze the data from my labs and research. When Apple says the iPad Pro can replace a laptop I don’t think they’re targeting the actual “pro” people that I first described. I think ultimately what they want is for it to replace the computers of people who spend most of their time on the web, social media, communication, and using apps like ms office. People like students, professionals, in academia, business people, etc.” Glacier88: “I’d need unfettered access to the file system, windowed apps, mouse cursor support, and apps like Logic Pro X for it to be a complete desktop replacement. Until then there are things that I can do on a Mac that I simply cannot do on an iPad. It’s not up for debate. ” Trulsemannen: “I love the iPad as a drawing device. I mainly use Procreate which is a fairly powerful app, but it doesn’t really come close to, say, Photoshop on Windows. When I work on my iPad I almost always have it on my desk, right in front of my two desktop monitors. I would never be able to work properly with just the iPad screen. Sure you can throw two windows up on the screen, but everything just feels so claustrophobic. Not just because the screen is small, but because, compared to Windows 10 (in my case), iOS only works well when you’re using one single app at a time. Anything else is just a hassle. For a lot of people I’m sure iOS works well enough as a daily driver, but I honestly think the lack of a keyboard that can properly stand up on its own makes it a terrible laptop replacement for most people.” Rokorre: “Sold my MacBook and live in iOS now. It’s amazing and I’m never looking back I use both an iPhone and iPad everyday for work and it’s made me more productive and happier to do things. I would have never even considered it before the pro came out.” Thumperr: “I’ve been away from my iMac on business with my iPad Pro for the last three months. Only thing I needed from my Mac was iBooks Author.” Macbookvirgin: “Well my Mac hasn’t been touched in 2 weeks so I guess it does replace a laptop for me.” Telynor: “For me, it’s a laptop replacement with its current apps. I’m in the process of getting ready to sell my MBP and keep only my iPad Pro 12.9". ” Sindiewen: “I would love the iPad Pro as a computer. I love the idea of a tablet/hybrid with a detachable keyboard for more productivity like Microsoft Surface tablets. But as a CS major, I would need a text editor,a compiler for various languages that run locally like C++, Python, Swift, Java… Easy access to the file system for organization and easily moving documents around. But to be honest I’m not complaining really because my Retina MacBook Pro Is perfect for my needs.” Themightytiny: “Not unless it runs a desktop OS. I can’t work without a file system. I need desktop apps too. I need Photoshop, I need CMYK support and custom tool presets. I need fonts. I need to save my files to a folder on the desktop, or wherever. I need to access my home network. So no, it’s not just apps, it’s iOS. It’s too limited/restrictive and it cannot replace a desktop OS.” More at Reddit As you can tell from the discussion thread, opinions about the iPad Pro replacing a laptop vary considerably, depending on the user. For some it works great, for others it simply isn’t enough. Did you miss a post? Check the Eye On Apple home page to get caught up with the latest news, discussions and rumors about Apple.

Share Tweet Share Tags : iOS-iOS+ Apple-Apple+ Apple's iPhone 7, 7 Plus, and possibly 7 Pro are coming, and we already seem to know a lot about these devices, but so far we had merely a vague idea when Apple's going to unwrap them on stage. Until now, that is. According to the latest word on the street, we might get to see Apple's next batch of iPhones unveiled on September 7, 2016. This is what Bloomberg claims in a recent blog post, which is mostly focused on Apple's rumored overhaul of the MacBook Pro lineup. In particular, it's said that no new MacBook Pro laptops will be announced at said September 7 event, leaving plenty of time for Tim Cook, Phil Schiller, and Craig Federighi to show us the next chapter in the iPhone's history. We are yet to stumble upon Apple's official teaser for the event though.  This generally falls in line with what we expect from Apple. For the past four years, all iPhone announcement events have taken part in the first half of September, with both the 2014 and 2015's events being held on September 9.

However, things may change later this year when Apple launches its 2016 MacBook Pro series. Detailing the alleged new features of the new laptops, a report casually mentions that some models will pack high-end Polaris graphics cards, which have been built to offer gamers cheap access to VR, at least on desktops. DON’T MISS: This has to be the prettiest poster ever designed on an iPad That said, it’s not clear what type of AMD Polaris graphics card will be found in the new MacBook Pro. “Apple is using one of AMD’s ‘Polaris graphics chips because the design offers the power efficiency and thinness necessary to fit inside the slimmer Apple notebook,” Bloomberg noted in a new report. The “high-performance graphics chip” from AMD will equip only one version of the upcoming MacBook Pro, the report says, suggesting that Apple will stick to its policy of only using more powerful graphics cards in some of its MacBook Pros. It’s unclear what company will provide the processor for the new MacBook, with Intel being Apple’s choice for previous models. Bloomberg did not only focus on the chips and graphics cards of the upcoming MacBook Pro. According to the report, Apple is preparing the most significant overhaul to the laptop line in over four years. The 2016 MacBook Pro should be thinner than existing models, but they won’t be tapered like the MacBook Air and Retina MacBook. Even so, they will have a smaller footprint and the case will have shallower curves around the edges. The pressure-sensitive trackpad is slightly wider, and a secondary, likely OLED-based screen will replace the function key row on the keyboard. The new touchscreen is supposed to offer users fast access to context-aware shortcuts. Depending on the app on the screen, the secondary display will show shortcuts that fit the task at hand, such as media playing controls or shortcuts to some of the most frequent actions inside an app, like copy and paste. The new design also includes USB-C ports, and Apple may launch the MacBook Pros in iPhone colors, including gray, gold and silver. A fingerprint sensor will also be found on the new MacBook Pros, and will likely borrow the Touch ID features on the iPhone. Users will be able to unlock the laptop with their fingerprints and authenticate Apple Pay purchases online. The new computers have been in “advanced testing” inside Apple since earlier this year, and should be unveiled during a press event later this year — but not the iPhone keynote that’s reportedly scheduled for September 7th.

McIntyre August 10, 2016 8:45 am EST Print Email Tweet With a modestly positive earnings report behind them, skeptics about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) have increased the number of shares of the stock sold short by 6.4 million to 50.9 million, an increase of almost 15% for the period that ended July 29. None of the top 15 Nasdaq companies by short interest size had such a large increase. Over the past month, Apple’s share price has risen 12% to $108. However, with a 3% increase this year, it has not matched the rise in the Nasdaq. Apple remains the company with the world’s largest market cap, at $586 billion. The company’s most recent quarterly earnings were not bad. For the quarter that ended June 25: The Company posted quarterly revenue of $42.4 billion and quarterly net income of $7.8 billion, or $1.42 per diluted share. These results compare to revenue of $49.6 billion and net income of $10.7 billion, or $1.85 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 38 percent compared to 39.7 percent in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 63 percent of the quarter’s revenue. Guidance was light: Apple is providing the following guidance for its fiscal 2016 fourth quarter: revenue between $45.5 billion and $47.5 billion gross margin between 37.5 percent and 38 percent operating expenses between $6.05 billion and $6.15 billion other income/(expense) of $350 million tax rate of 25.5 percent Apple’s success continues to rely on two things: China and the iPhone 7. In the past quarter, Greater China sales fell 33% to $8.8 billion. Several research firms have shown Apple’s share of the market has dropped below those of Samsung and local smartphone manufacturers. Then there is the iPhone 7, which is expected to be released in September. Early speculation says the phone will have two cameras, no port for headphones and a dozen other features that cannot be confirmed or denied. What is almost certain is that the phone is not a revolution within the industry as earlier versions were. That leaves the Apple brand to carry success over competitors, mostly Samsung. That is not much to rely on anymore. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Douglas A.

Follow TechnoBuffalo We have good news and bad news for folks waiting for the new MacBook Pro from Apple. The good news is that it sounds like it’s going to come packed full of new features. The bad news is that we still don’t know when it’ll launch, and Bloomberg said Wednesday that we won’t see the new MacBook Pro at Apple’s iPhone event in September. The new MacBook Pro is reportedly thinner than the current generation laptop and will, as earlier reports also indicated, feature an OLED bar above the keyboard (refer to concept above) that can be customized with software. You might have music controls in one instance, for example, and quick launch icons for your favorite apps in another. There’s also a Touch ID fingerprint scanner “beside the new function key display,” Bloomberg explained. That will allow folks to unlock their laptop similarly to how one accesses an iPhone – and Touch ID would open the laptop to other functions, like Apple Pay in apps and the Web browser. Apple is reportedly going to offer AMD Polaris discrete graphics, a change from its NVIDIA offering it seems, with Intel the presumed partner for the CPU. Bloomberg said Apple “considered” colors for the laptop, instead of launching it in a simple silver offering, but there’s no confirmation that a selection will be available at launch. Apple apparently won’t show the new laptop on September 7, when it’s expected to announce the new iPhones. That’s bad news for folks who have been waiting for the new computer. Perhaps in time for the holidays?

Welcome to Mossberg, a weekly commentary and reviews column on The Verge and Recode by veteran tech journalist Walt Mossberg, now an Executive Editor at The Verge and Editor at Large of Recode. When the iPad came out in 2010, I wrote that it might upend the laptop if it could perform enough of the scenarios a user performed on his or her laptop, using its modern, full-screen, touch-centric software. For me, personally, it performed quite a few, and I used my laptop less and less. Years later — last November — when Apple came out with the original, huge, 13-inch iPad Pro, complete with snap-on keyboard (a move that followed Microsoft’s lead), the promise was tantalizing that it might totally replace the need for a laptop. But after reviewing it, I felt it had missed the mark for three reasons. First, I found its size too big and bulky for holding while reading or watching video. Second, though Apple’s huge library of tablet apps worked well on standard-sized iPads, there wasn’t much that made use of the ginormous screen. But the most important reason I couldn't replace my laptop with an iPad was the keyboard. I disliked Apple’s keyboard, which has a flat-feeling simulated key travel and lacks backlighting and dedicated feature-control keys for the iPad. The reason I couldn't replace my laptop with an iPad was the keyboard Apple managed to overcome my first two objections with a smaller, standard 9.7-inch version of the Pro released in March. It even surpassed its big sibling in a few areas, including the screen and cameras. But it still had the same Apple keyboard, only now more cramped. So I upgraded, and waited for somebody to release a really nice 9.7-inch snap-on keyboard (as opposed to the many Bluetooth keyboards that require pairing and charging). Logitech to the rescue Now somebody has, and this new snap-on keyboard is (in my view) not only better than Apple’s, but it completes the smaller iPad Pro as a great productivity device. In fact, I’m writing this entire column using it. It’s from Logitech and it’s called the Create 9.7. It costs $130, which is $19 less than Apple’s Smart Keyboard for the 9.7-inch iPad. Here are some of the things the Logitech Create has that the Apple keyboard lacks: Real, movable keys that I find comfortable and accurate for typing Backlighting A row of small but usable shortcut keys that do things like trigger the home button; lock the iPad; initiate a search; and control brightness, volume, and media playback. There’s also a key, missing on the Apple model, that calls up the software keyboard anytime you like. A holder for the optional $99 Apple Pencil, an accessory that’s one of the best things about the iPad Pros, but which is costly to lose. On top of all this, the Create, like the Apple keyboard, has some Mac keys, like command, option, control, and tab, which are useful for keyboard shortcuts. Logitech made a larger version of the Create for the jumbo iPad Pro last year, and I briefly mentioned it in my review. But it lacked the Pencil holder. So, as with the iPad Pro itself, the smaller version is actually improved in some ways. What I did on my iPad Pro In addition to writing this column (in Google Docs), I used the iPad Pro and the Logitech Create to quickly compose emails, texts, tweets, Facebook posts, and Slack messages — sometimes in full-screen mode and sometimes in multi-app mode. I read The Verge and Recode and used the web browser for many things. I began the gripping new Daniel Silva novel in the Kindle app. I watched YouTube videos. I listened to Paul Simon and Linda Ronstadt through the Pro’s fabulous four speakers. And much more. I used it pretty much in every way like a laptop. I actually found typing to be just as fast as on my larger MacBook Air. This is partly because, even though you’re using a physical keyboard, you still get the iPad’s real-time auto-correct suggestions and shortcuts like hitting the spacebar twice for a period. Obviously, there are some people who will prefer to, or have to, do some things on a full laptop. Some people need desktop software, not iOS apps. There are some who simply couldn’t abide a keyboard this small. But, for me at least, this is the first time I could see just not using the laptop at all. (I rarely use my laptop’s ports anymore. You may be different.) The inevitable downsides Any attachable keyboard is going to make a tablet heavier and thicker. The Create adds more weight and height than the Apple keyboard, mostly because, when closed, it’s a full wraparound case — whereas the Apple is just a cover with a bump in it to accommodate its keyboard. But I found the weight — still under two pounds — to be an acceptable tradeoff for the nice keyboard. It’s still lighter than the MacBook, Apple’s littlest laptop, but with a keyboard I prefer. The thickness, created by the Logitech’s stiff, wraparound case design, took longer to get used to, but plenty of people use thick iPad cases. Like the Apple case, the Logitech Create has only a single angle for use when typing on its keyboard. You snap the iPad into the underside of the top of the case, and then, when you open the case, the tablet pivots smoothly and quickly into a single slot above the keys which contains the electronic connecting pins. When you’re done typing, you close the case and the iPad remains firmly ensconced inside the lid, but no longer connected to the keyboard. I found the process better than on the Apple keyboard, but there’s still only that one slot for a screen angle while typing. It didn’t bother me. The Logitech Create has only a single angle for typing The Create also has only one horizontal position for drawing or reading. In this mode, the screen faces up at a slight angle, atop the keyboard. I found it worked well. But it’s missing a vertical, movie-watching or presentation position that hides the keyboard, which the Apple keyboard does include. It took me the longest to get used to just consuming content while holding the encased iPad Pro, because you’re essentially using that folded, horizontal mode, and it’s thick. I got used to it, but I could also have merely snapped the iPad out of the case altogether for such times. Also, just like on Microsoft’s Surface tablets (even with their kickstands), this combination works better for typing on a desk than on a lap, because the upright screen is heavier than the horizontal base. In some cases, it even flops a bit. Much depends on the angle at which you're sitting. That's why I like being able to summon the software keyboard at will; you get to choose. Bottom Line Between the right-sized iPad Pro and the new Logitech Create, I think using an iPad instead of your laptop for productivity as well as consumption is finally a pleasure. If you can afford the price, and love the iPad, the solution is now out there, at Logitech.com, Apple.com, and Amazon. I love a good gadget.

Apple usually releases its iOS public beta versions one day after the latest beta is seeded to developers. On Monday, iOS 10 beta 5 came out and now early on Tuesday morning, Apple made iOS 10 public beta 4 available to all users currently registered in the company’s public beta program. DON’T MISS: Google’s new Nexus phones will be just as fast as the Galaxy Note 7 iOS 10 public beta 4 offers the exact same features as iOS 10 beta 5, even if the numbers don’t coincide. Installing it is quite simple. If you’re already on the public beta release of iOS 10, just head to the Settings app, and go to Software Update under General. The update should appear on your iOS device’s screen just like any other regular update. Then you can simply follow the steps on the screen to install it. If you’re not enrolled in the public beta, you need to get access by going to beta.apple.com and signing up with your Apple ID. Then download the profile on your iPhone or iPad by following the instructions on the screen, and go to Settings again to find your iOS 10 public beta 4 update. On an iPhone 6s, the update measures less than 300MB so it’ll be a quick download. Just make sure your device is connected to a wireless network and has more than 50% battery life to perform the over-the-air update. At any time during the public beta period, you can revert to the latest version of iOS 9.3.x if you’re not happy with it. The final version of iOS 10 should be released at some point in September after Apple unveils the iPhone 7.

However, things may change later this year when Apple launches its 2016 MacBook Pro series. Detailing the alleged new features of the new laptops, a report casually mentions that some models will pack high-end Polaris graphics cards, which have been built to offer gamers cheap access to VR, at least on desktops. DON’T MISS: This has to be the prettiest poster ever designed on an iPad That said, it’s not clear what type of AMD Polaris graphics card will be found in the new MacBook Pro. “Apple is using one of AMD’s ‘Polaris graphics chips because the design offers the power efficiency and thinness necessary to fit inside the slimmer Apple notebook,” Bloomberg noted in a new report. The “high-performance graphics chip” from AMD will equip only one version of the upcoming MacBook Pro, the report says, suggesting that Apple will stick to its policy of only using more powerful graphics cards in some of its MacBook Pros. It’s unclear what company will provide the processor for the new MacBook, with Intel being Apple’s choice for previous models. Bloomberg did not only focus on the chips and graphics cards of the upcoming MacBook Pro. According to the report, Apple is preparing the most significant overhaul to the laptop line in over four years. The 2016 MacBook Pro should be thinner than existing models, but they won’t be tapered like the MacBook Air and Retina MacBook. Even so, they will have a smaller footprint and the case will have shallower curves around the edges. The pressure-sensitive trackpad is slightly wider, and a secondary, likely OLED-based screen will replace the function key row on the keyboard. The new touchscreen is supposed to offer users fast access to context-aware shortcuts. Depending on the app on the screen, the secondary display will show shortcuts that fit the task at hand, such as media playing controls or shortcuts to some of the most frequent actions inside an app, like copy and paste. The new design also includes USB-C ports, and Apple may launch the MacBook Pros in iPhone colors, including gray, gold and silver. A fingerprint sensor will also be found on the new MacBook Pros, and will likely borrow the Touch ID features on the iPhone. Users will be able to unlock the laptop with their fingerprints and authenticate Apple Pay purchases online. The new computers have been in “advanced testing” inside Apple since earlier this year, and should be unveiled during a press event later this year — but not the iPhone keynote that’s reportedly scheduled for September 7th.

As if having your iPhone stolen wasn't bad enough, the hackers are tricking phone theft victims into giving up their Apple ID credentials, giving them access to their personal data. iPhone users are being hit by a very convincing phishing scam (Photo: PA) Many Apple users have reported being tricked by the hack online, including one unlucky man Joonas Kiminki, who detailed just how convincing the phishing scam can be over at Hackernoon. After having his iPhone stolen out of his car while on holiday, Kiminki did the obvious thing: used his wife's phone to call his own. But, as expected, it was turned off. He then marked the phone as "lost" in the Find my iPhone app, which informs users if a phone has been found. He entered a text to display on the phone in case it was ever turned on again, and clicked all the “send me email when the phone returns online” checkboxes. The Find My iPhone app helps users locate lost iOS devices (Photo: Apple) Read More iPhone users in the UK targeted by (another) iCloud phishing scam - don't be fooled by phony message "Nobody could access my data on the phone and since it’s connected to my iCloud account, others can’t reactivate the phone for themselves," he said. “I later bought a new phone, but then yesterday  -  eleven days after the phone was stolen  -  the most interesting thing happened: I got an SMS and an email notifying that the phone was found!” The authentic-looking fake iCloud login with unencrypted web address (Photo: Hackermoon) The SMS and email both contained a link for Kiminki to click, to show him the location of his lost iPhone. The link brought up an authentic-looking iCloud login screen. “I of course rushed to the address on the link and then started typing my credentials, but then suddenly stopped. Something was just not right,” he said He explained that - because he works for a website building company - he was able to spot the telltale signs of a hack that the average person may not. “I'm pretty sure many people would have just punched in their Apple ID and password and only then wondered why the login doesn't work,” he added. The script behind the fake iCloud login shows it's not really from Apple Because he was able to spot that the email and SMS weren't authentic, he managed to escape having his credentials stolen too. So what were the telltale factors of this so called phishing attack? Firstly, the link took Kiminki to a website with the address "show-iphone-location.com" - not very official sounding. It also wasn’t encrypted like a genuine Apple page would be. Digging deeper, Kiminki noticed that the email was not from Apple, either, but from icloud.insideappleusa@gmail.com, which is not registered to Apple, but a company in Nassau. Read More Hacker creates fake boarding pass app to blag his way into swanky airport lounges “You can’t activate an iPhone, or any iOS device for that matter, as long as it’s connected to someone’s iCloud account,” Kiminki said "However, when you steal a phone, you can perfect the crime by stealing the poor b******’s identity as well." The hackers then just need to log on to Find my iPhone, decouple the account from the device, and boom - they have an unlocked phone. hackers are able to exploit the Find my Phone app as the feature does not use two-step verification (Photo: Getty) This isn’t a completely new idea - there have been several cases of this scam being used against users. A similar attack was posted by a user on Reddit back in April . Security expert Graham Cluley said that hackers are able to exploit the Find my Phone app because, unlike iCloud, the feature does not use two-step verification to double check those accessing the service are genuine. Commenting on the same hack used on a computer science graduate student at the University of Waterloo , Cluley said: "If there had been another login step, such as a secret security question, the attacker would not have been able to have almost wiped his devices. “Users should protect their Apple IDs as well as all of their web accounts with a strong password and with two-step verification, if and when available.” Read More 'Cyber criminals emptied £900 from my account to fund spending spree on Amazon and Harrods,' reveals student victim The security industry is hoping Apple will introduce two-step verification for the Find My iPhone feature now that several of these phishing attacks have been reported online. Despite the very locked-down nature of its software, the tech giant is finally starting to realise it is not immune to cyber security vulnerabilities. Last week, the firm agreed to give security researchers access to its software for the first time. The company is now offering $200,000 (£152,000) bug bounties – an incentive programme which offers rewards for discovering and submitting security holes and weaknesses. Fellow tech firms such as Google and Microsoft have been offering such rewards to bolster their level of security online for some time now. Although, perhaps to make up for lost time, Apple's lump sum seems to be the highest corporate bounty ever. poll loading Do you trust Apple's Find My iPhone feature? 0+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @MirrorTech Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On Reddit Apple Microsoft Google Silicon Valley PLC University of Waterloo Apps iOS iPhone Mobile phones Smartphones tech all Most Read Most Recent TechnologyThousands of women confess to wanting virtual reality SEX as techy toys become mainstream Over two thousand British women have given their thoughts on the ways technology will improve their sexual fulfillment Black FridayBest tech Black Friday deals 2016: Our pick of the top UK offers on gadgets, gaming and consumer electronics Black Friday takes place on November 25 - here are some of this year's best tech bargains Black FridayWhere to find the best Playstation deals online on Black Friday 2016 Have you got your eye on anything in particular for Black Friday?

Apple on Tuesday rejected allegations from Russia's state competition watchdog it may have been involved in fixing prices for iPhones, saying resellers set their own prices. Apple reacted a day after Russia's Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS) said it had opened a case into the allegations after a consumer had pointed out that identical prices had been set for iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus models, which appeared in Russia in October 2015, at 16 major resellers. Apple, in e-mailed comments, said it did not oblige Russian resellers to fix prices for its products. "Resellers set their own prices for the Apple products they sell in Russia and around the world," the company's press office said. FAS said it was looking into the idea that Apple had somehow obliged Russian resellers to treat its recommended product prices as mandatory. It said an investigation had shown retailers had set identical prices and kept them at that level for a certain time period, including for other models. FAS has the power to fine firms it finds guilty of price-fixing. Related stories: Apple sells more iPhones than expected Judge voids VirnetX's $625.6m Apple verdict Copyright 2016 Reuters Limited.

X Apple planning first Pro laptop overhaul in four years Updated MacBook Pro will be thinner and more powerful and have touch-screen strip Wed, Aug 10, 2016, 13:23 Updated: Wed, Aug 10, 2016, 13:24 Apple is planning to bring over its Touch ID fingerprint technology from the iPhone to the new MacBook Pro line.         Apple is preparing the first significant overhaul of its MacBook Pro laptop line in more than four years, using one of its older products to help reverse two quarters of sliding sales. According to sources, the updated notebooks will be thinner, include a touch-screen strip for function keys, and will be offered with more powerful and efficient graphics processors for expert users such as video gamers. The new computers have been in advanced testing within Apple since earlier this year. The MacBook Pros aren’t likely to debut at an event currently scheduled for September 7th to introduce next-generation versions of the iPhone, according to the sources. Apple spokesman Bill Evans declined to comment. Resilience Apple co-founder Steve Jobs heralded tablets as possible laptop replacements by calling the iPad a”post-PC” device after it launched in 2010, but products such as the MacBook Pro have shown surprising resilience. Sales of Macs, including the Pro line, rose 6 per cent to $25.5 billion in the last fiscal year, while iPad sales fell 23 per cent to $23.2 billion. This year’s MacBook Pro overhaul is aimed at increasing notebook sales at a time when consumers are taking longer to buy or replace iPads. Apple research suggests customers upgrade iPads roughly every three years, while they buy new iPhones every 18 to 24 months, according to a person familiar with Apple’s strategy, which helps explain why iPad sales numbers have fallen from a peak in 2013. Secondary display The most significant addition to the new MacBook Pro is a secondary display above the keyboard that replaces the standard function key row. Instead of physical keys, a strip-like screen will present functions on an as-needed basis that fit the current task or application. The smaller display will use organic light-emitting diodes, a thinner, lighter and sharper screen technology, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said earlier this year. ADVERTISEMENT Apple’s goal with the dedicated function display is to simplify keyboard shortcuts traditionally used by experienced users. The panel will theoretically display media playback controls when iTunes is open, while it could display editing commands like cut and paste during word-processing tasks, the people said. The display also allows Apple to add new buttons via software updates rather than through more expensive, slower hardware refreshes.The new top-of-the-line MacBook Pros will be slightly thinner than the current models but are not tapered like the MacBook Air and latest 12-inch MacBook, one of the people said. Smaller footprint The new MacBook Pros have a smaller footprint than current models and the casing has shallower curves around the edges. The pressure-sensitive trackpad is also slightly wider, the person added. An option for a version featuring a higher-performance graphics chip from Advanced Micro Devices will be available, according to other sources. It’s unclear which provider Apple will use for the main processor, but Intel has supplied this in the past.Apple is using one of AMD’s Polaris graphics chips because the design offers the power, efficiency and thinness necessary to fit inside the slimmer Apple notebook, the person said. The new graphics card is more than 20 per cent thinner than its predecessor, AMD said earlier this year. AMD declined to comment, referring inquiries to Apple.The new design will include USB-C technology, a multifunctional type of port that can handle charging, data transfers and display connectivity, one of the people said. Apple has also considered bringing grey, gold, and silver colours to the new line, as it has done with other products such as the iPhone, iPad and the 12-inch MacBook. It’s unclear whether coloured Pro laptops will be available when the new line is released. Fingerprint scanners Apple is planning to bring over its Touch ID fingerprint technology from the iPhone to the new MacBook Pro line. Apple has tested versions of the forthcoming laptops that integrate the scanner beside the new function key display, according to one of the people.

Black and white wallpapers for macOS and iOS   skip to main content skip to main menu     DigiTimes: TSMC to build 16nm Apple Watch 2 chip By Christian Zibreg, Aug 10, 2016 Tweet 6 Comments An Apple-designed ‘S2’ system-in-package that will power a second-generation Apple Watch won’t be produced by Samsung, like the original Apple Watch’s S1 chip. According to a new report by Taiwanese trade publication DigiTimes, semiconductor foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has managed to beat Samsung in securing S2 orders. In fact, both the second-generation Apple Watch and an enhanced version of the original Apple Watch will be driven by the S2 chip, built using TSMC’s 16-nanometer process technology. “TSMC will replace Samsung as the sole supplier of chips for the new Apple Watch starting the second half of 2016,” wrote DigiTimes, citing a report by Taiwan’s Central News Agency (CNA). The current S1 package that powers the Apple Watch is being built on Samsung’s 28-nanometer process technology. Producing the forthcoming S2 chip on TSMC’s more advanced 16-nanometer process will result in smaller transistors, thereby helping reduce the size of the chip, improve processing speed and make the wearable device more power efficient. The news came hot on the heels of a KGI Securities analysis by Ming-Chi Kuo, who believes there will be two models of Apple Watch slated for launch in the second half of 2016, with Samsung joining LG Display as a provider of AMOLED panels for the device in the second half of 2016. The analyst also predicted that iPhone manufacturer Foxconn will enter the supply chain for the Apple Watch starting 2017, joining existing supplier Quanta Computer.

Patent reveals plans for a bizarre bendy vehicle with giant treads Patent was granted to BAE Systems with Apple as the assignee It shows plans for an articulated vehicle which runs on tracks Plans show a vehicle resembling a cross between a tank and a bendy bus The vehicle is close to an all-terrain model already used by BAE   By Ryan O'Hare for MailOnline Published: 08:12 EST, 10 August 2016 | Updated: 08:14 EST, 10 August 2016 e-mail 39 shares 20 View comments A slew of patent applications granted in the US have revealed Apple may be planning a fleet of vehicles. Sketches filed with the patent show plans for an articulated vehicle, with two sections joined in the middle, running on tracks. Initial impressions point to something resembling a cross between a bendy bus and a tank. Sketches filed with a patent awarded to Apple Inc and BAE Systems show plans for an articulated vehicle, running on tank tracks (pictured) APPLE'S VEHICLE PLANS  The vehicle plans came in a batch of 80 patents granted to Apple this week. Drawings show an articulated vehicle which runs on tracks, resembling a cross between a bendy bus and a tank. But the patent could apply to future generations of a vehicle already made by BAE Systems. The patent application, granted earlier this week to Apple Inc and defence firm BAE Systems, shows plans for a steering device for two parts of a vehicle. It remains unclear as to what the final vehicle could look like, but one of BAE’s existing vehicles, the BvS10 uses a similar design. The BvS10 has an articulated two-part vehicle which moves on tracks. On its website, in a description under footage of the vehicle in action, the firm describes it as a ‘proven workhorse’.

Share this article Share 39 shares It remains unclear as to what the final vehicle could look like, but one of BAE Systems’ existing vehicles uses a similar design, with an articulated two-part vehicle which moves on tracks like a tank (stock image used) It adds: ‘The family of BvS10 variants are all capable of rapidly traversing terrain that would hinder other all-terrain vehicles.’ Commenting on the patent design, website Patently Apple said it is proof that Apple has an automotive division which could use such a design. But despite the military connection, it won’t necessarily mean cities around the world are likely to see fleets of tanks emblazoned with the Apple logo roaring down their streets any time soon. The patent application, granted earlier this week to Apple Inc and defence firm BAE Systems, shows plans for a steering device for two parts of a vehicle, like a bendy bus (pictured) Instead, the patented technology could provide a single element for a larger automotive project, such as automated vehicles. Previous patent applications have hinted at plans for an iCar, with novel charging technologies, as well as using an iPhone as a key to unlock a vehicle. As with all Apple patents, it is unclear at this early stage where the development might be at, or if it the technology will make it to a final working product.

(AP Photo/Christian Palma) Share Written by Anne Quito Obsession Design August 10, 2016 Design is a buzz word. It’s a catchy, quixotic and powerful strategy tangled with technology, marketing, branding and innovation jargon that few grasp. But now you can: More than 100 world-famous design experts have put together the essential Design 101 reading list, useful for anyone who want to school themselves about design. On Aug. 4, designers and theorists from Dieter Rams to Calvin Klein, put their names behind an amicus curiae (pdf) expert brief in support of Apple in its multi-million dollar Supreme Court patent battle against Samsung. The 36-page illustrated document is full of notes about design history, cognitive psychology and marketing principles. It also contains a fascinating and extensive reading list. Authored by Industrial Designers Society of America member Charles Mauro, and created to defend the Apple’s now-iconic iPhone design, the list tends to focus on consumer products like cars, computers, and Coca-Cola bottle. But it also contains some classics, like Siegfried Giedion’s thrilling 1948 historical exegesis of mechanization’s effect on daily life, Don Norman on the emotional power of design, and steam locomotive designer Raymond Loewy’s interrogation of American car design (published in the Atlantic magazine in 1955).

Apple's changing things up and continuing its long war on that most humble gadget component: the button. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, who has an excellent track record when it comes to iPhone leaks, reports that the new gadget will have a much different home button. Per the article: "[The] new models will have a pressure-sensitive button that provides feedback to the user via a vibrating haptic sensation rather than a true physical click, according to the people." In other words, it will look like a button and feel like a button but it won't actually, you know, be a button. Which, I have to admit, troubles me a little bit. Some of it is psychological. Physical buttons and switches feel direct and can make you feel as if you have more control. If your touch screen is unresponsive, you know you can hit the power button and the side button on an iPhone and reboot it.On a broader level, the revamped home button could make Apple devices harder to repair. Several Apple consumers complain about "planned obsolescence" - the idea that the firm makes things hard to repair so that it can make money on new hardware. It's a bit of a tinfoil-hat way to look at things. But with no button and no easy way to get into a phone, we're likely to see fewer ways for third-party businesses to be able to replace parts. And not being able to replace parts could, in effect, shorten a gadget's life span. Complicating the function of the home button has already had this negative effect for some Apple customers. In February, many people were upset that replacing Apple's home button made their phones inoperable. Apple said it was to ensure that no one tampered with the button's built-in security features. That's a sensible explanation. But it still means that users have to go to Apple with their repair problems, and possibly get their phone replaced, thanks to the complications of the home button. This only stands to get worse if the rumors are true. There are some general advantages, however, to ditching buttons, apart from aesthetics. One is that it leaves fewer places where outside debris such as sand, dirt, dust or water could get in and wreak havoc with your device. There's been a lot of pressure on Apple, for example, to make the iPhone more water-resistant. Fewer outside seams theoretically helps with that. And software buttons aren't all bad, either. We have seen Android manufacturers go further than what Apple is rumored to be doing with the next iPhone and using software-only buttons with no physical spot on the phone to make screens bigger and free up screen space. The home, back and options buttons are on a bar that hides at the bottom of the screen when not in use. Apple has shown that it can design for software buttons with its pressure-sensitive Force Touch on the new MacBook and the iPhone's 3D Touch. That technology means Apple can offer more than one dimension of function even with a flat screen. In fact, the options with those technologies go far beyond what a single button could ever do. If it's executed well and doesn't react every time something brushes against it - I'm looking at you, Xbox One power button - it's unlikely to detract much from the experience. In fact, I only ever remember that my MacBook trackpad doesn't click when my computer's off. (Or, you know, when I'm writing an entire column about buttons.) We all seemed to get used to losing the physical "call" and "end" buttons, or the physical snap of hanging up a flip phone. Given what's rumored from Apple, this will be a far smaller compromise of physical sensation than that. But we may miss the button in other ways. © 2016 The Washington Post Tags: Apple, Force Touch, Mobiles, iPhone 7, iPhones Meizu M3E With 5.5-Inch Display, MediaTek Helio P10 SoC Launched Twitter to Expand Reach of Its Moments Feature to All Users A Pressing Concern About the Next iPhone     Advertisement   In Mobiles and Tablets Latest Ziox Mobiles Zelfie Intex Aqua E4 HTC Desire 650 Panasonic Eluga Mark 2 HTC 10 evo Ziox Mobiles Astra Prism Ziox Mobiles Astra Zing+ Huawei Mate 9 Lite Vivo Xplay6 Vivo X9 Plus Vivo X9 Lyf Wind 7i OnePlus 3T Gionee S9 Vivo V5 Huawei Mate 9 Pro HTC Bolt Hyve Pryme Panasonic P71 Zopo Color F2 Popular iPhone 7 Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Motorola Moto Z Moto Z Play Lenovo K5 Note Xiaomi Redmi 3s HTC 10 OnePlus 3 Moto G4 Xiaomi Mi5 Galaxy J7 2016 Redmi Note 3 iPhone SE Sony Xperia Z5 Micromax phones Samsung phones Android Phones Smartphones Google Phones From Gadgets 360 Shop » Yu Yureka Plus In Mobiles Buy Now Rs. 12,500Rs. 6,389 Celkon Millennia Q599 Ufe...

This was set to have a dual-lens camera and a Smart Connector, but according to the latest leaks it's now been scrapped. Or rather the iPhone 7 Pro name has been scrapped, as according to a source speaking to Nikkei: "Initially, Apple had planned two versions of iPhone 7 Plus, one with a single lens and one with a dual lens. The single lens edition has since been ditched." So it sounds like we might still get the phone that was going to be called the iPhone 7 Pro, but that it will be taking the place of the iPhone 7 Plus. Apparently the decision to ditch the third model is down to weaker than expected sales for the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus in the face of competition from the likes of Samsung and Huawei. Glass half full But the 'Pro' name might be brought back in 2017, with the iPhone 7S Pro, or whatever Apple ends up calling it, complete with a glass casing, which Foxconn (a major manufacturing partner for Apple) has supposedly been working on for a year. It's long been rumored that Apple will be heavily redesigning the iPhone in 2017 for its ten year anniversary and a glass casing would certainly be a big change. It's also one we've heard before, but may only be coming to one of Apple's 2017 handsets, so the iPhone 7S Pro would be the obvious choice, allowing it to truly stand out from the rest of the range. It also ties into rumors that the entire front of a future iPhone will be glass, with the Touch ID sensor embedded into the display, which would make for an even bigger change. Alongside a glass case it's previously been rumored that the iPhone 7S will switch from an LCD to an OLED screen. That could lead to a brighter display with better contrast, comparable to what you'll see on Samsung phones like the Galaxy Note 7. If Apple really does have all this planned then you might want to think twice about upgrading this September, but for now it's just rumors and with more than a year to go before we see this glass phone anything could happen, even if it's currently in the works. The apparent last minute cancellation of the iPhone 7 Pro is proof of that.

However, the top-of-the-range Pro could be delayed until next year, according to a new report. Nikkei says that its sources say that Apple is changing its plans completely. It writes, "Initially, Apple had planned two versions of iPhone 7 Plus, one with a single lens and one with a dual lens. The single lens edition has since been ditched." Apparently, it is being scrapped because of weaker than expected sales of the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, mainly due to increased competition from Samsung and Huawei. The dual-lens camera device was rumoured to be called the Pro, but it looks like it’ll simply bear the Plus moniker instead. The Pro name will reportedly be used in 2017 for a device with a glass casing and the Touch ID sensor embedded into the display.

(Photo : Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Iphone 7 leaked images show that the device will indeed come in a new Space Black variant, confirming previous rumors. The black chassis, SIM tray and mute button are markedly darker than the Space Grey variant of the iPhone 6s. Advertisement The component depicted in the leaked images shows roughly the right shape and the red line matches the current design: however, the exact source of the new images is unknown, 9to5Mac reported. It is also unclear whether Apple will be releasing the Space Black iPhone 7 as an addition to its iPhone 7 variants or will it be a replacement for the Space Grey lineup. The new black version mirrors the Space Black option for Apple Watch. The new color option may pose a huge factor in driving iPhone 7 sales as Other rumors are pointed at a more iterative hardware update. Apple is reportedly breaking its usual tick-tock upgrade cycle by retaining the same external design for three years in a row. The iPhone 7 is suggested to look like the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6 in chassis. Some models of the iPhone 7 are expected to feature a dual-camera system, which will include two image sensors for substantially better quality photos. Previous leaks revealed that this feature will only be limited to specific versions of the 5.5 inch iPhone 7 Plus. However, it has also been suggested that a larger and improved camera will be integrated for the 4.7 inch iPhone 7. Advertisement Other specs of the Iphone 7 include a waterproof body which is a first for the iPhone lineup, graphics improvement and compute performance with a new SoC likely dubbed as A10. Moreover, it has been confirmed that Apple will drop the 16GB storage capacity and instead, will start with a 32GB. This will also add a higher-end 256GB SKU, The Next Web reported. iPhone 7 is expected to be released sometime in Sept. 16. Apple will announce the new device at a media event about two weeks earlier, which is around Sept. 7.

Share Tweet Share Tags : iOS-iOS+ Apple-Apple+ For months now, we've been hearing conflicting reports over how many iPhone 7 (or 2016 iPhone) variants we should expect. Some leaksters say two, while others swear by the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and iPhone 7 Pro rumors. Allegedly, the iPhone 7 Plus is supposed to be simply a larger version of the regular-sized one, like we've seen Apple do in the past 2 years, while the iPhone 7 Pro is the one that would pack that juicy dual camera module we've seen leaked so often. However, some new information by tech media Nikkei Asian Report may shed some light on what's up with this year's iPhone variants. According to the post in question, Apple did, indeed, plan to release three heavy-hitting iPhone 7 models, as was leaked so many times. However, dwindling growth and shaky sales made Cupertinians reconsider. For the second fiscal quarter of 2016, the company reported a drop in sales year-over-year for the first time in the iPhone's history, though, they were back up and soaring in Q3. Apparently, the slight dip still made the company cancel plans of further diversifying its portfolio, at least for now. So, what happens with the dual camera model now? According to the report, Apple scrapped the iPhone 7 Plus, suggesting that this year's phablet will, indeed, be the iPhone 7 Pro — the one with the two sensors on the back. Of course, it may also be renamed to Plus in order to retain consistency with the naming schemes from the past couple of years. Of course, considering how secretive Apple is, we still wouldn't be quick to believe this information is 100% accurate. There's still a month to go before we see the official announcement, and then we will know for sure. iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and iPhone 7 Pro dummy units revealed in new video 06 Aug 2016 Will Apple really release three iPhone 7 models this year?

It's the only thing I'm looking forward to in the new iPhone. Apart from that, it's a disappointment. posted on 10 Aug 2016, 08:18 0 in response to #7 in response to #7 Hide Reply 15. sgodsell (Posts: 3843; Member since: 16 Mar 2013) Apple had to scrap the iPhone pro, because if it was the same size as the plus model, then why couldn't they have added what ever is in the pro model to the plus model. Also how much more would it cost consumers over the current plus model? If the plus is a $100 more, then would the pro be another $100 or more on top of the plus model. Not to mention what would they add to make people spend much more over the plus version? Basically it would be another avenue for Apple to gouge it's customer base. posted on 10 Aug 2016, 08:20 0 in response to #7 in response to #7 Hide Reply 17. nctx77 (Posts: 2092; Member since: 03 Sep 2013) Totally agree!! posted on 10 Aug 2016, 08:25 2 Reply 21.

FBIsurveilance (Posts: 42; Member since: 10 Aug 2014) Apple's going to sick big time if they dropped the Pro model. Note7 is having a big pre-order moment and there is a genuine excitement over the new phablet. Hell, this year's iPhone is recycling the design. Most apple user base cares little if anything changes in the inside and the missing 3.5mm port is a downgrade if we can call it what it really is. They need a dual camera iPhone 7pro to remain relevant now! posted on 10 Aug 2016, 07:14 7 Reply 2. abdoualgeria (Posts: 455; Member since: 27 Jul 2015) Ugly 3 years old sheap design Shame. posted on 10 Aug 2016, 07:28 0 Reply 8.

And we don't know what the s8 will look like because Samsung is going to curved displays. posted on 10 Aug 2016, 14:42 0 Reply 40. TechieXP1969 (Posts: 10555; Member since: 25 Sep 2013) Dual glass? Yes. Will it look exactly like the S7? No! The S7 doesn't look exactly like the S6. The iPhone 7 looks 99.9% identical. All that has changed on the outside is where the bands are and the larger lenses of the camera and missing headphone jack. But if I blindfold you, you cant tell the iPhone 6's or 7's apart with just a touch. But I bet anyone can tell the S6 and S7 apart. posted on 10 Aug 2016, 07:15 1 Reply 3.

The results appear to confirm previous reports, which claim the 5.5-inch smartphone will include 3 GB of RAM.  ( TechTastic ) Advertisement Leading up to its September launch, Apple has watched details about its upcoming iPhones leak on a daily basis. The latest comes in the form of what is reportedly the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus/Pro showing some of its specs on Geekbench. Samsung has seen strong interest in its latest Galaxy Note smartphone, the just introduced Galaxy Note 7. The company has reportedly broken preorder records in its home country of South Korea with over 200,000 Galaxy Note 7 smartphones preordered in two days, which doubles the 100,000 preorders it received for the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge. The Galaxy Note 7 will get a head start on what is sure to be its biggest rival, Apple's iPhone 7 Plus/Pro. While the Galaxy Note 7 rocks a 5.7-inch Quad HD display, the iPhone 7 Plus/Pro will ship with a 5.5-inch Full HD display. Unlike Samsung's Galaxy Note 7, which features a fresher design than that of its predecessors, Apple is using a design that virtually mirrors the design of 2014's iPhone 6/iPhone 6 Plus, and last year's iPhone 6s/iPhone 6s Plus. The company is planning to make a few small tweaks and one of them is sure to frustrate users. When Apple unveiled the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in September 2014, many people complained about how the vertical antenna bands on the rear of the smartphones took away from Apple's typical minimalist look. The following year, it received similar criticism with the antenna bands once again gracing the back of the devices. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus/Pro will have visible rear antenna bands, but they have been placed at the top and bottom of the handsets, leaving its back free of vertical lines. One feature or lack thereof will likely dominate headlines after Apple officially unveils the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus/Pro at its rumored Sept. 6 press event. The handsets will be the first iPhones to ship without a standard 3.5mm headphone port, which will require users to use the Lightning EarPods expected to be in the box, their favorite headphones and a special Lightning to 3.5mm adapter, or wireless headphones. A new report appears to reveal that the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus/Pro will also differ from each other in two key areas; cameras and RAM. The iPhone 7 Plus/Pro is widely believed to employ a high end dual-lens rear camera, while the iPhone 7 will sport a single lens rear shooter. In May, the larger iPhone was reported to include 3 GB of RAM in order to handle the image processing required by the dual cameras and reports also claimed the iPhone 7 would ship with 2 GB of RAM. If a screenshot of what is reportedly the iPhone 7 Plus/Pro is to be believed, the 5.5-inch smartphone will indeed pack in 3 GB of RAM. The image is supposedly a screenshot of the iPhone 7 Plus/Pro on Geekbench. It's listed as iPhone 9,2 and is running iOS 10. The benchmark shows its A10 processor is a 2.37GHz dual-core chip and includes 3 GB of RAM. The smartphone received a single-core score of 3548 and multi-core score of 6430, which outpaces the iPhone 6s Plus, with its 2531 single-core score and its 4404 multi-core score. As always it's best to take iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus/Pro reports with a grain of salt, but thankfully all will be revealed in a few weeks.

More than just technology news Home Tech Reviews Science Games Culture Video Stay Connected Facebook Twitter RSS Updated Hot Tags Pokemon Go Pokemon Sun And Moon Apple Pokemon Sun And Moon news Pokemon Go Update iPhone 7 Plus Rumors False: 3GB Of Ram And A10 Chip Not Happening Benjie Batanes First Posted: Aug 10, 2016 04:50 AM EDT An Apple Inc. iPhone SE is displayed at the company's Omotesando store on March 31, 2016 in Tokyo, Japan. (Photo by Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images) New iPhone 7 rumors are circulating on the Internet. Unfortunately, some of them have been exposed as fakes. It seems reports that the upcoming Apple smartphone will have 3 GB of RAM and A10 chips are simply not true. Recently, an alleged iPhone 7 Geekbench result was published. The supposed test showed the upcoming iPhone model featuring 3 GB of RAM and a dual-core processor running at 2.37 GHz. However, John Poole, the head of Primate Labs declared that the Geekbench iPhone 7 tests are merely fabrications, according to Mac Rumors. The current iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s Plus only have 2 GB of RAM. However, numerous online postings insist that the upcoming iPhone 7 lines will feature and additional 1 GB of RAM. Ming-Chi Kuo, who works with KGI Securities, was one of the first to spread such claims. There have been doubts about the 3 GB RAM rumors, even though it is possible that the bigger iPhone 7s Plus can have such feature. But this is stille mere speculation at this point. The alleged performance of the A-10 chip in the upcoming iPhone 7 would have indicated its performance superiority over the current iPhone model. But since its single-core and double-core have been exposed as fakes, there is no way to know if the processor of the iPhone 7 is indeed more powerful than the iPhone 6S. The fake Geekbench report originated from Weibo which is a China-based microblog site. Most of the Apple product leaks originate from that country. This is because most Apple suppliers are from China who may have wittingly or unwittingly leak their products on the Internet. One rumor that seems certain right now is the absence of the 3.5 mm headphone jack port, according to Bloomberg. It is expected that Apple is about to announce the launch date of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus this September. Much of its specs and features have yet to be officially released, according to an earlier iTech Post report.

(Mark Lennihan) Print Email Troy L. Smith, Cleveland.com By Troy L. Smith, Cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Follow on Twitter on August 10, 2016 at 8:07 AM comments CLEVELAND, Ohio – Apple may gearing up to unveil its latest iPhone in a matter of weeks. But consumers are already bracing themselves for what may be the most advanced Apple product ever in 2017. Rumors about next month's iPhone suggest it may or may not be called the iPhone 7 (It could be the iPhone 6SE). It will also likely have a dual camera and lack a headphone port in favor of two speakers. If those seem like minor changes, it may be because Apple is holding back something big for next spring. According to Business Insider, that's when Apple will unveil an iPhone with an all glass body and edge-to-edge screen. Much of this is attributed to Apple suppliers who are developing all glass cases to match the 2017 phone's look. An all glass iPhone has long been rumored. This would explain why, despite Apple's iPhone sales dropping and the company's stock being down, CEO Tim Cook and his team have remained confident. An all glass iPhone would certainly skyrocket sales and silence critics in 2017.

By Mark Gurman. Added by Agency Staff on 10 August 2016. Saved under News, Top Tags: Apple, MacBook Pro Tweet Apple is preparing the first significant overhaul of its MacBook Pro laptop line in over four years, according to people familiar with the matter, using one of its older products to help reverse two quarters of sliding sales. The updated notebooks will be thinner, include a touch screen strip for function keys, and will be offered with more powerful and efficient graphics processors for expert users such as video gamers, said the people, who asked not to be named. The new computers have been in advanced testing within Apple since earlier this year, said one of the people, who didn’t want to be identified discussing products before their release. The MacBook Pros aren’t likely to debut at an event currently scheduled for 7 September to introduce next-generation versions of the iPhone, according to one of the people. Apple spokesman Bill Evans declined to comment. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs heralded tablets as possible laptop replacements by calling the iPad a “post-PC” device after it launched in 2010, but products like the MacBook Pro have shown surprising resilience. Sales of Macs, including the Pro line, rose by 6% to US$25,5bn in the last fiscal year, while iPad sales fell by 23% to $23,2bn. This year’s MacBook Pro overhaul is aimed at increasing notebook sales at a time when consumers are taking longer to buy or replace iPads. Apple research suggests customers upgrade iPads roughly every three years, while they buy new iPhones every 18 to 24 months, according to a person familiar with Apple’s strategy, which helps explain why iPad sales numbers have fallen from a peak in 2013. The most significant addition to the new MacBook Pro is a secondary display above the keyboard that replaces the standard function key row. Instead of physical keys, a strip-like screen will present functions on an as-needed basis that fit the current task or application. The smaller display will use organic light-emitting diodes, a thinner, lighter and sharper screen technology, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said earlier this year. Apple’s goal with the dedicated function display is to simplify keyboard shortcuts traditionally used by experienced users. The panel will theoretically display media playback controls when iTunes is open, while it could display editing commands like cut and paste during word processing tasks, the people said. The display also allows Apple to add new buttons via software updates rather than through more expensive, slower hardware refreshes. The new top-of-the-line MacBook Pros will be slightly thinner than the current models but are not tapered like the MacBook Air and latest 12-inch MacBook, one of the people said. The new MacBook Pros have a smaller footprint than current models and the casing has shallower curves around the edges. The pressure-sensitive trackpad is also slightly wider, the person added. An option for a version featuring a higher performance graphics chip from Advanced Micro Devices will be available, another person familiar with the matter said. It’s unclear which provider Apple will use for the main processor, but Intel has supplied this in the past. Apple is using one of AMD’s Polaris graphics chips because the design offers the power efficiency and thinness necessary to fit inside the slimmer Apple notebook, the person said. The new graphics card is more than 20% thinner than its predecessor, AMD said earlier this year. AMD declined to comment, referring inquiries to Apple. The new design will include USB-C technology, a multifunctional type of port that can handle charging, data transfers, and display connectivity, one of the people said. Apple has also considered bringing grey, gold and silver colours to the new line, as it has done with other products like the iPhone, iPad and the 12-inch MacBook, a person said. It’s unclear whether coloured Pro laptops will be available when the new line is released. Fingerprint scanners Apple is planning to bring over its Touch ID fingerprint technology from the iPhone to the new MacBook Pro line. Apple has tested versions of the upcoming laptops that integrate the scanner beside the new function key display, according to one of the people. The sensor would allow users to log in more quickly and theoretically authenticate Apple Pay purchases. Like with iPhones, the new Pro laptops will encrypt fingerprint data so it can’t be removed from the devices. Apple will also release a new version of its Mac operating system named Sierra this fall that brings Siri, new messaging and photo management features, deeper iCloud integration, and more efficient file storage to Apple’s desktops and laptops, the company said in June.  — (c) 2016 Bloomberg LP Reported with assistance from Ian King and Alex Webb Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 9Why SA Connect tender was cancelled 9Vodacom to launch VOD platform 7A radical proposal for state-owned fibre 5MTN’s Mteto Nyati takes the fight to No 1 5One day I will tell you the truth – Zuma Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

Sections Machines Discoveries Space Futures Gaming Earth Videos About en de es fr it nl pt The VICE Channels Share Tweet Motherboard Motherboard Watch Sections Machines Discoveries Space Futures Gaming Earth Latest Videos Documentaries Interviews Machines Discoveries Space Futures Gaming Earth Follow Motherboard Newsletter Image: Esther Purple/Shutterstock Zero-Day Hunters Will Pay Over Twice as Much as Apple’s New Bug Bounty Programme Written by Joseph Cox Contributor August 10, 2016 // 07:25 AM EST Copy This URL Last week, Apple finally joined other technology giants and announced a bug bounty programme, where hackers can submit details of previously unknown vulnerabilities in Apple systems and devices, and get paid for sharing them with the company. But Apple is not going to be without competition. On Wednesday, established bug-hunting company Exodus Intelligence launched its own new acquisition programme for both vulnerabilities and exploits. And when it comes to iOS bugs, the company is offering up to more than double Apple's maximum payout. While Apple's highest bounty is $200,000, Exodus is advertising a maximum of $500,000 for vulnerabilities affecting iOS 9.3 or above. Screenshot from Exodus Intelligence Exodus provides details of vulnerabilities and working exploits to customers who pay a subscription fee of around $200,000 per year, according to Time. Those customers could be on the defensive side—such as antivirus vendors who want to plug newly discovered holes—or part of an offensive team using the exploit to target systems themselves. On its site, Exodus emphasises the former, writing that it “works with the research community to find these attacks first and make them available to security vendors and enterprises, allowing them to deploy defenses before their adversaries can attack.” Traditionally, companies like Exodus pay more for vulnerabilities than the tech giants affected. Indeed, if that wasn’t the case, researchers looking for a payday may instead just inform Apple, which would then patch the vulnerability for everyone, making the attack lose its financial value. Those who submit their bugs to Exodus could receive extra cash on top of the lump sum for every quarter that the zero-day is still alive, and can be paid by check, wire transfer, Western Union, or Bitcoin, according to the website. It's not clear what sort of attack would warrant the $500,000 There are some differences between the Apple and Exodus programmes. Apple lists specific areas it is trying to cover, such as secure boot firmware, vulnerabilities that allow extraction of confidential material from the Secure Enclave (a special section of the device that stores, amongst other things, the user's fingerprint data), and execution of arbitrary code with kernel privileges (the kernel being the heart of the operating system). Exodus, meanwhile, doesn't point to any particular iOS targets, so it's not clear what sort of attack would warrant the $500,000. (Update: Logan Brown, president of Exodus Intelligence, told Motherboard in an email that the maximum $500,000 payout is awarded to a full chain of vulnerabilities that attain remote code execution and the ability to persist on the device. “We do require a reliable exploit for the purchase, so our programme differs from Apple, as they are interested in vulnerabilities in their security architecture, and do not require the exploit,” Brown added.) Last year, Zerodium, another vulnerability company, paid $1 million to a group of hackers who compromised a device using a number of issues in Chrome and iOS. That figure was a one-time offer, and Zerodium's bounty for an iOS exploit has since halved to $500,000 too. As well as the heftier maximum payouts, anyone can register on Exodus’s site to submit vulnerabilities, while Apple’s programme is by invitation-only, at least for the time being. Exodus publishing its price list is a sign of an emerging trend in the zero-day business. Previously a trade largely conducted in private, Exodus is now the second company to go public with its prices, after Zerodium. Exodus’s “current hitlist” also includes Google Chrome, Microsoft EDGE, and Firefox, and the company is also paying for exploits of already-known vulnerabilities.

In a three-page letter to the ACCC, Apple states that the banks’ application was made up of “factual and legal misstatements” and would “harm consumers, lead to less competition and less innovation, and create a troubling precedent” if granted. “Unfortunately, and based on their limited understanding of the offering, the applicants perceive Apple Pay as a competitive threat,” the company says. “These banks want to maintain complete control over their customers. The present application is only the latest tactic employed by these competing banks to blunt Apple’s entry into the Australian market. “Now they ask the ACCC for explicit permission to negotiate with Apple as a collective group, the goal of which is to: force Apple and other third party providers to accept their terms; allow them to charge consumers that choose to use Apple Pay; and force Apple to undermine the security of its mobile payment service by opening access to the NFC antenna, placing at risk the consumer experience of a simple, secure and private way to make payments in-store, within applications or on the web. “Providing simple access to the NFC antenna by banking applications would fundamentally diminish the high level of security Apple aims to have on our devices.” Westpac, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), National Australia Bank (NAB) and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank submitted their request to the ACCC in July 2016.

Modern iPhones come bundled with NFC chips that let users pay for things easily via Apple Pay, and the Cupertino giant is fighting back against attempts from Australian banks to gain access to it. Doing so would let the banks create their own contactless payment apps, and get a slice of the lucrative fees that Apple charges on every transaction — but Apple counters that doing so would damage its users' security. "Providing simple access to the NFC antenna by banking applications would fundamentally diminish the high level of security Apple aims to have on our devices," the company said in a submission to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). (We first saw the news over on The Register, and you can read the complete submission below.) Four banks — the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank, Westpac, and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank — want to team up to collectively negotiate with Apple over access to the tech. But Apple is pushing back hard. "Unfortunately, and based on their limited understanding of the offering, the [banks] perceive Apple Pay as a competitive threat," the company says. "These banks want to maintain complete control over their customers. The present application is only the latest tactic employed by these competing banks to blunt Apple's entry into the Australian market." Apple also argues that the banks teaming up would constitute a "cartel," and be illegal under Australia's competition laws.

This time, however, Kantar brings better news for Apple, as iOS has managed to return to growth after several months of decline. And yet, this doesn’t mean that Android is giving up, as significant increases have been recorded here too. The biggest increase recorded by iOS in Europe took place in France, where it improved its sales share by 3.4 percent, reaching 20.2 percent in the three-month period ending June 2016 (versus the same period of 2015). Similar performance was experienced in the UK too, where it reached 37.2 percent, up 3.1 percent - the UK also continues to be Apple’s best iOS market in Europe right now. Overall, EU5 figures show an increase of just 0.7 percent for iOS, but at least it’s an increase, with Apple’s platform now at 18.2 percent. Android continues to be the leader with 76.8 percent, up 5.5 percent. In the United States, June 2016 trends changed, and while iOS improved, Android declined. iOS reached 31.8 percent, up 1.3 percent, while Android dropped 0.6 percent to 65.5 percent. The biggest drop recorded by iOS was in Japan, where it lost 4.2 percentage points to settle at 38 percent, while Android posted an increase of 6.6 percent here to 61 percent. All hail the iPhone 6s! In case you’re wondering how come iOS increased even though Apple didn’t launch any new product, it’s because the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are once again selling like hot cakes (for whatever reason - one of the possible explanations for this growth is the massive discounts that the 6s generation is getting across the world, including the US and Europe), so they managed to overtake the Samsung Galaxy S7 (and not the other way around, as it happened last month). The iPhone SE helped a lot too, becoming the third best-selling phone during the period. “Combined sales of the iPhone 6s/6s Plus totalled 15.1%, making this the top selling device in the quarter, while the Samsung Galaxy S7/S7 edge accounted for 14.1% of smartphone sales. The iPhone SE became the third best-selling phone at 5.1%, contributing to the overall growth of iOS during the period,” Lauren Guenveur, Consumer Insight Director for Kantar Worldpanel ComTech, said. Now everyone in the Apple community is confident that sky’s the limit for iOS, as the company is gearing up to introduce a new iPhone model and a new iOS version next month. But at the same time, new Android models are also launching, so it’ll be an interesting end of year for the mobile world. #Apple#iPhone 6s#Samsung Galaxy S7#Android#iOS subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news The “Jaw-Dropping” 2017 iPhone Will Be Fully Made of Glass Apple Wanted to Launch an iPhone 7 Pro This Year but Ditched the Plan - Report Apple Releases Fourth iOS 10 and macOS 10.12 Sierra Public Betas, Update Now Apple Seeds Fifth Betas of iOS 10, macOS Sierra, tvOS 10, and watchOS 3 to Devs iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks    iOS is improving, but Android is doing well too new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Load old comments   Donald Trump, Tim Cook Discuss Building iPhones in the United States more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Sound quality isn’t super important to me because these are for the gym, not for critical listening at home. I want bass, and plenty of it, so that my hard-driving playlists can drown out the treadmill motors and ambient grunts that ride atop a soundtrack of inoffensive bubble-gum pop played over my gym’s loudspeakers. Fit is critical, however, and impossible to determine based upon a spec sheet, or the recommendation of any reviewer. That’s meant a lot of trial and error as I exchange one failed experiment for another. Headphone makers have invented a dizzying array of methods to keep their buds lodged in our ears. These range from flanges, to memory foam, to ear hooks, to silica gel buds each offered in a variety of shapes and sizes. Unfortunately, the only way to know what works best for your particular anatomy is to try them all. Simply stated, if your wireless earbuds aren’t comfortable, you won’t wear them. Period. And if they don’t maintain a snug fit while training then you’ll find yourself constantly adjusting them to maintain the quality of sound, especially the bass which falls off quickly as earbuds dislodge. My PowerBeats 2 Wireless earbuds require constant adjustment while at the gym and it’s maddening. By chance I recently discovered the Meizu EP-51 earbuds By chance I recently discovered the Meizu EP-51 earbuds, which turned out to be the wireless headphones I’ve longed for! They’re even "good enough" for Apple, which, I just realized, could be construed as a compliment or insult. Here, let me explain. The disappearing headphone jack is one of the biggest topics of discussion in tech this year. Although it’s only rumored for the next iPhone, its removal has been so thoroughly corroborated by people familiar with these things that it’s time to consider what it means going forward. Mark Gurman, who’s been the go-to source for Apple rumors for a few years now, said on Monday that "the new iPhones will remove the headphone jack in favor of connectivity via Bluetooth and the charging port." Great, so that raises the question of what Apple will include in the box when it ships its new iPhones in a few months. Fortunately, John Gruber’s already laid out the likely options over at Daring Fireball: Wireless earbuds Wireless earbuds and a Lightning adapter Lightning earbuds Lightning earbuds and a Lightning adapter The existing 3.5mm earbuds and a Lightning adapter "I’d prefer ‘good enough’ wireless earbuds included with the iPhone," says Gruber, "and ‘amazing’ headphones as the upsell product." Same, but that doesn’t mean it’s economically viable for Apple to do it. When I first read Gruber’s take a few weeks ago I thought bundling an acceptable set of wireless earbuds would be too expensive. After all, the most popular models recommended by experts start at around $80, and can easily cost more than $200. But that was before I received the Meizu EP-51 Bluetooth earbuds for testing. Apple currently bundles its EarPods with all new iPhone purchases making them the baseline by which we must measure "good enough" — an admittedly low bar that’s nevertheless deemed acceptable by millions of iPhone owners. These same earbuds can be purchased separately for $29 on the Apple store. Meizu Meizu’s EP-51 earbuds aren’t widely available in the West, but a few niche online retailers sell them for $27.99 — a buck less than Apple’s wired earbuds. The price is incredibly cheap for what you get: good sound with solid bass that far exceeds Apple’s EarPods, a decent three-button remote that’s easy to navigate blindly by touch, a reasonable 6-hour battery, and a snug, comfortable fit (for my ears, anyway). The machined aluminum looks great (in my opinion) set against the red and black accents of the cable and mic, they’re waterproof and lightweight, and the buds attach magnetically around your neck when not in use. And because of the fit and better bass I get with the Meizu buds, I prefer them to the $100 JLab Epic2 Bluetooth wireless fitness buds selected by both The Verge and The Wirecutter as the best wireless buds for most fitness enthusiasts (the Epic2 is my second favorite). Hell, I even prefer the Meizu buds to the $250 B&O H5 wireless earbuds I recently received for testing, mainly because I can’t get the H5 buds to stay in my ears even while walking. It’s clear that Apple could bundle cheap wireless earbuds with its new iPhones Had my colleague Vlad Savov not sent me the Meizu EP-51 earbuds on a whim, I never would have found my perfect wireless earbuds. Moreover, I wouldn't have realized that Apple could indeed manufacture a decent pair of wireless earbuds cheaply enough to bundle with its next iPhones. Apple could even resist the "good enough" trap and surprise and delight new iPhone buyers if profit margins allow. That would still leave plenty of room for a premium upsell, to, oh, I don’t know, a pair of $299 truly wireless Apple earbuds that may or may not include a heart monitor, and an entire lineup of Beats-branded wireless cans that can also be listened to while tethered over a Lightning cable. So yeah, it’s clear that Apple could bundle cheap wireless earbuds with its new iPhones after it ditches the headphone jack. And given the foreseeable options available, I think it should.

Apple has just added the 12.9-inch iPad Pro to its selection of “Certified Refurbished” products, some with a discount as big as $160. This does make the iPad Pro a lot more palatable in terms of price, though it comes with your usual disclaimers of an already used, but in good condition, device. When Apple launched the first iPad Pro, one of the biggest complaints about it was its price. While Apple isn’t exactly known for wallet friendly products, even some of its biggest fans found the iPad Pro’s price tag a tad ridiculous, especially when factoring in the almost essential accessories. Now nearly a year later, Apple is finally giving still interested buyers a more official option. While there are retailers that are already carrying discounted prices, Apple’s refurbs come with a one year warranty, a brand new battery, and a new outer shell. Without much further ado, here are the prices for the refurbished 12.9-inch iPad Pros and how much you’ll be saving when buying these instead of brand new units. • 32 GB 12.9-inch iPad Pro (Wi-Fi) – $679 (save $120) • 128 GB 12.9-inch iPad Pro (Wi-Fi) – $809 (save $140) • 128 GB 12.9-inch iPad Pro (Wi-Fi + Cellular) – $919 (save $160) In all cases, all three Gold, Silver, and Space Gray colors are available. One caveat is that, by now, the iPad Pro is already a year old. In most cases, that could mean that a successor is on the way. So far, however, there has been little word in the rumor mill about an iPad Pro 2, save for a lone, sketchy photo. Besides, the original iPad Pro still has a lot going for it, making it still a viable option, especially with these reduced prices.

 No, Apple hasn't stopped selling music downloads in South Korea James Cook Aug. 10, 2016, 6:34 AM 1,115 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks at the WSJD Live conference in Laguna Beach, California October 27, 2014. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson Multiple websites are reporting that Apple has begun its plan to stop selling music downloads on iTunes, gradually forcing customers to subscribe to Apple Music. It's a worrying scenario, but there's a slight problem: It's not true. "Apple has begun to stop selling iTunes downloads," says ShortList. "Breaking: Apple Drops Music Downloads In iTunes Korea App," says Digital Music News. The apparent evidence for those headlines is a collection of screenshots of iTunes in South Korea. There aren't any download options — just the option to stream songs on Apple Music. Apple has just launched Apple Music in the country, and so the screenshots make it look like Apple cut music downloads at the same time. Apple Except it didn't. Apple has never offered iTunes downloads in South Korea. It's a complicated environment for rightsholders, and music sales in South Korea are dominated by local telecom companies. What's happened here is that people saw Apple Music launch in South Korea and incorrectly assumed Apple quietly cut music downloads at the same time. For what it's worth, Apple said in May that it has no plans to end paid music downloads. It told Recode in May 2016 that a story about a longterm scheme to end iTunes downloads was "not true."

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search Analyst: Apple is Forcing Higher Margins by Renegotiating with Suppliers August 10, 2016 6:43am Nasdaq:AAPL ShareTweet Evidence suggests that computer and mobile device giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is squeezing its suppliers by paying lower prices for their goods and services, according to a new report. Analysts Amit Daryanani and Jeriel Ong at RBC Capital Markets recently sent a note to clients describing the phenomenon, which includes data from several Apple suppliers. Based in Taiwan, U.S., U.K., and elsewhere, many of these firms look to be feeling pressure from Apple to deliver their wares at less profitable price points. Some of these companies make microchips, integrated circuits, and other components, while others assemble pieces into completed products. The products they work on range from iPhones to iPads to Mac computers — most of Apple’s product line. Here’s a table of what RBC found (pay attention to the red highlighted areas): Out of the 11 companies the firm studied, 9 of them saw lower gross margins than originally expected. That’s pretty strong evidence that Apple has done some negotiating behind the scenes to get lower prices and thereby boost its own margins, which fell to 38% from 39% year-over-year in the past quarter. “We think Apple has been pushing for price discounts from multiple suppliers as a way to dampen foreign exchange headwinds Apple is facing on their own profit and loss statement heading into the iPhone 7,” say the analysts. Last month, a similar report suggested that Apple is pitting companies against each other to get lower prices. As the evidence mounts that Apple might have some gross margin upside in upcoming quarters, the timing of the iPhone 7 launch this fall is probably no coincidence. The company’s margins have fallen mainly as a result of currency headwinds, and Apple is so powerful that it can simply pass the effects onto its suppliers rather than shoulder the burden itself. It’s good to be the king. Apple shares were mostly flat in premarket trading Wednesday at $108.80 per share. APPL has risen 3.37% year-to-date, versus a 7% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index in the same period.

KGI Securities analyst Ming-chi Kuo first revealed that Apple is planning to replace the function keys on the MacBook Pro with an OLED touch bar, and now Bloomberg's Mark Gurman is confirming the initial reports. The new MacBook Pros are said to be slightly thinner than current models, with a slightly wider trackpad and an option for AMD Polaris graphics in at least one model. Bloomberg says that Apple isn't planning to unveil the new MacBook Pros at an event on September 7th, where it's expected to launch a new iPhone and additional Apple Watch models. Apple is also expected to include USB Type-C on the new MacBook Pro, alongside a Touch ID fingerprint reader. "Apple has tested versions of the upcoming laptops that integrate the scanner beside the new function key display," explains Bloomberg's Gurman. Apple is also rumored to be considering gray, gold, and silver color options for the new MacBook Pro. Mockup of the new MacBook Pro OLED touch strip by Martin Hajek The most intriguing addition to the MacBook Pro is the secondary display above the keyboard. Designed to replace the function keys, Bloomberg reports that it will be a strip-like screen that shows functions on a task-by-task basis and will simplify keyboard shortcuts. The panel could show media controls when iTunes is open, or cut and paste commands when Microsoft Word is running. Apple has been widely criticized for still selling a four-year-old MacBook Pro model without a Retina display. Mac fans have been waiting anxiously for a MacBook Pro refresh, and the current Retina MacBook Pro is more than 440 days into its cycle, despite refreshes usually appearing every 268 days on average in the past. Apple has not yet announced an official date for its iPhone event (rumored for September 7th), and it's possible the company could now refresh its MacBook Pro line without an onstage event.
