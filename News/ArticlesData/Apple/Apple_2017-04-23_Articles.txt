The actions — first, digital fingerprinting users' devices  and then, geofencing Apple's headquarters to veil the company's actions — earned Uber CEO Travis Kalanick an in-person rebuke from Apple CEO Tim Cook, who threatened to kick Uber out of the powerful Apple App store. Asked for comment, Uber said that it does not track individual users or their location if they have deleted the Uber app. It said that the persistent ID tags protected against driver fraud and allowed it to keep fraudsters from loading the Uber app onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone again and again. The company did not respond to the Times' allegation that it has attempted to hide its use from Apple. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday evening. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick showing off his backhand.  (Photo: Ryan Soule, SPiN) The allegation is one of several in a piece that outlines Uber CEO Travis Kalanick's long history of flouting rules and corporate norms — a legacy that helped it overcome myriad opposition from cities and taxi unions but that has forced it into a leadership crisis that threatens Kalanick's job. The Apple issue came about in 2014 and early 2015. According to the paper, Uber was fighting fraud worldwide at a time when it offered bonuses to drivers if they did more rides. In China and elsewhere, drivers would use stolen iPhones that had had their information digitally wiped to create dozens of fake email addresses for false, new riders, who would then request rides. The drivers accepted, increasing their ride count. In an effort to thwart such deceits, Uber created persistent ID tags on iPhones so that each could be identified even if the phone's information was wiped. This ran afoul of Apple rules that prohibit such "fingerprinting" of phones, meant to preserve customer privacy when phones change hands. To keep Apple from discovering what it was doing, Uber engineers created a faked version of its computer code, without the fingerprinting, which would automatically be shown to anyone who looked at it from the physical location of Apple headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., using a technology called geofencing. According to the story, Apple engineers elsewhere saw the fingerprinting and figured out what was happening. Apple's Cook called Kalanick into his office in early 2015 to lay down the law — stop the fingerprinting or Apple would remove the Uber app from its App Store. Kalanick acquiesced, aware that if Uber lost access to iPhones it would lose millions of customers, the Times reported. The incident is somewhat reminiscent of another code slight-of-hand Uber used in 2014 to hide its activities from government officials in cities where it was prohibited. As reported by the Times, the Greyball program identified authorities in areas where the service hadn't been approved so what when they attempted to hail a ride on Uber (and thus provide fodder for enforcement actions) they were instead shown a false version of the app filled with fake cars that never came to pick them up. Uber has said it will no longer use that program to thwart local regulators. The company also used a variety of questionable ploys to wrest drivers and customers from smaller rival Lyft. For example, Uber employees ordered and canceled Lyft rides "en masse" to frustrate Lyft drivers, the article said.  Other Uber employees took Lyft rides and spent the duration of the ride trying to talk the drivers to switch to driving for Uber. Uber and its CEO  have faced increasing scrutiny in the past months as employees have accused it of fostering a winner-take-all culture that allowed sexual harassment by high-performers and contributed to a toxic work culture. It's also facing a suit by Google accusing an Uber engineer of stealing 14,000 files covering self-driving car technology.

By Hyacinth Mascarenhas April 24, 2017 06:46 BST Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly pulled up Travis Kalanick in 2015, threatening to remove Uber from the App Store.Reuters/Shu Zhang Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly threatened to have Uber's iPhone app pulled from the App Store in 2015 after learning that the ride-hailing firm had secretly been identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app was deleted from the phone. According to the New York Times, Cook apparently pulled up CEO Travis Kalanick over the scheme that violated Apple's privacy rules. "So, I've heard you've been breaking some of our rules," Cook reportedly told Kalanick during an in-person meeting at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California. He demanded that Uber end the practice or risk being kicked off the App Store. A person who saw Kalanick after the meeting said he looked "shaken by Mr. Cook's scolding" NYT reports. Losing access to millions of iPhone users would be disastrous for Uber's business so Kalanick conceded and put an end to the practice. The Times reports the practice began in 2014 when Uber was tackling widespread account fraud in markets like China where people were buying stolen, erased iPhones and then create multiple fake email addresses and Uber rider accounts. They would then request rides via these accounts, accept these rides and cash in on Uber's incentives for drivers to take more rides, earning them more money. To address the fraudulent activity, Uber used a practice called "fingerprinting" by adding a piece of code to let them identify an iPhone and keep tabs on it even after the app is deleted or the phone is wiped. The firm also used a technique called "geofencing" to cover their tracks and evade detection by Apple. Kalanick apparently asked his engineers to "geofence" Apple's headquarters and "obfuscate its code from people within that geofenced area, essentially drawing a digital lass around those it wanted to keep in the dark." Apple engineers outside of the firm's headquarters, however, soon found out about Apple's ruse. "We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they've deleted the app," an Uber spokesperson said to multiple media outlets. "As the New York Times story notes towards the very end, this is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone - over and over again." "Similar techniques are also used for detecting and blocking suspicious logins to protect our users' accounts. Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back onto our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users." Uber has been having a rocky year thus far with a long litany of controversies over the past few months. The company is currently investigating allegations over sexual harassment, sexism and a toxic work culture. A damaging #DeleteUber campaign resurfaced following the sexual harassment claims after it first went viral in January when Uber was accused of strike-breaking a protest against President Trump's immigration order. Alphabet's Waymo slapped the company with a lawsuit alleging theft of its self-driving car technology. An embarassing video also emerged showing Kalanick yelling at an Uber driver over falling fares. He later apologised and admitted he needed to "grow up" and "get leadership help". Uber admitted to using a secret "Greyball" tool to deceive law enforcement in markets where the company faced restrictions. It later vowed to stop using the software for that purpose. In January, Uber agreed to pay a $20,000 fine and adopt more stringent privacy and security practices following a 14-month investigation into its "God View" tool to track riders. The company also allegedly used a tool called Hell to secretly track and monitor drivers of rival ride-hailing company Lyft. Uber was also accused of shortchanging both its drivers and customers in the US. Amid the whirlwind of PR crises, a slew of executive departures have continued to plague Uber. Meanwhile, Uber is looking for a new chief operating officer to help Kalanick run the troubled company.

Read: iPhone 8 To Be Biggest Contributor To Apple’s Net Worth, Expected To Reach $824B By 2017-End The newest iPhone 8 leak indicates Apple could go for a dual-camera setup similar to the iPhone 7 Plus, but instead of a horizontal one, the company might opt for a vertical dual-camera setup. Benjamin Geskin, known for leaking smartphones, claimed on Twitter to have a computer numerical control (CNC) model of the upcoming device, and he posted pictures of the device Sunday. CNC models are used in advance stages of device manufacturing for automating production. The model shown in the photo and another one of Geskin’s tweets indicates other features of the device. In addition to the rear camera setup, iPhone 8 may have a curved display with 4 mm bezels and 2.5D curved glass and dual-front cameras, encased inside a metal frame with the same 7.1 mm thickness as the iPhone 7. It may also come in a new Space Black color. The leak belies earlier rumors of an edge-to-edge display like the Samsung Galaxy S8 and hints that the biggest feature of the new iPhone might be its cameras and not its display. The leak also confirms one previously rumored feature — iPhone 8 could ditch Apple’s home button and have a display-embedded fingerprint sensor instead. Read: iPhone 8: 6 Expected Features The leak is meant to be taken with a pinch of salt, just like previous ones. Bloomberg reported April 18 that Apple was testing many designs for the iPhone 8 and was yet to finalize one, so even if the leak is genuine, it might be based on a design which is not yet confirmed. iPhone 8 is expected to launch in Fall 2017, with features such as a 5.8-inch OLED display, A11 processor and long-range wireless charging.

According to The New York Times (NYT) article, 2015 was no different where Apple caught Uber red-handed, when it was found that the company’s app was identifying iPhones even after the app was deleted from the device. The NYT report mainly gives a broader picture about Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and how the leader is willing to go to the extremes to ensure he gets what he wants. It details Uber’s journey in China from investing millions to shutting shop abruptly in the country. The piece also points out an incident where Apple caught Uber red-handed, but the company had its reasons for doing the same. In short, Uber wanted to track fraudsters and block them from creating multiple accounts using the same iPhone to collect new account bonuses. Uber used a process called fingerprinting, where the company was able to collect UUIDs (unique hardware serial numbers) of iOS devices. Uber would obtain the same once the app was installed. Since hardware details being collected, the company could identify iPhones even after the app was uninstalled. Oddly, the same works with Android. It is not illegal to do so when it comes to the Google ecosystem, says a report from Apple Insider. The above procedure, called “fingerprinting”, is a strict NO as it violates the App Store’s policies to do with tracking and privacy. But Uber did more than this. According to the article, Uber took countermeasures to ensure that Apple employees were not being tracked. It did this by geofencing Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino and changing its code so that the same code would not be visible to Apple Employees. However, despite Uber’s best efforts, Apple caught a whiff of the activity and this led to Tim Cook calling Kalanick to his office. “So, I’ve heard you’ve been breaking some of our rules,” was the line that Apple CEO Tim Cook told Uber CEO, Kalanick in 2015. Uber quickly complied to Apple’s rules. An Uber spokesperson has responded to The Verge, stating that the company does not track individual users or their location if the app has been deleted. Not confirming any details from the NYT story, it did confirm that it did what it did to prevent fraudsters from taking advantage of the system and that similar technique is also used by the company to block suspicious logins to protect user accounts.

In a triumphant feat of PR jujitsu, Samsung turned the embarrassing recall of the Note 7 into a dramatic rise-from-the-ashes narrative that was lapped up by the media like a bunch of hipsters gobbling artisanal provisions. The gorgeous new curved-edge screens on the new Samsung Galaxy S8 ($720) and S8 Plus ($840) weren’t just improvements featured by the company’s next-generation smartphone, but game-changing aspects of this, the company’s do-or-die moment. It’s as if Samsung had studied Boston sports and this was the ninth inning of Game 4 of the 2004 ALCS. Either that or it summoned the aura of Steve Jobs, because this level of contrived mystique was his hallmark. Last week, I heard New York-based DJ Elvis Duran on Z100 Radio tell listeners that the S8 might well change the way we interact with our smartphones forever. Since when do radio hosts talk about smartphones? The S8 is officially cooler than the iPhone, and that couldn’t come at a worse time for Apple as it celebrates the 10-year anniversary of its once iconic smartphone and prepares to launch the next upgrade in September. Apple is also aiming for an edge-to-edge screen, but now it risks looking like a Samsung follower instead of an innovator. If the upcoming iPhone doesn’t have a major new feature beyond the increased screen size, Apple may as well cancel the big product reveal. Its days of smartphone supremacy are over. The S8 is a powerful smartphone, but its biggest asset is that it is a beauty to behold. Focusing on the skin-deep improvements was a brilliant strategy — started by Apple — because that’s the one feature that guarantees an instant reaction from anyone. The S8’s biggest weakness is that its much-ballyhooed new smart assistant, dubbed Bixby, isn’t yet fully functional. It’s supposed to use the camera to recognize landmarks, products and even translate foreign languages. According to Samsung, it will begin to recognize your routines and build in recommendations around them. The company admits the voice recognition functions of Bixby aren’t ready for launch yet, and the fact is the company released the phone before the software was finished. I wouldn’t be surprised if Apple starts playing defense with attack ads along the lines of, “We may only have Siri, but at least she works.” The letdown of Bixby hasn’t gotten nearly as much attention as the S8’s newly narrowed shape. Samsung has somehow made the concept of an 18.5:9 aspect ratio sound sexy, while simultaneously relegating the Note 7 debacle to a distant memory — if not a required fall en route to greatness. True enough that the so-called “infinity screen” that curves over the edges of the S8 and S8 Plus are stunning, with richer colors and more vibrancy than before. But it’s really just extra screen space.

In a quest to build Uber into the world’s dominant ride-hailing entity, Kalanick has openly disregarded many rules and norms, leading to a pattern of risk-taking that has at times put his company on the brink of implosion. By Mike Isaac / The New York Times SAN FRANCISCO — Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber, visited Apple’s headquarters in early 2015 to meet with Tim Cook, who runs the iPhone maker. For months, Mr. Kalanick had pulled a fast one on Apple by directing his employees to help camouflage the ride-hailing app from Apple’s engineers. The reason? So Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased — a fraud detection maneuver that violated Apple’s privacy guidelines. But Apple was on to the deception, and when Mr. Kalanick arrived at the midafternoon meeting, Mr. Cook was prepared. “So, I’ve heard you’ve been breaking some of our rules,” Mr. Cook said. Stop the trickery, Mr. Cook then demanded, or Uber’s app would be kicked out of Apple’s App Store. If Uber’s app was yanked from the App Store, it would lose access to millions of iPhone customers — essentially destroying the ride-hailing company’s business. So Mr. Kalanick acceded. In a quest to build Uber into the world’s dominant ride-hailing entity, Mr. Kalanick has been seen as openly disregarding many rules and norms, backing down only when caught or cornered. He has flouted transportation and safety regulations, bucked against entrenched competitors and capitalized on legal loopholes and gray areas to gain a business advantage. In the process, Mr. Kalanick has helped create a new transportation industry, with Uber spreading to more than 70 countries and gaining a valuation of nearly $70 billion, and its business continues to grow. But the previously unreported encounter with Mr. Cook showed how Mr. Kalanick was also responsible for risk-taking that pushed Uber beyond the pale. According to interviews with more than 50 current and former Uber employees, investors and others with whom the executive had personal relationships, Mr. Kalanick, 40, is driven to the point that he must win at whatever he puts his mind to and at whatever cost — a trait that has now plunged Uber into its most sustained set of crises since its founding in 2009. “Travis’ biggest strength is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals,” said Mark Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks owner and billionaire investor who has mentored Mr. Kalanick. “Travis’ biggest weakness is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals. That’s the best way to describe him.” A blindness to boundaries has been viewed as leading Mr. Kalanick to a pattern of repeatedly going too far at Uber, sabotaging competitors and allowing the company to use a secret tool called Greyball to trick some law enforcement agencies. That quality also extended to his personal life, where Mr. Kalanick mixes with celebrities like Jay Z and businessmen including President Donald Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn. For the last few months, Uber has been reeling from allegations of a machismo-fueled workplace where managers routinely overstepped verbally, physically and sometimes sexually with employees. Uber’s detractors have started a grass-roots campaign with the hashtag #deleteUber. Executives have streamed out. Some Uber investors have openly criticized the company. Mr. Kalanick’s leadership is at a precarious point. He has publicly apologized for some of his behavior and is interviewing candidates for a chief operating officer. He has also been working with senior managers to reset some of the company’s stated values. Through an Uber spokesman, Mr. Kalanick declined an interview request. Apple declined to comment on the meeting with Mr. Cook. Many of the people interviewed for this article asked to remain anonymous because they had signed nondisclosure agreements with Uber or feared damaging their relationship with the chief executive. Selling efficiency After attending the University of California, Los Angeles, to major in computer engineering, Mr. Kalanick dropped out in 1998 to form a startup with several classmates. The company, Scour, became a peer-to-peer file exchange similar to Napster. Scour, which was eventually sued for $250 billion for alleged copyright infringement, filed for bankruptcy in October 2000, a move that protected it from the suit. The failure did not stop Mr. Kalanick from helping to found another Los Angeles startup, Red Swoosh, four months later. Red Swoosh made a technology to efficiently transfer large files of digital data; one of its investors was Mr. Cuban. With Red Swoosh, Mr. Kalanick started exhibiting his hallmark aggressiveness. When the company struggled, Mr. Kalanick and a partner took the tax dollars from employee paychecks — which are supposed to be withheld and sent to the IRS — and reinvested the money into the startup, even as friends and advisers warned him the action was potentially illegal. In 2007, Mr. Kalanick sold Red Swoosh to Akamai, a cloud services company, for roughly $19 million. The deal turned the executive, who had headed north to San Francisco, into a millionaire. Uber’s rise The idea for Uber came in 2009 from Garrett Camp, a friend of Mr. Kalanick’s, who became fixated on hailing a private luxury car with a smartphone app after being unable to catch cabs in San Francisco. UberCab, as it was called at the time, started its service in San Francisco in May 2010. Mr. Kalanick quickly positioned the startup as an alternative to the taxi industry. City-by-city regulations required procedures like base stations for cabs, safety measures and other stipulations. Mr. Kalanick ignored those rules. The company typically sent a small strike team into a new city to aggressively recruit new drivers through Craigslist and other online listings. Then the team marketed UberCab’s app to increase ridership. That drew attention from regulators. In October 2010, the company shortened its name to Uber after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from San Francisco officials for marketing itself as a taxi company without the proper licenses and permits. Uber plunged into China in 2013, and Mr. Kalanick spent billions of dollars to outgun the local incumbent Didi Chuxing — only to have to retreat last year, partly because of heavy losses. Mr. Kalanick is now spending heavily in India to win there. For the win With Mr. Kalanick setting the tone at Uber, employees acted to ensure the ride-hailing service would win no matter what. They spent much of their energy one-upping rivals like Lyft. Uber devoted teams to competitive intelligence, purchasing data from an analytics service called Slice Intelligence. Using an email digest service it owns named Unroll.me, Slice collected its customers’ emailed Lyft receipts from their inboxes and sold the anonymized data to Uber. Uber used the data as a proxy for the health of Lyft’s business. Slice confirmed it sells anonymized data based on ride receipts from Uber and Lyft, but declined to disclose who buys the information. The idea of fooling Apple, the main distributor of Uber’s app, began in 2014. At the time, Uber was dealing with widespread account fraud in places like China, where tricksters bought stolen iPhones that were erased of their memory and resold. Some Uber drivers there would then create dozens of fake email addresses to sign up for new Uber rider accounts attached to each phone, and request rides from those phones, which they would then accept. Since Uber was handing out incentives to drivers to take more rides, the drivers could earn more money this way. To halt the activity, Uber engineers assigned a persistent identity to iPhones with a small piece of code, a practice called “fingerprinting.” Uber could then identify an iPhone and prevent itself from being fooled even after the device was erased of its contents. There was one problem: Fingerprinting iPhones broke Apple’s rules. Mr. Cook believed that wiping an iPhone should ensure that no trace of the owner’s identity remained on the device. So Mr. Kalanick told his engineers to “geofence” Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., a way to digitally identify people reviewing Uber’s software in a specific location. Uber would then obfuscate its code for people within that geofenced area, essentially drawing a digital lasso around those it wanted to keep in the dark. Apple employees at its headquarters were unable to see Uber’s fingerprinting. But Apple engineers outside of Cupertino caught on to Uber’s methods, prompting Mr. Cook to call Mr. Kalanick to his office. Mr. Kalanick was shaken by Mr. Cook’s scolding, according to a person who saw him after the meeting. But only momentarily. After all, Mr. Kalanick had faced off against Apple, and Uber had survived. He had lived to fight another day.

Here are 10 changes Apple could make to bring the professional device back to its glory. By Jesus Vigo | April 23, 2017, 4:00 PM PST Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto.com/Anil Bolukbas As an IT professional, you're constantly bombarded with questions regarding the latest smartphones, computers, and devices. Your opinion, largely based on your experiences, is highly sought after—and it should be. After all, your work exposes you to equipment that the average user has no need for, such as high-end workstations and cutting-edge servers. What's Hot at TechRepublic Microchip implants help employees access data; experts worry about 'slippery slope' for privacy Windows 10 Creators Update: The smart person's guide 8 practical ways to make your tech job less stressful Subscribe to our Cover Stories newsletter But there's also a lot of, shall we say, obsolete equipment you come across that is likely 10 to 15 years old and really should not be used by anyone ever. This experience combined with playing with the latest toys rounds out what we recommend, based on the user's needs, of course. What does this all have to do with Apple's new MacBook Pro laptops? Well, despite the fact that their selling quite well, many diehard Apple fans—many of whom are professionals in their own respective fields—think the Pro line has lost much of its professional appeal, making it a hard device to recommend. As an admin, I have to work with many of the major OSes, so I support them equally and see their pros and cons. But as a personal computer user, I tend to prefer Macs for their lack of quirks. For me, "It just works." And while I've come to enjoy my new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, I don't love it necessarily and find that it could've (and should've) been better. So indulge me the opportunity to cover 10 points I believe Apple could certainly use to work on the next iteration in the MacBook Pro line to better align its Pro philosophy with its hardware and possibly regain some of that "Pro cred" many feel Apple lost last time around. Before I jump in, however, I want to address the use of "professional" in this article. It is my belief that professionals exist at every level of industry and that the inherent needs of one type of professional will not necessary mesh with those of a professional in other fields. For example, a video editor will certainly have different computing needs from those of a server administrator. The idea is to create a device that is capable of being upgraded, dependent on needs, to adapt to the user—not requiring the user to adapt their needs to the device's limited capacities. SEE: Is it time for high-end pros to dump the Mac? 1. Support for 32GB (or more) of RAM There aren't many laptops that support 32GB+ of RAM. They do exist; it's just not as common. But the need for more RAM in computers is akin to water for human beings. It's never going to end, and depending on how strenuous the activity, that need will increase. Since 8GB is the bare minimum recommended for end users today, 16GB is a good alternative upgrade for some. But for those with heavier workloads, more RAM will address a real-world requirement for professionals who need it to complete their tasks on the go. 2. 4K screen resolution The one thing I do love about my MBP is its retina screen resolution. Coming from a non-retina MBP more than eight years old, the heightened resolution is incredible for working with multiple apps. However, in a world where 4K is not just present but readily available, from ample content to affordable smart TVs, the switch to 4K screens isn't just about prettier pictures. It's fueled by the whopping 3840 x 2160 screen real estate that helps anyone working in art departments, network administration, or data analysis view all the work without having to toggle back and forth. 3. Quad-core CPUs on 13" laptop The MBP has supported quad-core processors on its 15" and 17" line for sometime now, yet never on its 13" line. Admittedly, the Thermal Design Power (TDP) is ultimately what comes into play on smaller, thinner laptops and their ability to dissipate heat efficiently. The fact remains that while many pros who would gain from the increased core count typically make the jump to a larger, 15" screen laptop, some would prefer to retain the smaller form factor offered by a 13" laptop while having power on tap for when it's most needed. In addition, there are 13" laptops for sale by competing manufacturers that do support quad-core CPUs, so I have nothing but the utmost faith that Apple's engineering and design gurus can come up with such a powerful device while keeping TDP requirements in check. 4. Bluetooth 5 The Bluetooth 5 spec was officially unveiled in June 2016, sporting a number of enhancements over its predecessors. Doubling transfer speeds and quadrupling the range while retaining its low energy capability make this seem like a no-brainer for the next MacBook Pro. To its credit, Apple has a track record of being good with wireless technologies, particularly Bluetooth, as it has historically maintained the latest releases across the entirety of its lines. That being said, this is a protocol widely adapted by many products—1st- and 3rd-party alike—and it would be a shame to see it go, like SDHC support (more on this later). 5. Working-day battery life This is another area where Apple has been able to shine until recently. Marketed as having a 10-hour battery life, the MBP line was outfitted with larger capacity batteries and combined with tweaks to OS X to provide a laptop that could stand up to the day's workload. Sadly, the bar by which this is measured is largely based on consumer standards of use, with barometers for wirelessly accessing the internet and media playback with a specific set of settings enabled, such as lowered brightness and certain apps open. This does not reflect the life of a mobile professional. Perhaps allowing for the return of higher-capacity batteries while focusing less on shrinking the laptop dimensions would yield more battery life for the end user as needed and remain in line with their requirements. 6. Integration of Apple SIM for WWAN connectivity This is one feature that many pro and non-pro users have been clamoring for, practically since the MBP was released in 2006. With Apple's universal SIM (subscriber identity module) introduced in 2014, the manufacturer created a SIM card capable of supporting multiple wireless carrier profiles for its iPad line of devices. This enables users to connect to the cellular wireless connection of their choosing to obtain internet connectivity when neither Wi-Fi or Ethernet access is available. The Apple SIM adds the flexibility to obtain LTE coverage, for example, in more than 140 countries world wide by signing up for their services with various data plans to choose from. While users can tether their smartphone's data connection, if needed, this capability does come with a few caveats. Namely, that hotspot or tethering is often limited by lowered data caps set by the carrier; the access will typically work only when connecting to the provider's towers locally; and if roaming is allowed, there may be additional charges or fees imposed that can spike the cellular bill with just a few MBs of downloads per month. 7. The return of the SD card reader Losing the SD card reader was a really confusing move for many MBP owners—particularly when the size of the slot of the SD card was well within the size guidelines of the new MBP dimensions. Worse still, for many professional photographers, end users, and even those wanting to expand the space of their SSD storage (but unable to find a suitable upgrade path), the SD card offered a way to import their work, transfer data, and add a secondary storage or backup device to their laptops without sacrificing portability or performance. Apple should definitely bring back the SD card reader, as it essentially added value to the portable device and took away nothing in return. 8. Minimum specs that adhere to Pro-level requirements While this is more of a general guideline, I feel it is one that would help Apple avoid muddling any future Pro-level line upgrades by instituting a set of policies based on feedback from multiple sources, such as owners, professional community members, and technologists, to determine what constitutes professional-level devices and how that integrates with the workflow of many prominent fields, including sciences, multimedia, and technology. Consider, for example, Apple's recent admission that the Mac Pro desktop has been unable to achieve its peak performance because it's hamstrung by a less-than-accomodating design. Having this information could help Apple better design its products for professionals, who can then use them to the fullest potential. 9. Tweaks to wireless network hardware and network stack Apple's on-again, off-again issues regarding its Wi-Fi chipsets and network stack have been notorious for more than a decade now. Generally speaking, the wireless hardware is provided by a 3rd-party manufacturer and is available on some non-Mac devices without the same troubles Apple users experience. So it's high time to take a critical look at both the hardware and software components that make up the wireless network adapters found in the MBP—especially when so much reliance is placed upon the wireless signal as the only native form of communication. When it does not work as expected, such as dropping connectivity every few minutes or refusing to connect to a known wireless network after a vital system update, it becomes increasingly difficult for users to get their work done. 10. The headphone jack This one is a bit tongue-in-cheek, I'll admit, but completely accurate. The "dongle hell" introduced by swapping out all existing ports on the MBP to USB Type-C caused a large kerfuffle for longtime Apple users and new users alike. The iPhone 7 experienced a similar resistance from users who wanted to upgrade but ultimately chose not to so as to not lose the headphone jack or the ability to charge the device while simultaneously using their headphones (such as yours truly). It makes little sense to jettison the headphone jack, as has been rumored, in favor of wireless headphones to minimize the device's footprint, when the latter choice requires carrying around a (usually) larger set of headphones, charging cable and/or replacement batteries, and often a case to carry them in versus a $10 pair of headphones that can be bound up and tucked into your pocket or small carry-on with little fuss. The future of MBP Apple, like any manufacturer, creates new products—and users worldwide will either love them or not. If Apple's earnings calls are any indication, it is financially secure and continuing to do well. Users have not abandoned the brand nor are they looking elsewhere for devices to the point that it's affecting Apple's bottom line. But this article isn't intended to bash Apple or criticize its failings—rather, to illustrate the perceived shift in the Pro line away from what made it the Pro line in the first place and maybe course-correct that ship.

Cook, who runs the iPhone maker. It was a session that Kalanick was dreading. For months, Kalanick had pulled a fast one on Apple by directing his employees to help camouflage the ride-hailing app from Apple's engineers. The reason? So Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased - a fraud detection maneuver that violated Apple's privacy guidelines. But Apple was onto the deception, and when Kalanick arrived at the midafternoon meeting sporting his favorite pair of bright red sneakers and hot-pink socks, Cook was prepared. "So, I've heard you've been breaking some of our rules," Cook said in his calm, Southern tone. Stop the trickery, Cook then demanded, or Uber's app would be kicked out of Apple's App Store. For Kalanick, the moment was fraught with tension. If Uber's app was yanked from the App Store, it would lose access to millions of iPhone customers - essentially destroying the ride-hailing company's business. So Kalanick acceded. In a quest to build Uber into the world's dominant ride-hailing entity, Kalanick has openly disregarded many rules and norms, backing down only when caught or cornered. He has flouted transportation and safety regulations, bucked against entrenched competitors and capitalized on legal loopholes and gray areas to gain a business advantage. In the process, Kalanick has helped create a new transportation industry, with Uber spreading to more than 70 countries and gaining a valuation of nearly $70 billion, and its business continues to grow. But the previously unreported encounter with Cook showed how Kalanick was also responsible for risk-taking that pushed Uber beyond the pale, sometimes to the very brink of implosion. Crossing that line was not a one-off for Kalanick. According to interviews with more than 50 current and former Uber employees, investors and others with whom the executive had personal relationships, Kalanick, 40, is driven to the point that he must win at whatever he puts his mind to and at whatever cost - a trait that has now plunged Uber into its most sustained set of crises since its founding in 2009. "Travis' biggest strength is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals," said Mark Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks owner and billionaire investor who has mentored Kalanick. "Travis' biggest weakness is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals. That's the best way to describe him." A blindness to boundaries is not uncommon for Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. But in Kalanick, that led to a pattern of repeatedly going too far at Uber, including the duplicity with Apple, sabotaging competitors and allowing the company to use a secret tool called Greyball to trick some law enforcement agencies. That quality also extended to his personal life, where Kalanick mixes with celebrities like Jay Z and businessmen including President Donald Trump's chief economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn. But it has alienated some Uber executives, employees and advisers. Kalanick, with salt-and-pepper hair, a fast-paced walk and an iPhone practically embedded in his hand, is described by friends as more at ease with data and numbers (some consider him a math savant) than with people. Uber is grappling with the fallout. For the last few months, the company has been reeling from allegations of a machismo-fueled workplace where managers routinely overstepped verbally, physically and sometimes sexually with employees. Kalanick compounded that image by engaging in a shouting match with an Uber driver in February, an incident recorded by the driver and then leaked online. (Kalanick now has a private driver.) The damage has been extensive. Uber's detractors have started a grass-roots campaign with the hashtag #deleteUber. Executives have streamed out. Some Uber investors have openly criticized the company. Kalanick's leadership is at a precarious point. While Uber is financed by a who's who of investors including Goldman Sachs and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Kalanick controls the majority of the company's voting shares with a small handful of other close friends, and has stacked Uber's board of directors with many who are invested in his success. Yet board members have concluded that he must change his management style, and are pressuring him to do so. He has publicly apologized for some of his behavior, and for the first time has said he needs management help. He is interviewing candidates for a chief operating officer, even as some employees question whether a new addition will make any difference. He has also been working with senior managers to reset some of the company's stated values. Results of an internal investigation into Uber's workplace culture are expected next month. Through an Uber spokesman, Kalanick declined an interview request. Apple declined to comment on the meeting with Cook. Many of the people interviewed for this article, who revealed previously unreported details of Kalanick's life, asked to remain anonymous because they had signed nondisclosure agreements with Uber or feared damaging their relationship with the chief executive. Kalanick's pattern for pushing limits is deeply ingrained. It began during his childhood in suburban Los Angeles, where he went from being bullied to being the aggressor, continued through his years taking risks at two technology startups there, and crystallized in his role at Uber. Selling Efficiency After attending the University of California, Los Angeles, to major in computer engineering, Kalanick dropped out in 1998 to form a startup with several classmates. The company, Scour, became a peer-to-peer file exchange similar to Napster, which let people digitally share music and media files through legally dubious means. Scour, which was eventually sued for $250 billion for alleged copyright infringement, filed for bankruptcy in October 2000, a move that protected it from the suit. The failure did not stop Kalanick from helping to found another Los Angeles startup, Red Swoosh, four months later. Red Swoosh made a technology to efficiently transfer large files of digital data; one of its investors was Cuban. Sean Stanton, Red Swoosh's former vice president for sales, said of Kalanick: "Scour was about efficiency. Swoosh was about efficiency. It's just the way his brain is wired. It's like the way Uber works right now: What's the fastest, cheapest and most efficient way to get from point A to point B? That consumes him, and all parts of his life." With Red Swoosh, Kalanick started exhibiting his hallmark aggressiveness. When the company struggled, Kalanick and a partner took the tax dollars from employee paychecks - which are supposed to be withheld and sent to the IRS - and reinvested the money into the startup, even as friends and advisers warned him the action was potentially illegal. In 2007, Kalanick sold Red Swoosh to Akamai, a cloud services company, for roughly $19 million. The deal turned the executive, who had headed north to San Francisco, into a millionaire. By then, some advisers had soured on him. "The Travis Kalanick I came to know 17 years ago was relentless in pursuit of his goals at the expense of those who supported him along the way, deluded by his own embellished personal narrative, and a serial prevaricator," said Peter Yorke, a former Red Swoosh adviser and a longtime tech executive. Others stuck by him. Michael Robertson, chief executive of MP3.com, an early digital music sharing service, said that he told Kalanick, "Sometimes in business you have to battle the establishment, and it can get brutal and ugly." In San Francisco, Kalanick and Angie You, his longtime girlfriend, bought a townhouse nestled in the upper hills of the city's Castro section. Though the couple have since split, the two remain close and still speak on a regular basis. Uber's Rise The idea for Uber came in 2009 from Garrett Camp, a friend of Kalanick's, who became fixated on hailing a private luxury car with a smartphone app after being unable to catch cabs in San Francisco. Camp talked about the idea incessantly, including at Kalanick's townhouse, nicknamed the "Jam Pad." Entrepreneurs frequently stopped by to brainstorm there, and the house even had its own Twitter account, controlled by Kalanick. UberCab, as it was called at the time, started its service in San Francisco in May 2010. Camp and Kalanick picked that name to emphasize the convenience of calling a car on demand from an app. Kalanick wanted a break from full-time startup life after running Red Swoosh, so he and Camp named Ryan Graves, who responded to a call for help on Twitter, as chief executive. A few months later, Kalanick changed his mind and took over as UberCab's chief. He quickly positioned the startup as an alternative to the taxi industry. At the time, taxi companies had iron grips in many towns. City-by-city regulations required procedures like base stations for cabs, safety measures and other stipulations. Kalanick ignored those rules. "We're in a political campaign," he once said at a technology conference, and the candidate is Uber. The opponent is named Taxi, he said, adding a rude descriptive. "Nobody likes him, he's not a nice character, but he's so woven into the political machinery and fabric that a lot of people owe him favors." Kalanick carried that same level of intensity into Uber's headquarters, pacing briskly while working by doing laps around the office. His pacing is so legendary, his father once said, that he wore a hole in the carpeting. Kalanick focused on expanding UberCab quickly. The company typically sent a small strike team into a new city - say, Seattle - to aggressively recruit new drivers through Craigslist and other online listings. Then the team marketed UberCab's app to increase ridership. That drew attention from regulators. In October 2010, the company shortened its name to Uber after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from San Francisco officials for marketing itself as a taxi company without the proper licenses and permits. Kalanick was eventually coaxed more into the limelight by others. Shervin Pishevar, an Uber investor, sometimes took Kalanick to clubs in Los Angeles on the weekend, providing a car and a change of "club clothes." Pishevar, who did not respond to a request for comment, was the Uber chief's entryway into Los Angeles' world of celebrity. Hollywood stars were eager to buy into Uber, which they had started using to get around. Actors like Edward Norton, Olivia Munn and Sophia Bush took small stakes in the company. Kalanick and a top lieutenant, Emil Michael, sometimes hung out with Leonardo DiCaprio, who is also an investor, and Jay Z, whose wife, Beyoncé, performed for Uber employees at a poolside party in Las Vegas in 2015. Jay Z once wired money to Michael in an attempt to invest even more in Uber. Michael and Kalanick, giddy at rebuffing a celebrity, wired some of the money back, saying they already had too many interested investors. Representatives for Jay Z did not respond to requests for comment. Kalanick also dreamed of luring celebrities into advisory roles at Uber. One aim was persuading Oprah Winfrey to join the board - something Uber executives believed could happen after Kalanick met Winfrey at a party on the Spanish island of Ibiza - but the idea never jelled. A spokeswoman for Winfrey declined to comment. Kalanick began mixing with elite business executives. He developed a close relationship with Cohn, then a top-ranking executive at Goldman Sachs. At one point, the two men spoke on a near daily basis. Cohn and a White House spokeswoman did not return requests for comment. Leadership Principles Inside Uber, Kalanick began codifying the pillars of the company's culture. He particularly admired Amazon, the e-commerce company that espouses 14 leadership principles including "learn and be curious" and "insist on the highest standards." So he created 14 values for Uber, with tenets such as being "super pumped" and "always be hustlin.'" Some employees admired Kalanick's deep involvement in Uber. "TK was hands-on and in the product weeds," said Chris Messina, who left Uber in January, using Kalanick's nickname. "He cared deeply about the product and the people building it." Kalanick's main mantra was "growth above all else." That meant Uber's top performers were often promoted and protected. When one general manager, a title for a city-level chief, threw a coffee mug at a subordinate in a fit of rage, the incident was reported to human resources - but there was no follow up. At the time, Uber's business in the general manager's city was strong. Other complaints also fell on deaf ears. After a backlash over Uber's use of "surge pricing" (raising ride prices when demand is high) amid an East Coast snowstorm in 2013, Kalanick's response to upset riders was a torrent of economics and math. "We did more trips because of our approach, not fewer," he said in an interview with Wired at the time. "We gave people more options to get around, and that is the whole frickin' goal." Friends and employees told Kalanick that he should at least pretend to care about how it looked to take such a hostile stance with Uber's users. Several described him as "emotionally unintelligent." Kalanick made other missteps. In 2014, he and his then-girlfriend, Gabi Holzwarth, went out in South Korea with Michael and other Uber employees, to drink and sing karaoke. The establishment was an escort bar, where customers may pay for the company of women, and some members of the party picked out dates for the evening. The incident, reported by The Information, resulted in a human resources complaint from an employee who attended. The same year, Kalanick discussed how Uber had boosted his desirability with women in an interview with GQ, calling the company "boober." And just days after a former employee published a blog post in February detailing sexual harassment at Uber, Kalanick attended Vanity Fair's Academy Awards party in Hollywood, stunning some colleagues with his perceived insensitivity. His desire for growth also knew few limits. Uber plunged into China in 2013, and Kalanick spent billions of dollars to outgun the local incumbent Didi Chuxing - only to have to retreat last year, partly because of heavy losses. Kalanick is now spending heavily in India to win there, even offering to become an Indian citizen if it will help Uber's prospects. The company has said that it lost $2.8 billion in 2016, excluding China. For the Win With Kalanick setting the tone at Uber, employees acted to ensure the ride-hailing service would win no matter what. They spent much of their energy one-upping rivals like Lyft. Uber devoted teams to competitive intelligence, purchasing data from an analytics service called Slice Intelligence. Using an email digest service it owns named Unroll.me, Slice collected its customers' emailed Lyft receipts from their inboxes and sold the anonymized data to Uber. Uber used the data as a proxy for the health of Lyft's business. (Lyft, too, operates a competitive intelligence team.) Slice confirmed that it sells anonymized data (meaning that customers' names are not attached) based on ride receipts from Uber and Lyft, but declined to disclose who buys the information. Uber also tried to win over Lyft's drivers. Uber's "driver satisfaction rating," an internal metric, has dropped since February 2016, and roughly one-quarter of its drivers turn over on average every three months. According to an internal slide deck on driver income levels viewed by The New York Times, Uber considered Lyft and McDonald's its main competition for attracting new drivers. To frustrate Lyft drivers, Uber dispatched some employees to order and cancel Lyft rides en masse. Others hailed Lyfts and spent the rides persuading drivers to switch to Uber full time. After Kalanick heard that Lyft was working on a carpooling feature, Uber created and started its own carpooling option, UberPool, in 2014, two days before Lyft unveiled its project. That year, Uber came close to buying Lyft. At a meeting at Kalanick's house, and over cartons of Chinese food, he and Michael hosted Lyft's president, John Zimmer, who asked for 15 percent of Uber in exchange for selling Lyft. Over the next hour, Kalanick and Michael repeatedly laughed at Zimmer's audacious request. No deal was reached. Lyft declined to comment. The rivalry remains in force. In 2016, Uber held a summit meeting in Mexico City for some top managers, where it distributed a playbook on how to cut into Lyft's business and had sessions on how to damage its competitor. To develop its own business, Uber sidestepped authorities. Some employees started using a tool called Greyball to deceive officials trying to shut down Uber's service. The tool, developed to aid driver safety and to trick fraudsters, essentially showed a fake version of Uber's app to some people to disguise the locations of cars and drivers. It soon became a way for Uber drivers to evade capture by law enforcement in places where the service was deemed illegal. After The Times reported on Greyball in March, Uber said it would prohibit employees from using the tool against law enforcement. The idea of fooling Apple, the main distributor of Uber's app, began in 2014. At the time, Uber was dealing with widespread account fraud in places like China, where tricksters bought stolen iPhones that were erased and resold. Some Uber drivers there would then create dozens of fake email addresses to sign up for new Uber rider accounts attached to each phone, and request rides from those phones, which they would then accept. Since Uber was handing out incentives to drivers to take more rides, the drivers could earn more money this way. To halt the activity, Uber engineers assigned a persistent identity to iPhones with a small piece of code, a practice called "fingerprinting." Uber could then identify an iPhone and prevent itself from being fooled even after the device was erased of its contents. There was one problem: Fingerprinting iPhones broke Apple's rules. Cook believed that wiping an iPhone should ensure that no trace of the owner's identity remained on the device. So Kalanick told his engineers to "geofence" Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California, a way to digitally identify people reviewing Uber's software in a specific location. Uber would then obfuscate its code for people within that geofenced area, essentially drawing a digital lasso around those it wanted to keep in the dark. Apple employees at its headquarters were unable to see Uber's fingerprinting. The ruse did not last. Apple engineers outside of Cupertino caught on to Uber's methods, prompting Cook to call Kalanick to his office. Kalanick was shaken by Cook's scolding, according to a person who saw him after the meeting. But only momentarily. After all, Kalanick had faced off against Apple, and Uber had survived. He had lived to fight another day.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 24 April 2017 | MYT 11:00 AM Apple funds new programme to turn young artistes into pop stars Apple executives hope the campaign will attract more artistes and customers to its two-year-old music service, which has signed up more than 20 million customers since June 2015. — AFP Apple Inc is introducing a programme to promote young musicians with a month-long barrage of videos, playlists and new music, deepening the technology giant’s direct investment in artistes through Apple Music.  The first performer to benefit from the Up Next programme is 6lack, a 24-year-old Atlanta singer who released his debut album last fall. On April 20, Apple released a short documentary about 6lack, as well as video of a live recording session taped in Atlanta and an interview on Beats 1, Apple Music’s radio station.  Beats 1 host Zane Lowe will introduce 6lack (pronounced “black”) on James Corden’s late-night talk show Thursday evening on CBS, and over the course of the next month, Apple will promote 6lack’s songs on Apple Music playlists, Beats 1 and the iTunes store. Similar promotions with other artistes will follow in the months to come.  Apple executives hope the campaign will attract more artistes and customers to its two-year-old music service, which has signed up more than 20 million customers since June 2015. With rivals YouTube, Pandora Media Inc and Spotify Ltd all offering support to musicians, Cupertino, California-based Apple is eager to show artistes it can help them become stars, and to lure fans with exclusive video and music.  “It’s hard if you are a new artiste,” Lowe said in an interview. “That’s why they’ve all turned to digital platforms and social media.’”  Lowe spoke from Apple’s office in Culver City, a town nestled in the middle of Los Angeles, where the technology giant is building a greater presence as its entertainment ambitions grow. Lowe joined Apple a couple of years ago from the radio station BBC Radio 1, where he cultivated a reputation as an influential tastemaker and host. Apple, creator of iTunes and the iPod, had just spent US$3bil (RM13.19bil) acquiring Beats Music to gain a foothold in the music business’s next area of growth: online streaming.  Streaming services have supplanted CDs and iTunes downloads as the dominant way the music business makes money. The growing number of people willing to pay a monthly fee for access to playlists and a large catalogue of songs has boosted music industry sales two years in a row.  Now these services are remaking the industry by performing many of the functions once performed by music blogs, record labels and radio. Pandora offers musicians data on where their fans are, to inform their tour stops. YouTube has funded the production of music videos, and Spotify has hosted live recording sessions all over the US.  To be sure, Apple’s deal with 6lack is part of a wide-ranging promotional campaign by the artiste’s label. Interscope Records, a division of Universal Music Group, signed 6lack last year and has been aggressively marketing his music on urban radio and the press, with coverage in magazines like XXL and GQ.  Interscope was co-founded by Jimmy Iovine, who now runs Apple Music. The streaming service has pitched itself as having a more human touch than its peers, which rely on algorithms to program radio stations and playlists. Iovine employs a cadre of music superfans and veteran industry executives who will pick which artistes to showcase each month on Up Next.  Lowe devotes 90% of his daily show to new music, and routinely tweets out a list of younger artistes he plans to showcase on any given day. “New music is consistently undervalued in the mainstream media,” Lowe said. “It gets the least rotation. It’s the thing that gets talked about the least in mainstream TV.”  6lack came to Apple’s attention courtesy of Carl Chery, a music journalist who joined Apple as the company prepared for the introduction of Apple Music. Chery identifies artistes with the potential to be stars and champions them within Apple, pushing for their music to be featured on playlists, on the radio and in commercials.  Chery was instrumental in the success of Bryson Tiller and Chance the Rapper, two acts he met well before they gained mainstream success. Their rise to stardom earned Chery a promotion to oversee all artiste curation at Apple Music.  “Carl got notoriety for what Apple Music did for Bryson,” recalled Tunde Balogun, 6lack’s manager and a leader of Atlanta music company LoveRenaissance. Balogun talks to Chery every week, and introduced him to 6lack with a copy of two singles, Prblms and Bless Me.  Prblms stuck out as an inevitable hit, so Chery placed the song on the Mood playlist. Prblms ranked as one of the 100 most popular songs on Apple Music within a couple days. “I’ve never seen anything that fast from someone no one knows,” Chery said.  The song would eventually spend 16 weeks on the Billboard charts. Balogun now considers Chery a member of 6lack’s team. With the promotion from Apple, this summer is shaping up to be the biggest moment of 6lack’s career. Next week, after the performance on Corden’s show, 6lack will go on tour with pop star The Weeknd and hip-hop duo Rae Sremmurd. He will use data from Apple (and its rivals) to help decide when to release new music, and where to tour.  “Streaming services are where you discover music,” Balogun said. “They are a one-stop shop that gives you better tools to help your artistes succeed.” — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested How to prevent your child from spending money on your smartphone Switch from 3G to 4G SIM card to enter Maxis' RM1mil giveaway campaign Nier: Automata – For the glory of mankind Robots, chefs hope to bring invasive lion fish to restaurants near you How to own your first home with zero down payment Pedalling to save the planet Others Also Read Pacquiao lands Down Under, tells Horn to be ready Police to quiz TV presenter over Watson Nyambek insult RM100mil paint job for public housing projects advertisement Latest News Apple funds new programme to turn young artistes into pop stars Galaxy C9 Pro: On cloud nine Nier: Automata – For the glory of mankind Old droids, new tricks What’s the iPhone’s future?

Reuters/Maxim Zmeyev/File Photo An alleged leaked image of the Apple iPhone 8 has highlighted a feature that has not gone down well with fans. The leak shows the fingerprint scanner has been moved to the rear of the phone. The relocated scanner is causing much outrage. Android fans have got used to this feature, Apple users were fast to point out how ridiculous and impractical the move is. The scanner in most Android devices is at the back but in a comfortable position. The Samsung Galaxy S8 was also criticised for putting the scanner at the back. However, if the latest iPhone 8 leak is true, the scanner seems to be at the centre of the rear. It’s far below the Apple logo. Users on Reddit have gone berserk and many have described the move as worse than the S8. It will indeed be very cumbersome to take the index finger to the revealed position while holding the phone in the hand. Certain Redditors are optimistic though, and are certain that the hole showed in the leaked image is not the fingerprint scanner but something else. Some simply refused to believe that Apple would make the silly mistake of putting the scanner below the logo and at the centre. There are still others who stated that even if the scanner is placed where the leaked image shows, it’s still worth it as they would be getting a larger screen. Apple is expected to be unveiling three iPhones this year with the premium model having a 5.8-inch curved OLED display. The premium model is also coming with a full-glass body. Apple is surely dropping the physical Home button to have an edge-to-edge display and minimal bezels. According to News.com.au, many are questioning Apple as why the company is not making its logo double as the fingerprint scanner. The logo seems to be in a perfect position and can easily function as the fingerprint scanner. The Apple iPhone 8 is a hugely-expected device along with the Galaxy Note 8. As per KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the Galaxy Note 8 will likely match the iPhone 8 is several key areas. It will be a divergence from the recently-released Galaxy S8. Note 8 may go with a dual-camera setup. Kuo believes that the dual-camera setup will be better than the iPhone 7 Plus’ and will match the performance of the OLED iPhone 8. The Note 8 will have a bigger display than its predecessors and will come with a 4K resolution.   iPhone 8 looks to be taking a new direction pic.twitter.com/mG19bcDYiC &mdash; Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 19, 2017   Submit Correction 0 0 0 Related Samsung sees red as fans complain of a Galaxy S8 display problem Xiaomi Mi 6 stuns Galaxy S8 and iPhone 7 Plus Join the Discussion 0 0 0 Search Most Shared Most Read 1 'Grand Theft Auto Online' turns back time with upcoming 'Tiny Racer' add-on 0 Shares 2 Four things to know about the Lyrid meteor shower 2017 in Australia 0 Shares 3 By the numbers: Rafael Nadal makes history with 10th Monte Carlo Masters title 0 Shares 4 ‘Outlander’ season 3: Filming challenges teased 0 Shares 5 Rafael Nadal vs Albert Ramos-Vinolas live stream: How to watch Monte Carlo Masters final online 0 Shares 6 Canada study shows string support towards marijuana legalisation 0 Shares 7 Roger Federer is on same level as Pele, Michael Jordan and Muhammad Ali, says Boris Becker 0 Shares 8 'Shades of Blue' Season 2 episode 8 'Unpaid Debts' spoilers: Wozniak struggles with difficult choices 0 Shares 9 ‘Vikings’ season 5 info reveals Katheryn Winnick’s Lagertha to appear in only a handful of episodes; No Ragnar sighting indicated 0 Shares 10 ‘Winds of Winter’ won’t be out before July 0 Shares Follow Us Please enter a valid email Like us Follow us Full site feed United CEO finally apologises to dragged passenger, says company will ‘work to make it right’ New Optus and Yes TV fixed broadband plans Salim Mehajer faces two charges in a 24-hour period Volkswagen to sell diesel-powered cars in the US Mike Pence assures Trump’s tax reform will benefit Australia Aramco CEO says global oil market moves closer to balance despite US boom More Business Economy Markets Companies Real Estate Banking & Finance FDA to require restaurants to post nutritional info for their menu starting May 5 Melania Trump welcomes Queen Rania of Jordan, heads to an all-girls school Pump hydro storage can help build 100 percent renewable energy grid Study shows Western Australians are unhappiest at work; older, female employees are more satisfied Egyptians unite after church bombing; Abdel Fatah el-Sisi declares state of emergency Trump to visit China; Xi approves 100-day trade talks plan More News Australia Asia Pacific Africa The Americas Europe Middle East Manny Pacquiao guranteed rematch clause for bout against Jeff Horn By the numbers: Rafael Nadal makes history with 10th Monte Carlo Masters title Luol Deng hints at moving to power forward, ready for possible exit with Lakers Cleveland Cavaliers vs Indiana Pacers live stream: Watch 2017 NBA Playoffs online, Game 4 preview, start time Struggling Novak Djokovic should seek advice from Roger Federer, says mentor With Indiana Pacers swept, a Paul George trade is coming More Sports AFL NRL Rugby Union Cricket Soccer Tennis Motor Sports Basketball NFL Fight Sports More Persona 5 review: why it was worth the wait Project Scorpio price leaked Tesla recalling 53,000 Model S and Model X vehicles due to faulty parking brakes Corsair Hydro GFX GTX 1080 Ti specs, price and release details Apple creates artificial sweat to test Apple Watch OnePlus 3T vs Samsung Galaxy S8 More Life Environment & Science Health & Wellbeing Gaming Technology Travel & Food Fashion & Beauty Art & Design 'Pretty Little Liars' Season 7B has nine episodes left Spider-Man confirmed for untitled 'Avengers 4' 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' has five post-credit scenes ‘Bloodline’ season 3 spoilers: More violence and betrayal await the Rayburn family ‘Boruto Naruto Next Generations’ episode 3 review ‘Offspring’ season 7 spoilers: Nina struggles between love and family More Entertainment Movies TV Celebrities Music McLaren 570GT Review: Grand, But No Touring Car IBTimes Newsletters Sign up to get the latest headlines delivered to your inbox every morning.

The premium model, dubbed the iPhone Edition, is also tipped to have a full-glass body. Similar to the Samsung S8, Apple is tipped to remove the physical home button from the phone to allow for an edge-to-edge display with little to no bezels. Last week, a leaker with a proven record of getting accurate information about Apple products shared a schematic of the forthcoming device, which showed the fingerprint scanner had been moved to the rear of the phone - a necessity given the removal of the home button. While Android phones have used this feature for years, Apple users have been outraged about the relocated fingerprint scanner. And they have very good reason to be, if the schematic is indeed accurate. iPhone 8 looks to be taking a new direction pic.twitter.com/mG19bcDYiC— Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 19, 2017 After the picture was leaked last week, iPhone users were fast to point out just how ridiculously impractical the positioning of the new fingerprint scanner was. With most Android devices, the scanner is located at the rear of the device, but at the top where it is natural for your finger to sit. Even though the S8 has been criticised for placing it next to the camera, at least it is located in a comfortable position. One Reddit user explained why the button's new position would be a terrible move from Apple. "Just try holding your iPhone now and reaching your index finger that far below the Apple logo. If this is true, it is a disastrous placement of touch ID, even worse than the S8 in my opinion," they wrote. The physical home bottom will be replaced with virtual controls, meaning the fingerprint scanner will be relocated to the rear of the device.Source:Supplied "It isn't the end of the world, but as far as that specific functionality is a downgrade. However, the trade-off is worth it. A much bigger screen for the same dimensions," added another. A common theme on the thread was users questioning why Apple would not make its logo double as the fingerprint scanner.  "The Apple logo should be Touch ID. That would look badass," wrote one user. "The logo is in almost the perfect location for one handed use. If it was in the middle of the screen that would be pretty awkward," added another. Other Reddit users saw the negatives in the placement, but remained optimistic. "I have faith that if Apple were to use the non-optimal solution of placing touch on the back, they'd put it in a more ergonomically friendly location than so far below the Apple logo. So I think that, if this render is legit, the hole is for something else," one wrote. "It isn't the end of the world, but as far as that specific functionality is a downgrade.

Times reports Bloomberg News Travis Kalanick, co-founder and chief executive officer of Uber Technologies Inc. By MikeMurphy Editor Uber Technologies Inc. has a long history of flaunting government regulations, but it was its violation of a rule by Apple Inc. that almost sank its business. In a Sunday profile of Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick, the New York Times reported that in 2015, Apple CEO Tim Cook scolded Kalanick during a face-to-face meeting for tweaking coding to track iPhones even after users deleted the Uber app. “So, I’ve heard you’ve been breaking some of our rules,” Cook said, according to the Times, as he told Kalanick to knock it off or Uber would be banned from the App Store — a prospect that would have been disastrous for Uber. Kalanick “was shaken” by Cook’s scolding, the Times said, and agreed to stop tracking the phones. According to the Times, the trouble started in 2014 when Uber drivers in China tried to game the system to make it look like they were getting more riders — and thus, entitled to more money. Drivers would buy iPhones on the black market, wipe their memory and create new “customer” accounts., then repeat the process. Uber caught on, and devised a trick to counter the memory wipes, leaving a digital “fingerprint” on the phone that could identify the device even if it had been wiped. Apple’s AAPL, -0.12%   privacy policy, however, requires that the device be wiped 100% clean, with no lingering coding. Uber engineers went a step further and covered their tracks through geofencing, essentially blocking their telltale coding from being seen by users in the area around Apple’s Cupertino, Calif., headquarters. Later Sunday, Uber defended the practice, calling such tracking a common industry anti-fraud technique. “We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they’ve deleted the app,” Uber said in a statement. “As the New York Times story notes towards the very end, this is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone — over and over again. Similar techniques are also used for detecting and blocking suspicious logins to protect our users’ accounts. Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back onto our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users.” The digital-outlaw image and ends-justify-the-means business practices helped build privately-held Uber to a valuation of $68 billion, but have also raised serious concerns. In recent months, Uber has come under fire for evading regulators through its “Greyball” program, been accused of rampant sexual harassment, been sued by Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo for allegedly stealing driverless-car trade secrets and faces a possible $1.1 million fine by California regulators for its handling of drunken-driver complaints. It has also seen an exodus of top executives. Kalanick, meanwhile, is seeking to hire a chief operating officer who can help the company grow up.

News 1 0 0 April 23, 2017 Uber Tracks User Devices After Their App Gets Deleted, CEO In Trouble? John Leuven Uber CEO Travis Kalanick once drew the ire of Apple’s Chief Executive, Tim Cook. It appears that the app for the ride-hailing service has been tracking users’ devices, even after they deleted the Uber app. A report by the New York Times stated that Kalanick met Cook once in 2015; a session the former was “dreading.” It seems that Kalanick was trying to get his employees to help him camouflage the Uber app so that Apple engineers could not identify the bold move. But Apple had detected the violation anyway, as Cook gave Kalanick an ultimatum. They broke Apple’s rules, and getting on the bad side of the Apple exec would be the last thing they want to have on their plate right now. Cook demanded for Uber to “Stop the trickery,” lest their app be kicked out of the App Store. Tim Cook, Apple CEO [Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] Uber and its CEO released a statement in defense against the allegations of terms violations. They said, in a recent response as reported by TechCrunch, that what they did was “common industry practice used to prevent fraud and account compromise.” They added that what they did was one way of controlling an exploit that can potentially grant drivers rewards they did not actually earn. Uber rewards their drivers based on the number of rides they get. Theoretically, drivers can install the Uber app on multiple phones and get fake rides credited to their accounts. Uber stated that this was one of the schemes they were trying to protect themselves against. By using a “device fingerprinting” technique, they could minimize the risk of fraud in busier locales like China. On the other hand, Will Strafach, president of the Sudo Security Group, analyzed the code for the 2014 version of Uber’s app and declared that he found out how the ride-hailing app is tracking devices. The TechCrunch report mentioned above contained the technical specifics, but suffice it to say, he found protocols that were “very much forbidden.” He did add that “tracking after uninstall” was just a case of bad phrasing; what the app actually did was “tracking between reinstall/uninstall.” Yet he also implied that it changes nothing, as this kind of tracking is still forbidden by Apple. The Uber App, alleged to have malicious code that tracked devices even after uninstalling. [Image by Carl Court/Getty Images] What’s more, Uber “geofenced” Apple’s Cupertino headquarters so that engineers in that location would not find out about the incriminating code. However, Apple engineers in other locations found out about it anyway, which led to the discovery. This was actually what prompted Apple CEO Tim Cook to summon Kalanick to a meeting. Uber did comply with Cook’s demands. However, the company admitted that they are still fingerprinting devices, primarily to protect themselves against fraudulent behavior. They did not discontinue fingerprinting; more like they just modified the code so that it would comply with Apple’s standards. “We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they’ve deleted the app,” an Uber spokesperson said. “The New York Times story noted that this is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone — over and over again.” It seems that Uber is taking steps to ensure that their app does not violate any more rules. In 2016, for example, it was reported that they have been tracking users even when the app is not in use. They responded by saying that it only tracks users about five minutes before or after a ride, to ensure a more accurate pickup location. In addition, tracking is based on user accounts, and not on devices. The user must also enable location services for it to work.

Noting that he would soon be meeting top officials of the US-based firm to discuss its plans to make its mobile phones in India, Prasad said as India was a huge market, making in India for the domestic and export markets was important. “They (Apple) are very keen. Its executives are going to meet me in a couple of days though I need not share with you what they are going to discuss with me,” quipped Prasad after an interactive meet with captains of the IT industry, organised by the state-run Software Technology Parks of India here.

Travis Kalanick, 40, the oft-criticized head of Uber, was summoned for what turned out to be a tense meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook in 2015 at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California, according to The New York Times. Apple had caught on to Uber’s attempt to circumvent its guidelines by secretly identifying and tagging iPhones with a digital ‘fingerprint’ even after the Uber app had been deleted from its devices. In order to protect the privacy of its users, Apple mandates that all iPhones which are ‘wiped clean’ do not contain traces of apps that were used.

The two are seen in a May 2016 file photo in New York Uber, however, hoped that Apple wouldn’t notice, according to Gizmodo. In 2014, Uber wanted to trick Apple because it had discovered that many of its drivers in places like China were buying stolen iPhones on the black market and creating fictional email addresses and account. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Outsiders Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen sweep to victory... Marking her territory! Amber Heard CONFIRMS relationship... Share this article Share The drivers would then cash in on Uber incentives to hail more rides by ordering them from the numerous accounts, thereby earning more money from the company even though in reality there was no growth of its customer base. Uber wanted its ‘fingerprinting’ mechanism to continue keeping tabs on iPhones in order to crack down on the incentive fraud. In order to evade detection by Apple, Uber’s engineers used a technique called ‘geofencing,’ which meant that their app was programmed not to show its ‘fingerprinting’ technology on all iPhone devices located in the area near Apple headquarters in northern California. But the ruse did not work, as Apple’s engineers who live outside of the ‘geofenced’ area figured out what Uber was doing. Apple had caught on to Uber’s attempt to circumvent its guidelines by secretly identifying and tagging iPhones with a digital ‘fingerprint’ even after the Uber app had been deleted from its devices The Apple chief told Kalanick that if his company continued with the practice, Uber would be kicked out of the App Store. That meant a loss of millions of drivers – and an end to Uber This prompted Cook to invite Kalanick to his office for a Silicon Valley showdown. “So, I’ve heard you’ve been breaking some of our rules,” Cook, 56, told Kalanick. The Apple chief told the young executive that if his company continued with the practice, Uber would be kicked out of the App Store. That meant a loss of millions of drivers – and an end to Uber. Kalanick, shaken by the threat, had no choice but to back down. Uber’s chief executive has been wrestling with a series of high-profile scandals and departures of top talent in recent weeks. Earlier this week, it was announced that former Attorney General Eric Holder was granted an extension by Uber’s board so that he could pursue an investigation into alleged widespread sexual harassment. Kalanick called for the 'urgent investigation' in February after explosive claims from former employees emerged. The probe has included 'information received from hundreds of employees through interviews and anonymous online focus groups', according to the newly leaked memo. 'We anticipate the report by the end of May,' Arianna Huffington, an Uber board member, wrote in the leaked memo to Uber staff.

The filed documents provide us with some interesting new information regarding Apple’s training program for its nascent self-driving car initiative. Don't Miss: Someone rendered that leaked iPhone 8 design, and it looks even worse than we thought According to training materials which correspond to software Apple calls the “Apple Automated System”, it appears that Apple engineers have been busy developing a suite of software and hardware sensors designed to assist a car drive with the flow of traffic while avoiding other vehicles and pedestrians. According to the training packet, the car that Apple’s staffers are using to test the self-driving technology is outfitted with consumer video game gear such as a Logitech steering wheel and pedals to actuate drive by wire. Whereas Apple’s earlier car efforts seemed to entail hiring hundreds of employees with vast automotive experience across all aspects of the car development and manufacturing process, it stands to reason that Apple, for the time being, has decided to primarily focus its attention on self-driving technologies. With cars boasting Apple’s mysterious autonomous software having been approved for use on the road, California law holds that the drivers/passengers overseeing the testing must be sufficiently trained and ready to assume control of the wheel at any moment. Apple applied for a permit for six drivers to drive three Lexus RX450h SUVs. Apple’s drivers, named in the application, are mostly Ph.D.s specializing in machine learning, some of whom previously worked for companies like Bosch and Tesla, according to their LinkedIn profiles. Apple said its vehicles would be able to capture and store “relevant data before a collision occurs” in its application. That Apple is exploring self-driving technologies may not be all that surprising, but the more interesting question is if it really matters. As it stands now, we can only presume that Apple’s progress with its own technology isn’t anywhere close to matching what established automakers and a myriad of start-up companies have already developed. Going forward, it will be interesting to see if Apple’s foray into the self-driving world will ever yield a marketable product or if it will simply become an Apple research initiative that never sees the light of day. Apple’s full permit application can be viewed over here via AppleInsider.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Apple Valley High, Rio Vista recognized as state Honor Roll schools Sunday Apr 23, 2017 at 6:59 PM Apr 23, 2017 at 6:59 PM By Staff Reports APPLE VALLEY — Apple Valley Unified School District recently announced that two of its schools have been selected for 2016 California Honor Roll recognition. Apple Valley High School and Rio Vista School of Applied Learning were both chosen by the Educational Results Partnership (ERP) and the Campaign for Business and Education Excellence (CBEE) as two of 1,866 public schools in the state to receive the Honor Roll status. The Honor Roll is part of a national effort to recognize schools which demonstrate consistent high levels of student academic achievement, school officials said, as well as improvement in reducing achievement gaps among student populations. For high schools, the Honor Roll also includes measures of college readiness. “We are proud to recognize those schools and school districts who are succeeding in putting their students on a path of productivity that not only leads to success in the classroom, but also prepares them to contribute to and benefit from a more productive economy,” ERP and CBEE Board Chairman Greg Jones said. “Leadership from both education and the business community is critical to linking success from one system to the next, and ensuring that students have the knowledge and skills necessary to achieve a college degree and the financial security of a living wage job.” Honor Roll schools are either named “Scholar Schools” or, like AVHS and Rio Vista, “Star Schools.” Star Schools are those with significant populations of socio-economically disadvantaged students that have shown a significant increase in grade-level proficiency over time, AVUSD officials said. “We are so proud to be recognized by leaders in the California business community as an Honor Roll school,” AVUSD spokesperson Kristin Hernandez said. “Our teachers and administrators work tirelessly to keep the focus on high expectations and student academic achievement and to continuously improve our practices. This hard work and dedication is paying off for all of our students, no matter their background.” A full list of the Honor Roll schools, districts, and the STEM awardees can be found at  http://edresults.org/HonorRoll/HonorRoll?State=CA or follow Jim Lanich, President and CEO at @JLanich or email help@edresults.org.

Their renewable energy projects will produce over 12 MW of solar power — more than the energy they need for Apple manufacturing — and support Japan’s nationwide efforts to limit its carbon emissions. “These innovative new clean energy investments demonstrate our commitment to doing business responsibly and economically,” said Kyoichi Yamanaka, Managing Director of Ibiden’s Environment Group. “Our products help Apple devices run smarter, and now we’re powering our operations with smarter energy too. We’re pleased to partner with Apple and lead the way in helping Japan meet its clean energy goals.” Apple and its suppliers will be generating over 2.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy for the manufacturing of Apple products by the end of 2018 — equal to taking over 400,000 cars off the road for a year. Apple has taken significant steps to protect the environment by transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy. Today, the company is powering 100 percent of its operations in 23 countries, and more than 93 percent of its worldwide operations, with renewable energy.

Apple seems certain to announce three iPhones later this year, with a premium model having a 5.8-inch, curved OLED display. The premium model, dubbed the iPhone Edition, is also tipped to have a full-glass body. Similar to the Samsung S8, Apple is tipped to remove the physical home button from the phone to allow for an edge-to-edge display with little to no bezels. Last week, a leaker with a proven record of getting accurate information about Apple products shared a schematic of the forthcoming device, which showed the fingerprint scanner had been moved to the rear of the phone - a necessity given the removal of the home button. While Android phones have used this feature for years, Apple users have been outraged about the relocated fingerprint scanner. And they have very good reason to be, if the schematic is indeed accurate. After the picture was leaked last week, iPhone users were fast to point out just how ridiculously impractical the positioning of the new fingerprint scanner was. With most Android devices, the scanner is located at the rear of the device, but at the top where it is natural for your finger to sit. Even though the S8 has been criticised for placing it next to the camera, at least it is located in a comfortable position. iPhone 8 looks to be taking a new direction pic.twitter.com/mG19bcDYiC— Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 19, 2017 Continued below. Related Content No call on Edgecumbe support package Tauranga worker must pay $66,681 damages after bidding for contract against employer Your Views: Readers Letters One Reddit user explained why the button's new position would be a terrible move from Apple. "Just try holding your iPhone now and reaching your index finger that far below the Apple logo. If this is true, it is a disastrous placement of touch ID, even worse than the S8 in my opinion," they wrote. Other Reddit users saw the negatives in the placement, but remained optimistic. "I have faith that if Apple were to use the non-optimal solution of placing touch on the back, they'd put it in a more ergonomically friendly location than so far below the Apple logo. So I think that, if this render is legit, the hole is for something else," one wrote. "It isn't the end of the world, but as far as that specific functionality is a downgrade. However, the trade-off is worth it. A much bigger screen for the same dimensions," added another. A common theme on the thread was users questioning why Apple would not make its logo double as the fingerprint scanner. "The Apple logo should be Touch ID. That would look badass," wrote one user. "The logo is in almost the perfect location for one handed use. If it was in the middle of the screen that would be pretty awkward," added another. - news.com.au By Matthew Dunn Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

And as the cashless society takes hold, you can bid goodbye too to your credit and debit cards.  The only thing you’ll need when you leave the house will be your keys and your phone. Just last month, Apple Pay arrived in Ireland. Its main rival, Android Pay preceded it by about three months.  These are known in the trade as Near-field communication, or NFC payment platforms. In a nutshell, they allow you to use your device like a debit or credit card. You download the wallet app to your device and enter your card details into it.  If you wish to make a payment in one of the participating stores, you hold your phone or tablet or smart watch up to the terminal. In most cases, you don’t even have to wake the device up.  The sensor picks up the proximity of the terminal and completes the transaction automatically. You walk out with your purchase and the relevant amount is automatically deducted from your card account. Ulster Bank has launched Apple Pay in Ireland as part of its customer-centric innovation, transforming mobile payments with an easy, secure and private way to pay that’s fast and convenient. Apple Pay was first rolled out in the States more than two and a half years ago. In the first three months of its life, the company reported that over one million cards were registered on the app.  Here in Ireland, two banks are currently embracing the platform. You can use Apple Pay with KBC and Ulster Bank debit and credit cards. The technology works with an iPhone 6 or later, an iPhone SE, iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 3 or later and an Apple Watch paired to an iPhone 5 or later.  Set up Touch ID, Apple’s fingerprint sensor, and you can use Apple Pay to shop in participating websites and apps, without the bother of having to fill out lengthy account forms or shipping and billing info. Two banks have also taken on Android Pay — KBC again, as well as AIB. Android works with Android phones and tablets with Android 4.4 or later. As with Apple Pay, you just install the app and enter your card details. As well as point of sale transactions, you can use the technology on the range of participating websites and apps — which are of course growing in number all the time. So the big question. Is it safe? Yes, says Jillian Heffernan of the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI). “With both Apple Pay and Android Pay, the card number and identity of the cardholder aren’t shared with the retailer,” she says, “and actual card numbers are not stored on your device or on Apple/Google servers. Also, in the event that the cardholder loses their device, they can temporarily suspend or completely delete the ability to use Apple or Android Pay from the device.” While the cut-off point for contactless payments is €30, it’s possible to use Apple Pay and Android Pay for higher value transactions with a number of participating merchants — and there is an extra layer of security in that event. You’ve got to unlock your device and hold the back of it to the contactless payment terminal until you see a checkmark. The phone will beep and/or vibrate to confirm that the payment has been made. Jillian Heffernan says that while cash is still king, the old methods of payment are slowly ceding ground to the new. “While figures show that cash is still the most popular form of payment at point of sale — particularly for lower-value items – consumers are increasingly using debit cards, contactless and other electronic payment options in preference to cash for the greater convenience and security they provide.  "These latest initiatives, and others likely to follow from across the banking sector, will further bolster the use of non-cash payment options.” While the banks rush to reassure you that all of these methods are secure, it’s worth pointing out that the consumer also has a role to play here. Only download mobile apps from official app stores. These include the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and Blackberry App World. Always keep your mobile phone’s operating system updated with the latest upgrades.  Older software may have vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could expose you to security and fraud risks. The BPFI also recommends you do what very few people do, which is to use a reputable brand of anti-virus software on your mobile phone.  Don’t share or give your mobile banking security details, including your passcode, to anyone and never store these on your phone. Finally, remember that public wifi hotspots aren’t always secure.  Only access online/mobile banking on safe networks. READ MORE Visit the section home page here © Irish Examiner Ltd.

RYAN YOUNG NYT Business April 23, 2017 8:41 PM Travis Kalanick built Uber into a multibillion-dollar giant, but his blindness to boundaries nearly toppled it By MIKE ISAAC New York Times News Service LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story SAN FRANCISCO Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber, visited Apple’s headquarters in early 2015 to meet with Timothy D. Cook, who runs the iPhone maker. For months, Kalanick had pulled a fast one on Apple by directing his employees to help camouflage the ride-hailing app from Apple’s engineers. The reason? So Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased — a fraud detection maneuver that violated Apple’s privacy guidelines. But Apple was on to the deception, and when Kalanick arrived at the midafternoon meeting, Cook was prepared. “So, I’ve heard you’ve been breaking some of our rules,” Cook said. Stop the trickery, Cook then demanded, or Uber’s app would be kicked out of Apple’s App Store. If Uber’s app was yanked from the App Store, it would lose access to millions of iPhone customers — essentially destroying the ride-hailing company’s business. So Kalanick acceded. In a quest to build Uber into the world’s dominant ride-hailing entity, Kalanick has openly disregarded many rules and norms, backing down only when caught or cornered. He has flouted transportation and safety regulations, bucked against entrenched competitors and capitalized on legal loopholes and gray areas to gain a business advantage. In the process, Kalanick has helped create a new transportation industry, with Uber spreading to more than 70 countries and gaining a valuation of nearly $70 billion, and its business continues to grow. But the previously unreported encounter with Cook showed how Kalanick was also responsible for risk-taking that pushed Uber beyond the pale. According to interviews with more than 50 current and former Uber employees, investors and others with whom the executive had personal relationships, Kalanick, 40, is driven to the point that he must win at whatever he puts his mind to and at whatever cost — a trait that has now plunged Uber into its most sustained set of crises since its founding in 2009. “Travis’ biggest strength is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals,” said Mark Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks owner and billionaire investor who has mentored Kalanick. “Travis’ biggest weakness is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals. That’s the best way to describe him.” A blindness to boundaries led Kalanick to a pattern of repeatedly going too far at Uber, sabotaging competitors and allowing the company to use a secret tool called Greyball to trick some law enforcement agencies. That quality also extended to his personal life, where Kalanick mixes with celebrities like Jay Z and businessmen including President Donald Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn. For the last few months, Uber has been reeling from allegations of a machismo-fueled workplace where managers routinely overstepped verbally, physically and sometimes sexually with employees. Uber’s detractors have started a grass-roots campaign with the hashtag #deleteUber. Executives have streamed out. Some Uber investors have openly criticized the company. Kalanick’s leadership is at a precarious point. He has publicly apologized for some of his behavior and is interviewing candidates for a chief operating officer. He has also been working with senior managers to reset some of the company’s stated values. Through an Uber spokesman, Kalanick declined an interview request. Apple declined to comment on the meeting with Cook. Many of the people interviewed for this article asked to remain anonymous because they had signed nondisclosure agreements with Uber or feared damaging their relationship with the chief executive. Selling Efficiency After attending the University of California, Los Angeles, to major in computer engineering, Kalanick dropped out in 1998 to form a startup with several classmates. The company, Scour, became a peer-to-peer file exchange similar to Napster. Scour, which was eventually sued for $250 billion for alleged copyright infringement, filed for bankruptcy in October 2000, a move that protected it from the suit. The failure did not stop Kalanick from helping to found another Los Angeles startup, Red Swoosh, four months later. Red Swoosh made a technology to efficiently transfer large files of digital data; one of its investors was Cuban. With Red Swoosh, Kalanick started exhibiting his hallmark aggressiveness. When the company struggled, Kalanick and a partner took the tax dollars from employee paychecks — which are supposed to be withheld and sent to the IRS — and reinvested the money into the startup, even as friends and advisers warned him the action was potentially illegal. In 2007, Kalanick sold Red Swoosh to Akamai, a cloud services company, for roughly $19 million. The deal turned the executive, who had headed north to San Francisco, into a millionaire. Uber’s Rise The idea for Uber came in 2009 from Garrett Camp, a friend of Kalanick’s, who became fixated on hailing a private luxury car with a smartphone app after being unable to catch cabs in San Francisco. UberCab, as it was called at the time, started its service in San Francisco in May 2010. Kalanick quickly positioned the startup as an alternative to the taxi industry. City-by-city regulations required procedures like base stations for cabs, safety measures and other stipulations. Kalanick ignored those rules. The company typically sent a small strike team into a new city to aggressively recruit new drivers through Craigslist and other online listings. Then the team marketed UberCab’s app to increase ridership. That drew attention from regulators. In October 2010, the company shortened its name to Uber after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from San Francisco officials for marketing itself as a taxi company without the proper licenses and permits. Uber plunged into China in 2013, and Kalanick spent billions of dollars to outgun the local incumbent Didi Chuxing — only to have to retreat last year, partly because of heavy losses. Kalanick is now spending heavily in India to win there. For the Win With Kalanick setting the tone at Uber, employees acted to ensure the ride-hailing service would win no matter what. They spent much of their energy one-upping rivals like Lyft. Uber devoted teams to competitive intelligence, purchasing data from an analytics service called Slice Intelligence. Using an email digest service it owns named Unroll.me, Slice collected its customers’ emailed Lyft receipts from their inboxes and sold the anonymized data to Uber. Uber used the data as a proxy for the health of Lyft’s business. Slice confirmed it sells anonymized data based on ride receipts from Uber and Lyft, but declined to disclose who buys the information. The idea of fooling Apple, the main distributor of Uber’s app, began in 2014. At the time, Uber was dealing with widespread account fraud in places like China, where tricksters bought stolen iPhones that were erased of their memory and resold. Some Uber drivers there would then create dozens of fake email addresses to sign up for new Uber rider accounts attached to each phone, and request rides from those phones, which they would then accept. Since Uber was handing out incentives to drivers to take more rides, the drivers could earn more money this way. To halt the activity, Uber engineers assigned a persistent identity to iPhones with a small piece of code, a practice called “fingerprinting.” Uber could then identify an iPhone and prevent itself from being fooled even after the device was erased of its contents. There was one problem: Fingerprinting iPhones broke Apple’s rules. Cook believed that wiping an iPhone should ensure that no trace of the owner’s identity remained on the device. So Kalanick told his engineers to “geofence” Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California, a way to digitally identify people reviewing Uber’s software in a specific location. Uber would then obfuscate its code for people within that geofenced area, essentially drawing a digital lasso around those it wanted to keep in the dark. Apple employees at its headquarters were unable to see Uber’s fingerprinting. But Apple engineers outside of Cupertino caught on to Uber’s methods, prompting Cook to call Kalanick to his office. Kalanick was shaken by Cook’s scolding, according to a person who saw him after the meeting. But only momentarily. After all, Kalanick had faced off against Apple, and Uber had survived. He had lived to fight another day. Travis Kalanick, the chief executive and founder of Uber, in New York, 2011.

That quality also extended to his personal life, where Mr. Kalanick mixes with celebrities like Jay Z and businessmen including President Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn. But it has alienated some Uber executives, employees and advisers. Mr. Kalanick, with salt-and-pepper hair, a fast-paced walk and an iPhone practically embedded in his hand, is described by friends as more at ease with data and numbers (some consider him a math savant) than with people. Uber is grappling with the fallout. For the last few months, the company has been reeling from allegations of a machismo-fueled workplace where managers routinely overstepped verbally, physically and sometimes sexually with employees. Mr. Kalanick compounded that image by engaging in a shouting match with an Uber driver in February, an incident recorded by the driver and then leaked online. (Mr. Kalanick now has a private driver.) The damage has been extensive. Uber’s detractors have started a grass-roots campaign with the hashtag #deleteUber. Executives have streamed out. Some Uber investors have openly criticized the company. Mr. Kalanick’s leadership is at a precarious point. While Uber is financed by a who’s who of investors including Goldman Sachs and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, Mr. Kalanick controls the majority of the company’s voting shares with a small handful of other close friends, and has stacked Uber’s board of directors with many who are invested in his success. Yet board members have concluded that he must change his management style, and are pressuring him to do so. He has publicly apologized for some of his behavior, and for the first time has said he needs management help. He is interviewing candidates for a chief operating officer, even as some employees question whether a new addition will make any difference. He has also been working with senior managers to reset some of the company’s stated values. Results of an internal investigation into Uber’s workplace culture are expected next month. Through an Uber spokesman, Mr. Kalanick declined an interview request. Apple declined to comment on the meeting with Mr. Cook. Many of the people interviewed for this article, who revealed previously unreported details of Mr. Kalanick’s life, asked to remain anonymous because they had signed nondisclosure agreements with Uber or feared damaging their relationship with the chief executive. Mr. Kalanick’s pattern for pushing limits is deeply ingrained. It began during his childhood in suburban Los Angeles, where he went from being bullied to being the aggressor, continued through his years taking risks at two technology start-ups there, and crystallized in his role at Uber.© Ryan Young for The New York Times Uber headquarters in San Francisco. The company has grown fast, spreading to more than 70 countries and gaining a valuation of nearly $70 billion. Selling Efficiency Mr. Kalanick grew up in the Northridge neighborhood of Los Angeles. His parents, Bonnie and Donald Kalanick, made sure he and his brother, Cory, were never left wanting. He was naturally athletic and competitive, and excelled at running track and playing football. At Patrick Henry Middle School, he was a wiry student who got good grades — putting him in the sights of some older kids who picked on him. Mr. Kalanick later vowed never to be bullied again and turned the tables on his tormentors. He also showed signs of entrepreneurialism. One summer, he sold knives door-to-door for the cutlery company Cutco. At 18, he started New Way Academy, his own S.A.T. prep business, with a partner. The start-up life soon called to him. After attending the University of California, Los Angeles, to major in computer engineering, Mr. Kalanick dropped out in 1998 to form a start-up with several classmates. The company, Scour, became a peer-to-peer file exchange similar to Napster, which let people digitally share music and media files through legally dubious means. Scour, which was eventually sued for $250 billion for alleged copyright infringement, filed for bankruptcy in October 2000, a move that protected it from the suit. The failure did not stop Mr. Kalanick from helping to found another Los Angeles start-up, Red Swoosh, four months later. Red Swoosh made a technology to efficiently transfer large files of digital data; one of its investors was Mr. Cuban. Sean Stanton, Red Swoosh’s former vice president for sales, said of Mr. Kalanick: “Scour was about efficiency. Swoosh was about efficiency. It’s just the way his brain is wired. It’s like the way Uber works right now: What’s the fastest, cheapest and most efficient way to get from point A to point B? That consumes him, and all parts of his life.” With Red Swoosh, Mr. Kalanick started exhibiting his hallmark aggressiveness. When the company struggled, Mr. Kalanick and a partner took the tax dollars from employee paychecks — which are supposed to be withheld and sent to the Internal Revenue Service — and reinvested the money into the start-up, even as friends and advisers warned him the action was potentially illegal. With Mr. Kalanick desperate to keep Red Swoosh afloat, he moved back into his parents’ house. He staved off bankruptcy for a second time by raising another round of funding. The wayward tax dollars eventually went to the I.R.S. Mr. Kalanick also decamped to Thailand with his software team in April 2006 to save money by living cheaply abroad, while also using the trip as a team-building exercise. He was interested not only in business during this time. In 2003 he picked up a registration form to run for governor of California and registered a website, travis4gov.com, positioning himself as an independent candidate — though he never followed through with a campaign. In other personal pursuits, he once held the world’s second-highest score for the Nintendo Wii Tennis video game. In 2007, Mr. Kalanick sold Red Swoosh to Akamai, a cloud services company, for roughly $19 million. The deal turned the executive, who had headed north to San Francisco, into a millionaire. By then, some advisers had soured on him. “The Travis Kalanick I came to know 17 years ago was relentless in pursuit of his goals at the expense of those who supported him along the way, deluded by his own embellished personal narrative, and a serial prevaricator,” said Peter Yorke, a former Red Swoosh adviser and a longtime tech executive. Others stuck by him. Michael Robertson, chief executive of MP3.com, an early digital music sharing service, said that he told Mr. Kalanick, “Sometimes in business you have to battle the establishment, and it can get brutal and ugly.” In San Francisco, Mr. Kalanick and Angie You, his longtime girlfriend, bought a townhouse nestled in the upper hills of the city’s Castro section. Though the couple have since split, the two remain close and still speak on a regular basis.© Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times Taxi drivers and others who supported Mr. de Blasio’s efforts to halt Uber’s expansion rallying outside City Hall in Manhattan in 2015. Uber’s Rise The idea for Uber came in 2009 from Garrett Camp, a friend of Mr. Kalanick’s, who became fixated on hailing a private luxury car with a smartphone app after being unable to catch cabs in San Francisco. Mr. Camp talked about the idea incessantly, including at Mr. Kalanick’s townhouse, nicknamed the “Jam Pad.” Entrepreneurs frequently stopped by to brainstorm there, and the house even had its own Twitter account, controlled by Mr. Kalanick. UberCab, as it was called at the time, started its service in San Francisco in May 2010. Mr. Camp and Mr. Kalanick picked that name to emphasize the convenience of calling a car on demand from an app. Mr. Kalanick wanted a break from full-time start-up life after running Red Swoosh, so he and Mr. Camp named Ryan Graves, who responded to a call for help on Twitter, as chief executive. A few months later, Mr. Kalanick changed his mind and took over as UberCab’s chief. He quickly positioned the start-up as an alternative to the taxi industry. At the time, taxi companies had iron grips in many towns. City-by-city regulations required procedures like base stations for cabs, safety measures and other stipulations. Mr. Kalanick ignored those rules. “We’re in a political campaign,” he once said at a technology conference, and the candidate is Uber. The opponent is named Taxi, he said, adding a rude descriptive. “Nobody likes him, he’s not a nice character, but he’s so woven into the political machinery and fabric that a lot of people owe him favors.” Mr. Kalanick carried that same level of intensity into Uber’s headquarters, pacing briskly while working by doing laps around the office. His pacing is so legendary, his father once said, that he wore a hole in the carpeting. Mr. Kalanick focused on growing UberCab quickly. The company typically sent a small strike team into a new city — say, Seattle — to aggressively recruit new drivers through Craigslist and other online listings. Then the team marketed UberCab’s app to increase ridership. That drew attention from regulators. In October 2010, the company shortened its name to Uber after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from San Francisco officials for marketing itself as a taxi company without the proper licenses and permits. To influence local legislators to accept Uber, Mr. Kalanick took extra steps. In 2014, Uber hired Ben Metcalfe, an engineer who described his job on LinkedIn as building “custom tools to support citizen engagement across legislative matters” to drive “social good and social change.” In practice, Mr. Metcalfe and his team created an email-based system to aid Uber users and drivers to directly contact local legislators to lobby for allowing Uber in their cities. The system was similar to Change.org, a website that pushes social change through online petitions. City and state officials were soon deluged with emails supporting Uber. In some places, Uber employees were also told to create computer programs known as scripts that would automatically vote for the ride-hailing service in city-administered surveys. Such tactics were effective. In 2015 when New York’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, tried capping the number of Uber cars, Uber added a “de Blasio” tab in its app to show lengthy waiting times for rides if legislation against Uber was allowed to go forward. People could easily send a form email to the mayor and City Council supporting Uber by pressing a button in the app. Mr. de Blasio capitulated, and the cap did not take place.© Danny Moloshok/Reuters Mr. Kalanick at Vanity Fair’s Oscars party in February. Taking Center Stage As Uber gained momentum, Mr. Kalanick moved into the spotlight. It did not come naturally. One friend recalled a night out with a group of married couples at the Gold Club, a San Francisco strip club, a few years ago. Mr. Kalanick, who was single, pulled out a laptop to work on a spreadsheet, crunching Uber’s numbers while friends watched the dancers onstage. Another friend called Mr. Kalanick a “tech world rock star,” which means something different in Silicon Valley than in the music world. “To work with and around one requires a different kind of mentality and skill,” said Andy Abramson, an early adviser to Mr. Kalanick. Mr. Abramson likened the chief executive to other idiosyncratic founders like Jeff Bezos of Amazon. Mr. Kalanick was eventually coaxed more into the limelight by others. Shervin Pishevar, an Uber investor, sometimes took Mr. Kalanick to clubs in Los Angeles on the weekend, providing a car and a change of “club clothes.” Mr. Pishevar, who did not respond to a request for comment, was the Uber chief’s entryway into Los Angeles’s world of celebrity. Hollywood stars were eager to buy into Uber, which they had started using to get around. Actors like Edward Norton, Olivia Munn and Sophia Bush took small stakes in the company. Mr. Kalanick and a top lieutenant, Emil Michael, sometimes hung out with Leonardo DiCaprio, who is also an investor, and Jay Z, whose wife, Beyoncé, performed for Uber employees at a poolside party in Las Vegas in 2015. Jay Z once wired money to Mr. Michael in an attempt to invest even more in Uber. Mr. Michael and Mr. Kalanick, giddy at rebuffing a celebrity, wired some of the money back, saying they already had too many interested investors. Representatives for Jay Z did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Kalanick also dreamed of luring celebrities into advisory roles at Uber. One aim was persuading Oprah Winfrey to join the board — something Uber executives believed could happen after Mr. Kalanick met Ms. Winfrey at a party on the Spanish island of Ibiza — but the idea never jelled. A spokeswoman for Ms. Winfrey declined to comment. Mr. Kalanick began mixing with elite business executives. He developed a close relationship with Mr. Cohn, then a top-ranking executive at Goldman Sachs. At one point, the two men spoke on a near daily basis. Mr. Cohn and a White House spokeswoman did not return requests for comment.© Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times When Mayor Bill de Blasio tried to cap the number of Uber cars in New York, the company campaigned hard against the measure. Leadership Principles Inside Uber, Mr. Kalanick began codifying the pillars of the company’s culture. He particularly admired Amazon, the e-commerce company that espouses 14 leadership principles including “learn and be curious” and “insist on the highest standards.” So he created 14 values for Uber, with tenets such as being “super pumped” and “always be hustlin.’” Some employees admired Mr. Kalanick’s deep involvement in Uber. “TK was hands-on and in the product weeds,” said Chris Messina, who left Uber in January, using Mr. Kalanick’s nickname. “He cared deeply about the product and the people building it.” Mr. Kalanick’s main mantra was “growth above all else.” That meant Uber’s top performers were often promoted and protected. When one general manager, a title for a city-level chief, threw a coffee mug at a subordinate in a fit of rage, the incident was reported to human resources — but there was no follow up. At the time, Uber’s business in the general manager’s city was strong. Other complaints also fell on deaf ears. After a backlash over Uber’s use of “surge pricing” (raising ride prices when demand is high) amid an East Coast snowstorm in 2013, Mr. Kalanick’s response to upset riders was a torrent of economics and math. “We did more trips because of our approach, not fewer,” he said in an interview with Wired at the time. “We gave people more options to get around, and that is the whole frickin’ goal.” Friends and employees told Mr. Kalanick that he should at least pretend to care about how it looked to take such a hostile stance with Uber’s users. Several described him as “emotionally unintelligent.” Mr. Kalanick made other missteps. In 2014, he and his then-girlfriend, Gabi Holzwarth, went to an escort bar in South Korea with Mr. Michael and other Uber employees, where they drank, sang karaoke and some members of the party picked out women as their dates for the evening. The incident, reported by The Information, resulted in a human resources complaint from an employee who attended. That same year, Mr. Kalanick discussed how Uber had boosted his desirability with women in an interview with GQ, calling the company “boob-er.” And just days after a former employee published a blog post in February detailing sexual harassment at Uber, Mr. Kalanick attended Vanity Fair’s Academy Awards party in Hollywood, stunning some colleagues with his perceived insensitivity. His desire for growth also knew few limits. Uber plunged into China in 2013, and Mr. Kalanick spent billions of dollars to outgun the local incumbent Didi Chuxing — only to have to retreat last year, partly because of heavy losses. Mr. Kalanick is now spending heavily in India to win there, even offering to become an Indian citizen if it will help Uber’s prospects. The company has said that it lost $2.8 billion in 2016, excluding China.© Greg Baker/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images An Uber station in Sichuan Province, China. Uber plunged billions of dollars into China, only to eventually retreat from the market. For the Win With Mr. Kalanick setting the tone at Uber, employees acted to ensure the ride-hailing service would win no matter what. They spent much of their energy one-upping rivals like Lyft. Uber devoted teams to so-called competitive intelligence, purchasing data from an analytics service called Slice Intelligence. Using an email digest service it owns named Unroll.me, Slice collected its customers’ emailed Lyft receipts from their inboxes and sold the anonymized data to Uber. Uber used the data as a proxy for the health of Lyft’s business. (Lyft, too, operates a competitive intelligence team.) Slice confirmed it sells anonymized data (meaning that customers’ names are not attached) based on ride receipts from Uber and Lyft, but declined to disclose who buys the information. Uber also tried to win over Lyft’s drivers. Uber’s “driver satisfaction rating,” an internal metric, has dropped since February 2016, and roughly a quarter of its drivers turn over on average every three months. According to an internal slide deck on driver income levels viewed by The New York Times, Uber considered Lyft and McDonald’s its main competition for attracting new drivers. To frustrate Lyft drivers, Uber dispatched some employees to order and cancel Lyft rides en masse. Others hailed Lyfts and spent the rides persuading drivers to switch to Uber full time. After Mr. Kalanick heard that Lyft was working on a car-pooling feature, Uber also created and started its own car-pooling option, UberPool, in 2014, two days before Lyft unveiled its project. That same year, Uber came close to buying Lyft. At a meeting at Mr. Kalanick’s house, and over cartons of Chinese food, he and Mr. Michael hosted Lyft’s president, John Zimmer, who asked for 15 percent of Uber in exchange for selling Lyft. Over the next hour, Mr. Kalanick and Mr. Michael repeatedly laughed at Mr. Zimmer’s audacious request. No deal was reached. Lyft declined to comment. The rivalry remains in force. In 2016, Uber held a summit meeting in Mexico City for some top managers, where it distributed a playbook of how to cut into Lyft’s business and had sessions on how to damage its competitor. To grow its own business, Uber sidestepped the authorities. Some employees started using a tool called Greyball to deceive officials trying to shut down Uber’s service. The tool, developed to aid driver safety and to trick fraudsters, essentially showed a fake version of Uber’s app to some people to disguise the locations of cars and drivers. It soon became a way for Uber drivers to evade capture by law enforcement in places where the service was deemed illegal. After The Times reported on Greyball in March, Uber said it would prohibit employees from using the tool against law enforcement. The idea of fooling Apple, the main distributor of Uber’s app, began in 2014. At the time, Uber was dealing with widespread account fraud in places like China, where tricksters bought stolen iPhones that were erased of their memory and resold. Some Uber drivers there would then create dozens of fake email addresses to sign up for new Uber rider accounts attached to each phone, and request rides from those phones, which they would then accept. Since Uber was handing out incentives to drivers to take more rides, the drivers could earn more money this way. To halt the activity, Uber engineers assigned a persistent identity to iPhones with a small piece of code, a practice called “fingerprinting.” Uber could then identify an iPhone and prevent itself from being fooled even after the device was erased of its contents. There was one problem: Fingerprinting iPhones broke Apple’s rules. Mr. Cook believed that wiping an iPhone should ensure customers that no trace of the owner’s identity remained on the device. So Mr. Kalanick told his engineers to “geofence” Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., a way to digitally identify people reviewing Uber’s software in a specific location. Uber would then obfuscate its code from people within that geofenced area, essentially drawing a digital lasso around those it wanted to keep in the dark. Apple employees at its headquarters were unable to see Uber’s fingerprinting. The ruse did not last. Apple engineers outside of Cupertino caught on to Uber’s methods, prompting Mr. Cook to call Mr. Kalanick to his office. Mr. Kalanick was shaken by Mr. Cook’s scolding, according to a person who saw him after the meeting. But only momentarily. After all, Mr. Kalanick had faced off against Apple, and Uber had survived. He had lived to fight another day. Follow Mike Isaac on Twitter @MikeIsaac. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem.

X Phone warranties and breakfast cereal prices Pricewatch: know your customer rights and remember supermarkets make mistakes about 7 hours ago Conor Pope The Carphone Warehouse: “We apologise for the inconvenience . . . due to a misunderstanding by our customer service team.” Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill         iPhone query Michelle Carney bought an iPhone 6 from a Carphone Warehouse outlet in June 2015 on a 24-month contract with Eir. “In September 2016, I started having problems when I downloaded a software update. The problem I had was the screen would go blank intermittently even though the phone was still operating in the background. The problem became worse over a short period until it got to the point where I could not use the phone,” she writes. So she brought it into Carphone Warehouse, who told her that the phone was outside of the 12-month warranty. She was told she would have to call into an Apple agent store. She did and was told that the screen needed replacing. “I was provided with a copy of Apple’s consumer information that stated basically it was covered under Irish consumer law but I would have to go through the seller who is Carphone Warehouse.” So she dropped in an attached complaint letter and was told that as it was outside of the 12-month warranty it was not covered for repair or refund. “At this stage my only course of action was to bring them to the small claims court. I then went back and contacted Apple and eventually after long discussions and evidence that the fault was not caused by physical neglect, they replaced the phone in October 2016.” “Now just five months on, the screen has gone again and, after being in contact with Apple, they advised me to bring it to CompuB to get it checked as they were unable to solve the issue over phone. I did this last Friday and I was told that it would need a replacement screen at a cost of €167. CompuB told me that it was out of warranty, to which I asked that if it’s the same problem as before (ie screen defect), was it not covered under warranty for a year. They said I need to contact Apple as they couldn’t advise me on this.” There are a couple of things going on here. First, our reader bought the phone from Carphone Warehouse which means her contract of sale was with that shop so it had the sole obligation to resolve any problems she had with the product. By directing her to Apple – or to one of its agents – it would appear to us that the retailer has let her down. The second thing that strikes us is Carphone Warehouse’s insistence that, as the product was out of warranty, it had no obligation to her. This is, of course, complete nonsense. A 12-month warranty can be offered by a manufacturer – in this case, Apple - but statutory rights trump them every time and warranties are not the last word when something breaks or doesn’t work as it should. Under the Sale of Goods Act, consumers have up to six years to seek redress for faulty or defective items. There are limits to this law, however. And the limits are typically governed by how much you pay for something, what it is supposed to do and what you do with it. A watch that costs €10 is probably not going to last long, so if it breaks after a year you have no real comeback. An Apple phone that has a sale price of in excess of €700, however, should last quite a bit longer than that. Another point worth making concerns the new phone she was given. If a person gets a replacement product under warranty, the warranty clock is not reset to zero. So if a phone breaks after 10 months and you get a new one, do not be surprised if the manufacturer tells you the new phone has a warranty of only two months. We contacted Carphone Warehouse and received the following statement: “We apologise to Miss Carney for the inconvenience caused to her which was due to a misunderstanding by our customer service team. We will contact her directly to resolve this matter as quickly as possible and arrange a replacement handset.” Supermarket prices “I am a long-term customer of Tesco online shopping,” her mail starts. “It is a fantastic service but the price difference between Tesco and my local SuperValu on a 1.1kg bag of No Added Sugar Alpen is a staggering 47 per cent and has been for a very, very long time now.” Last week she bought the product in question for €4.95 in Super Valu, Raheny, while the same product costs €7.29 in Tesco. “At the weekend I purchased the 560g box online from Tesco at €3.50, down from €4.65 on special offer. I still cannot believe the price difference between the two stores and, as I’ve already said before, this has been the case for well over a year. I’ve never queried the price with either store but am fascinated by the rather stark difference in price for the same product.” In a statement, Tesco said it “stocks nearly 40,000 products . . . Every week we check more than 10,000 prices against our competitors to make sure we offer the best value possible. “Regrettably, when managing this number of products, pricing errors, both up and down, do occur very occasionally. This product was incorrectly priced and has now been reduced to €4.95. Tesco would like to sincerely apologise for this mistake and we thank our customer for bringing it to our attention.”       Topics: Michelle Carney Apple Carphone Warehouse Supervalu Tesco Raheny Read More Holiday for less: 21 ways to bag a cheaper time away Pricewatch: readers’ queries Shelling out for Easter eggs Sneaky supermarket tricks and thinking behind them High insurance costs blamed for drop in young drivers Grand Canal weekly market at Mount Street Bridge axed ‘Not having a car gives you a different type of independence’ ‘I don’t understand why students need to drive at all’ Broadband nightmares: No signal, no salary  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Phone warranties and breakfast cereal prices Sneaky supermarket tricks and thinking behind them High insurance costs blamed for drop in young drivers ‘I don’t understand why students need to drive at all’ Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

The publisher’s decision will see the UK, US and Australian content axed from the platforms, with a spokesperson from The Guardian saying: “We have run extensive trials on Facebook Instant Articles and Apple News to assess how they fit with our editorial and commercial objectives. “Having evaluated these trials, we have decided to stop publishing in those formats on both platforms. “Our primary objective is to bring audiences to the trusted environment of The Guardian to support building deeper relationships with our readers, and growing membership and contributions to fund our world-class journalism,” the spokesperson said. Earlier last month The Guardian Media Group CEO, David Pemsel, expressed his concern for the financial results Facebook Instant Articles can deliver to publishers. After launching Facebook Instant Articles two years ago with Buzzfeed, BBC News and The Guardian as some of the first to sign on to the platform, “Facebook believed that Instant Articles was going to be a very efficient way for us to publish straight into the news feed”, Pemsel told Mumbrella. Pemsel said in March, he would stick out a trial with the platform for audience reach purposes. “What I would say is that it’s great for reach and it’s a brilliant way to be able to extend our audience and our traffic and build a much more global reach,” he said. “The economics financially for us were woeful. “It was an attempt to try to find some equitable return for us for our journalism and it didn’t succeed, at all. So now we will keep pushing Facebook to come up with new ideas,” he said. The publisher stopped running its content on the platform over the weekend.

Times reports Bloomberg News Travis Kalanick, co-founder and chief executive officer of Uber Technologies Inc. By MikeMurphy Editor Uber Technologies Inc. has a long history of flaunting government regulations, but it was its violation of a rule by Apple Inc. that almost sank its business. In a Sunday profile of Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick, the New York Times reported that in 2015, Apple CEO Tim Cook scolded Kalanick during a face-to-face meeting for tweaking coding to track iPhones even after users deleted the Uber app. “So, I’ve heard you’ve been breaking some of our rules,” Cook said, according to the Times, as he told Kalanick to knock it off or Uber would be banned from the App Store — a prospect that would have been disastrous for Uber. Kalanick “was shaken” by Cook’s scolding, the Times said, and agreed to stop tracking the phones. According to the Times, the trouble started in 2014 when Uber drivers in China tried to game the system to make it look like they were getting more riders — and thus, entitled to more money. Drivers would buy iPhones on the black market, wipe their memory and create new “customer” accounts., then repeat the process. Uber caught on, and devised a trick to counter the memory wipes, leaving a digital “fingerprint” on the phone that could identify the device even if it had been wiped. Apple’s AAPL, -0.12%   privacy policy, however, requires that the device be wiped 100% clean, with no lingering coding. Uber engineers went a step further and covered their tracks through geofencing, essentially blocking their telltale coding from being seen by users in the area around Apple’s Cupertino, Calif., headquarters. Later Sunday, Uber defended the practice, calling such tracking a common industry anti-fraud technique. “We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they’ve deleted the app,” Uber said in a statement. “As the New York Times story notes towards the very end, this is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone — over and over again.

Times reports Bloomberg News Travis Kalanick, co-founder and chief executive officer of Uber Technologies Inc. By MikeMurphy Editor Uber Technologies Inc. has a long history of flaunting government regulations, but it was its violation of a rule by Apple Inc. that almost sank its business. In a Sunday profile of Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick, the New York Times reported that in 2015, Apple CEO Tim Cook scolded Kalanick during a face-to-face meeting for tweaking coding to track iPhones even after users deleted the Uber app. “So, I’ve heard you’ve been breaking some of our rules,” Cook said, according to the Times, as he told Kalanick to knock it off or Uber would be banned from the App Store — a prospect that would have been disastrous for Uber. Kalanick “was shaken” by Cook’s scolding, the Times said, and agreed to stop tracking the phones. According to the Times, the trouble started in 2014 when Uber drivers in China tried to game the system to make it look like they were getting more riders — and thus, entitled to more money. Drivers would buy iPhones on the black market, wipe their memory and create new “customer” accounts., then repeat the process. Uber caught on, and devised a trick to counter the memory wipes, leaving a digital “fingerprint” on the phone that could identify the device even if it had been wiped. Apple’s AAPL, -0.12%   privacy policy, however, requires that the device be wiped 100% clean, with no lingering coding. Uber engineers went a step further and covered their tracks through geofencing, essentially blocking their telltale coding from being seen by users in the area around Apple’s Cupertino, Calif., headquarters. Later Sunday, Uber defended the practice, calling such tracking a common industry anti-fraud technique. “We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they’ve deleted the app,” Uber said in a statement. “As the New York Times story notes towards the very end, this is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone — over and over again. Similar techniques are also used for detecting and blocking suspicious logins to protect our users’ accounts. Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back onto our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users.” The digital-outlaw image and ends-justify-the-means business practices helped build privately-held Uber to a valuation of $68 billion, but have also raised serious concerns.

Review: Gamemaker 2 Why Understanding Food Serving Sizes Is Important For Weight Loss Uber Speaks About Tracking iPhone Users After App Uninstallations junglist Apr 24, 2017, 9:00am ⋅ Filed to:  apple Australian Stories iphone uber Share Image: iStock "So I've heard you've been breaking some of our rules," was how a meeting began between Tim Cook and Travis Kalanick in early 2015, according to the New York Times. Uber had been tracking iPhone users after uninstalls, and until that point, evading Apple's attention. The New York Times report tells a story of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick going to Apple's headquarters for a meeting with Tim Cook, in which he was calmly chided by the Apple CEO and told to start following the rules or have his app pulled from the App Store. Uber was apparently tracking iPhones after the app had been uninstalled. It had disabled the functionality in the vicinity of Apple's headquarters in an attempt to fool its Cupertino engineers, but testers in other locations picked up on the activity. The technique is called "fingerprinting", which identifies a device and remains even after it's wiped. Apple had previously given developers the ability to mark devices with a Unique Device Identifier, which new installs wouldn't get rid of, but eventually scrapped the technique in favour of more privacy-prudent protections. Uber's fingerprinting, however, was one of its own design. Regarding the fingerprinting, an Uber spokesperson told the following to TechCrunch: We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they’ve deleted the app. As the New York Times story notes towards the very end, this is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone—over and over again. Similar techniques are also used for detecting and blocking suspicious logins to protect our users’ accounts. Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back onto our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users.

These days, Dauman’s probably spending some of that on the golf course. Oh, and he has no good business reason left to just play nine holes. Of course, Dauman’s golden parachute had nothing on DreamWorks Animation boss Jeffrey Katzenberg’s more than $400 million windfall from the sale of his studio to Comcast’s NBCUniversal. Aside from that cash-out on his equity in DWA, Katzenberg pocketed $44.5 million in payments relating to the company’s change of ownership and stock appreciation. TOP ENTERTAINMENT VIDEOS: Story continues below | Things to Do and New Flicks: Sign in for newsletters Among moguls who still have jobs, CBS’ Les Moonves so far edges Disney’s Bob Iger for most profitable 2016. On the flip side of these rankings, Apple’s Tim Cook managed to avoid the chief executive basement by a few million bucks. Also Read: Discovery CEO Admits Rival History Channel's Surge 'Forced Us to Get More Focused' In other words, don’t expect Tribune Media’s Peter Liguori to pick up the tab anytime soon at a retreat for top execs: He’s currently the lowest paid on our list, and the man is also out of a job. Below is TheWrap‘s list of executive compensation details from 2016 corporate SEC filings. To compare it to past years, click through our previous annual reports: 2015 | 2014 | 2013 | 2012 | 2011 | 2010 | 2009 | 2008 Some performance or stock-price based compensations are related to fiscal 2016 performance, while others are a barometer of a company’s showing in 2015 or even earlier. Also Read: Netflix Plans to Move Productions to California, 'Invest in Infrastructure,' Ted Sarandos Says (Exclusive) Disney’s Bob Iger recently agreed to add an extra year to his contract, agreeing to stay on until July 2019 after the Mouse House hasn’t been able to find a successor to its big cheese despite a years-long search. We can assume he’s getting paid handsomely to delay retirement by a year: Iger hauled in $43.9 million during 2016, which was actually a 2.2 percent pay cut from the previous year. Since Iger took over as CEO on October 1, 2005, Disney’s stock price has nearly quadrupled. Its movie studio remains the dominant force in Hollywood, claiming 26 percent market share in the U.S. last year and becoming the first-ever studio to gross $7 billion worldwide. The company’s cable networks, led by ESPN, have suffered subscriber losses as cord-cutting has gained in popularity, but Disney acquired a stake in streaming technology company BAMTech last year and has plans to launch a standalone ESPN. And while Iger nears the end of his career as an executive, his wife, journalist Willow Bay, landed a big job this year. In March, she was named dean of the Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California. Also Read: Bob Iger Reveals Young Han Solo's Age, More 'Star Wars' Details Zaslav, who took home a healthy $156.1 million in 2014, has had to make do with less than $40 million in each of the last two years. His 2014 bonanza was a result of contract negotiations that saw the Discovery boss pocket more than $94 million in new stock awards. Discovery’s stock rose 3 percent in 2016, a year in which the pay-TV provider boosted revenue by 2 percent and net income by 15 percent. And although the company has dedicated a lot of resources into its international expansion, its U.S. growth was actually more impressive. In October, Discovery announced a minority investment in Group Nine Media, the parent company behind digital-first outlets including NowThis and Thrillist, as it looks to reach more cord-cutting millenials. Zaslav won’t have any problem paying for cable, though. The man in charge of the world’s largest company by market cap had a relatively modest 2016 compensation package that didn’t even put him in the eight-figure range — or about what a serviceable relief pitcher can command today. And unlike many CEOs, Cook’s pay was dinged for actual performance issues. Even with the iPhone 7 launch, Apple failed to meet its targets for net sales and operating income, which resulted in him and other execs getting just 89.5 percent of their allocated cash incentives. Don’t feel too sorry for Cook, though: He holds more than $100 million in vested Apple shares. That’s a lot of headphone jack-to-lightning adapters. Leslie Moonves is the highest-paid executive in our round-up thus far, though his take pales in comparison to the guy below. That said, at least Les still has a job. The CBS head honcho hauled in a cool $69.6 million in 2016 — the biggest raise of anyone not being shown the exit door. We’ll show due respect to the man who has helped make CBS America’s most-watched network for 14 of the past 15 years. While Moonves’ salary remained steady at $3.5 million annually, the chairman, president and CEO nabbed an extra $13 million in bonuses across 2016. Not bad at all. Before you bury his huge payday, remember, Moonves earned his money by making dough for shareholders: CBS stock closed 2015 at $47.13; it finished this past year at $63.62 per share. Where do we even begin with Philippe Dauman’s 2016? We’ll start with the money, because $93 million is $93 million. Here’s how Dauman’s big 2016 pay breaks down: $3.6 million in salary $13.8 million in stock awards $7.5 million in option awards $9.7 million in non-equity incentive plan compensation $58.4 million in “all other compensation” That final catch-all category includes Sumner Redstone’s former protege’s giant golden parachute. Those two — along with Sumner’s daughter Shari Redstone — spent most of last year battling for power in the court system and through the media. The Redstones ultimately won, and Dauman was sent packing. Peter Liguori, the president and CEO of WGN America parent company Tribune Media, made $400,000 less last year than he did in 2015, and is currently the lowest-paid top executive in our limited 2016 roundup. That’s a bummer. Of course, Liguori won’t even make our list next year — the top dog announced in January that he was stepping down from the company’s top job. “Following the successful completion of several financial, strategic and creative initiatives, culminating in the pending sale of Gracenote, Tribune Media is well advanced in its transformation to a more focused broadcast and cable networks company,” Liguori said in a statement. Katzenberg sold his DreamWorks Animation to Comcast’s NBCUniversal last year in a $3.8 billion deal that left the longtime studio boss without a fiefdom. But don’t feel too sorry for him: as part of the deal, Katzenberg hauled in $44.5 million in change-of-control payments and vested stock appreciation rights, making him one of the highest-paid CEOs in the country — even without factoring in any payment for the job itself. DWA, no longer its own company, didn’t release a proxy statement this year, but Katzenberg had been making $2.5 million a year in salary. The stuido behind some of the most successful animated franchises of all-time, including “Shrek” and “Kung Fu Panda,” was able to command that premium price at a time when family fare has been one of Hollywood’s most reliable genres. Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast” live-live action remake has grossed more than $1 billion worldwide. Katzenberg appears to already be plotting his next move — in January, he raised $591.5 million for WndrCo, a venture that aims to produce TV designed for mobile screens. The 2016 executive compensation for other top media company executives has yet to be publicly filed with the SEC. This story will be updated as each company makes that pay available.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Apple Hires 3D Developer Tim Dashwood; Company Boosting Efforts For VR On iPhone? By Ramish Zafar 11 hours ago 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Talking tech, at the consumer end, there aren’t many avenues left for companies to explore. The smartphone has matured, and tablet sales aren’t what we’d like them to be. A couple of avenues, such as VR are still on the rise, especially as technology that’s usable on a mass scale still isn’t ready. So, a lot of folks are investing in the tech, as we slowly become capable to support it. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors for starters have become more focused on Virtual Reality. Today, we’re back in Apple’s world as Cupertino’s also making moves in the segment. Take a look below to find out more. Apple Hires Final Cut Developer Tim Dashwood As Company’s Interest In Virtual Reality Grows When it comes to new tech, Apple’s known to keep its card pretty close to the chest. The company’s known to not launch new features until they’ve been thoroughly tested. VR seems to be one of these things. There’s little mention for the technology on the iPhone and details for the iPhone 8 to feature it are also sparse. One of Apple’s core philosophies always has been easy user interaction with its devices. The current state of VR doesn’t allow for this, as you need clunky headgear to use the tech. Related iPhone 8 Dummy Out in the Open; Bezel-Less Display, Vertical Dual-Lens Camera, No Rear Touch ID and More Seen Right Here However, that hasn’t stopped Cupertino and other manufacturers from experimenting. Word on the street suggests that Apple’s been looking into developing AR glasses internally. Even the iPhone 8 has seen a handful of rumors suggest a form of 3D recognition. Sources claim that the front camera for Apple’s upcoming smartphone will be able to detect your face and other environments. Advertisement Related Tweetbot For iOS Now Lets You Send Images Via DM, Usernames No Longer Counts Towards Character Limit Apple will use PrimeSense’s hardware for the iPhone 8, which will have a basic touch of AR. The company has now hired Tim Dashwood, to help it with AR exploration. The developer is known for his work on 360VR Toolbox, which is a plug in for Final Cut Pro. 360VR Toolbox cost around $1000 and aids in making 3D videos. The exact nature of Dashwood’s work for Apple is unknown. However, given the rumors surrounding AR for the iPhone 8 and the time of his hiring, we can speculate that it’s got something to do with Apple’s smartphone plans. Making 3D, VR videos is a new direction for the smartphone, one that hasn’t been explored fully. Apple’s got a lot riding on the iPhone 8, especially as a majority of Cupertino’s revenues flow in from the smartphone lineup. Therefore the bar is even higher this year, given the maturation of the smartphone market. Apple’s gonna go guns blazing this September, and maybe Dashwood will be a part of it. Thoughts?

Uber flouts Apple's user-tracking policy – and gets away with it Monday April 24, 2017 Share KeallHauled Chris Keall Travis Kalanick (Getty) Play NBR radio on Uber faces yet another PR firestorm this morning with a New York Times allegation that it continued to track users, without their knowledge, after they deleted its app. The Times says Apple boss Tim Cook summoned Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick into his office in early 2015 and confronted him over the practice.  Uber backed down. However, some commentators have said any other app maker would have been booted from the App Store for such a flagrant violation of Apple's policy — which is made worse by the Times allegation that Uber geo-fenced Apple's Cupertino headquarters so its staff would not realise what was going on (it came a cropper when Apple staff at other locations noticed). Another disturbing aspect: It's unclear how Uber managed to keep tracking people after they deleted its app. The episode is an embarrassment to Mr Kalanick — but also yet another validation of his apparent philosophy that if you've got enough users and deep enough pockets, you can get away with pushing laws, regulations and other companies' terms and conditions. Uber has now responded to the NYT article, saying it deployed tracking on phones with deleted apps up until 2015 to help prevent fraud from stolen handsets. LinkedIn launches proximity alerts In other Big Brother news, over the past few days, LinkedIn has switched on a new user tracking/proximity alert feature. The idea is that if you're at, say, an event or conference, it'll be easier for you to locate your LinkedIn buddies, or for them to locate you, utilising your respective phone's Bluetooth or wi-fi. A pop-up message that asks users if they want to opt in has drawn a lot of derision on social media. I asked security expert Daniel Ayers for his take on LinkedIn's new feature. He didn't point out any security flaw from a technical standpoint but he did point out that it can still be problematic in other ways, especially if people forget to switch it off. "It's basically the same issue as geo-tagged tweets," he says. "Even if the privacy policy is okay, if people turn it on and leave it on, then it can come back to bite you in unexpected ways," he says. "From a privacy perspective, they are being pretty upfront about it and making it opt in, meaning you would have to make a conscious decision to have your location information shared with others. "From a security perspective, if you did opt in, you would need to consider how well-protected that location data was and what the potential implications were if the data was stolen  LinkedIn is a social network that tends to cater to businesspeople so, if there was a security compromise of the collected data, then hackers would be able to easily identify 'high-value people' and find out if any location data had been collected. You can imagine what the headlines might be if that data was compromised: 'CEO of X Inc spent the night at fancy hotel with secretary' or 'Leaked data reveals clandestine meetings between X Inc and Y Co'." LinkedIn having its data stolen is not a hypothetical concept. In 2012 the professional business network had tens of millions of user accounts compromised in a security breach (which was not revealed until mid-2016). It has since strengthened its defences. But you still have to think of the meta data and social implications of others constantly seeing your location if you simply forget to turn tracking off. New owner Microsoft is no doubt going to introduce other new features to LinkedIn, and I don't want to be a snowflake about them. After all, there is always a trade-off for convenience, and a number of LinkedIn buffs are going to love proximity alerts when they attend events. But just be aware of the downsides.

Now, as Apple Inc. prepares to introduce a new smartphone with an OLED screen, a Japanese refiner better known for its chain of gas stations is about to join the list. Apple’s OLED iPhone expected this year will carry a Samsung screen. Photographer: Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images Idemitsu Kosan Co. began experimenting with organic light-emitting diodes in the mid-1980s, seeking to reduce its reliance on petroleum after the global oil shock. Now, pick up Google’s latest Pixel smartphone or a Galaxy model from Samsung Electronics Co., and chances are the blue pixels on the OLED screens are built with Idemitsu’s materials or patents. Wider adoption of the advanced displays, which offer crisper images and use less battery power, is putting the spotlight on Japanese suppliers that up until now had virtually no stake in iPhone sales. Canon Tokki Corp., for example, has a near monopoly on the giant vacuum machines capable of making OLED screens. Dai Nippon Printing Co. and Toppan Printing Co. are leading manufacturers of fine metal meshes needed to imprint OLED pixels. “Samsung has been using OLED screens for a few years, but with Apple it becomes a big push,” said Alberto Moel, a technology analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. “It makes everyone else want to do the same thing.” Apple plans to ship at least one new iPhone with an OLED screen this year, the 10th anniversary of the product’s debut, people with knowledge of the matter have said. The Cupertino, California-based company’s use of OLED displays will boost demand by hundreds of millions of units, according to industry estimates. IHS Markit forecasts they will overtake liquid-crystal displays for smartphone panels this year in a market expected to reach $22.7 billion in 2017.  Idemitsu’s unlikely role in OLED technology stems from its early research in blue diodes, which don’t last as long but are critical for offering a full range of colors on displays. Blue light has a higher frequency than red and green, packing enough energy to cut chemical bonds. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up OLEDs have held out the promise of better screens for decades even as LCDs ruled. OLED displays can be thinner, more energy efficient and produce deeper black colors because organic pixels can glow on their own, while LCDs require a backlit panel. They can also be made on flexible plastic for a wider variety of shapes and applications. The challenge has been in creating long-lasting, bright screens at low enough prices. When Idemitsu began development in 1985, OLED was little more than a promising science. For a decade, Japan’s second-largest refiner struggled to make materials that lasted more than a few seconds, until a breakthrough that extended longevity. That allowed Pioneer Corp. to include the world’s first commercial OLED display for a car stereo in 1999.  “We were there from the beginning,” said Yuichiro Kawamura, chief researcher at Idemitsu’s electronic materials development center. More advancements followed, but it took massive investments by South Korean screen manufacturers to produce displays that were price competitive with LCDs. Samsung bet its smartphone future on OLED and currently makes the vast majority of small displays. LG Electronics Inc. forged an alliance with Idemitsu in 2009 and focused on TV panels. “We have had all the key patents for 10 years,” said Takamitsu Nagase, general manager in charge of business strategy at Idemitsu’s electronic-materials department. “But it’s only in the past three or four years that it has become a real business.” While Idemitsu took an early lead in developing OLED technology, Dow Chemical Co., Merck & Co. and other rivals have joined the fray, pouring money into research to find a better way to produce organic materials. A flexible display made with OLED technology. Source: OPERA at Kyushu University Universal Display Corp., which was founded by a former Princeton University professor in 1994 and trades under the ticker OLED, commercialized a method of extracting more light from organic molecules. The process, which involves the use of iridium, a rare-earth metal, helped UDC become one of the industry’s leading suppliers. Others aren’t convinced that the use of heavy elements offers room for technological improvement. “Once you add iridium, you introduce restrictions and lose that wonderful Lego-like ability to form shapes,” said  Chihaya Adachi, director of Center for Organic Photonics and Electronic Research at Kyushu University. Adachi and his researchers are able to create carbon compounds that never existed before, in as little as a week. That lets them rapidly produce and test tiny OLED square samples for brightness and longevity before going back to the drawing board.  In 2012, this approach yielded a breakthrough that promises much lower costs and power consumption, and OLEDs with purer colors. Idemitsu says the technique, called thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), could threaten its blue diode patents and would be even more damaging to UDC’s position. The incumbents, Idemitsu and UDC, aren’t standing still either. The refiner has been working on its own TADF technology since 2013 and opened a research center in Switzerland in January. Last year, UDC paid 87 million euros ($93 million) for the entire OLED patent portfolio of BASF SE. “The science behind blue TADF will be solved this year,” said Adachi, who is also a co-founder of Kyulux Inc., a company created to commercialize the technology. “The next step is solving the mass production issue.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Check out the new SourceForge HTML5 Internet speed test! × 90642993 story Uber Tried To Hide Its Secret IPhone Fingerprinting From Apple (cnbc.com) 76 Posted by EditorDavid on Sunday April 23, 2017 @05:44PM from the Greyballing-Apple dept. theodp quotes today's New York Times profile of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick: For months, Mr. Kalanick had pulled a fast one on Apple by directing his employees to help camouflage the ride-hailing app from Apple's engineers. The reason? So Apple would not find out that Uber had secretly been tracking iPhones even after its app had been deleted from the devices, violating Apple's privacy guidelines. Uber told TechCrunch this afternoon that it still uses a form of this device fingerprinting, saying they need a way to identify those devices which committed fraud in the past -- especially in China, where Uber drivers used stolen iPhones to request dozens of rides from themselves to increase their pay rate. It's been modified to comply with Apple's rules, and "We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they've deleted the app..." an Uber spokesperson said. "Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back onto our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users." The article offers a longer biography of Kalanick, who dropped out of UCLA in 1998 to start a peer-to-peer music-sharing service named Scour. (The service eventually declared bankruptcy after being sued for $250 billion for alleged copyright infringement.) Desperately trying to save his next company, Kalanick "took the tax dollars from employee paychecks -- which are supposed to be withheld and sent to the Internal Revenue Service," according to the Times, "and reinvested the money into the start-up, even as friends and advisers warned him the action was potentially illegal." The money eventually reached the IRS as he "staved off bankruptcy for a second time by raising another round of funding." But the article ultimately argues that Kalanick's drive to win in life "has led to a pattern of risk-taking that has put his ride-hailing company on the brink of implosion." apple business china ← You may like to read: → Companies Are Paying Millions For White Hat Hacking Apple Cites 'Courage' As Reason To Remove 3.5mm Headphone Jack China Threatens To Cut Sales of iPhones and US Cars if 'Naive' Trump Pursues Trade War Phil Schiller Says the MacBook Pro Doesn't Need an SD Card Slot Taking the Headphone Jack Off Phones Is User-Hostile and Stupid Thanks To Apple's Influence, You're Not Getting A Rifle Emoji Submission: NYT: Uber Engineers Geofenced Apple HQ to Cover Up iPhone Fingerprinting Is Social Media Making Us Hate Each Other?

"Some consider him a math savant," Isaac writes for the New York Times. But the profile is mostly cutting beyond that. Isaac opens with an until-now-unreported 2015 meeting between Kalanick and Apple honcho Tim Cook, in which Kalanick had to answer for an egregious violation of Apple's privacy guidelines: "Directing his employees to help camouflage the ride-hailing app from Apple’s engineers. The reason? So Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased." After a scolding from Cook, Kalanick reversed course in order to avoid getting the boot from Apple's App Store. In Isaac's view, it wasn't an anomaly, but a regular flouting of rules and norms that's becoming characteristic of Uber but traces back to Kalanick—and his earliest days. The California native dropped out of UCLA in 1998 to form a Napster-like start-up; it filed for bankruptcy two years later (allowing it to sidestep a $250 billion copyright infringement lawsuit). Next was data transfer startup Red Swoosh. Isaac reports that Kalanick and a Red Swoosh partner illegally took employee tax withholdings that were supposed to go to the IRS and put the money back into the floundering company (the IRS eventually got its money). Read Isaac's piece in full here; it includes an anecdote about Kalanick refusing some of Jay Z's money, details about the various and aggressive ways Uber has tried to eat away at rival Lyft, and more on how the Apple violation came to be.   The best longform stories, in one weekly email.   My Take on This Story Report a story error Show results without voting  |   16% Hilarious 38% Intriguing 9% Depressing 4% Brilliant 7% Scary 26% Ridiculous Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Story 8 comments You Might Like Sponsored by ZergNet Next on Newser: Ex-Treasure Hunter Again Told to Give Up Coins' Location Comments Read comment policy Showing 3 of 8 comments tpvero 54 minutes ago More slime and scum who will rob cheat and steal to make a buck at the expense of everyone else.

Security by Steven Musil 23 April 2017 6:30 pm BST @stevenmusil Uber CEO Travis Kalanick got called on a bit of app trickery during a 2015 meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook, The New York Times reports. James Martin/CNET It should come as no surprise to anyone that Apple takes the privacy of its iPhone users very seriously. This is after all the company that famously resisted FBI demands for a backdoor into a terrorist's iPhone. So it was understandable that Uber CEO Travis Kalanick might have been a bit anxious before a 2015 meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook. The reason? Kalanick had been directing his engineers to camouflage a feature in the ride-hailing app that allowed Uber to secretly identify and tag iPhone users, even after the app had been deleted from users' phones, according to a wide-ranging profile published Sunday by The New York Times. But Apple was on to the ruse, which violated Apple's app privacy rules. "So, I've heard you've been breaking some of our rules," Cook reportedly told Kalanick in a calm tone. Cook then demanded Uber stop the deception or face getting yanked from Apple's App Store. Losing access to millions of iPhone users would destroy Uber's business, so Kalanick complied with Cook's demand, the newspaper reported. Uber denied using its app to track individual riders' locations, saying the feature was used for fraud detection. "We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they've deleted the app," Uber said in a statement. "As the New York Times story notes towards the very end, this is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone -- over and over again. Similar techniques are also used for detecting and blocking suspicious logins to protect our users' accounts. Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back onto our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users." This isn't the first time Uber has been accused to using software for nefarious purposes. The company was recently caught using a secretive tool called Greyball to thwart efforts by local authorities to catch the ride-hailing company violating local regulations. The company has since said it would stop using the tool for that purpose. In 2014, an Uber executive allegedly used an internal feature known as "God View" to track a reporter's location without her knowledge. Uber's use of the tool, which allows employees to see logs of Uber customer activity, suggested "a troubling disregard for customers' privacy," Sen. Al Franken, chairman of the Subcommittee On Privacy, Technology and the Law, said in a letter to the company. The resulting backlash led the company to hire a third-party data-privacy expert to review its policies and provide recommendations. It wasn't immediately clear if Kalanick's meeting with Cook in 2015 was about the "God View" tool. Representatives for Apple didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

There was even a report from Bloomberg saying that the Cupertino company is busy testing out a number of prototypes for the tenth anniversary iPhone. Now, a new leak seems to give a better idea of what the iPhone 8 would look like when it releases later this year. The latest images actually came from the same guy who made a name in leaking various upcoming mobile devices including the Samsung Galaxy S8. However, this time arounds, known leaker Benjamin Geskin was kind enough to share a dummy model of the iPhone 8. Now, one might think that this is possibly what the iPhone 8 would look like. However, keep in mind that the previous Bloomberg report says that Apple is testing out more than one prototype. This means that the new leaked images could be one of the many.   In the said leaked images, one can see clearly the absence of the TouchID sensor from the back of the device. Earlier last week, it was rumored that Apple might veer away from the display-embedded fingerprint scanner in favor of the rear mounted one. This is mainly because the company’ main supplier is still having issues merging the display and the sensor together. Another stark feature of the dummy model is the vertical duo camera. It has been reported many times that Apple is considering this camera configuration as it deems it will give better imaging quality. The one thing to note, however, is the fact that this could be an elaborate hoax. Readers are still urged to take this bit of news with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, everyone can agree that  if this happens to be what the iPhone 8 would look like, users are in for a thicker phone. Furthermore, there seems to be more surface area on the display in comparison to the Samsung Galaxy S8. Unfortunately, this purported design could still change as the days go by. Evidently, the display-embedded TouchID will still depend greatly on the manufacturer’s ability to generate enough units to comply with the demands.

Kalanick’s company has repeatedly made headlines over the past year for a number of reasons, ranging from frustrated drivers, arguments with city administrators and legacy cab firms, over-ambitious autonomous car testing, and allegations of harassment in the workplace. Indeed, Kalanick’s ambition almost saw him lose his entire iPhone audience. The degree to which Kalanick was willing to push his company to the brink is made clear in a new profile of the entrepreneur by the New York Times. It details a reported meeting between the executive and Apple’s CEO in 2015, after Kalanick was forced to answer questions about Uber circumnavigating privacy policies laid down for apps in the App Store. That brought him to Cupertino and a sit-down meeting with Tim Cook. According to the report, Uber’s engineers had baked a tracking system into the app based on a unique “fingerprint” of each iPhone, which allowed them to continue to identify unique devices even when the software had been uninstalled. Such data could be invaluable to a company specializing in disrupting the transportation business; however, it was also in direct contravention of Apple’s requirements for privacy. Despite Kalanick’s team doing their best to hide it, Apple had discovered the trick. [Update: Uber PR has pointed out that, rather than tracking the location of devices, the software remembered the individual iPhone; indeed, the NYT piece has been updated to remove mention of tracking and instead highlight the system’s use in fraud detection, albeit still contravening Apple’s policies in the process. Back in 2012, for instance, Apple had warned developers not to use the UDID (Unique Device Identifiers) of an iOS device for tracking purposes] Cook’s response, it’s said, was blunt. Uber could cease to run its tracking workaround and agree to comply with Apple’s rules, or Apple would simply remove the Uber app from the App Store. Without a foothold in the download store for iOS devices, Uber would effectively be cut off from a huge number of existing and potential users. While at the time Kalanick backed down, in a statement Uber PR denied using such fingerprinting for nefarious means. According to the company’s version of the story, the system is intended to protect customers from credit card fraud, rather than to track them. Indeed, it argues, it’s common practice for apps: “We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they’ve deleted the app. As the New York Times story notes towards the very end, this is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone—over and over again. Similar techniques are also used for detecting and blocking suspicious logins to protect our users’ accounts. Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back onto our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users.” At other times, Kalanick has proved less willing to compromise: at least, not until the very last minute. Another recent example is Uber’s testing with self-driving vehicles, which the company has said will eventually allow it to move beyond human drivers. Unlike such projects from other companies, Uber opted to begin testing first in San Francisco rather than apply for permission, with execs arguing that its trials fitted neatly through a loophole in terminology that meant DMV approval wasn’t required. Unsurprisingly, California lawmakers didn’t agree, and it was only when they yanked the licenses for Uber’s test fleet that the company conceded. After making a big show of packing up the cars and moving them to Arizona, a state with a more liberal approach to on-road testing, Uber quietly applied for the necessary San Francisco permits. That came just in time for a lawsuit with Alphabet spin-off Waymo, which accused Uber of stealing autonomous car technology. Although giving users options beyond traditional taxis is Uber’s claimed reason for existing, at times its ambitions ride roughshod over things like privacy. It’s said that Uber purchased data from anonymized Lyft receipts scraped – legally – from the emails of users of the rival service, from a data intelligence firm that operates a free email digest service. Although users may not have realized it, by using that service they also gave the data firm, Slice Intelligence, permission to sell the anonymized contents of their inbox to other businesses. At the same time, it was trying to evade the eyes of authorities with a secretive tool known internally as Greyball. That allowed different driver locations to be shown to different users, in part as an attempt to undermine attempts to more tightly regulate the startup. However, some Uber drivers also used it as a way to avoid police and other law enforcement. The lingering question is how much Uber can continue to get away with and still remain standing. According to the NYT, though momentarily cowed by Cook’s ultimatum, the fact that his company made it through to the other side is said to have buoyed Kalanick’s resolve. With numerous lawsuits on the cards, and the #DeleteUber campaign showing no signs of fading, he’ll need as much of it as he can muster.

Without Steve Jobs at the helm, it was lost and tried entering every product category you can think of. Most of them failed commercially, though some have a legacy worth remembering. Apple Newton Long before the iPhone, Apple made the Newton - a Personal Digital Assistant or PDA. These days you may hear digital assistant and think Siri, but PDAs were like smartphones, except without the phone part. In fact, the term PDA was coined by Apple CEO John Sculley. The Newton was advanced for its day (it was released in 1993), but its high price prevented mass adoption. Still, its advanced features were not easy to come by in those days. Larry Tesler, former Lisa team member, set out to find a fast but low-power processor for Apples PDA but there were no suitable existing options. Eventually, he turned to Acorn RISC Machines (a fabless chip designer) and their partner VLSI (a chip maker). Apple Newton (photo: Blake Patterson)  Note the ARM 610 chip (photo: Binarysequence) Never heard of Acorn? It designed the processor for the successful BBC Micro. But youve probably know it under the name ARM. Yes, the ARM that created the foundation of practically all mobile CPUs today. Apple, Acorn and VLSI designed a new ARM core - ARMv6 - to power the Newton. Various ARMv6-derived processors would go on to power early smartphones, including several Androids and the Palm Pixi. Things moved on to ARMv7 and now ARMv8 (the 64-bit chips), but theres little competition. Intel bailed out of mobile chipsets while MIPS never had much of a foothold in the Android era. And modern ARM cores are not the only legacy of the Apple Newton. Two devs that worked on it would later found Pixo, the company behind the OS for the early iPods (all non-iOS iPods ran Pixo OS). Apple Pippin In the mid-90s Apple started licensing its brand to other makers who made digital cameras, CD players and even a game console. That console was the Apple Pippin and was manufactured by Bandai (you may know them from Power Ranger toys). In fact, the Pippin was more than a console - it was based on the Macintosh platform and ran a modified Mac OS. But Apple forbade Bandai from calling it a computer to prevent confusion (Apple also did zero marketing for the product). The Pippin was a multimedia center - it played games, yes, and it could also play music and video and even browse the web. However, with a $600 launch price it proved expensive, making it a commercial failure. Still, you can see the similarities with Microsofts Xbox - it was meant to be the brain of a home entertainment setup and it ran a version of the companys flagship OS. However, by all accounts the Pippin was not a very impressive game console. One game stood out to us, though, a sci-fi first person shooter called Super Marathon made by a small game developer known as Bungie. Yes, that Bungie, which 3 years later would go on to make Halo, another sci-fi shooter. Halo broke all sorts of sales records and in the two months after its release, a Halo disc was sold alongside half of Xbox consoles. Many bought Microsofts console specifically for the game - just think what might have been if Bungies Pippin game sold so well. Apple eWorld In 1988 Apple and Quantum Computer Services launched AppleLink Personal Edition for the Apple II and the Macintosh. Later (in 1994) the two companies would partner again to create eWorld. Presented as a city with various buildings, eWorld offered e-mail (at the post office, of course), BBS (at the community center) and so on. Welcome to eWorld  installation diskettes Quantums co-founder and CEO Steve Case spend three months in California trying to convince Apple to let his company run the new service. Apple would get a 10% royalty of the $8.95 monthly subscription and $7.95 hourly charge (between 6am-6pm, outside that period it was $4.95 an hour). Perhaps youve never heard of Quantum, but thats only because in 1991 it rebranded to America Online or AOL. Sure, today AOL is mostly an empty husk, but in its heyday it was the dominant Internet provider in the US. Seriously, at the time 50% of CDs made in the whole world were AOL CDs. Plus, Apples later efforts to build an online community were no more successful than eWorld - you could argue that iTunes Ping was actually worse (it sure didnt last any longer).

Moss federal courthouse. A pair of editorials in The New York Times and Business Insider exclaimed recently that the power in the tech industry is concentrated among too few companies, with both publications calling for a new round of antitrust regulation akin to the Department of Justice action against Microsoft in the 1990s. This argument is stunningly, spectacularly wrong. Yes, the five big tech companies—Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft—are more powerful collectively than the tech industry has ever been. They're the five largest companies in the U.S., as measured by market cap, and have been driving most of the stock market's gains since January. It's also easy to argue, as Matt Stoller does in the Business Insider piece, that innovation in the tech industry is in a lull. Venture capital-funded companies like Juicero, which sells a $400 juicer, as a highly visible example. (A recent Bloomberg investigation showed that the juice packets could actually be squeezed by hand to the nearly same effect as the $400 juicer, which apparently irritated some of the start-up's early investors.) Yet what both of these facts actually demonstrate is that the tech industry is one of the nation's most vibrant, subject to constant competition and disruption—precisely the opposite of the market characteristics antitrust law was meant to stop. Consider: The Big Five are in constant competition. The fact that there are five powerful companies at the top of this industry, rather than one (as was arguably the case with Microsoft in the 1990s) should be a clear clue that the tech industry is exceptionally vibrant. In fact, it's not clear that any of these companies has an actual monopoly, and it depends on how you define the market. Does Google have a monopoly search market? Probably. But it makes its money from online advertising, where it faces clear competition from Facebook. Amazon arguably has a monopoly only if you define e-commerce as a separate market from retail. Apple doesn't seem to have a monopoly anywhere. But more to the point, these five companies are in constant battle, both at the margins and in their core areas of business. Consider the following: Apple invented the modern smartphone business with the iPhone in 2007, but Google quickly rolled out a competing platform, Android, and licensed it broadly to the point where it now has more than 80 percent of the global market; Amazon is constantly improving product search in an effort to undercut one of Google's core sources of revenue—search ads that appear when the user seeks information on a particular product; Facebook is competing against Google for every dollar available in online advertising, particularly in video; Apple has its own suite of mobile productivity apps that compete with Microsoft's Office apps on its devices, while Google has a strong online version of these kinds of apps; Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are in brutal competition for the cloud computing market, which itself is disrupting traditional software vendors like Oracle and SAP, with hundreds of billions of dollars of corporate IT budgets at stake. And on and on. This isn't a case of five companies sitting comfortably on their piles of gold and colluding to stay out of each other's core areas. It's all-out war, year after year. The evidence of fast disruption in the industry is clear. Contrary to Stoller's argument, Google did not beat Microsoft because of antitrust litigation; the areas where Microsoft was restricted from competing related to web browsers and forcing PC makers to accept and reject certain software as a condition for getting Windows. Google became a threat to Microsoft because it solved an entirely different problem that Microsoft hadn't even been focused on—organizing the burgeoning mass of information on the Internet in a way that made it easy for people to find what they were looking for. By the time Microsoft woke up and tried to beat Google with its own search engine, MSN Search (later Bing) in 2005, it was already too late. Getty Images Larry Page chief executive officer of Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc. There are plenty of other examples. As recently as 2007, Microsoft had the only operating system that mattered—Windows. A decade later, Windows is in third place behind Google's Android and Apple's iOS, which conquered mobile computing devices and caught Microsoft flat-footed. Facebook swept into an online advertising market dominated by Google in 2012, and ended up capturing a huge portion of mobile online ads, catching Google flat-footed. And on and on. A vibrant start-up market is a sign of competition. Yes, Juicero was a silly idea. (Although as former Microsoft exec and current venture capitalist Steven Sinofsky pointed out to me on Twitter, the company that owns the similar Keurig drink-pod system sold for $14 billion in 2015.) But the fact that these silly ideas are getting funded is a sign of vibrancy, not a sign that innovation is being squashed by monopolists. Take for example Snap, which is losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year, but was funded by venture capitalists to the tune of $2.65 billion before going public earlier this year at a valuation over $20 billion. It is now causing enough panic at Facebook that the company is imitating Snapchat's core features as fast as its developers can code them. Or look at Jet.com, a venture-funded competitor to Amazon that Wal-Mart snapped up for over $3 billion last year. Or on the enterprise side, Okta set out to solve a problem in an area that Microsoft had dominated for most of the last decade—how to sign employees in to the apps they need to use, without making them enter a username and password every time. Microsoft's solution was designed back when most companies used apps from a few vendors, running on their own in-house computers; Okta saw that companies were moving toward using cloud-based apps from a wide variety of vendors and exploited that niche. It went public earlier this month at a market cap of over $2 billion. Source: Okta Okta co-founder and CEO Todd McKinnon. Price competition benefiting customers. U.S. antitrust law focuses on harm to consumers—it's not enough for a company to be dominant, it must be using that dominance to raise prices or lower selection for consumers. (It's different in Europe, where the dominance itself can be cause for restriction.) The evidence is quite to the contrary. Amazon is in brutal competition with physical retailers to offer consumers the lowest prices on almost anything they could want to buy. Google and Facebook offer their services for free to consumers, and are fiercely competitive when it comes to their paying customers—advertisers. Meanwhile, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are locked in a price war for cloud computing. Venture capital-subsidized start-ups like Uber give consumers more choices at lower prices than they've ever had. Antitrust is a blunt instrument No doubt, these five companies are powerful. There may indeed be cases where regulators need to step in and restrict these companies from harming consumers. For instance, you could argue that Google and Facebook have too much information about people's web-surfing and buying habits, and that they should be subject to strict privacy restrictions on how they use that information. You could argue that Amazon's cutthroat negotiations with suppliers will have a long-term negative effect on price and selection by forcing smaller retailers and e-tailers out of business, and look for ways to regulate that. Regulators should certainly be on the lookout for any evidence of collusion between the big powers in tech—as happened with the class action suit over employee salaries at Apple, Google, and several other big companies that was settled in 2015. But antitrust law is a blunt instrument meant to be used in cases of obvious market dominance that's clearly hurting consumers. That's not at all what the tech industry looks like today.

At the time, Uber was reportedly trying to stop its own drivers from defrauding the company. Some were creating fake accounts and using those accounts to request rides in order to cash in on an incentive program meant to encourage them to take more rides. When Uber caught on, they had their engineers assign a “persistent identity” to iPhones with a small piece of code, the Times reported. The practice is called “fingerprinting.” That way, Uber could identify an iPhone even after the device had been wiped. But that violates Apple’s privacy policies. To hide the activity, Kalanick reportedly had his engineers “geofence” Apple’s headquarters and obscured the app’s code in that area, so that Apple engineers couldn’t see Uber’s fingerprinting, the Times reported. “This is like a holy trinity of privacy disaster: 1) secret tracking that 2) persists after users delete app 3) in knowing violation of rules,” Dustin Volz with Reuters said on Twitter Sunday. Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple reportedly found out about the policy violations in 2015 and called a meeting with Uber’s CEO, Travis Kalanick. The report of Uber’s policy violations comes just one month after the company announced that it would end the use of a controversial tool called “Greyball” the company has used to identify and evade regulators in markets in which the car sharing service is prohibited. Greyball relied on at least a dozen factors, including location information and credit card data, to determine if a user hailing a car was a regulator or law enforcement official. Earlier in March, Kalanick issued a public apology after a recording of him engaging in a heated argument with an Uber driver was made public. At the time, the company was already dealing with serious backlash from its response to President Donald Trump’s first travel ban and allegations of systemic sexism at the company. The #DeleteUber campaign went viral and Uber sent an email to customers saying the company was “deeply hurting.” According to the Times, Uber now operates in more than 70 countries and is valued at nearly $70 billion.

Now, the company is hoping to strike Lightning twice with a similarly retro styled iPhone stand, the M4. But somehow, it feels like the M4 fails at everything that made the original W3 great. First off is design — while both the W3 and M4 share a similar beige Macintosh aesthetic, the W3, by virtual of the square screen on the Apple Watch, actually resembles the original product. In contrast, the M4 iPhone stand offers a stretched-out funhouse mirror version of the classic computer. Secondly, when it comes down to it, the M4 isn’t very useful. The Apple Watch’s inductive charger meant that you could easily slide the Watch down through the slot at the top to easily charge the device with the W3, plus there was the added benefit of activating Apple’s dock-focused Nightstand mode. The M4 case moves the entry point to the side, making it far more difficult to slip your phone in, and at the end of the day, you’ll still have to plug in a charging cable manually. Plus, once it’s actually in the case, there still isn’t any real benefit to propping up your iPhone like a miniature computer beside the novelty of it. I somehow doubt that Elago’s hypothetical use case of connecting a Bluetooth keyboard for getting work done is realistic. Lastly, there’s the price. While the W3 could be justified as a cheap, cute toy at $15, the M4 costs over double that at a whopping $35 — almost as much as Apple’s (also overpriced) official Lighting dock, and that at least has the benefit of charging your phone and adding back a 3.5mm headphone jack. I really liked the original W3 dock — it was a geeky bit of fun that managed to neatly balance cost and utility while appealing to my sense of retro nostalgia. But with the M4, it feels like that appeal has turned into senseless pandering.

Follow Kyle: Twitter | IG  Apr 23, 2017 Share Tweet Uber's ability to track your location is a big part of how they're able to provide speedy pick-ups for customers around the world. But according to a new report from the New York Times, they may have stepped over the line in their pursuit of expansion. The chief executive officer of Uber, Travis Kalanick, was profiled in a story about a tumultuous time for the ride-sharing app. In an effort to shine a light on the difficulties facing Kalanick, the Times revealed a stunning detail: Uber was identifying and tagging iPhone users even after they deleted their app, which forced Apple CEO Tim Cook to step in. For months, Mr. Kalanick had pulled a fast one on Apple by directing his employees to help camouflage the ride-hailing app from Apple’s engineers. The reason? So Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased — a fraud detection maneuver that violated Apple’s privacy guidelines. But Apple was on to the deception, and when Mr. Kalanick arrived at the midafternoon meeting sporting his favorite pair of bright red sneakers and hot-pink socks, Mr. Cook was prepared. “So, I’ve heard you’ve been breaking some of our rules,” Mr. Cook said in his calm, Southern tone. Stop the trickery, Mr. Cook then demanded, or Uber’s app would be kicked out of Apple’s App Store. Though there's an understanding amongst younger tech users that your privacy is being compromised on a daily basis, this is an extraordinary overreach on Uber's part. Not only was Uber using their app to violate the privacy of their users, it was doing so intentionally and deceptively, in an effort to get around Apple's policy on the matter. The practice is just one of several ruthless decisions made by Uber under Kalanick's authority. Uber didn't become a global phenomenon by accident, and several unsavory practices were implemented in order to kneecap their competitors and dodge regulations that affected other players in the transportation industry. In places around the world where Uber service was deemed illegal, drivers were instructed to use an app called Greyball, which effectively allowed them to evade law enforcement by disguising the locations of cars and drivers. Not everyone was so focused on the invasion of privacy from Uber, and some readers had a little fun at Kalanick's expense: the real reason u should stop using uber pic.twitter.com/s0BZQrvSsE — Flexington Ave Local (@Dr_TacoMD) April 23, 2017 Can someone explain this quote about Uber's CEO? Who is tracking high scores in Wii Sports Tennis, and how are they measured? pic.twitter.com/f1imCyIPwm — Kyle Orland (@KyleOrl) April 23, 2017 It should be noted The New York Times originally printed their story with the word "tracking" in place of the phrase "identifying and tagging". In response to the controversy stemming from the initial story, Uber provided Complex with the following statement: We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they’ve deleted the app. As the New York Times story notes towards the very end, this is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone—over and over again. Similar techniques are also used for detecting and blocking suspicious logins to protect our users' accounts. Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back onto our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users.  Uber's overarching policy was perhaps best described by Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, who described Kalanick with a brief quote. “Travis’s biggest strength is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals," said Cuban. “Travis’s biggest weakness is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals. That’s the best way to describe him.”  Kalanick was previously under fire for being part of President Trump's advisory council. He has since resigned from the position after a social media campaign to delete the ride-sharing app was launched.

There have been several reports that Apple is exploring an AR smart glasses product internally. To add some fuel to the fire, Apple has recently hired prominent Final Cut Pro plugin developer Tim Dashwood, most well known for making 360VR Toolbox, which helped creatives make virtual reality videos … The best, strongest, Lightning cables ... buy braided cables here His new employment was brought to light by the blog FCP.co. Dashwood’s premier software offering was 360VR Toolbox which comprised various filters, utilities and tools to create stereoscopic 3D videos, and sold for around $1,000. The plugin was compatible with Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premier and After Effects. For existing users of the plugin, the news is bittersweet as it means the toolkit is unlikely to see any more feature updates. However, as a gesture, Dashwood has made the app available to anyone as a free download (as well as the rest of his company’s software). It remains to be seen whether Apple will integrate the same ilk of VR features into future versions of Final Cut Pro. Dashwood may have been hired to work on FCP, join Apple’s augmented reality team, or some other job in the company. Apple’s efforts with augmented reality are still largely unknown and it seems any AR-oriented consumer hardware is years away. However, the iPhone 8 may debut with some AR technology this year; the front camera is expected to include 3D depth-projection sensors which will enable some virtual reality features.

(GuruFocus) Which company will hit a $1 trillion valuation first, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) (current valuation $430 billion) or Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) (current valuation $756 billion)? According to Piper Jaffray's Michael Olson, Amazon will be first to hit the coveted milestone even though Apple has a notable head start. Speaking as a guest on CNBC's "Squawk Box" segment on Friday, Olson argued that the company to win the race to $1 trillion will be the one that has the most "shots on goal to having a new leg of innovation" within the business. That's Amazon given its potential expansion into same day and same hour delivery services, AWS and a shift to advertising on its platform. On the other hand, the analyst sees Apple as being a "product cycle company" with a "less defined" path toward innovation. As such, Olson believes Apple will grow at a slower rate versus Amazon since roughly 80 percent of its business is tied to the iPhone and related services revenue. When Will Amazon Hit The Trillion-Dollar Mark? Investors hoping for Amazon's stock to more than double in the near term should adjust their expectations and may need to wait at least five years. Olson acknowledged that his valuation metrics don't extend five years, but the path to Amazon hitting a $1-trillion valuation is still simple: Apply a multiple that most investors are using on Amazon today, and apply it an EBITDA that is six years out.

Could Soon Compete With SpaceX -- but Not How You'd Think Sadly, we're not talking about an Apple Rocket. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Apr 23, 2017 at 12:00PM Investors already know that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is actively searching for its next big hit, be it autonomous electric cars, augmented reality, or a toaster-refrigerator. There's now a clue of another possible idea floating around Cupertino: space internet. Bloomberg reported on Friday that Apple has poached two high-level Alphabet executives that worked on satellite and spacecraft projects for Google, John Fenwick and Michael Trela. Trela served as Google's head of satellite engineering from August 2014 to March 2017, according to his LinkedIn profile. Fenwick was Google's head of spacecraft operations over the same time frame, according to his LinkedIn profile. Neither executive's profile has been updated to mention Apple. Image source: Getty Images. Apple may have "potential interest in space" The report notes that aerospace giant Boeing (NYSE:BA) has expressed interest in pursuing space internet with a network of 1,000 satellites, saying that Boeing has held talks with Apple as a potential investor and partner. Apple may in fact be helping fund the project, according to Bloomberg, citing a blog post from satellite and telecom consultant Tim Farrar, but Apple's involvement beyond that is unclear. Farrar wrote last month, "Boeing has also indicated to these people that it does not need export credit funding for the project, which supports the idea that this project is backed by a deep pocketed US entity." After ruling out other tech giants that have expressed extraterrestrial interest, Farrar concludes, "That only leaves Apple as never having discussed publicly its potential interest in space." Apple does have the deepest pockets of any company on Earth, after all. Tim Cook vs. Elon Musk This all comes a few months after The Wall Street Journal got ahold of leaked financials for Elon Musk's SpaceX, which is privately held. Of course, SpaceX's primary mission is to achieve full and rapid reusability of rockets in order to realize massive reductions in the cost of space travel, which the company hopes will pave the way for subsequent colonization of Mars. The business is currently built on launch contracts, but the internal information that was obtained shows that SpaceX has lofty ambitions for creating a satellite internet business within a matter of years, potentially starting as early as 2019. Image source: SpaceX. SpaceX's projections estimate that the service could garner 40 million subscribers and generate over $30 billion in revenue by 2025, according to the report. In contrast, the launch business is only expected to bring in $5 billion in sales that year, meaning that SpaceX believes that there's much more financial opportunity in beaming space internet down to Earth than launching reusable rockets. Operating income is forecast between $20 billion and $25 billion in 2025, which would largely be driven by the new business. The company had previously disclosed plans to launch over 4,400 satellites into low-Earth orbit to deliver low-latency internet from space, but had not mentioned financial expectations. Apple has been wanting to grow services revenue People have been dreaming of space internet for over a decade, and there have been many casualties over the years. But as things tend to go in technology, things change rapidly over time, and that rate of change only accelerates. Falling costs have opened up the potential for a new wave of space entrepreneurs; start-up OneWeb raised $1.2 billion last year to build and launch a space internet network. It's entirely possible that Apple has something else in mind, but given the company's heavy emphasis on services in recent quarters, it seems conceivable that Apple sees potential in building a strong base of recurring revenue from a literal moon shot like space internet. However, even if you accept SpaceX's forecast, $30 billion still isn't a game changer on Apple's income statement, although it would be a welcome addition to the services segment (currently a $25 billion business). There would immense costs associated with building such a constellation, but the Mac maker is currently sitting on the most cash that it's ever had ($246 billion at last count, before factoring in debt). Space internet revenue also wouldn't have as high of margins compared to Apple's terrestrial services, given these costs. Still, I'm hoping that Apple one day announces "the most extraterrestrial service we've ever made." Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

A new wide-raging profile from The New York Times, however, offers more detail on Uber’s location tracking habits, and how they almost got the app banned from the App Store… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case The profile covers a variety of different things about Uber and is well worth a read, but the most startling tidbit of information is just how far Uber went in trying to trick Apple engineers. What Uber wanted to do was assign a persistent identity to iPhones with a small piece of code, better referred to as “fingerprinting.” This tactic, however, is in complete violation of Apple’s rules as the company believes a device should offer no trace of the owner’s identify after being erased. Here’s how Uber maneuvered around these rules: So Mr. Kalanick told his engineers to “geofence” Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., a way to digitally identify people reviewing Uber’s software in a specific location. Uber would then obfuscate its code from people within that geofenced area, essentially drawing a digital lasso around those it wanted to keep in the dark. Apple employees at its headquarters were unable to see Uber’s fingerprinting. As you might expect, however, it didn’t take long for Apple and its engineers to catch on to Uber’s tactics and the issues went straight to the top. Tim Cook called Uber CEO Travis Kalanick to come meet with him on Apple’s campus. Cook reportedly opened the meeting with a simple, “So I’ve heard you’ve been breaking some of our rules.” He went on to demand that Uber stop the fingerprinting and put the app back in compliance with Apple’s privacy guidelines. The consequence for refusing this demand from Cook, was that Uber would be removed from the App Store. For Mr. Kalanick, the moment was fraught with tension. If Uber’s app was yanked from the App Store, it would lose access to millions of iPhone customers — essentially destroying the ride-hailing company’s business. So Mr. Kalanick acceded. Last December, Uber was accused of tracking customers for weeks after their last trip. While Uber explained itself, it’s clear that the company still has some issues with location data.

By Sarmistha Acharya April 23, 2017 17:07 BST Apple granted permission to test its self-driving cars on 14 AprilReuters/Carlo Allegri In a document submitted to California regulators earlier this month, Apple has outlined plan to train the operators of self-driving cars, seeding details about its autonomous driving system technology. The California Department of Motor Vehicles granted a permission to Apple to test self-driving cars on 14 April. In a document released by California containing Apple application, obtained by Reuters, reveals details about company's self-driving car technology. Included in the application is a 10-page training plan related to operators taking back manual control of the car during automated driving exercise of the system. It also includes a document called "Automated System: Development Platform Specific Training Overview" which aims "to train safety drivers in various automated driving conditions". The document reads, "Development platform will be controlled electronically (e.g. joystick) and safety drivers must be ready to intervene and take control." The document states high-speed driving, tight U-turns and lane changes, are some of the aspects need to be tested. However, it does not include details about how Apple's self-driving car works, the kind of sensors are found on its three permitted vehicles or other technical details. In a letter sent to the state Department of Motor Vehicles, Apple noted its development platform "will have the ability to capture and store relevant data before a collision occurs".

Plays With Fire A tense 2015 encounter with Apple CEO Tim Cook revealed that Uber was secretly tracking iPhone users after they deleted the app. Cook threatened to bar Uber from the Apple Store. Incident underscored Kalanick's win-at-all-costs mentality, sources told The Times. By Mike Isaac 15 Hours AgoThe New York Times SHARES David Orrell | CNBC Travis Kalanick. SAN FRANCISCO — Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber, visited Apple’s headquarters in early 2015 to meet with Timothy D. Cook, who runs the iPhone maker. It was a session that Mr. Kalanick was dreading. For months, Mr. Kalanick had pulled a fast one on Apple by directing his employees to help camouflage the ride-hailing app from Apple’s engineers. The reason? So Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased — a fraud detection maneuver that violated Apple's privacy guidelines. But Apple was on to the deception, and when Mr. Kalanick arrived at the midafternoon meeting sporting his favorite pair of bright red sneakers and hot-pink socks, Mr. Cook was prepared. “So, I’ve heard you’ve been breaking some of our rules,” Mr. Cook said in his calm, Southern tone. Stop the trickery, Mr. Cook then demanded, or Uber’s app would be kicked out of Apple’s App Store. For Mr. Kalanick, the moment was fraught with tension. If Uber’s app was yanked from the App Store, it would lose access to millions of iPhone customers — essentially destroying the ride-hailing company’s business. So Mr. Kalanick acceded. In a quest to build Uber into the world’s dominant ride-hailing entity, Mr. Kalanick has openly disregarded many rules and norms, backing down only when caught or cornered. He has flouted transportation and safety regulations, bucked against entrenched competitors and capitalized on legal loopholes and gray areas to gain a business advantage. In the process, Mr. Kalanick has helped create a new transportation industry, with Uber spreading to more than 70 countries and gaining a valuation of nearly $70 billion. But the previously unreported encounter with Mr. Cook showed how Mr. Kalanick was also responsible for risk-taking that pushed Uber beyond the pale, sometimes to the very brink of implosion. Crossing that line was not a one-off for Mr. Kalanick. According to interviews with more than 50 current and former Uber employees, investors and others with whom the executive had personal relationships, Mr. Kalanick, 40, is driven to the point that he must win at whatever he puts his mind to and at whatever cost — a trait that has now plunged Uber into its most sustained set of crises since its founding in 2009. “Travis’s biggest strength is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals,” said Mark Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks owner and billionaire investor who has mentored Mr. Kalanick. “Travis’s biggest weakness is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals. That’s the best way to describe him.” A blindness to boundaries is not uncommon for Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. But in Mr. Kalanick, that led to a pattern of repeatedly going too far at Uber, including the duplicity with Apple, sabotaging competitors and allowing the company to use a secret tool called Greyball to trick some law enforcement agencies. That quality also extended to his personal life, where Mr. Kalanick mixes with celebrities like Jay Z and businessmen including President Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn. But it has alienated some Uber executives, employees and advisers. Mr. Kalanick, with salt-and-pepper hair, a fast-paced walk and an iPhone practically embedded in his hand, is described by friends as more at ease with data and numbers (some consider him a math savant) than with people. Uber is grappling with the fallout. For the last few months, the company has been reeling from allegations of a machismo-fueled workplace where managers routinely overstepped verbally, physically and sometimes sexually with employees. Mr. Kalanick compounded that image by engaging in a shouting match with an Uber driver in February, an incident recorded by the driver and then leaked online. (Mr. Kalanick now has a private driver.) The damage has been extensive. Uber’s detractors have started a grass-roots campaign with the hashtag #deleteUber. Executives have streamed out. Some Uber investors have openly criticized the company. More from The New York Times: In House of Murdoch, Sons Set About an Elaborate Overhaul Elizabeth Warren on Big Banks and Their (Cozy Bedmate) Regulators Trump's Industry, Real Estate, Poses Hurdle to Tax Overhaul Mr. Kalanick’s leadership is at a precarious point. While Uber is financed by a who’s who of investors including Goldman Sachs and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, Mr. Kalanick controls the majority of the company’s voting shares with a small handful of other close friends, and has stacked Uber’s board of directors with many who are invested in his success. Yet board members have concluded that he must change his management style, and are pressuring him to do so. He has publicly apologized for some of his behavior, and for the first time has said he needs management help. He is interviewing candidates for a chief operating officer, even as some employees question whether a new addition will make any difference. He has also been working with senior managers to reset some of the company’s stated values. Results of an internal investigation into Uber’s workplace culture are expected next month. Through an Uber spokesman, Mr. Kalanick declined an interview request. Apple declined to comment on the meeting with Mr. Cook. Many of the people interviewed for this article, who revealed previously unreported details of Mr. Kalanick’s life, asked to remain anonymous because they had signed nondisclosure agreements with Uber or feared damaging their relationship with the chief executive. Mr. Kalanick’s pattern for pushing limits is deeply ingrained. It began during his childhood in suburban Los Angeles, where he went from being bullied to being the aggressor, continued through his years taking risks at two technology start-ups there, and crystallized in his role at Uber. Selling Efficiency show chapters Most of Uber's problems are 'self-inflicted': Recode's Swisher    Monday, 17 Apr 2017 | 11:17 AM ET | 02:27 Mr. Kalanick grew up in the Northridge neighborhood of Los Angeles. His parents, Bonnie and Donald Kalanick, made sure he and his brother, Cory, were never left wanting. He was naturally athletic and competitive, and excelled at running track and playing football. At Patrick Henry Middle School, he was a wiry student who got good grades — putting him in the sights of some older kids who picked on him. Mr. Kalanick later vowed never to be bullied again and turned the tables on his tormentors. He also showed signs of entrepreneurialism. One summer, he sold knives door-to-door for the cutlery company Cutco. At 18, he started New Way Academy, his own S.A.T. prep business, with a partner. The start-up life soon called to him. After attending the University of California, Los Angeles, to major in computer engineering, Mr. Kalanick dropped out in 1998 to form a start-up with several classmates. The company, Scour, became a peer-to-peer file exchange similar to Napster, which let people digitally share music and media files through legally dubious means. Scour, which was eventually sued for $250 billion for alleged copyright infringement, filed for bankruptcy in October 2000, a move that protected it from the suit. The failure did not stop Mr. Kalanick from helping to found another Los Angeles start-up, Red Swoosh, four months later. Red Swoosh made a technology to efficiently transfer large files of digital data; one of its investors was Mr. Cuban. Sean Stanton, Red Swoosh’s former vice president for sales, said of Mr. Kalanick: “Scour was about efficiency. Swoosh was about efficiency. It’s just the way his brain is wired. It’s like the way Uber works right now: What’s the fastest, cheapest and most efficient way to get from point A to point B? That consumes him, and all parts of his life.” With Red Swoosh, Mr. Kalanick started exhibiting his hallmark aggressiveness. When the company struggled, Mr. Kalanick and a partner took the tax dollars from employee paychecks — which are supposed to be withheld and sent to the Internal Revenue Service — and reinvested the money into the start-up, even as friends and advisers warned him the action was potentially illegal. With Mr. Kalanick desperate to keep Red Swoosh afloat, he moved back into his parents’ house. He staved off bankruptcy for a second time by raising another round of funding. The wayward tax dollars eventually went to the I.R.S. Mr. Kalanick also decamped to Thailand with his software team in April 2006 to save money by living cheaply abroad, while also using the trip as a team-building exercise. He was interested not only in business during this time. In 2003 he picked up a registration form to run for governor of California and registered a website, travis4gov.com, positioning himself as an independent candidate — though he never followed through with a campaign. In other personal pursuits, he once held the world’s second-highest score for the Nintendo Wii Tennis video game. In 2007, Mr. Kalanick sold Red Swoosh to Akamai, a cloud services company, for roughly $19 million. The deal turned the executive, who had headed north to San Francisco, into a millionaire. By then, some advisers had soured on him. “The Travis Kalanick I came to know 17 years ago was relentless in pursuit of his goals at the expense of those who supported him along the way, deluded by his own embellished personal narrative, and a serial prevaricator,” said Peter Yorke, a former Red Swoosh adviser and a longtime tech executive. Others stuck by him. Michael Robertson, chief executive of MP3.com, an early digital music sharing service, said that he told Mr. Kalanick, “Sometimes in business you have to battle the establishment, and it can get brutal and ugly.” In San Francisco, Mr. Kalanick and Angie You, his longtime girlfriend, bought a townhouse nestled in the upper hills of the city’s Castro section. Though the couple have since split, the two remain close and still speak on a regular basis. Uber’s Rise The idea for Uber came in 2009 from Garrett Camp, a friend of Mr. Kalanick’s, who became fixated on hailing a private luxury car with a smartphone app after being unable to catch cabs in San Francisco. Mr. Camp talked about the idea incessantly, including at Mr. Kalanick’s townhouse, nicknamed the “Jam Pad.” Entrepreneurs frequently stopped by to brainstorm there, and the house even had its own Twitter account, controlled by Mr. Kalanick . UberCab, as it was called at the time, started its service in San Francisco in May 2010. Mr. Camp and Mr. Kalanick picked that name to emphasize the convenience of calling a car on demand from an app. Mr. Kalanick wanted a break from full-time start-up life after running Red Swoosh, so he and Mr. Camp named Ryan Graves, who responded to a call for help on Twitter, as chief executive. A few months later, Mr. Kalanick changed his mind and took over as UberCab’s chief. He quickly positioned the start-up as an alternative to the taxi industry. At the time, taxi companies had iron grips in many towns. City-by-city regulations required procedures like base stations for cabs, safety measures and other stipulations. Mr. Kalanick ignored those rules. “We’re in a political campaign,” he once said at a technology conference, and the candidate is Uber. The opponent is named Taxi, he said, adding a rude descriptive. “Nobody likes him, he’s not a nice character, but he’s so woven into the political machinery and fabric that a lot of people owe him favors.” Mr. Kalanick carried that same level of intensity into Uber’s headquarters, pacing briskly while working by doing laps around the office. His pacing is so legendary, his father once said, that he wore a hole in the carpeting. Mr. Kalanick focused on growing UberCab quickly. The company typically sent a small strike team into a new city — say, Seattle — to aggressively recruit new drivers through Craigslist and other online listings. Then the team marketed UberCab’s app to increase ridership. That drew attention from regulators. In October 2010, the company shortened its name to Uber after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from San Francisco officials for marketing itself as a taxi company without the proper licenses and permits. To influence local legislators to accept Uber, Mr. Kalanick took extra steps. In 2014, Uber hired Ben Metcalfe, an engineer who described his job on LinkedIn as building “custom tools to support citizen engagement across legislative matters” to drive “social good and social change.” In practice, Mr. Metcalfe and his team created an email-based system to aid Uber users and drivers to directly contact local legislators to lobby for allowing Uber in their cities. The system was similar to Change.org, a website that pushes social change through online petitions. City and state officials were soon deluged with emails supporting Uber. In some places, Uber employees were also told to create computer programs known as scripts that would automatically vote for the ride-hailing service in city-administered surveys. Such tactics were effective. In 2015 when New York’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, tried capping the number of Uber cars, Uber added a “de Blasio” tab in its app to show lengthy waiting times for rides if legislation against Uber was allowed to go forward. People could easily send a form email to the mayor and City Council supporting Uber by pressing a button in the app. Mr. de Blasio capitulated, and the cap did not take place. Taking Center Stage As Uber gained momentum, Mr. Kalanick moved into the spotlight. It did not come naturally. One friend recalled a night out with a group of married couples at the Gold Club, a San Francisco strip club, a few years ago. Mr. Kalanick, who was single, pulled out a laptop to work on a spreadsheet, crunching Uber’s numbers while friends watched the dancers onstage. Another friend called Mr. Kalanick a “tech world rock star,” which means something different in Silicon Valley than in the music world. “To work with and around one requires a different kind of mentality and skill,” said Andy Abramson, an early adviser to Mr. Kalanick. Mr. Abramson likened the chief executive to other idiosyncratic founders like Jeff Bezos of Amazon. Mr. Kalanick was eventually coaxed more into the limelight by others. Shervin Pishevar, an Uber investor, sometimes took Mr. Kalanick to clubs in Los Angeles on the weekend, providing a car and a change of “club clothes.” Mr. Pishevar, who did not respond to a request for comment, was the Uber chief’s entryway into Los Angeles’s world of celebrity. Hollywood stars were eager to buy into Uber, which they had started using to get around. Actors like Edward Norton, Olivia Munn and Sophia Bush took small stakes in the company. Mr. Kalanick and a top lieutenant, Emil Michael, sometimes hung out with Leonardo DiCaprio, who is also an investor, and Jay Z, whose wife, Beyoncé, performed for Uber employees at a poolside party in Las Vegas in 2015. Jay Z once wired money to Mr. Michael in an attempt to invest even more in Uber. Mr. Michael and Mr. Kalanick, giddy at rebuffing a celebrity, wired some of the money back, saying they already had too many interested investors. Representatives for Jay Z did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Kalanick also dreamed of luring celebrities into advisory roles at Uber. One aim was persuading Oprah Winfrey to join the board — something Uber executives believed could happen after Mr. Kalanick met Ms. Winfrey at a party on the Spanish island of Ibiza — but the idea never jelled. A spokeswoman for Ms. Winfrey declined to comment. Mr. Kalanick began mixing with elite business executives. He developed a close relationship with Mr. Cohn, then a top-ranking executive at Goldman Sachs. At one point, the two men spoke on a near daily basis. Mr. Cohn and a White House spokeswoman did not return requests for comment. Leadership Principles Inside Uber, Mr. Kalanick began codifying the pillars of the company’s culture. He particularly admired Amazon, the e-commerce company that espouses 14 leadership principles including “learn and be curious” and “insist on the highest standards.” So he created 14 values for Uber, with tenets such as being “super pumped” and “always be hustlin.’” Some employees admired Mr. Kalanick’s deep involvement in Uber. “TK was hands-on and in the product weeds,” said Chris Messina, who left Uber in January, using Mr. Kalanick’s nickname. “He cared deeply about the product and the people building it.” Mr. Kalanick’s main mantra was “growth above all else.” That meant Uber’s top performers were often promoted and protected. When one general manager, a title for a city-level chief, threw a coffee mug at a subordinate in a fit of rage, the incident was reported to human resources — but there was no follow up. At the time, Uber’s business in the general manager’s city was strong. Other complaints also fell on deaf ears. After a backlash over Uber’s use of “surge pricing” (raising ride prices when demand is high) amid an East Coast snowstorm in 2013, Mr. Kalanick’s response to upset riders was a torrent of economics and math. “We did more trips because of our approach, not fewer,” he said in an interview withnWired at the time. “We gave people more options to get around, and that is the whole frickin’ goal.” Friends and employees told Mr. Kalanick that he should at least pretend to care about how it looked to take such a hostile stance with Uber’s users. Several described him as “emotionally unintelligent.” Mr. Kalanick made other missteps. In 2014, he and his then-girlfriend, Gabi Holzwarth, went to an escort bar in South Korea with Mr. Michael and other Uber employees, where they drank, sang karaoke and some members of the party picked out women as their dates for the evening. The incident, reported by The Information, resulted in a human resources complaint from an employee who attended. That same year, Mr. Kalanick discussed how Uber had boosted his desirability with women in an interview with GQ, calling the company “boob-er.” And just days after a former employee published a blog post in February detailing sexual harassment at Uber, Mr. Kalanick attended Vanity Fair’s Academy Awards party in Hollywood, stunning some colleagues with his perceived insensitivity. His desire for growth also knew few limits. Uber plunged into China in 2013, and Mr. Kalanick spent billions of dollars to outgun the local incumbent Didi Chuxing — only to have to retreat last year, partly because of heavy losses. Mr. Kalanick is now spending heavily in India to win there, even offering to become an Indian citizen if it will help Uber’s prospects. The company has said that it lost $2.8 billion in 2016, excluding China. For the Win With Mr. Kalanick setting the tone at Uber, employees acted to ensure the ride-hailing service would win no matter what. They spent much of their energy one-upping rivals like Lyft. Uber devoted teams to so-called competitive intelligence, purchasing data from an analytics service called Slice Intelligence. Using an email digest service it owns named Unroll.me, Slice collected its customers’ emailed Lyft receipts from their inboxes and sold the anonymized data to Uber. Uber used the data as a proxy for the health of Lyft’s business. (Lyft, too, operates a competitive intelligence team.) Slice confirmed it sells anonymized data (meaning that customers’ names are not attached) based on ride receipts from Uber and Lyft, but declined to disclose who buys the information. Uber also tried to win over Lyft’s drivers. Uber’s “driver satisfaction rating,” an internal metric, has dropped since February 2016, and roughly a quarter of its drivers turn over on average every three months. According to an internal slide deck on driver income levels viewed by The New York Times, Uber considered Lyft and McDonald’s its main competition for attracting new drivers. To frustrate Lyft drivers, Uber dispatched some employees to order and cancel Lyft rides en masse. Others hailed Lyfts and spent the rides persuading drivers to switch to Uber full time. After Mr. Kalanick heard that Lyft was working on a car-pooling feature, Uber also created and started its own car-pooling option, UberPool, in 2014, two days before Lyft unveiled its project. That same year, Uber came close to buying Lyft. At a meeting at Mr. Kalanick’s house, and over cartons of Chinese food, he and Mr. Michael hosted Lyft’s president, John Zimmer, who asked for 15 percent of Uber in exchange for selling Lyft. Over the next hour, Mr. Kalanick and Mr. Michael repeatedly laughed at Mr. Zimmer’s audacious request. No deal was reached. Lyft declined to comment. The rivalry remains in force. In 2016, Uber held a summit meeting in Mexico City for some top managers, where it distributed a playbook of how to cut into Lyft’s business and had sessions on how to damage its competitor. To grow its own business, Uber sidestepped the authorities. Some employees started using a tool called Greyball to deceive officials trying to shut down Uber’s service. The tool, developed to aid driver safety and to trick fraudsters, essentially showed a fake version of Uber’s app to some people to disguise the locations of cars and drivers. It soon became a way for Uber drivers to evade capture by law enforcement in places where the service was deemed illegal. After The Times reported on Greyball in March, Uber said it would prohibit employees from using the tool against law enforcement. The idea of fooling Apple, the main distributor of Uber’s app, began in 2014. At the time, Uber was dealing with widespread account fraud in places like China, where tricksters bought stolen iPhones that were erased of their memory and resold. Some Uber drivers there would then create dozens of fake email addresses to sign up for new Uber rider accounts attached to each phone, and request rides from those phones, which they would then accept. Since Uber was handing out incentives to drivers to take more rides, the drivers could earn more money this way. To halt the activity, Uber engineers assigned a persistent identity to iPhones with a small piece of code, a practice called “fingerprinting.” Uber could then identify an iPhone and prevent itself from being fooled even after the device was erased of its contents. There was one problem: Fingerprinting iPhones broke Apple’s rules. Mr. Cook believed that wiping an iPhone should ensure customers that no trace of the owner’s identity remained on the device. So Mr. Kalanick told his engineers to “geofence” Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., a way to digitally identify people reviewing Uber’s software in a specific location. Uber would then obfuscate its code from people within that geofenced area, essentially drawing a digital lasso around those it wanted to keep in the dark. Apple employees at its headquarters were unable to see Uber’s fingerprinting. The ruse did not last. Apple engineers outside of Cupertino caught on to Uber’s methods, prompting Mr. Cook to call Mr. Kalanick to his office. Mr. Kalanick was shaken by Mr. Cook’s scolding, according to a person who saw him after the meeting. But only momentarily. After all, Mr. Kalanick had faced off against Apple, and Uber had survived. He had lived to fight another day. Follow Mike Isaac on Twitter @MikeIsaac. Doris Burke contributed research.

Studded with performances from Aretha Franklin, Barry Manilow and Carly Simon, a premiere at last week's Tribeca Film Festival also featured a Silicon Valley celebrity: Apple. Apple Music has the exclusive rights to "Clive Davis: The Soundtrack Of Our Lives," which airs in New York City this week at the annual artistic confab. The film's director, Chris Perkel, tweeted the announcement, with a link to a report in Billboard. "Apple is a global innovator that has revolutionized the distribution of music," Davis said in a statement. The acquisition highlights Apple's methodical approach to becoming a taste-maker in the video content business. The documentary film profiles Davis, who helped launch the careers of musical icons like Bruce Springsteen, Whitney Houston and Santana. For Apple, the film joins a line-up of music-and-tech themed documentaries like Taylor Swift's "1989 World Tour," and shows like "Carpool Karaoke" and "Planet of the Apps." Davis' profile also fits with the company's long tradition of paying homage to visionary thinkers, like the company's "Think Different" commercials that celebrated those who "push the human race forward." Apple's Jimmy Iovine "remains obsessed with harmonizing the respective dialects of the entertainment industry, which he claims is insecure; and the tech sector, which he calls 'slightly overconfident,' Variety reported earlier this year. Davis, in a way, represents the type of person that Iovine says he is looking for: "We're trying to make the music service a cultural point of reference, and that's why we're making video." Gaining gravitas with the media and film industry has been a hard-fought battle for Apple, which enlisted Iovine in the early iTunes days to convince artists that they could trust the iTunes Store. Now, Apple is fighting those battles again, with new mediums and content. Apple's content boss Eddy Cue has reportedly been in and out of meetings with Paramount Pictures and Sony TV, sources told Mashable. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company has been trying for many years to orchestrate a type of "skinny bundle" for its Apple TV device, but hasn't necessarily been able to close deals with major content producers, according to Recode's reporting. Then there's streaming, a model that Apple has been trying to improve for artists that feel shortchanged. Cortney Harding, author of "How We Listen Now: Essays and Conversations About Music and Technology, said that the "Davis" deal is a smart move for Apple. "One of the biggest problems with streaming services is they don't have any way to differentiate themselves," Harding said. "Exclusives were a big thing...I don't think they worked, so they have sort of fallen out of favor. They can't compete on price. So they have different free intro periods, ad-supported versions. Where can they compete? By offering other types of content." The combination of piecemeal purchases on iTunes and Apple Music could eventually make Apple a one-stop hub for all kinds of content, Harding said. It also puts Apple Music out on the edge with services like Hulu and Spotify that are branching out into new types of content like virtual reality and podcasts. Plus, Apple has the cash to outspend almost any rival. CEO Tim Cook told analysts on a conference call last quarter that there "there's not a size that [Apple] would not do" when it comes to media acquisitions. "One thing they can do is just write a giant check," Harding said. "It's frustrating in the artist space that more artists aren't doing this...There's a lot of artists interested, it's just finding the funding."

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About General Apple is getting serious about self-driving cars Yoni Heisler @edibleapple April 22nd, 2017 at 6:02 PM Share Tweet Though Apple’s plans to develop and manufacture a branded car may currently be on hold, the company’s plans to research and develop self-driving car technologies appears to be moving forward. Just about a week after Apple obtained a permit to test autonomous vehicles in the state of California, Business Insider filed a public-records request and managed to gain access to materials accompanying Apple’s permit application. The filed documents provide us with some interesting new information regarding Apple’s training program for its nascent self-driving car initiative. Don't Miss: Someone rendered that leaked iPhone 8 design, and it looks even worse than we thought According to training materials which correspond to software Apple calls the “Apple Automated System”, it appears that Apple engineers have been busy developing a suite of software and hardware sensors designed to assist a car drive with the flow of traffic while avoiding other vehicles and pedestrians. According to the training packet, the car that Apple’s staffers are using to test the self-driving technology is outfitted with consumer video game gear such as a Logitech steering wheel and pedals to actuate drive by wire. Whereas Apple’s earlier car efforts seemed to entail hiring hundreds of employees with vast automotive experience across all aspects of the car development and manufacturing process, it stands to reason that Apple, for the time being, has decided to primarily focus its attention on self-driving technologies. With cars boasting Apple’s mysterious autonomous software having been approved for use on the road, California law holds that the drivers/passengers overseeing the testing must be sufficiently trained and ready to assume control of the wheel at any moment. Apple applied for a permit for six drivers to drive three Lexus RX450h SUVs. Apple’s drivers, named in the application, are mostly Ph.D.s specializing in machine learning, some of whom previously worked for companies like Bosch and Tesla, according to their LinkedIn profiles. Apple said its vehicles would be able to capture and store “relevant data before a collision occurs” in its application. That Apple is exploring self-driving technologies may not be all that surprising, but the more interesting question is if it really matters. As it stands now, we can only presume that Apple’s progress with its own technology isn’t anywhere close to matching what established automakers and a myriad of start-up companies have already developed. Going forward, it will be interesting to see if Apple’s foray into the self-driving world will ever yield a marketable product or if it will simply become an Apple research initiative that never sees the light of day. Apple’s full permit application can be viewed over here via AppleInsider.

On Black Friday 2016 Target was shifting 3,200 TVs per minute, and in the first few hours of Black Friday Amazon had sold over 100,000 children’s toys. In the US, Adobe reports that online sales hit $3.34 billion, with $1.2 billion of that coming from people using mobile devices. The most popular purchases? iPads and 4K Samsung TVs. It’s ironic that Black Friday drives so much traffic to websites, because it used to be about more traditional traffic: the name was used by US police to describe the chaos when everybody hit the sales on the same day. Black Friday still happens on the High Street, but increasingly the best deals - and the most shoppers - are online. When is Black Friday 2017? Black Friday is the Friday immediately after the Thanksgiving holiday in the US, so Black Friday 2017 will be on November 24th. It’s the starting gun of the Christmas shopping season, and it’s famous for what retailers call “ doorbusters”: deals so good that shoppers will try and break down the front doors to get at them. Inevitably that means it’s also famous for shoppers battling one another, with each Black Friday bringing a new bunch of YouTube clips showing people fighting over flat-screen TVs. Things got so bad on Black Friday 2014 that ASDA, Wal-Mart’s UK brand and the firm largely responsible for bringing Black Friday to the UK, decided not to do Black Friday 2015 or Black Friday 2016 at all. That proved to be an expensive decision. Like for like sales in the 13 weeks to January 1 2016 were down 5.8%, the firm’s worst quarterly sales ever. By comparison, in 2014 John Lewis UK reported that its Black Friday sales were the highest weekly sales in the company’s 150-year history. Why Black Friday matters Black Friday has transformed the Christmas shopping season, for better and for worse. James Miller, senior retail consultant at Experian Marketing Services, told the BBC that “there is little doubt Black Friday has dramatically changed the way people shop in the run-up to Christmas and has created an expectation of deep discounts that arguably did not exist before,” while a report by LCP Consulting found that nearly one-third of UK and US retailers believe that Black Friday is “unprofitable and unsustainable." Before Black Friday became a big deal, the run-up to Christmas was a great period for retailers: we’d buy loads of presents for others and for ourselves, and retailers would make huge piles of money. Then Black Friday happened, and all of a sudden many of us were browsing the bargains for the presents to put in Santa’s sack. Money spent on deeply discounted products in November is money that won’t be spent on more profitable products in December. According to research by Verdict Retail, there is “no evidence” that Black Friday “stimulated demand”: Black Friday is essentially a black hole that sucks in a big part of people’s pre-Christmas shopping. We buy more but pay less for it. According to Mike Watkins of Nielsen UK, “Whilst Nielsen analysis shows that Black Friday in November 2014 did not deliver incremental food sales it did serve to kick start what was the slowest start to Christmas trading in over 10 years. Perhaps that’s the primary objective in these changing times.” Gary Booker, CMO at Dixons Retail, told Marketing Week that Black Friday negatively affects purchases in the following weeks: “It takes sales out of what would have been key early weeks in December,” he said, and multiple reports show that since Black Friday has taken off in the UK we’re spending less money on Boxing Day, our previous favourite for bargain hunting. That means retailers need to think very carefully about Black Friday: they can discount in the hope they’ll make up for the lower margins with higher volumes, or they can decide not to take part in Black Friday and potentially lose sales to rivals who do. Black Friday 2017 won't be so crazy Black Friday 2014 was particularly silly in the UK: while grown men and women knocked each other over to try and get cheap Polaroid TVs in supermarkets, men and women knocked over loads of websites too. Many retailers weren’t prepared for the volume of online traffic and their servers couldn’t cope. Other firms that hadn’t thought Black Friday was a particularly big deal tried to get in on the action. The result felt rather like some firms were running around with a pricing gun, discounting whatever they spotted. Black Friday 2015 was very different. Websites coped just fine - although some raised eyebrows with “oh! We’re so busy you’ll have to queue!” warnings that seemed more about marketing than reflecting actual demand - and retailers had a strategy in place. Where previous Black Fridays were crazy, Black Friday 2015 was calm. The difference? Planning. Retailers knew what to expect, had struck deals with suppliers well in advance and approached Black Friday like any other shopping event. There were still bargains to be had, but it certainly didn’t feel like bargain-conscious customers were getting one over on panicking retailers. Black Friday 2016 was different again: for many big-name retailers, instead of everything happening on one day, their sales were spread over an entire week from the Monday before Black Friday to Cyber Monday, the Monday immediately after. Cyber Monday used to be a separate event, the day everybody panicked and thought “oh no! It’s nearly Christmas and I haven’t bought any presents!” before visiting Amazon on their work PCs. But in 2016 it was just another part of Black Friday Deals Week. As Experian’s Richard Jenkings told the BBC, “The Black Friday promotions at the end of November are the start of a longer, more drawn-out peak season, which begins with most of the activity online and then moves in-store as we get closer and closer to Christmas day.” The best Black Friday deals from last year: Every year, we load up with pizza and energy drinks to scour the entire internet for Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals. These were some of our favourite deals from Black Friday 2016. £125 off the iPhone 7 Apple’s iPhone 7 may have been new but that didn’t mean you couldn’t get a Black Friday deal. With the code BLACKNOV125 you could get £125 off the up-front cost of an iPhone 7 - and no, the contract wasn’t more expensive to compensate. £130 off the PS4 The PlayStation 4 is a brilliant console, and last Black Friday it was a brilliant bargain too: there was £130 off the 1TB model and bundles costing as little as £189. Very chopped 34% off the price of some of its PS4 bundles and Amazon cut 20%. £40 off the iPad Air There were lots of iPad bargains on Black Friday 2016 including £40 off the iPad Air, £30 off iPad Pros and up to £50 off iPad Minis. Apple wasn’t offering those discounts, but it did bundle gift cards with various products. £900 off an LG OLED TV How’s this for a discount: Black Friday meant a massive £900 off the LG OLED55B6V TV, bringing its price down to a much less frightening £1,899. There was also £550 off Sony 4K TVs and up to £300 off Panasonic TVs. Huge savings on Xbox One bundles The 4K Xbox One S was just £199 with Minecraft and Forza Horizon thrown in, and prices were slashed all over the place for every conceivable combination of console, controllers and games. There were good deals to be had on accessories too. Why to expect from Black Friday 2017: The last few Black Friday deals periods saw many retailers taking baby steps, but in 2017 they’re all grown up. That means they’ve been poring over their spreadsheet models since the last Black Friday, and they know exactly what they’ll be doing this year. And the first thing they’ll be doing is trying to beat Black Friday by starting their deals early. What started as Black Friday weekend became Black Friday week, and this year we expect some big-name retailers to start discounting long before that. That makes sense for many reasons: it spreads the load on their websites and shops, and more importantly it means the news of their deals won’t be buried amid the avalanche of Black Friday announcements. So keep your eyes peeled - and keep visiting our deals page - from early November, and maybe even earlier than that. Something we saw a lot of in 2016 and expect to see even more of in 2017 is a sliding scale of discounting: we noticed deals got bigger and better as the month progressed. That’s likely to recur in 2017, with reasonable deals at the beginning of the Black Friday period and more exciting but limited quantity deals on Black Friday itself. The emphasis will be on the more expensive products where retailers can cut prices but still make a decent profit. Predicting the best Black Friday deals of 2017: iPhone 8 We know that Apple’s 2017 iPhone 8 is likely to be dramatically different from the current model, we can reasonably expect it to go on sale in September or October at the latest, and we know that iPhone 8 Black Friday deals will be very popular - so this one’s a slam-dunk. Expect similar discounts to 2016 chopping £100-plus off the up-front price, and Apple to offer gift cards across the range. We’d expect some decent deals on iPads too as Apple refreshes the line-up this year. Samsung Galaxy S8 Black Friday 2016 saw really good deals on the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, with the Black Friday voucher code BLACKFRI2 wiping out the upfront cost altogether on a £29.99 per month contract. That was a fantastic deal, and we’re expecting to see similarly great Galaxy deals on the Samsung Galaxy S8 in 2017. PS4 Pro Black Friday 2016 was all about the PS4 Slim, and Black Friday 2017 will be all about the PS4 Pro. As with 2016 we’d expect the very best deals to be on bundles, with some of them costing only a little more than the PS4 Pro itself, so start working on your game wish list: a bundle’s only a good deal if it includes the games you actually want to play. Up to now, the PS4 Pro is holding its RRP but you can expect that to change later this year, particularly when Microsoft has launched Scorpio... Xbox One + Project Scorpio Microsoft’s got a pro console too, and unless something goes wrong with the release schedule it should be on sale long before Black Friday 2017. As with the Xbox One in 2016 we’d expect to see the very best deals on bundles, rather than on the console itself: there’s more wiggle room for the retailer there, so they can afford to be more daring with the discounts. 4K HDR OLED TVs Black Friday 2016 was positively packed with TV deals, including nearly half-price deals on selected OLED TVs. High-end sets are where the really expensive RRPs are, and the ever-advancing world of telly tech means those prices can only be sustained for a fairly short time. If you’re in the market for the kind of TV whose price tag wouldn’t look out of place on a car, Black Friday 2017 could be a very good day for you indeed.

We scour all the top retailers’ Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals so that you don’t have to - and we tell you whether the deals are worth getting excited about too. Whether it’s a 4K HDR OLED TV or an Xbox One controller, if it’s discounted we’ll have the details here. How do I get the best Black Friday 2017 deals? Know what you want, know what you can afford to spend and know the market: you’ll often spot retailers charging higher than usual prices in October so they can offer amazing discounts on Black Friday. Pay particular attention to real prices, not RRPs: TVs are particularly bad for this, with sets whose RRP is eleventy billion pounds routinely selling for five hundred quid. Sites such as CamelCamelCamel and PriceSpy enable you to tell if you’re looking at a legitimate bargain or some timed tomfoolery. It’s also a very good idea to be flexible: for example, if you fancy a Sony 4K TV then think about the features you want rather than a specific model number: the BRV123ABD54-88C-9218-B may not be discounted on Black Friday, but an almost identical set with the specification you want probably will be. Can I get cashback on Black Friday deals? Sometimes, yes. Your debit card or credit card may offer cashback on purchases, and sites such as Quidco often offer cashback for new customers of big-name online shops. It’s definitely worth looking into, not just for Black Friday but for any online shopping. Am I protected when I buy on Black Friday? Yes. In the UK, anything you buy from a company online is covered by a wealth of consumer protection legislation including the Consumer Contracts regulations, which give you the same rights as with any other online purchasing. How can I stay safe on Black Friday? Black Friday brings out the scammers as well as the sellers, so be wary of unsolicited emails or links to deals on social media no matter how legitimate they look: anything asking for card details or login details is a scam. Phishing sites do big business on Black Friday, so be extra suspicious - and if you’re on a PC, make sure your security software is up to date. Many suites automatically block known scam sites.

Published on April 23, 2017. 0 We all know that things move quite fast in the mobile and tech industry, but one element of consistency is represented by the rivalries between the companies. We do have sometimes new competitors occasionally, but two of the main enemies around are Apple and Microsoft. Two of their best devices are the iPad Pro and the Microsoft Surface Pro 4. But let’s see how they stack against each other. Apple or Microsoft? Truth be told, the iPhone and the Mac are some of the best products on the market. However, if you have a quick look at the specs, it seems that the Surface Pro 4 is by far better than the iPad Pro for whoever is searching for a hybrid device. Various Configurations One of the biggest differences is the fact that there are more options with Surface Pro 4 than with the iPad Pro. With the Apple product you have 3 options: a 32 GB model, a plain 128 GB one and another 128 GB one but with 4G. All three of them offer 4 GB RAM and run on the same chipset, the A9X. Meanwhile, the Microsoft device lets you choose between 128, 256 and 512 GB internal storage. Moreover, you can also choose if you want to have 4, 8 or 16 GB RAM. Camera When it comes to the camera, both iPad Pro 12.9 and the Surface Pro 4 enjoy 8 MP back cameras. However, the one made by Microsoft includes a 5 MP camera, while iPad Pro only offers an 1.2 MP front one. At the same time, the Surface Pro has a more sophisticated and professional look, while the iPad Pro has the looks of an oversized iPad. OS The Surface Pro feels more like a laptop, given the fact that it runs on the Windows 10 OS. Meanwhile, the iPad Pro runs on iOS 9, which is not a full desktop one like the OSX.

The UK newspaper was one of Apple's launch partners and had included every single story on their platform. The move is a clear sign of displeasure in how these platform-publishing initiatives have treated the business needs of the Guardian. Many publisher have complained that the revenue they generate from Facebook and Apple pale in comparison the monetization from their own websites.   A Guardian News and Media spokesperson confirmed the removal, and issued the following statement to Digiday:   "We have run extensive trials on Facebook Instant Articles and Apple News to assess how they fit with our editorial and commercial objectives. Having evaluated these trials, we have decided to stop publishing in those formats on both platforms. Our primary objective is to bring audiences to the trusted environment of the Guardian to support building deeper relationships with our readers, and growing membership and contributions to fund our world-class journalism."   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     IPhone 8 Dummy Leaks From Foxconn Posted: Apr 23 2017, 8:57am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Apple   Credit: Benjamin Geskin‏   The iPhone 8, aka 10th anniversary iPhone is a new flagship smartphone that will sit above the new iPhone 7S. The iPhone 8 is rumored to have an 5.8" edge-to-edge OLED display and a new design. Apple will release three new iPhones this fall and not just two. At least this is the current consensus of the rumor mill. Don't Miss: Today's Best Deals on Amazon.com Today an iPhone 8 dummy leaked. Designer and leaker Benjamin Geskin shared photos of what he says is a CNC dummy sourced from Foxconn, Apple's manufacturing partner for the iPhone. iPhone 8 Dummy (This is CNC model according to Foxconn) Back is 2.5D Glass.#iPhone8 #iPhoneX #iPhoneEdition pic.twitter.com/Z8mH7b7z4r— Benjamin Geskin (@VenyaGeskin1) April 23, 2017 The alleged CNC model of the iPhone 8 shows black glass on the front and back. The frame is polished metal. The design has retro feel to it, reminding on the iPod. The dual camera is as leaked before aligned vertical. The photos of the dummy do not reveal how small the bezel in the iPhone 8 is going to be. The dummy does not include a screen. It does though not have the stupid fingerprint scanner on the rear shell. The leaked dummy suggests that Apple will succeed to have a fingerprint scanner integrated in the screen. There is no home button in the design. If this dummy is really showing the final design of the iPhone 8 is not known. It could be an early prototype or even a design Apple will or has dismissed. The iPhone 8 is supposed to be released in late 2017. It could be the most expensive iPhone ever. The internal technology is expected to be similar to the new iPhone 7S. iPhone 8 specifications include A11 CPU, 5.8" OLED display, 3D sensing front camera, wireless charging, IP86 waterproof and more.

Apple was granted a permit to test self-driving cars on April 14 by the California Department of Motor Vehicles but the company has never said anything about its plan. The state released 41 pages of Apple application documents to Reuters that give some clues about the company's highly secret self-driving effort, which it has never openly acknowledged. The iPhone maker joins a long list of carmakers, start-ups and technology rivals, including Alphabet's Waymo, that are testing cars on state roads. Apple is looking for new hit products and autonomous car technology is expected to revolutionize the traditional auto industry. As part of the application, Apple included a 10-page training plan that appeared to be related to operators taking back manual control of the car during automated driving exercises of the system, which it calls a development platform. Business Insider reports that Apple engineers riding in the back seats have the ability to take over control of the car using off-the-shelf steering wheel and pedal video game controllers from Logitech. Apple declined comment beyond the filing. The plan includes a document called "Automated System: Development Platform Specific Training Overview" whose objective is "to train safety drivers in various automated driving conditions." "Development platform will be controlled electronically (e.g. joystick) and safety drivers must be ready to intervene and take control," the document reads. The document highlights different scenarios to be tested, from high speed driving and tight U-turns to lane changes. One letter sent from Apple to the state Department of Motor Vehicles noted that Apple's development platform "will have the ability to capture and store relevant data before a collision occurs." The document does not include detail on how Apple's self-driving platform actually works or other technical details. It also does not say what kind of sensors are found on Apple's three permitted vehicles, all 2015 Lexus model RX450h. The permit does not necessarily mean that Apple itself is building a full car. Apple could instead be designing a self-driving platform that can be integrated into other manufacturer's cars. (By Alexandria Sage.

We’ll help you fix AirPods connection issues, AirPods charging problems and other issues like bad audio quality or problems switching them to another Apple device. Apple’s short delay in releasing the AirPods helped iron out many issues, but there are still some problems that users run into while switching between the iPhone and a Mac. It is very easy to fix most AirPods problems and it is unlikely that you will need to return or exchange your AirPods. Common AirPods problems and how to fix them. Here are the most common AirPods problems; How to Fix AirPods That Won’t Connect How to Fix AirPods That Won’t Connect to Mac How to Fix AirPod Call Disconnect Problems How to Fix Bad AirPods Battery Life How to Reset AirPods We’ll show you how to fix AirPods problems below, including what to do if you need to reset them, which can solve many AirPods problems. How to Fix AirPods That Won’t Connect If your AirPods won’t connect to the device that you normally use them with, the first thing to try is very simply. Put the AirPods back in the case. Wait about 10 seconds and then take them both out and put them immediately in your ears. How to Fix AirPods that won’t connect. After 3-5 seconds the AirPods should now connect to the device you primarily use with them. We find that if one AirPod won’t connect, adding the second to the mix is an excellent way to get them connected. Another thing that you can try is turning Bluetooth off on your iPhone or iPad and turning it back on. Swipe up to open the Control Center, tap on Bluetooth, wait 20 seconds and then tap on Bluetooth again. Once Bluetooth is back on you can try again. If this fails you may need to Reset the AirPods. Click here to jump to that section. How to Fix AirPods That Won’t Connect to Mac If you have an older Mac, it can be tougher to connect the AirPods to it. We occasionally run into issues with the Mac Pro. The steps are similar to those listed above, but you may not want to turn Bluetooth off on your Mac if you only have a Bluetooth mouse. How to fix AirPods Mac connection problems. Instead, let’s unpair the AirPods from your Mac and then re-pair them directly to that Mac. From there, iCloud will connect them back to the other devices. Go to System Preferences -> Bluetooth on your Mac and click on AirPods. Click on the X to unpair them. You can unpair them from any other device that you connect them to including your iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. If possible turn off all the other devices after you unpair them. On the Mac, go into the Bluetooth settings again and pair the AirPods. From there iCloud should sync the connection to your other devices again. In many cases, this will fix your Mac AirPods connection issues. How to Fix AirPod Call Disconnect Problems Some users report the AirPods disconnect on calls. This is especially annoying during important calls and while you are driving or walking. There are a lot of potential factors that can cause the AirPods to disconnect while on a call, so there are many steps you can try taking. How to fix AirPods call disconnect problems. The first thing to try is taking a call with just one AirPod in. This is the primary way we make calls, and it usually works without any problem. Set the AirPods to always use the right or left AirPod for the microphone. Go to Settings -> Bluetooth -> Tap on the i to the right of AirPods. Tap on Microphone and then choose left or right. You may also want to try turning off Automatic Ear Detection. This means the AirPods won’t know if they are in your ear, so you lose some features, but it could help you nail down why your AirPods are disconnecting during calls. Go to Settings -> Bluetooth -> Tap on the i to the right of AirPods. Tap on the toggle to the right of Automatic Ear Detection.  You can also try restarting your iPhone completely and by making sure your AirPods are fully charged. If that doesn’t fix the issue you may want to try a complete reset of AirPods. How to Fix Bad AirPods Battery Life AirPods battery life should be about five hours on a charge, another 3 hours with just a 15-minute charge and about 24 hours total using the case to charge in between sessions. How to fix bad AirPods battery life. If you are experiencing bad AirPods battery life you should make sure that the automatic detection is on. This will pause the AirPods when you remove them and it will help save battery life in the long run. Go to Settings -> Bluetooth -> Tap on the i to the right of AirPods. Tap on the toggle to the right of Automatic Ear Detection. Green is on.  Avoid constantly flicking the case open and closed near your iPhone. We don’t know for sure that this is draining battery life, but it is triggering an AirPods animation on the iPhone so it would make sense that some kind of Bluetooth handshake is happening. Some users report that the AirPods case is draining fast without any use. If this happens you can try resetting the AirPods. If that fails, you should contact Apple and go into a store to exchange for a new pair of AirPods. How to Reset AirPods It takes about 15 seconds to reset the AirPods and this will solve many of the AIrPods problems listed above as well as general connectivity issues and glitchy AirPods behavior. Put the AirPods in the case. Find the button on the back and hold it for about 15 seconds. When the small LED flashes orange it is complete. Open the case next to your iPhone and reconnect. iCloud will then sync the connection to your other devices. We found that after we reset the AirPods they connected faster and more reliably. This is worth trying if you have annoying AirPods problems that you can’t fix any other way.

Internet Feels Slightly Shoddy? Check the WiFi Connection Speed of Your Device with Your AirPort Router Despite reports suggesting that Apple has exited the ‘WiFi router’ business, the AirPort lineup of products from Apple are solid in what they do. Not only they are extremely stable at handling WiFi connections, but the user friendly way of setting them up is just pure gold. Related How to Check Remaining Memory Capacity of Your Apple Watch If you happen to have an AirPort base station at home, then you will be keen to learn on how you can check the WiFi connection speed of a device with your AirPort base station.

Josh Smith03/21/2017 What is the best iPhone 7 color to buy? Apple just added a Red iPhone 7 to the mix, after adding two new iPhone 7 colors in fall 2016. This brings the total iPhone 7 colors to six including, Silver, Gold, Rose Gold, Jet Black, Black, and Product (Red.) We’ll help you decide which iPhone 7 color option you should buy, and which iPhone 6s and iPhone SE colors you should buy as well. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are available in six color options for the first time. Apple still offers the iPhone 6s and iPhone SE in Space Gray, Gold, Rose Gold, and Silver. The new Product RED iPhone 7 is only available in 128GB and 256GB options. The new Red, Black and Jet Black iPhone 7 colors aren’t available on previous models so you’ll need to check them out on an iPhone 7. The other colors you have likely seen, even if you are overdue for an upgrade. Which is the best iPhone 7 color option? While the overall iPhone 7 design looks the same, Apple now hides the antenna lines better on four of the iPhone 7 colors. There are also many upgrades to the iPhone 7 like a new force touch home button, no headphone jack, upgraded speakers and it is water resistant so you might not need a case. In addition to the six iPhone 7 color options, there are two main front iPhone 7 color options. There is no option to customize the iPhone 7 color combinations from Apple, so this front color depends on the main color you choose. iPhone 7 Colors Entertainment If you plan to use the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus for watching movies and TV shows all the time, the Black and Jet Black iPhone 7 color options are the best options to consider. Jet Black and Black iPhone 7 colors offer a black front bezel that looks great for watching content. These iPhone 7 color options are the only ones with a black front bezel. The black looks a lot like the bezel on your HDTV, which means it creates a nicer looking frame for your content. This allows you to focus on what you are watching more. There is nothing wrong with the white iPhone 7 front color option found on Gold, Rose Gold, nd Silver when it comes to watching a movie for a number of users, but it can still prove somewhat distracting. There is a reason you don’t see white HDTVs. iPhone 7 Colors Style The new Red iPhone 7 color choice stands out. The Jet Black, Rose Gold, and Gold iPhone 7 colors are the most fashionable colors. The new red iPhone 7 is the most stand out choice. If you want an iPhone 7 color that screams, look at me or that confirms you are using the new iPhone, you should choose Jet Black or the Product RED iPhone 7. The Jet Black iPhone 7 includes a black Apple logo to complete the stunning design and the red iPhone 7 includes a standout silver Apple logo. Rose Gold and Jet Black are interesting fashion color choices for the iPhone 7.   Gold and Rose Gold are also a great choice that we see many users pick to use without a case or with a clear case, as it mixes well with a variety of styles and looks. The safest choice is Silver, as it works well with a multitude of colors and looks. The silver Apple logo also reflects the colors you are wearing. iPhone 7 Color Options The iPhone 7 color sample below shows what the new iPhone 7 color options look like next to each other and including the front and back. Here’s your ultimate look at the iPhone 7 color options. We’ve added the red iPhone 7 color below. This also uses the white front like the other fashionable colors. This is something to keep in mind if you are concerned about the color of front of the iPhone. iPhone 7 Colors Scratches While there was a major problem with the black iPhone 5 scratching, this is not much of an issue for the iPhone 6s. If you choose the black iPhone 7, or opt for the tired and true Gold, Silver and Rose Gold, you should be fine. Apple warns that the Jet Black iPhone 7 is more susceptible to scratches. Apple warns that the Jet Black iPhone 7 color scratches easier than other options. Apple cautions, “high-gloss finish of the jet black iPhone 7 is achieved through a precision nine-step anodization and polishing process. Its surface is equally as hard as other anodized Apple products; however, its high shine may show fine micro-abrasions with use. If you are concerned about this, we suggest you use one of the many cases available to protect your iPhone.” We’ve used the Rose Gold iPhone 6s Plus for a year without any real scratches, and haven’t heard from users complaining about the Gold or Silver option. Space Gray is still a solid choice on the iPhone 6s and iPhone SE. After six months of using the Jet Black iPhone 7 there are some scratches, but fingerprints are the bigger issue. Essentially, there is no best iPhone 7 color to buy that is tougher to scratch, but if you don’t want to see scratches you should avoid the iPhone 7 Jet Black color. The light color of the silver iPhone 7 may still give it a small edge compared to the other colors. iPhone 7 Colors Fading and Wear One other factor to consider as you choose between iPhone 7 colors is how it will handle wear or fading. We have not noticed any fading to the three older iPhone 7 color options as they exist on the iPhone 6s. Gold is still bright, Rose Gold as pink as ever and Silver as shiny as new. This will likely be the case with the iPhone 7 Black and Jet Black options. A gold iPhone color option can show discoloration if not cleaned regularly. One thing that is an issue to consider is wear and discoloration. We observe some discoloration on lighter iPhone 7 color options when users leave them in a case for long periods and expose them to moisture and then heat. This can cause changes to the colors or leave a stain as seen in the image above. If you regularly clean your iPhone 7 this shouldn’t be a problem, but if you like to buy and just use the iPhone without worrying, keep this in mind. iPhone 7 Cases Apple announced a collection of new iPhone 7 cases. If you plan to use the iPhone 7 in a case, you still need to decide what color looks best with that case. You will see a small portion of the iPhone 7 color show through the back and at the bottom of the case. The front iPhone 7 color is also still important. You can see how the Apple iPhone 7 cases look above, but it is also important to factor in the number of clear iPhone 7 cases available like the option from Speck below that lets the iPhone 7 color show through. If you use a clear iPhone 7 case, color is especially important. Which iPhone 7 Color Should I Buy? At the end of the day the best iPhone 7 color to buy is subjective. You have to choose the iPhone 7 color that fits your style and use best. Here is a helpful breakdown in case you are on the edge. Black iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus – You’ll be watching a lot of movies, you don’t like white phone fronts. Jet Black iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus – You want a standout iPhone 7 color, a black front and don’t mind the potential for scratches. Silver iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus – You want the iPhone 7 color that works with any colors and cases available. Gold iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus – You want an iPhone that stands out and you don’t plan on using a case. Rose Gold iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus – You want a fashionable iPhone (that is almost pink) that you will use without a case or with a clear case. Red iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus – You want to support Product RED, you want a standout iPhone 7 color. The most popular iPhone 6 color choice for nearly 40,000 Gotta Be Mobile readers was Space Gray, with 40% of the vote. Silver is in second with 31% and Gold in last place with 28%. The most popular iPhone 6s color choice for over 16,000 Gotta Be Mobile readers was Rose Gold with 5,209 votes. Space Gray was the second most popular option with 5,191 votes. Silver was in third and Gold was the least chosen color. Take Our Poll 28 Best iPhone 7 Cases Speck Presido iPhone 7 Cases   1 / 28 Speck chose to deliver a new line of iPhone 7 cases that look and feel amazing. The new Presidio iPhone 7 cases use upgraded material to deliver better shock protection while arriving in a thinner design.  The Presidio Grip, Inked and Wallet can protect your iPhone 7 from a 10 foot drop while the Presidio Clear, Clear + Glitter and Clear + Print are tested for an 8 foot drop. We already have these iPhone 7 cases on our iPhone and love the look and feel that they offer. $39.95 to $44.95 at Speck   1 / 28 6 Responses 09/11/2015 johnleyo Reply great article :D 05/09/2016 sam Reply Very nice article. I think silver looks better. 05/20/2016 simon Reply You should definitely go with the rose gold option since both men and women are buying this color. You should also get a rose gold case to go with it since they look pretty slick https://goo.gl/RqbEot 09/09/2016 Richard Reply Something about Jet Black exclusivity makes it more appealing although it may not be practical and may be less appealing than the matte Black. It reminds me of Gold when it first came out. 02/19/2017 Yash Nagorey Reply Silver would be the best choice… Brightest after jet black and has a classic look ! 😁 Finally its ur choice …Go ahead get ur favourite colored handset soon.. 04/23/2017 Swatantra Kumar Reply Read the article, it helped me to decide which colour I should go for. Also noticed, There is a typo in section iPhone 7 Colors Scratches >> “tired and true” (may be correction would be give nice experience to future readers) Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

The report details Apple's work in reducing its carbon footprint, helping suppliers do the same, and more. When it comes to clean power, Apple is working with the companies to its supply chain in an effort to reduce the overall environmental impact of the manufacturing process. From the report: As part of our clean energy program, Apple and our suppliers will generate and procure more than 4 gigawatts of new clean power worldwide by 2020, including 2 gigawatts in China alone, and use it to reduce emissions associated with manufacturing. Already, commitments made as of April 2017 represent a total of 2 gigawatts. Once completed, the 4 gigawatts of clean power will represent 30 percent of our current manufacturing carbon footprint. In order to help suppliers gain better access to clean energy, the company has launched the Clean Energy Portal, which offers guidance for acquiring clean power in that supplier's region. The portal will also be used to offer manufacturers updates on renewable energy as Apple makes strides in that area. Apple has also made some improvements to its own facilities, with 96% of their power now coming from renewable sources. This is up from 93% last year. The company is also looking to create what it calls a closed-loop supply chain, with plans to rely more on recycled materials in making new devices. The goal of this, ultimately, if for Apple to stop using mining in order to gather materials for its products. Apple has already made some strides in this area with the use of Liam, a robot used to disassemble iPhones down to their individual components. While moving away from mining completely will take some work, it's interesting to see Apple take on this issue.

DailyTimes | Apple self-driving car testing plan gives clues to tech program Toggle navigation    Home Pakistan World Business Sport Life & Style Opinion Blogs Today's Paper E-PAPER Archives Apple self-driving car testing plan gives clues to tech program By:   AFP 23-Apr-17 Top News Wanted BLA suspects arrested by LEAs in raid 24-Apr-17 29 KARACHI Fire breaks out in New Anarkali, Lahore 24-Apr-17 218 LAHORE ... CALIFORNIA: Apple was granted a permit to test self-driving cars on April 14 by the California Department of Motor Vehicles but the company has never said anything about its plan. The state released 41 pages of Apple application documents to Reuters that give some clues about the company's highly secret self-driving effort, which it has never openly acknowledged. The iPhone maker joins a long list of carmakers, start-ups and technology rivals, including Alphabet's Waymo, that are testing cars on state roads. Apple is looking for new hit products and autonomous car technology is expected to revolutionize the traditional auto industry. As part of the application, Apple included a 10-page training plan that appeared to be related to operators taking back manual control of the car during automated driving exercises of the system, which it calls a development platform. Apple declined comment beyond the filing. The plan includes a document called "Automated System: Development Platform Specific Training Overview" whose objective is "to train safety drivers in various automated driving conditions." "Development platform will be controlled electronically (e.g. joystick) and safety drivers must be ready to intervene and take control," the document reads. The document highlights different scenarios to be tested, from high speed driving and tight U-turns to lane changes. One letter sent from Apple to the state Department of Motor Vehicles noted that Apple's development platform "will have the ability to capture and store relevant data before a collision occurs." The document does not include detail on how Apple's self-driving platform actually works or other technical details. It also does not say what kind of sensors are found on Apple's three permitted vehicles, all 2015 Lexus model RX450h. The permit does not necessarily mean that Apple itself is building a full car. Apple could instead be designing a self-driving platform that can be integrated into other manufacturer's cars.   Sunday Magazine sunday magazine aaj kal Business Plus TGIF Zaiqa TV Company Financials Investor Information Contact us Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions © 2017 DailyTimes - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Powered By opustech.co

The UK newspaper was one of Apple’s launch partners and had included every single story on their platform. The move is a clear sign of displeasure in how these platform-publishing initiatives have treated the business needs of the Guardian. Many publisher have complained that the revenue they generate from Facebook and Apple pale in comparison the monetization from their own websites. A Guardian News and Media spokesperson confirmed the removal, and issued the following statement to Digiday: “We have run extensive trials on Facebook Instant Articles and Apple News to assess how they fit with our editorial and commercial objectives. Having evaluated these trials, we have decided to stop publishing in those formats on both platforms. Our primary objective is to bring audiences to the trusted environment of the Guardian to support building deeper relationships with our readers, and growing membership and contributions to fund our world-class journalism.” Many publishers continue to use the Facebook Instant Articles system, but it does not bode well that BBC News, National Geographic and The Wall Street Journal barely seem to be using it and the New York Times has pulled out altogether. One of the big draws about the Facebook system is that articles open within the app and load instantly. This is a boon to users who do not want to be taken to the mobile version of an external site, but publishers lack the data about who is reading what and cannot get full access to user data. The Guardian will continue to push for their paid membership scheme, if you have visited the newspaper site lately they are constantly promoting paying for monthly access. Although they have pulled out Facebook, the newspaper is making use of  Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages. In March the Guardian revealed that 60 percent of the Guardian’s Google-referred mobile traffic was coming via AMP.

Alison had been disappointed when the Dragons declared themselves out on the hit BBC2 show after she asked them to invest in her firm. But she impressed specialists from Microsoft, who asked her to design a device for their tablet/PC hybrid Surface which will launch this summer. The businesswoman also won a referral to Apple’s main supplier of ergonomic office equipment, Office Relief, who supply other tech firms in Silicon Valley too. G-Hold was originally aimed at the food service industry before Alison saw its real potential in the booming handheld device market.

Skip to content The Guardian pulls out of Facebook’s Instant Articles and Apple News News Podcasts Pulse Events Careers Sections News Podcasts Pulse Events Careers Hot Topics The Platform Effect Marketing on Platforms Brands in Culture Modern Newsroom Agency Culture Video Anywhere Retail Revolution Categories Media Marketing A guide to the Google ad-blocking conspiracy theories Duopoly Video Anywhere Brands in Culture The Confessions Media Marketing The Platform Effect The Guardian pulls out of Facebook’s Instant Articles and Apple News April 21, 2017 by Jessica Davies Publishers aren’t happy with the deal platforms are cutting them. Now, the Guardian has dropped both Facebook’s fast-loading Instant Article format and will no longer publish content on Apple News. The publisher had gone all-in on Instant Articles, running every single Guardian article via the format for the last year. It was one of first U.K. media owners to adopt the Facebook format, alongside BBC News in the spring of 2015. The Guardian was also among the first publishers to join the Apple News app when it launched in the U.K. in October 2015. It ran all its articles in the app. A Guardian News and Media spokesperson confirmed the removal, and issued the following statement to Digiday: “We have run extensive trials on Facebook Instant Articles and Apple News to assess how they fit with our editorial and commercial objectives. Having evaluated these trials, we have decided to stop publishing in those formats on both platforms. Our primary objective is to bring audiences to the trusted environment of the Guardian to support building deeper relationships with our readers, and growing membership and contributions to fund our world-class journalism.” The publisher ceased running content through both Apple News and Instant Articles today. The move is a clear sign of displeasure in how these platform-publishing initiatives have treated the business needs of the Guardian. Many publishers have complained the money they make off visits to IA pages, for example, do not measure up to what they get on their own sites. The Guardian isn’t the only publisher that has lately cooled on Instant Articles, with several publishers are running far fewer articles within that format, according to analysis by NewsWhip. BBC News, National Geographic and The Wall Street Journal barely seem to be using Instant Articles either. The New York Times has pulled out altogether. Plenty of publishers remain on IA, of course, but the loss of marquee publishers like The New York Times and the Guardian is not exactly a great sign of health. Other publishers are likely to take a hard look at where their interests intersect with Facebook’s. The same goes for Apple News, although signs point to many publishers seeing promise there. The draw of Instant Articles was that they load much faster than the Facebook links that take readers back to most publishers’ own sites. Engagement is also supposedly higher on those articles than regular Facebook links. But Instant Articles keep people within the Facebook app, rather than sending readers through to a publisher’s own sites, where they can monetize them more effectively, and have better control of reader data. The Guardian, under pressure to cut costs and boost revenue, is pushing forwards with its paying membership scheme, and for it to keep building that successfully it must prioritize driving readers back to its own site, where it can ask them to donate or become a paying member, as well as serve advertising. It has notched up 200,000 paying members, and over 100,000 one-off donations in the past year. The goal: to reach 1 million paying subscribers by 2019. Although the Guardian hasn’t confirmed the specific revenue made, 200,000 members paying the minimum price tier of £5 a month (£60/$76 a year), would equate to £1 million ($1.3 million) a month, £12 million ($15 million) a year. If the million paying supporters paid the minimum membership of £60 ($77) a year, that would create £60 million ($77 million) in revenue. Meanwhile the Guardian’s use of Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages, the rival to Instant Articles, seems to be going strong. In March the Guardian presented at AMP Conf, a two-day conference hosted in New York, where it revealed that 60 percent of the Guardian’s Google-referred mobile traffic was coming via AMP.

Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. iPhone 7 doesn't just keep up with the twice-as-many cores in Galaxy S8 — Apple trounces Samsung core-for-core. Here's why that really matters. You have four people in the family but only one of you has a driver's license. Sure, you can get through household chores in a quarter of the time, but anything that requires a car? Not so much. The same is true for processors. If half the tasks are serial and half are parallel, a processor could have infinite cores at its disposal, but all those cores crushing their half won't help with the other half one bit. It's easy to be blinded by the numbers. Cores can be the new megapixels. But every once in a while you see something that brings you right back to reality. Case in point: recent performance comparisons between Apple's iPhone 7, launched last September, and Samsung's Galaxy S8, launching now. Battle of the benchmarks The Apple A10 Fusion system-on-a-chip (SOC) in iPhone 7 mops the floor with both the Samsung Exynos 8895 and Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 found in the Galaxy S8 when it comes to single threaded operations. For everyone obsessing over which CPU is better for the Galaxy S8. pic.twitter.com/28TTXdIDhW— Jerry Hildenbrand (@gbhil) March 17, 2017 Both Samsung and Qualcomm's chipsets do perform faster than Apple's A10 Fusion for multicore operations, but there are four high performance and four high-efficiency cores in the Galaxy S8 to the two high performance and two high-efficiency cores in iPhone 7. It literally takes twice the cores to edge ahead in the results. (Hi, meet Amdahl's Law. ) And, it turns out, their efficiency cores aren't anywhere nearly as efficient as Apple's. Apple has obviously seen the value in over-delivering on single threaded operations and it shows. For things like interface and interactions, that's often the bottleneck. No matter how fast modern chipsets can swap, if the experience feels slow then the phone feels slow. In other words, it's really no mystery why iPhone scrolls better and feels more responsive than anything else on the market — monstrous single-threaded processing enables it to. Making silicon super There's an old story about Steve Jobs wanting sushi at the Caffe Macs, the campus eatery. So, he got the best sushi chef he could find to make it. Likewise chipsets. When it became clear iPhone and future products would require custom silicon, the story goes Steve Jobs set out to find the best chip designers in the world. That's now evolved into the hardware technologies org, led by senior vice president, Johny Srouji. Part of what makes it unique is that Apple doesn't sell its chipsets so it doesn't have to operate like a silicon merchant. It doesn't have to worry about the shelf-life of each generation. It doesn't have to concern itself with the demands of marketing, markup, or the interests of multiple, competing vendors. Apple's platform technologies team doesn't have to worry about being hobbled or constrained in any way — all they have to do is run iOS and iOS apps faster than anything else on the planet. That's their only customer. It makes for an incredibly appealing work environment for legends of the industry and the best and brightest new minds, a startling number of whom have now found a home at Apple. It's a dream job that doesn't just let them dream but actively encourages them make those dreams into a reality. We first saw what kinds of results the team could produce with the Apple A7. Rumors of it being 64-bit had run rampant yet few in the industry believed them at the time. Competitors had been content to languish at 32-bit with little or no impetus to push forward. Then iPhone 5s was announced and, instantly, everything changed. Apple immediately leapfrogged everyone else in the industry and, in the span of a few minutes, became not just its leader but its driving force. That might sound hyperbolic but, in hindsight, it's proven true. At first, many of us, myself included, struggled to understand why. Most fell victim to the old cliché of more bits only being useful to address larger amounts of memory, which didn't seem important on mobile. A few of us settled onto the cleaner instruction set or improved hardware security as the rationale behind the change. But what Apple really did with A7 was completely re-architect the chipset itself. That was the leap forward. 64-bit was just gravy. Tighter integration Apple has long believed that tightly integrating both software and hardware allows the company to deliver a better experience to customers. These days that's expanded to include services on one end and chipsets on the other. It means the platform technologies team can work with the software engineer group, and industrial and human interface design groups, to make exactly the atoms to support exactly the bits and pixels Apple plans to ship. Silicon has to work years ahead, of course, which means there's a predictive element to it not unlike shooting an arrow at another arrow that needs to not only hit it in mid air but ensure both continue on to the bullseye. But the result is, when new features like the camera team's depth-of-field effect for Portrait Mode, the image signal processor team has built in everything they need to support it. Conversely, Apple's silicon team also doesn't have to carry the baggage of competing vendors and devices. For example, Apple A10 doesn't have to support Microsoft's Direct X. It only and exactly has to support Apple's specific technologies and implementations. In other words, what iOS wants fast, the A-team can deliver fast. Chipset intelligence Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Vision — those are the buzzwords on every keynote stage and in every Silicon Valley startup pitch these days. As a side effect, it's forced Apple to be more open about its own endeavors in the space as well. For example, last year we saw how Apple's chipsets could accelerate face recognition so it was possible on-device. That way, you didn't have to upload all your friends, relatives, and children to the cloud just to get them tagged. Your personal photos could remain personal. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, also let it slip that Apple was using AI to improve things like battery life. That kind of technology only truly works when you control everything from the pixels to the chips. And it's an advantage not even Samsung enjoys who, despite making its own Exynos chipset, is somehow still unable to extract itself from the clutches of Qualcomm in the U.S. If you can't rely on a specific chipset being there, you have to program for the lowest common denominators. Peaks and geeks-benched Feature sets are more important than chipsets. Apple never shipped NFC, it shipped Apple Pay. Likewise, specs and benchmarks don't matter anywhere nearly as much as user experience. But it's still the chipsets that enable those features and ensure that experience. One of the most fascinating aspects of all the attention being paid to iPhone 7's performance in benchmarks relative to the Galaxy S8 is that it's incidental — a circumstance of great design and singular philosophy. For A10 Fusion, pushing maximum performance on bigger cores meant leaving a gap on the low end. Pairing the high-performance cores with high-efficiency cores, and creating a performance controller to intelligently manage the switching all-but-invisibly, eliminated that gap. That controller gave Apple not only the best of both processing worlds, but a significant advantage over chipsets lacking those smarts. For the graphics cores, Apple uses a different, "wide and slow" approach. They can handle loads as efficiently as possible but that also gives them the headroom to handle spikes when they need to. Having 8 lanes on a highway helps all the traffic flow better, even the Ferrari when it needs to hit full throttle. You can catch that supercar hitting over 200 if that's all you're looking for, but you miss all the other throughput that's getting handled super-efficiently around it. In other words, performance and power-efficiency go hand-in-hand. They can't be viewed separately. 20 more letters in the alphabet What's become increasingly fascinating of late isn't just Apple's A-series SOCs. It's the custom CPU and GPU inside them. It's the now-integrated M-series sensor fusion hubs. It's the image signal processor and the video encode/decode blocks. It's the controllers that let flash storage on an iPhone be accessed as fast as it is on a MacBook. Recently, we've seen Apple embed a variant of the Watch's S1 system-in-package in the MacBook Pro as the T1 to handle Touch ID, Apple Pay, and other security systems. And we've seen W1 make Bluetooth all but painless on the AirPods and Beats Wireless headphones. It's not that Apple wants to make every component inside every device but it feels very much like Apple wants to own every component that makes a real, palpable, differentiated experience for customers. When Apple introduced W1, I joked that there were still 20-odd more letters in the alphabet for future Apple silicon. But the results we're already seeing with iPhone 7 vs. Galaxy S8 are no joke. I'll spare you the cliché of "just wait until Apple puts ARM in the MacBook", but Intel should be quaking in its fabs as well. Better yet, it should be lacing up its runners and getting back in the race. In a world where Qualcomm is more concerned with making great silicon than holding the rest of the industry ransom, where Samsung deploys custom chips up and down its line, where Nvidia ships monster mobile CPU and GPU all its own, everyone benefits. Customers most of all. Until that happens, Apple's singular drive to make the best chipsets, to treat performance and power efficiency as one and the same, and to design silicon the specifically supports software and services, will continue to provide them with a commanding lead. The latest round of benchmarks simply highlight that.

Wall Street is still saying that any Android smartphone is just as good as an iPhone. They're not talking about just Android flagship smartphones but even the mid-range Android smartphones. You have to realize they don't think iPhones are nothing worth boasting about when they start yelling loudly about how Samsung is selling far more smartphones than Apple is without even considering the combined price gap of Samsung's huge smartphone lineup. Anyway, the Galaxy S8 is now considered the top smartphone on the planet because of all of its amazing features like BT 5.0, having a standard headphone jack, the gorgeous, nearly full-face display, three kinds of ways to unlock the S8 and just about every other remarkable feature mankind could possibly want in a smartphone. Apple now has to start from zero and create a feature count higher than the Galaxy S8 or else Apple will be labeled as being left behind in the dust and being totally outdone by Samsung in every way imagined. That's how Wall Street, the tech critics, and tech-heads roll. The consumer doesn't really matter. It's all about how many features a smartphone has and not much else. 0 14 hours ago Reply West Londoner The benchmark scores may be higher , in single core , but in terms of real life use , it really doesnt make that much difference .

Synthetic benchmarks are useless. Even worse, in the hands of rabid fanboys, they are used to propagate misinformation, justify questionable purchases, and stroke brittle egos. They've become the equivalence of a ***** wagging contest. There's a reason Google abandoned one of the most popular JavaScript synthetic benchmark, Octane. Synthetic benchmarks can be easily manipulated, they have never reflected real-world workloads, and they have also lead to engineers optimizing their products for use-cases that don't even exist in the real world. Professional developers and engineers now turn to profilers, smart compilers, statistical analysis, telemetrics, and, more recently, machine learning to study the real world performance impact of their products. It is the reason articles like this make me cringe because the ideas are not only obsolete, they are just plain wrong. It's no news that iOS and Android are different platforms. iOS apps are mostly written in C/C++/ObjC. Let's ignore Swift for now. Android apps are mostly written in Java. This may also come as a surprise to many, but the developers of each platform also write and optimize their apps differently both for historical and cultural reasons. The introduction of multicore CPUs to Android wasn't just a marketing gimmick, it was a necessity to eek out maximum performance for a language and platform (Java and Linux) that lent itself easily to a multicore CPU architecture. The Java community had spent the last decade or so tweaking the language for concurrent and parallel CPU architectures, because "enterprise" server environments and data centers, where virtually all Java applications run on, benefited from concurrency and parallelism. In addition to the robust concurrency features and framework in Java, Linux also spent the better part of the decade trying to out-scale proprietary Unix platform on multicore CPU architectures. And it succeeded so much so that Linux began scaling multicore CPU architectures better than any OS in the market, including proprietary Unix OSes reputed for their scalability. So, Android written in Java, and running on Linux, were the perfect match for multicore CPU architectures. Naturally, Android vendors capitalized on the performance benefits of running Java and Linux on multicore CPU architectures and began shipping multicore devices much earlier than other platform vendors. This brings us to the cultural mindset of a Java developer and how it differs from a C developer. These differences also reflect how Google and Apple choose to approach and optimize the CPU architectures their platform runs on. Java developers inherently solve performance problems, rightfully or wrongfully, by creating more threads. The language platform lends itself well to concurrent programming because, well, its community spent the prior decade believing and advocating concurrency was the silver bullet for all performance woes. And thus they invested in making Java a first-class concurrent language. In contrast, C developers HATE threads. C was never designed with concurrency in mind. Concurrency and parallelism were afterthoughts in C and C-like languages. Compared to Java, doing concurrent programming in C is like throwing shards of glass into your eyes. And it's not a surprise that it is heavily discouraged in that community. It's also the reason why threading features and frameworks in C are nowhere close to the robustness and sophistication you find in Java and modern languages. Which brings us to the differences between Android and iOS developers. And also the difference in how their apps are designed, structured and optimized. Android apps are heavily parallel in nature. It's not unusual to have every event handled in a worker thread. In fact, Android developers are forbidden to perform expensive operations on the main thread. Some developers go as far as separating the backend and frontend of an app to run in different services, that run in different processes, and that are also heavily threaded. Android applications are heavily componentized for this same reason (they are structured into services, content providers, intents, activities, receivers etc). In addition, Linux treats threads like processes. In a multicore CPU architecture, Linux will throw a thread to any CPU core for processing. As a result, it's easy to see when Android devices lend themselves well to a multicore setup and benefit from it. I haven't done iOS development in a while. So bear with me. Unlike Android applications, which are heavily componentized, iOS applications are monolithic. iOS apps are your typical C application. As discussed above, for cultural and historical reasons, threading is heavily discouraged in favor of asynchronous programming. Asynchronous programming doesn't benefit much from multicore architecture because instructions are run on the same thread, and thus the same CPU core. Cooperative multitasking is used to mimic concurrency. Therefore, you can see why a fast and efficient single core CPU matters more on iOS. These are the minutiae synthetic benchmarks don't reveal in the endless Android vs iOS debate. iOS applications will always favor single-core performance. While Android applications will always favor multi-core performance. Also, native applications (C/C++ apps) are likely to suffer more on Android than on iOS because those applications tend not to be tuned for heavy concurrency like Java applications on Android. So, unfortunately, they don't benefit from multi-core CPU architectures than Android devices are optimized for. It's why, for example, games if they're written in C/C++, will usually run slightly faster on iOS than on Android. This is why Apple inherently favors SoCs with short and fat pipes with a smaller number of cores. While Android vendors favor SoCs with many more CPU cores. Either way, both platforms benefit from their SoC configurations in different and unique ways. And it is something that synthetic benchmarks will never reveal. 0 1 day ago Reply sangs Wow man, that was a great post. 0 1 day ago Reply StevenRN You made a mistake {serious) "I haven't done iOS development in a while. So bear with me. Unlike Android applications, which are heavily componentized" Should be: "I have never done iOS development. So I will make stuff up." Your entire mindset of iOS development is based 100% in fantasy and is completely wrong. 0 1 day ago Reply Lateef Alabi-Oki I may have made a mistake, but if I did, you didn't point it out. But to clarify my point, Android and iOS apps have fundamental differences in the way they're structured. In iOS, apps have a single (main) entry point that runs on a single main loop/thread. The traditional iOS application is modeled using the MVC design pattern. And for the most part, apps run in a single process. In contrast, Android apps have multiple entry points that run on different types of components. On Android, the OS can summon an app, or parts of it, from any of these entry points. Android applications are structured like local micro-services that can run in the same process or different processes. My goal was not to get into the details of iOS vs Android app development. My goal was to show how the structure and architecture of apps on these platform favor certain CPU architecture configurations. These differences are not reflected in synthetic benchmarks. There are also cultural differences between how C (use async) and Java (use threads) developers tend to optimize their apps. Which again are not reflected in synthetic benchmarks. 0 1 day ago Reply StevenRN Your mistakes were many. In fact, your entire understanding of programming under iOS shows you have never once programmed iOS and made things up. "In iOS, apps have a single (main) entry point that runs on a single main loop/thread. The traditional iOS application is modeled using the MVC design pattern. And for the most part, apps run in a single process." Did you know that processes have dozens of threads and most iOS spawn threads left and right to do calculations? And those threads can run concurrently on different processors? Spawning threads are brain dead simple in iOS so you supposition of: "This may also come as a surprise to many, but the developers of each platform also write and optimize their apps differently both for historical and cultural reasons." It would come as a surprise because it fundamentally untrue. Period. There is almost no room for discussion on this. The same EXACT methods and techniques are used to optimize both environments. There are no mythical mindsets Java developers use to magically parrallel their solutions. "This brings us to the cultural mindset of a Java developer and how it differs from a C developer." You do realize iOS is traditionally based in Objective-C and not C? I don't think you even begin to understand the differences between these two based on your following comments. As I said, you just make things up. "In contrast, C developers HATE threads. C was never designed with concurrency in mind" Ughhhh. This is true but Obj-C is structured, and developed, fundamentally differently than C. Threads and concuancy are also baked in, easy and robust. Again I don't think you understand the first part of developing iOS or Obj-C. "Android apps are heavily parallel in nature. It's not unusual to have every event handled in a worker thread. In fact, Android developers are forbidden to perform expensive operations on the main thread. " Just like developing under OPENSTEP, Cocoa and iOS. So what? Again, I don't think you have the slightest knowledge of developing for iOS. "iOS apps are your typical C application. As discussed above, for cultural and historical reasons, threading is heavily discouraged in favor of asynchronous programming." Ahhhhh. No. Obj-C has a single entry point but dozens of threads are spawned for each app and threaded development is STRONGLY encouraged. Threads spawn easily. Again, obj-C mindsets are radically different than C mindsets. Don't continue to embarrass your self thinking they are the same. "Cooperative multitasking is used to mimic concurrency. Therefore, you can see why a fast and efficient single core CPU matters more on iOS." WTH????? At this point, I think you went full into BS mode and pulled things from left field because you had 0 knowledge of what you were talking about? Cooperative multitasking? WTH are you thinking? We are not in the 1990's any more. 0 1 day ago Reply Lateef Alabi-Oki Are you serious? Threading in Obj-C is primitive and error prone compared to the facilities and frameworks available in Java. It's not even debatable. Yes, I've dealt with the nightmare that is NSThread and NSOperationQueue. GCD makes things easier, but it's a global thread pool managed by the OS which you have no control over. And on iOS, the behavior of GCD will dynamically shift from concurrent to parallel algorithms based on God knows what. And I can't tell you how many time our code has randomly just frozen because of some random number of thread limits. Which we only find out after hours of extensive debugging. I'm not even going to waste my time with you if you think iOS and Android apps are designed, structured and architected the same way. 0 1 day ago Reply StevenRN I've been doing threaded development under OPENSTEP, Java, GCD and other APIs for over 15 years.

The VAST majority of Java (and Obj-C for that mater) programs I have had to work on are HORRIBLY architected and I have NEVER seen any of this mythical and magical mindezet of inherent parallel problem solving you are dreaming about.

Just look at comparison where off screen test are used Apple is rarely if ever leading." Source? From the benchmarks I've seen, The iPhone 7 is as good or better than the S8 (at least the Snapdragon model, I haven't seen a comparison with the Exynos) in offscreen GPU tests. No "trouncing" to be had. As for onscreen tests, it's true the iPhone has lower resolution and that's a plus in Samsung's favor. Of course, you also can't complain when it's pointed out that Samsung decided to use more pixels on its display than its GPU is able to successfully drive. So to recap, the iPhone 7 blows away the S8 in any single core CPU test or app, and performs similarly in multicore tests (even though we know that very few real world situations are going to utilize that many cores), and scores similarly in GPU tests.

Apple traditionally have never been able to count on brute force for their systems because they weren't on Intel for a long time and didn't always have the best graphics cards etc.. So things like double buffering the screen, low latency audio or suspending apps running when in the background are just standard behaviour which will mean the OS will always run smoother than either windows or android on a comparable hardware spec. So Android has to have more power to do the same things. However, because things are more integrated and hardware companies are not really talking about the components in their machines I think these realities are more hidden. Android is basically sloppy architecturally , which is fine for them, because getting to market faster and making an OS for anyone is what they are about. But I doubt we will ever see android comparable to iOS in terms of efficiency. And this may not matter now because moores law seems pretty active in the mobile world, but when things start to slow down again all the architecture discipline that Apple puts in to its designs will start to bare fruit massively. In fact, it seems that the s8 has double the cores of a year old iphone 7 plus but only just beats it in multi core performance.

Maybe you have different background apps causing the issue. I allow very few apps to run in the background so that may be why I haven't seen this. And I am not a recent user. I have had an iPhone since the 4. I also have owned Samsung SIII, 4, 6. (got tired of Samsung Bloatware.) I have had 2 LG phones, and the Google Pixel.

Whether it be through my emails, the web browser, Facebook, or the Google Play Store. I just cannot comprehend why scrolling continues to be so problematic for Samsung phones. (For the record, scrolling was never an issue on the Google Pixel XL during my time with it.) Some may find that to be a minor thing, but when I'm trying to scroll fast and the page keeps pausing to keep up, it infuriates me to no end. We all have our little niggles and that's a big one for me. :) 0 2 days ago Reply dwd3885 I haven't used the S8 but I've used the other Galaxy phones and unless it's changed you are right. Scrolling perfect on Pixel but not Samsung devices. 0 2 days ago Reply sangs Baffles me.

I turned in my 7+ for the S8, and the S8 definitely isn't as fluid and smooth as the iPhone, it the Pixel which I also have. Wherever I someone on Android Central comment for their S7/edge is "buttery smooth" I cringe because it just isn't true and I don't understand how anyone could say that. 0 2 days ago Reply sangs "Buttery smooth" is one of those phrases that needs to disappear from the lexicon. It is SO overused. I agree that the Samsung phones have gotten better (the flagships anyway, don't know about the budget models), but the annoyances are still present. 0 1 day ago Reply DannyJJK Buttery smooth should refer to constant 60fps with no frame drops, and also a minimal amount of latency between moving your finger and the screen updating. Anything less than this isn't buttery smooth 0 14 hours ago Reply mehnitesh Agreed, Samsung still has this weird sticky feeling and ghosting scrolling.

The apps were identical, and not 'in one of those...', essentially in ALL of them, the test tasked the OS with a very 'real world' test - using the same apps, from same developer and timed exactly.... the performance of A10 is astounding, both for its instant, non-latent response to user but also how far Apple's come in memory compression, management and 'triage' -- as MANY of those apps are/were taxing, to both phones, yet iOS continued to open apps with immediacy and launch to use status quicker. While maintaining the app's functionality and 'return use' immediate vs having ...as you say, 'the Galaxy had to relaunch all the apps while the iPhone didn't' .... Your next line just doesn't jibe with your statement that the S8 stupidly underperforms and unfortunately requires the user to relaunch each app when returning ---- your response 'those high numbers from the multi core from Samsung don't really matter in real life performance' How much more 'real life' can opening and closing and returning to apps be? Looking at benchmarks that focus on non real life scenarios returning the same massive performance deltas and differences between them...as mentioned on graphics stack, image processing and Bluetooth simplified with W1! The other 'real world' tests you can do easily are performance sustained without throttling, efficiency and longevity of use. The A10, while she gets warm, it doesn't slow down. Battery life is commendable for intensive usage or regular, daily standard usage --- and one can easily count on it lasting the day, getting the updates, and constantly being 'bettered' ...all factors that matter just like speed tests that are beat by double ...all factors that come in to a users enjoyment and further 'investment' or purchasing with the phone. 0 2 days ago Reply Quis89 That video isn't even indicative of real world use.

Sorry man, I totally agree with you though. 0 1 day ago Reply TechAbstract Average people leave bunch of apps running in background without closing them. 0 8 hours ago Reply shaolinfinest That is true. But not in the way tests are done. Keep in mind that while the average user has apps open, as time goes by they are not running in the background to even be a problem. So this app is not truly what an average user goes through. I carry two phones, have over 100 apps on both my iPhone and Android (S8+). I don't even use my phone like they do in these test. I consider myself a heavy user as I have 7 email accounts on both phones, social media, streaming Spotify daily, running various apps on a regular, including Whatsapp. I do not have trouble with either phone. Granted the lag I get from my iPhone is because it is the 6 Plus, so it has some lag here and there. 0 4 hours ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Now, App Advice reports that the latest Overcast update lets you send podcasts to your Apple Watch with just a tap of a button after you've downloaded episodes to your iPhone. Here's how to transfer episodes to your Apple Watch: Launch Overcast from your iPhone's Home screen. Find the downloaded episode you want to transfer. Tap the Queue menu button (looks like ⁺≡). Tap Send to Watch. It's that simple. Pending transfers will appear on the Downloads screen. It may take a minute or two for the episode to hit your watch, so just be patient. App Advice's Bryan M. Wolfe noticed a bit of a quirk in that your play state doesn't sync back to your iPhone, so you can't pick up where you left off as seamlessly, but future Overcast updates will probably fix that. This update is on the heels of Apple's rebranding of the Podcasts app as "Apple Podcasts", which still can't transfer offline podcast episodes to Apple Watch. Whether this means updates (like offline Apple Watch capabilities) are coming to the app itself or not, who knows.

By Rene Ritchie Friday, Apr 21, 2017 at 3:00 pm EDT 50 Comments Rene Ritchie has been covering the personal technology industry for almost a decade. Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. Should you buy the small 38mm or large 42mm Apple Watch? Here's how to choose! Updated April 2017: Includes the latest information on sizes, features, and compatibilities. Apple has provided two sizing options for the Apple Watch: 38mm and 42mm. Whether you're getting aluminum, steel, or ceramic, Series 1 or Series 2, Nike+ or Hermès, they all come in those two sizes. Some might consider their personal choice obvious, whether that's based on wrist size, gender, or some other factor. If you're not finding it quite so obvious, however, here are some things to consider when picking the perfect Apple Watch size for you! See at Apple Height vs. width Unlike traditional watches, which measure case size horizontally, Apple is measuring the Apple Watch vertically. The smaller of the two has a height of 38mm (specifically, 38.6mm); the larger, 42mm. When it comes to width, the smaller Apple Watch is 33.3mm wide; the larger, 35.9mm. These differences might not sound like very much — 3-4mm here or there — but 4mm out of 40mm is one tenth of the watch dimensions. The rounded rectangular shape of the Apple Watch makes it hard to compare directly with round watches, but in the traditional watch world, neither of the Apple Watches would be considered overly wide or high. Big watches are typically closer to 48mm. So, even if you think you want to go small, you can still consider both sizes — neither is enormous. Display size The different case sizes also come with different display sizes. Both are Retina-quality, which means the pixels are invisible to the naked eye at normal viewing distance. The bigger Apple Watch simply has more of those pixels. The 38mm Apple Watch has a display size of 340x272 pixels. The 42mm Apple Watch has a display size of 390x312 pixels. The interface will fill whatever size display you have, and for many people, it won't make any difference. If you really want more pixels, which translates into bigger text and images, it's something to consider. Depth perception Unlike the Watch's two height options and two display densities, there's no difference when it comes to the thickness (or thinness) of the two sizes. That's because, unlike traditional mechanical or digital watches, the Apple Watch case has to hold a Retina display, the system-in-a-package (chipset), battery, and sensors. If you're trying to figure out which Apple Watch will best fit under the tight cuffs of your shirt, they're both about the same. Hers and his Because there are two sizes, and because some of Apple's bands are unique to one size or another, some have tried to simplify the size discussion down to "hers" and "his." People come in all shapes and sizes, though, and so do tastes. Some women will want the bigger Apple Watch, and some men, the smaller. Some people with small wrists will want the bigger watch, and vice versa. All this to say — get the size you want. Band bias Since Apple only offers some bands in some sizes, if you have your heart set on a certain band, you may have to be willing to go with the size that matches it. You can get 3rd-party knock-offs for everything in every size and then some, so this only really matters if you want the real thing. 38mm-specific bands: Modern Buckle Hermès Double Buckle Cuff Hermés Double Tour 42mm-specific bands Leather Loop Hermès Single Tour Deployment Buckle Price points The 38mm Apple Watch is slightly less expensive than the 42mm Apple Watch. So, if you want to save some money, you can do it if you go for the smaller size. 38mm: Apple Watch Series 1: Starts at $269 Apple Watch Series 2: Starts at $369 42mm: Apple Watch Series 1: Starts at $299 Apple Watch Series 2: Starts at $399 Battery life The 42mm Apple Watch has a slightly bigger battery than the 38mm watch, and the Series 2 has a slightly bigger battery than the Series 1. So, if battery life is important to you — for example, you want to get in multiple workouts a day or you want to go a couple days without charging — you'll not only want to go with Series 2, but with the 42mm. Who should get the 38mm Apple Watch? If you have a small wrist and want the Apple Watch to look comfortable on it, if you have a large wrist and want the Apple Watch to look small, or if you just like smaller watches in general, you should get the 38mm Apple Watch. See at Apple Who should get the 42mm Apple Watch? If you have a small wrist and want the Apple Watch to look big, if you have a large wrist and you want the Apple Watch to look as big as possible, if you have vision requirements that benefit from bigger graphics, you want a longer-lasting battery, or if you like bigger watches in general, you should get the 42mm Apple Watch.

Sent from the iMore App 0 4 months ago Reply Doug Saunders I also opted for the 38 simply because the smaller one looks more like a regular watch, whereas the 42 looks more like a smart watch. 0 4 months ago Reply PoisonMaps My Poison Maps app includes a fully working demo of its watch app that runs within the iPhone app, so you don’t need to have a watch in order to try out a watch app. It displays at actual size and you can choose between 38mm or 42mm. It’s not quite as good or as functional as the real Poison Maps watch app, but it gives a good idea of what it feels like to use a watch app at both sizes, and how the watch would look on your wrist. I actually wrote it before the watches first came out so that I could see how usable the app would be, and to help myself to choose between the sizes, so hopefully it can also help other people to decide. Apologies for the plug! 0 4 months ago Reply hankmobley I can't believe it--a comparison of the two watches that says nothing about which is the easiest to see and read. I no longer have 20/20, so that would be my major consideration. Also, which of the two watches is selling best--or are they neck and neck? Some folks may prefer the lest popular watch; others may be thinking about resale value. 0 1 year ago Reply Macsterguy The article clearly states: "if you have vision requirements that benefit from bigger graphics," 0 4 months ago Reply MarkCody After having worn the larger Apple Watch for about a month now, I can say wrist size is less of a consideration then finger size. If you have larger thicker fingers, your definitely going to want to go with the largest size. Otherwise just tapping in the passcode is going to be a challenge. Smaller thinner fingers definitely have an advantage here! 0 1 year ago Reply Crissandra Katsandris I really had my heart set on the soft pink with a 42size. I have small wrist but love a big face watch! I now see there will be no way to do that. Should I just by the 42 and wait to see if they add a band for it in that style and color?

They're measured based on their diameter, as the majority of faces are round, so horizontal or vertical makes no difference at all. Also, "thickness" not "depth". And do we know the actual thickness yet? The above reads like a pre-canned excuse. 1 2 years ago Reply Rene Ritchie Because I spoke to several watch experts and did independent research and the most common answer I got was horizontal 9 to 3 measure. (A few instances of 8 to 2, but nowhere nearly as many.) Depth perception was a pun :) 1 2 years ago Reply davidbowser Longines has several collections that are non-circular faces. Evidenza and DolceVita are in the $1000-$3000 range depending on the model. Although the majority are round, they sometimes list non-round the width and height in the description when sold, but the default is considered the width. There are plenty of watches that are non-circular, and sizing guides are made based on the width.

I really think you are downplaying the size issue far too much here. I particularly find the part at the end where you state "If you have a small wrist and want the Apple Watch to look SMALL on it ..." to be kind of rude. I'm an average sized person but I have thin wrists. Many of my friends are the same. I made a plaster mock-up of the two sizes so as to see which looked best on my wrist and I can tell you that the 38mm one looks absolutely HUGE on my wrist. The idea that I might want the small one so as to "make it look *small*" is just silly. The small one looks HUGE. The larger one would be ridiculously MORE huge. I want the 38mm one so it looks closer to "normal" on my wrist, not small. Every picture I've seen of slim young people (male or female) wearing these things, the 42mm one looks really, really, chunky on the wrist. I'm not saying this is unexpected on a 1.0 product and I'm getting one anyway, but pushing the erroneous idea that these are "normal sized" watches or won't look like a "brick on the wrist" is disingenuous to me. IMO everyone who isn't a big fat person or a burly lumberjack should definitely consider getting the 38mm one. The whole article seems skewed to me in regards pointing people towards the 42mm watch, even though I think it's probably the wrong choice for the majority of the population. -2 2 years ago Reply Rene Ritchie It's not meant to be rude, and I spoke to a lot of people with a lot of different wrists to get a sense of what their considerations were. Likewise, some people told me they wanted something much bigger, closer to 46mm (in traditional measures). Also: I didn't point people towards the 42mm. The goal was to break down stereotypes and help people pick the best size for them regardless of which one that was. I'm not sure you're reading what I intended to write? 0 2 years ago Reply Loren Sims My wife always wore men's watches (and bought men's shoes), she was truly 'big-boned'. Her wrists were as wide as mine. But over the last couple of days, I've been thinking to get the smaller one. I figure the larger one is for show-offs who want to display it to the world. It's still smaller than most 'other' smart watches. A pink band wouldn't bother me, but I would prefer a darker band, just as my wife would have. I would just like to be able to try them both on to see for myself... 0 2 years ago Reply Sebastian Schmid I don't know about that. I have fairly small to average wrists for a man with 180mm. But unlike some other regular watches the 42mm did not look big on my wrist. So I think this is more of an average man's watch size while the 38mm is more of an average woman's watch size. There is no show-off version yet. Maybe in the future they will add a 46 or 48mm which will be truly big. So far I think the show-off will need to fork out over ten grand to get the golden Apple watch. 0 2 years ago Reply nickpthemft Don't feed the troll, Rene. This individual has been subtly trolling hard on this site for the last several weeks/months. Bums me out. Well written article, as is typical :) 1 2 years ago Reply Gazoobee I may have read things in, but the way you wrote it wasn't clear, if as you say, you weren't really "steering" folks towards the larger one, because it did seem to me like you were with that crack about "looking small on the wrist." Anyway, nothing personal and I hope I didn't upset you in return. My main point was simply that the idea that ANY of these smart watches are "normal sized" at this stage is a bit much to take. They just aren't. These are great chunky, super-thick watches for sure. That's why I'm buying the smallest one possible. -1 2 years ago Reply Rene Ritchie Some people want watches that look small on the wrist, some want watches that look big.

Apple's car project, Titan, ready to train testers By Rene Ritchie Friday, Apr 21, 2017 at 5:37 pm EDT 1 Comment Last year Apple pivoted its Project Titan from a full-on car project to a platform designed to enable autonomous vehicles, whether they're eventually made by Apple or a partner manufacturer or ride-sharing service. It looks like that platform is now ready for early testing. Kif Leswing, writing for Business Insider: The documents obtained by Business Insider include a "Development Platform Specific Training" as well as details about an autonomous-vehicle system called the "Apple Automated System." Among the key training issues are instructions on how to regain manual control of an autonomous car if necessary. According to the training packet, Apple's self-driving car uses a Logitech wheel and pedals to actuate drive by wire, and it supports one person at a time. The drivers, mostly Ph.D's involved with the machine learning program, have to pass seven tests to be considered trained to, among other things, take back control of the system should they ever need to. Titan may no longer be the widely ambitious project it once was, but it's still terrifically cool tech and it'll be interesting to see how far Apple decides to take it and where — and when — it shows up. And, yeah, I hope at least one of the prototypes is named Optimus...

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Sunday, 23 April 2017 | MYT 1:00 PM What’s the iPhone’s future? Think IBM’s Selectric: opinion by adam minter Apple quietly reintroduced the discontinued, two-and-a-half-year-old iPhone 6 (pic) in several Asian countries and Eastern Europe to leverage a tried-and-true model that simply matches customer needs. — Reuters For the iPhone's 10th anniversary, Apple Inc is planning to release new and upgraded models later this year, with updated designs, improved cameras and better screens.  But a more important product launch actually began in mid-March, when the company quietly reintroduced the discontinued, two-and-a-half-year-old iPhone 6 in several Asian countries and Eastern Europe.  That might sound dull. But for Apple, which is banking on the developing world for growth, it's actually a far-sighted move. The company is acknowledging that smartphones have transitioned from elite niche products into mature technologies, owned by everyone and upgraded infrequently. And that means that boring reliability – not innovation – will define the iPhone's future.  By now, most consumers know what they want from a smartphone (social media, text messaging, and so on). And better screens and cameras will only persuade so many to splurge on new models. That's especially true in emerging markets.  In Kenya, users cite social media as the primary reason for upgrading from a feature phone, and used smartphones – which go for as little as US$40 (RM175) – work just fine for accessing Facebook. True, the cheaper phones won't look as good. But they do everything that late smartphone adopters want, and that's good enough.  ”Good enough” doesn't sound great for Apple and other phone makers, which prosper off the relentless upgrade cycle. But many well-known products have followed the same path, from ground-breaking innovation to reliable, profitable, “good enough” staples. The KitchenAid Model K mixer revolutionised American kitchens when it was introduced in 1937, but has since changed only incrementally as it became a wedding-registry juggernaut. Maytag washing machines, Aermotor windmills, the Ford Model T, and the Browning M1911 pistol have gone much the same route.  Perhaps the product that most closely approximates the iPhone's future is the venerable Selectric typewriter, from International Business Machines Corp. When IBM introduced the device in 1961, electric typewriters had already been around for decades. But the Selectric upended the business by enabling faster typing and the changing of fonts, thereby boosting productivity worldwide. The technology also came packaged in a sleek, minimalist case quickly recognised as a landmark in industrial design.  Sales exceeded forecasts from day one, and eventually the Selectric captured as much as 75% of the US typewriter market, as millions of office managers recognised that it provided exactly what they needed. But a device so perfectly suited to its customers' demands didn't need much in the way of upgrades, and IBM had trouble extending the line.  The Selectric II, introduced in 1971, allowed users to change the number of characters typed per inch – helpful, but hardly essential to most office tasks. A third model was introduced at the dawn of the PC era, but by then, increased competition and changing consumer demands meant the Selectric's days were numbered, and the line was discontinued in 1986. Yet it was hardly a failure. Its decades-long success helped finance other innovations at IBM, notably the personal computer.  In principle, the iPhone is becoming something similar: a tried-and-true model that simply matches customer needs. In Malaysia, where I live, one authorised reseller is promoting the iPhone 6 with a big red sign that promises “Amazing Phone, Amazing Price,” with no reference to the model name or vintage.  A clerk told me that the phone is selling well, especially to younger customers who can't afford a newer model but appreciate the iPhone's reliability compared to most Android phones. Although not flashy, this approach should remain profitable for Apple for some time, and help pay the bills as it transitions to the next big thing.  It may sting Apple's executives to learn that their iconic invention is evolving into the digital era's equivalent of a typewriter or washing machine. But in recent years, Apple has pushed hard to expand its services and content business, and more iPhones – no matter how old – help meet that goal. If marketed well, the durability of the company's older, duller phones could become an asset.  Meanwhile, if Apple wants to maintain its reputation as an innovator, it should acknowledge the iPhone as the mature product it has become, and redirect its vaunted creative energy to something new. — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested How to prevent your child from spending money on your smartphone Switch from 3G to 4G SIM card to enter Maxis' RM1mil giveaway campaign Nier: Automata – For the glory of mankind Robots, chefs hope to bring invasive lion fish to restaurants near you How to own your first home with zero down payment Pedalling to save the planet Others Also Read Pacquiao lands Down Under, tells Horn to be ready Police to quiz TV presenter over Watson Nyambek insult RM100mil paint job for public housing projects advertisement Latest News Apple funds new programme to turn young artistes into pop stars Galaxy C9 Pro: On cloud nine Nier: Automata – For the glory of mankind Old droids, new tricks What’s the iPhone’s future?

Prior to this, one could say that Siri was a bit limited and restrictive in its functionality, but presumably Apple saw how successful Amazon was with Alexa that they decided that maybe they should follow suit. Now the good news is that if you’re a heavy WhatsApp user, you’ll be pleased to learn that you can now use Siri to read your latest WhatsApp messages. This is thanks to the latest update to WhatsApp in which the app will now let users ask Siri to read their messages to them which will come in handy if you’re driving or if your hands are full. If you use newer iPhones like the iPhone 6s or better, you can actually enable “Hey Siri” functionality where you don’t need to touch your phone to enable it (and it doesn’t require users to have their phones plugged into a charger either). In addition to Siri integration, the latest update to the app will also introduce some changes like selecting multiple statuses at once and forward/revoke them. Two-step verification has also been updated and redesigned to make it easier to setup, and the overall interface for group/individual chats has also been changed to make it cleaner and easier to use. You’ll be able to grab the latest version of WhatsApp from the iTunes App Store if you haven’t updated already. Filed in Apple >Cellphones.

For Android users that might own an Apple TV that could have been a bit of a downer. Fret not, though. Much as doubleTwist was the first to bring AirPlay streaming to Android, they're one of the first to bring it back. I know that it's not very likely that Apple TV is a popular product among our readers, but for those that did make use of it the inconvenience after the recent 10.2 update must have been a bit annoying. For those out of the loop, it further locked down AirPlay by using a new pairing process, likely intended to restrict use of the protocol to Apple products. Thankfully for those that mix and match ecosystems, doubleTwist was able to work some magic on that proprietary mess and get things working again. Their full statement is available below. Back in May 2011, we were the first to bring AirPlay music streaming to Android, helping hundreds of thousands of Android users listen to their favorite tunes through their Apple TV and other AirPlay-compatible devices. Fast forward to April 2017 and Apple, in a surprising and anachronistic move, released a 4th generation Apple TV firmware update (tvOS 10.2) that blocked 3rd party apps from supporting AirPlay by requiring a proprietary pairing process conveniently restricted to Apple apps and devices. Yep, Apple wants you to switch to an iPhone if you happen to own an Apple TV! But users today demand interoperability between their devices. Modern households are diverse ecosystems of connected devices, full of iPhones, Android phones, smart TVs and a cacophony of gadgets. So we went ahead and added support for Apple’s new pairing process in the latest doubleTwist Pro release because we believe the era of walled gardens is long gone. The AirPlay functionality is also live for CloudPlayer so you can stream your cloud music to your Apple TV. Happy listening! If you mix and match things to such a degree that you need to side-load the app, APKMirror's got your back.

Nathan J Ecosystem mixer here. Nothing about the Apple TV looks appealing. It's simplicity, yeah, but it's simplicity at a premium on a market where they're all pretty simple. Roku is basically the de facto leader in this area. I've never owned one, but my brother has one, and he's only moderately technical, and he's got it set up and tired into all of his online services. Nexus Player is still pretty good, though the interface has some hiccups. I'm thinking the cheapest good option now might be Pi. I got my hands on one and I'm just excited about the possibilities. I'm only doing RetroPie (YouTube it, thank me later) but since you can pop in a new SD card and gave a whole new OS, I'm thinking about having a Linux home theater setup as well, I'm just not sure where to begin, but I know these things are stupidly popular with people who figure that stuff out. I mean, of you're an Android user and AP reader, you probably have a spare microSD card laying around, a step below your current one, and though Android isn't exactly Linux, you're probably not afraid of jumping into Linux, and there are user friendly options.

In late March, Apple pulled its milestone iOS 10.3 update out of beta and released it for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch models capable of running iOS 10. iOS 10.3 was only out a week before it was replaced with a new version iOS 10. Apple’s rolled out an iOS 10.3.1 update to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Unlike iOS 10.3, iOS 10.3.1 is a maintenance release focused on fixing bugs and improving device security. If you’re coming to iOS 10.3.1 from iOS 10.3, expect a pretty small download, a few MB. If you’re coming from something older like iOS 10.2.1 or iOS 9, your iPhone 6’s iOS 10.3.1 update will be much bigger. You’ll get everything from the previous iOS updates baked in. With the smoke from the release starting to settle we want to take a close look at the iPhone 6 iOS 10.3.1 update. This roundup includes our updated impressions of the software, some tips to help you get the most out of iOS 10.3.1, and a look at iPhone 6 iOS 10.3.1 problems. We’ll continue to update this page as we push away from the release date so check back for regular changes. Quick iPhone 6 iOS 10.3.1 Update Review   1 / 10 A quick note about the iOS 10.3.1 download and installation process on the iPhone 6. The iPhone 6 iOS 10.3.1 update is tiny it will only take you a few minutes to download and install on your iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus. Of course, this is only if you're coming to it directly from iOS 10.3. If you're coming to iOS 10.3.1 from something older, expect the process to take a lot longer.  If you're coming to iOS 10.3.1 from iOS 10.2.1 or below, your installation process will take a lot longer than most iOS updates. Our iPhone 6 iOS 10.3 update took about 15 minutes to install. This is due, in part, to the file system change to APFS.  If you fall into this group, we recommend putting aside 30 minutes or so of quiet time to monitor your iPhone 6 installation for problems.  We've been using the iPhone 6 iOS 10.3.1 update for a little over a week now and we've been taking a close look at some key areas including battery life, connectivity, and UI speed. Here's what we've learned so far.  We still haven't noticed any abnormal battery drain. Our iPhone 6 (AT&T model) is holding a solid charge. Same as iOS 10.3.  If you recently installed iOS 10.3.1 and you're noticing issues with your iPhone 6's battery life, give it a couple of days. It can sometimes take a few days for the battery and the new update to settle in. If you continue to see issues with your battery life, take action.  We've tested the iPhone 6's update with several ISPs, routers, and Bluetooth devices. We haven't run into any issues yet though that could certainly change down the road. AT&T's LTE and 4G networks are working properly as well.  We haven't noticed any random reboots and the phone's UI appears to be fast. Animations and transitions are fluid and we haven't encountered any weird lag or sluggishness when opening folders, apps or Control Center.  The iPhone 6 iOS 10.3.1 update's performance has been solid thus far. And given what's on board the update, it's certainly worth a look if your iPhone 6 is already on iOS 10.  If you're on an older version of iOS, say iOS 9, you might want to wait a few days so you can gather a little more feedback about performance.  If you need help to one side of the iOS 10.3.1 fence or the other, please take a look at our list of reasons. It'll help you make a decision.   1 / 10 7 Responses 12/22/2016 Leon Reply This article is useless. Nothing that I didn’t know or think. Total waste of time. 01/28/2017 Team Cydia Reply These are good points but I guess you forgot to mention that iOS 10.2 jailbreak is available now. So it is very important factor that people will consider when updating to iOS 10.2. 02/13/2017 Ryan Reply I updated not to long ago to 10.2.1 and am noticing the battery drain, network connectivity issues, and bluetooth issues (all on AT&T iPhone 6 btw) since day one of download. 02/18/2017 Susan Reply I’ve got an iPhone 6 that is less than two years old. Since updating to 10.2.1, Siri stopped working. My microphone works — I can talk on the phone, I can use Voice memo.. but Siri? Done. No workie. Unbelievable. 02/20/2017 Doreen Smith Reply Since doing updates for I phone 7, my phone keeps telling me I don’t have enough storage, really? I have had this phone for 2 years and never had this problem. I’ve had to delete so many of my pictures, and so many apps, can this problem be fixed or is this just a way for them for you to buy the new phone, I phone 7, which i don’t want to do 04/04/2017 Kathy Reply When I pressed the button (middle bottom) a box came up that has ALL THE OPTIONS I ALREADY KNOW & use. Now it jumps around the screen because it KNOWS when I’m typing! But in a game, it’s constantly in the way! There is NO option for it to go away or delete it. It’s a waste of space and I’m ready to go to another company. I got a big screen due to eye sight problems, now the little box with options I don’t need in my face WONT GO AWAY! How do I delete it, or I’m LEAVING APPLE! 04/22/2017 Emmett Reply What a load of crap, my battery drains much quicker, I lost my network service for three days. I had to reset to factory settings only to find that now 1/3 of my memory is being used by “others”. And that is without installing the back up. Apple is really starting to suck, constantly breaking things to give you more useless shit. Then again they’ll soon run out of ideas.

As the iPhone hits its 10th anniversary, Apple is preparing to launch three new versions. PAUL SAKUMA/AP file Apple readies iPhone overhaul for smartphone's 10th anniversary By Mark Gurman and Min Jeong Lee Bloomberg Apr 23, 2017 0 Buy Now PAUL SAKUMA The late Steve Jobs demonstrates the new iPhone in 2007. As the iPhone hits its 10th anniversary, Apple is preparing to launch three new versions. PAUL SAKUMA/AP file Ten years after Steve Jobs held up the original iPhone to a gushing San Francisco crowd, Apple Inc. is planning its most extensive iPhone lineup to date. Apple is preparing three iPhones for launch as soon as this fall, including upgraded versions of the current two iPhone models and a new top-of-the-line handset with an overhauled look, according to people familiar with the matter. For the redesigned phone, Apple is testing a new type of screen, curved glass and stainless steel materials, and more advanced cameras, the people said. Those anxiously awaiting the redesigned iPhone, however, may have to wait because supply constraints could mean the device isn’t readily available until one or two months after the typical fall introduction. The iPhone is Apple’s most important product, representing about two-thirds of sales. It also leads customers to buy other Apple devices like the iPad and Apple Watch, and serves as a home for lucrative services like the App Store. This year’s new iPhone lineup comes at a critical time. Last year, Apple broke its typical upgrade cycle by retaining the same iPhone shape for a third year in a row and endured a rare sales slide. Samsung Electronics Co.’s new S8 lineup has also been thus far well received after last year’s Note 7 battery debacle. For the premium model, Apple is testing a screen that covers almost the entire front of the device, according to people familiar with the matter. That results in a display slightly larger than that of the iPhone 7 Plus but an overall size closer to the iPhone 7, the people said. Apple is also aiming to reduce the overall size of the handset by integrating the home button into the screen itself via software in a similar manner to Samsung’s S8, the people said. The overhauled iPhone will use an organic light-emitting diode display that more accurately shows colors, while the other two phones will continue to use liquid crystal display technology and come in the same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen sizes as last year’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple’s iPhone feature and design plans are still in flux and can change, they added. The people asked not to be identified discussing Apple’s private testing and design plans. For its redesigned phone, Apple has tested multiple prototypes with manufacturing partners in Asia, including some versions that use curved glass and stainless steel, according to one of the people. One of the latest prototype designs includes symmetrical, slightly curved glass on the front and the back. The curves are similar in shape to those on the front of the iPhone 7. The new OLED screen itself is flat, while the cover glass curves into a steel frame. The design is similar conceptually to the iPhone 4 from 2010. An earlier prototype design had a thinner steel band, leaving more noticeable curved glass on the sides. Apple also tested a more ambitious prototype with the same slightly curved front and steel frame, but a glass back with more dramatic curves on the top and bottom like the original iPhone design from 2007, one of the people said. Apple suppliers have so far struggled to reliably produce heavily curved glass in mass quantities, so the company is more likely to ship the version with more subdued curves, the person added. The company is also testing a simpler design that has an aluminum back, rather than a glass one, and slightly larger dimensions, one of the people said. Because of its early lead in the mobile OLED display space, Samsung will enjoy a rare upper hand in this year’s high-end smartphone contest. At launch, Apple will exclusively use Samsung Display Co. OLED panels for the redesigned iPhone, as other suppliers won’t be ready to supply mass quantities until later, Bloomberg News reported last year. Apple has ordered around 100 million panels from Samsung, the people said. “This fall, it would be three years since we had a remarkable shift in iPhone hardware. This raises expectations for this year’s phone having a material change in functionality and look,” said Gene Munster, co-founder of Loup Ventures and a veteran Apple analyst. “The Samsung Galaxy S8 raises the bar for Apple to hit a home run.” Spokespeople for Apple and Samsung declined to comment. Apple has also experimented with integrating the iPhone’s fingerprint scanner into the screen of the OLED version, which would be technically challenging, the people said. It’s currently unclear if that feature will make it into the final product. Samsung also tried this approach for the S8, but ended up installing a more standard fingerprint reader on the back of its phone due to the challenges, another person said. Significant camera changes are also in testing for Apple’s overhauled iPhone. For the back of the phone, Apple is testing versions of the phone with the dual-camera system positioned vertically, instead of horizontally like on the iPhone 7 Plus, which could result in improved photos, according to people familiar with the matter. Some prototypes in testing continue to include the slight camera bump found on current iPhones, rather than having them flush with the back surface, the people said. For the front-camera, Apple is testing dual-lenses, one of the people said. The current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have single front cameras. As it has done in the past, Apple is using camera components from Sony Corp., the person added. Apple has explored adding augmented reality-based features and depth-of-field enhancements to its iPhone camera system, Bloomberg News reported earlier this year. Company engineers in the past have also experimented with integrating cameras into screens, another person said. All the new iPhones will run iOS 11, a mobile operating system that will include a refreshed user-interface and will be announced in June at the company’s annual conference for developers, according to a person familiar with the matter. Apple has been testing using faster processors based on a smaller 10-nanometer production process for all three new models, a person familiar with Apple’s chip plans said. That’s down from 16 nanometers for existing iPhones. The smaller processors are more efficient, allowing Apple to retain its battery life standards while adding more advanced features.

Join For Free Launching an app doesn’t need to be daunting. Whether you’re just getting started or need a refresher on mobile app testing best practices, this guide is your resource! Brought to you in partnership with Perfecto.  Apple knows how to keep its users engaged. After 7 beta releases, they have finally launched the iOS 10.3 for the masses. This doesn’t end the good news. The real news is that after installing the new OS on their iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, users have noticed their device working faster and more responsive. iOS engineer Renaud Lienhart, in one of his tweet, said, “iOS 10.3 feels ‘snappier’ because many animations were slightly tweaked & shortened, for the better.” Well, this isn’t all. With the launch of this new version, Apple has also bid farewell to its 19-year-old HFS+, which was the based on 32-year-old HFS and replaced it with Apple File System (APFS). Now, this is a big step. The new inclusion not only saves the space but also optimize it for solid state drives (SSDs). There’s Lots More in the Bucket Every time Apple releases a new update, the users without any delay download the new version. Though there are many misconceptions about iOS, this trust and loyalty are no doubts result of the uncompromised security they give. The users never try to look for the new features that are being released. Keeping this in mind, we have here listed some of the new features that make iOS 10.3 futuristic: 1. Find My AirPods They are easy to lose. Keeping this in mind, Apple introduces new Find my AirPods feature. The feature comes activated in the new OS. So, if you forget where you kept your AirPods last, dropped one/both of them somewhere, or lost. Simply go the Find my iPhone app and you’ll notice the new icon for AirPods. If your AirPods are connected to the device via Bluetooth, the feature will play a high pitched sound that will help you find them. However, if it isn’t, the map will show you the last location where it was connected to the device. 2. Updated Siri This one is especially for the cricket lovers. Our assistant Siri now understands that Cricket is a famous sport, played in different countries across the globe. The Siri can now tell you the scores for cricket matches and can also pull in scores for the world cup and champions trophy. Apart from this, the AI assistant will also help you in booking Uber trips hours in advance and in paying bills. 3. App Store Gets Better The updated App Store now allows you to rate the apps you are using. The developers can now ask users to write a review without switching to the App Store. This will help them understand the positive and negative aspects of user experience and subsequently can work to better it. The developers will also be allowed to respond to these reviews, making the entire arena more like a forum. 4. Customize App Icons This one is again for the developers. The new feature allows them to change the app icons without updating the app. However, to ensure that the feature isn’t misused, there are certain limitations to the feature. 5. User Interface This feature is too small to be noticed by many individuals. With this, now when you close your app, you’ll get the rounded corner at the edges. The reason for calling this change good is that the animation goes quite well with the rounded corners of the app icons. Keeping the same trend, Apple has also replaced the dashes with circles which can be noticed while entering the passcode. Apart from these, changes can also be noticed in the form of up/down arrows for switching emails in the mail app. 6. Updated Podcast Widget The control center can now be adorned with a podcast widget, which will allow you to listen to your podcasts quickly and to launch next one in your list with ease. Though this new widget looks very much like the one for music, it doesn’t show recently played albums. Instead, it features just the cover art of the podcasts you are subscribed to. 7. Changes in Apple ID Profile Changes start with the settings page. As soon as you reach the page, you’ll notice a new section featuring your photo and name. This section is housed with all the important information linked with your device. This includes your Apple ID, iTunes and iCloud information, and the App store settings. The new section allows you to update your payment information, set up family sharing, check iCloud storage, and check the devices that are linked with your Apple ID. 8. Hourly Weather Forecast The Maps app now enables you to have details about the upcoming weather conditions. The only thing you need to do is to use the Touch ID on weather icon to the right of the screen, and there you are with the details of the coming six hours. This new feature will help the users to plan their travel accordingly and avoid unexpected and unfavorable weather conditions. 9. Updates for CarPlay The new feature will allow you to switch apps without going back to the home screen first. Also, the music app gets a new "Up Next" screen featuring the list of songs that are in the queue, and will also let you access the album view from the song screen. 10. Safari and iCloud Improved The Verizon customers here get a treat, as they can now use any iCloud-connected device to answer Wi-Fi calls. Previously this feature was available only for Sprint, T-Mobile, and AT&T customers. However, to enable this, users will have to go to phone tab to the settings page and enable Wi-Fi calling. Apart from this, you can also check your iCloud storage easily through a breakdown by going to iCloud settings. iOS 10.3 no doubt is loaded with some really great features. This is why we said in the beginning that Apple is well acquainted with the ways to attract and engage users at the right time. With this entire list of new features for developers and users, we look ahead to have future updates from the house of Apple.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Chinese officials are cracking down and blocking… Chinese officials are cracking down and blocking access to Apple's App Store By Kyle Wiggers — April 20, 2017 11:13 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you The outcome of China's investigation could determine which apps get through the App Store's approval process. Apple’s dealings with the Chinese government have been fraught with turmoil, to put it lightly. China has targeted the iPhone maker in state-run media smear campaigns and it has repeatedly blocked access to Apple’s services and storefronts. Now, it is turning a skeptical eye on the Cupertino, California-based company’s App Store. On Wednesday, China’s official Xinhua News Agency reported that authorities will “tighten up checks on software applications available in the Apple Store.” According to Xinhua, Apple has been approached by the Beijing offices of three Chinese agencies, including the Cyberspace Administration of China, public security officials, and a cultural law enforcement group. The article did not elaborate, but the investigation appears to focus on third-party apps available in China’s app store — specifically those that offer live content forbidden by Chinese law, like pornography. Earlier in April, authorities told three Chinese websites to tighten their oversight of online information, live-streaming services, and online performance. Chalermphon Kumchai / 123RF It is part of a broader crackdown on digital goods and services in the country. In January, China’s Cyberspace Administration required that all app stores register with the government, and it recently enacted a bill — the Cyber Security Law — that prevents apps from “endanger[ing] national security” or “disrupt[ing] the social order” (Apple pulled the law’s first victim, the New York Times‘ app, from the Chinese App Store in 2016). Apple’s business dealings in the region have frequently run afoul of the country’s regulatory agencies. In 2014, following revelations that the U.S. National Security Agency surveilled Chinese leaders, China Central TV described the iPhone as a “national security concern.” Earlier in 2017, Chinese government regulators blocked access to Apple’s iBooks and iMovies within the country — reportedly out of concern for “security threats.” That is bad news for Apple, which depends on China for about one-fifth of its revenue. But the company’s relationship with the government may be on the mend. CEO Tim Cook apologized following Chinese state media’s allegations of warranty fraud, publishing an open letter in which he promised to implement an “improved level of repair service” and a “clearer and more concise” policy. A series of meetings in May between Cook and “senior government and Communist Party leaders” was described as “productive” by a Reuters source. It is a balancing act for both parties. Apple’s Chinese manufacturing operations are “directly or indirectly responsible for tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs,” according to eWeek. Apple, meanwhile, is eager to turn sales around in a market ripe for growth.
Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Weibo Someone rendered that leaked iPhone 8 design, and it looks even worse than we thought Chris Mills @chrisfmills April 21st, 2017 at 2:02 PM Share Tweet We’ve seen leaks and heard rumors that suggest Apple could put the Touch ID sensor on the back of the iPhone 8. Someone’s now taken the time to render what that would look like, and somehow, it actually looks worse than I’d imagined. Don't Miss: These leaked iPhone 8 schematics are a travesty if they’re real The casing render comes from Weibo, and seems to be based on the schematics that Sonny Dickson leaked earlier this week. We have the same cut-out for the Touch ID sensor on the back, the same dual camera module, and other details from the same set of leaked schematics like screw holes. Putting the fingerprint sensor on the back would be a logical engineering move for Apple. This year’s design trend has been to have edge-to-edge displays with no bezel, and that includes no bottom bezel. With nowhere to put a physical home button, Apple would either have to shift the Touch ID sensor to the back, or use some technology that lets the screen itself read a fingerprint. Apple has filed numerous patents for an under-screen fingerprint reader, but it’s unclear if the tech is mature enough to put in a consumer phone this year. With so much hype and stock price riding on the iPhone 8, Apple might be forced to ship the device this year, even if it involves making a huge compromise in design — like putting a fingerprint sensor on the back. In case you’re wondering why a fingerprint sensor on the back is a bad idea, just look at reviews of the new Galaxy S8. Although it’s a fantastic device in nearly every way, reviewers have universally found that the rear-mounted fingerprint sensor is way too close to the camera lens. You’re far too likely to hit the lens when you go to unlock, meaning smudged photos and unhappy customers. It’s still very possible that Apple has another plan up its sleeve. This render is still based on one dubious set of schematics, which could well be a fake, made by messing with the schematics for the current iPhone 7 Plus. It’s also early enough in the year that Apple is likely still experimenting with a number of different devices, before deciding which design to ultimately go with for manufacturing. Even if it means a few months of pain, it’s easy to see Apple delaying the iPhone 8 launch until after Christmas to get it right. With so much on the line, I’d like to think that Apple won’t be dumb (or courageous!) enough to ship a phone with such an obvious design flaw.

This year's phones show less innovation than in years past.   Samsung's Galaxy S8 goes on sale this week. The early 2017 phone picture is now complete. We now know what the mainstream phone market will look like until Apple reveals its iPhone plans. Here are ten things we've learnt about the state of the phone market: 1. Samsung fans are forgiving, maybe too forgiving You couldn't step on a plane at the end of last year with cabin crew reminding you of problems with the Samsung Note 7. Every safety announcement told passengers it was dangerous. The Note 7's exploding battery was news for weeks. The tech business has rarely seen such damaging publicity. It seems Samsung raced the product out before completing testing. According to Ben Bajarin at techpinions that bad publicity is not enough to stop today's Samsung owners from considering the Galaxy S8. 2. S8 ain't done until Bixby runs Bixby is Samsung's voice-controlled virtual assistant. If it works it will rival Apple’s Siri, Google’s Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa. Samsung says Bixby is different because it strings tasks together. It then manages complex tasks the others can't. Among other things, Bixby can wrap-up and send your most recently taken photo to, say, your partner. It promises to hunt down, then stream a specific video to a Samsung TV set. Soon after announcing the S8 Samsung said Bixby features will not all be available on day one. Unfinished software is not on a par with unfinished and unsafe battery designs. Yet it seems Samsung hasn't learned all the important lessons from the Note 7. If the signature feature of a new phone isn't ready by launch, you might wonder if Samsung still cuts corners. Will anything else emerge, Note 7-like, after the launch? 3. The case of the disappearing bezel Bezel is the name given to the rim around a phone's screen. All phone makers have reduced the size of their bezels in recent models. Huawei and Oppo's 2017 phones have tiny bezels. Samsung has taken this almost to the logical extreme. There is almost no bezel on the Galaxy S8. The front is almost all glass. In practice this means two things. First, you get more screen in a smaller package. The display on the Galaxy S8 is larger than the display on the Apple iPhone 7 Plus. Yet the S8 is roughly the same size as the non-Plus iPhone 7. 4. Much ado about fingerprint scanner placement Put Note 7 fires and Bixby to one side for a moment. What is the main aspect of the Galaxy S8 that every phone reviewer wants to discuss? Is it the camera technology, the processor speed or large 5.8-inch screen? It's none of these. Almost every review mention Samsung's decision to move the fingerprint scanner. A smaller bezel on the phone's front means there's no room for a fingerprint scanner. Samsung moved it to the rear of the phone. Using the S8 fingerprint scanner is now a little more uncomfortable and a touch more awkward. Both points are true. It says a lot about phone innovation that reviewers focus on fingerprint scanner placement. 5. Cameras, cameras, cameras Every phone maker at every launch says their latest model has the best camera on the market. I've been to five launches in the six months or so and have heard five different phone makers make that claim. They can't all be right. For what it's worth, all premium phones have great cameras. They can all take excellent pictures in the right circumstances. Exactly what makes up the right circumstances varies a little from brand to brand. To a degree the camera innovation battle has moved on from hardware to software. At least four of the five big phone brands now offer some form of software-generated bokeh effect. 1 6. Enough with the fashion parades So far this year Samsung, Huawei and Oppo have all had big splashy phone launches with a fashion theme. Each launch included beautiful people from the fashion world. Oppo took this furthest with a Sydney Harbour boat cruise. It featured lurid coloured cocktails, a DJ and fashion models cat posing with phones. A fashion-industry big wig made a speech. She told boat passengers to throw their iPhones overboard and replace it with an Oppo. It's worth pointing out that fashion-themed phone launches are not new. LG held a similar event in Auckland 10 years ago. The message, in case you didn't get it, is that premium smart phones are fashion items. 7. Hardware innovation slows in 2017 phones Related to the fashion metaphor is the fetish with phone colours. There are different shades of black, metallic blues, greens and reds and so on. Again, we've been here before with premium phones. In a sense modern phones have reached the point American cars got to in the 1960s. Then Detroit covered cars in chrome and added tail fins. They did this to create the impression of innovation where, in fact, there was little new. Innovation isn't quite dead in the phone business, but it has slowed to a crawl. The fact that people fuss over the fingerprint scanner tells you that. Almost every hardware improvement in the last year has been incremental, cosmetic or unimportant. Screen resolution passed the point where the human eye could notice a different a few years ago. It's been even longer since a phone processor wasn't fast enough for all everyday tasks. 8. The price isn't right Premium phone price have climbed faster than inflation. This isn't because of currency effects, phone prices are going up everywhere. In part this is because phone makers did not make much profit in the past. Although Apple has always enjoyed a good margin. Even Samsung struggled at times to earn a decent amount from selling hardware. In 2013 the Samsung Galaxy S4 cost NZ$1150 and the 16GB iPhone 5S was $1050. Today the cheapest iPhone 7 is $1430 and the bottom of the range Galaxy S8 is $1300. You can go all the way to $1830 with Apple or $1500 with Samsung. You can argue that you get more phone, or at least more memory and more screen. But that's not the point, it now costs Apple fans over 30 percent more to buy the least expensive iPhone. Samsung customers pay around 20 percent more. Huawei has pushed its prices up even faster. Four years ago it made bargain basement phones, today the P10 is NZ$1000 and the Mate 9 is $1100. Bucking the trend Oppo's $700 R9s has most of the features found in a Samsung phone for almost half the price. There's a huge opportunity for a brand selling good phone hardware at that price. 9. Everyone has a phone Almost every person in the rich world who wants a modern mobile phone now has one. This means phone sales have slowed to a crawl compared with the past decade. It also means phone makers rely on shortening the upgrade cycle to turn over more product. That keeps the money rolling in. There is one big problem with that... 10. There are few compelling reasons to upgrade Today's premium phones are good. When it comes to practical functionality they are not much better than the handsets on offer two years ago. Most of the changes in that time have made little difference to an owner's everyday life. There are always going to be performance obsessed geeks who argue for some esoteric reason they need an even faster processor. But in reality, it's been a long time since phones were slow in everyday use. Likewise, any new hardware feature, is often only of interest to a minority. Few people will hold onto phones for, say, 10 years, as they do with PCs. Apart from anything else, they take a physical beating day-in, day-out and get dropped or otherwise worn out after a few years. Most users who are not on plans have already moved away from annual or bi-annual phone upgrades. In the future more of us are likely to hang-on to devices for even longer. I can't remember if Sony or Oppo mentioned anything about blurred image backgrounds. Apple, Samsung and Huawei all did.

The only thing better than beating expectations is beating them and adding some positive forward guidance for the second quarter and/or the full year. We screened some recent reports from our Wall Street research database and some recent 24/7 Wall St. posts for companies that top analysts on Wall Street think are candidates to beat expectations. These stocks make good sense for growth portfolios that have some risk tolerance. Here are five top tech companies that may beat earnings expectations. Apple This technology giant has been on a huge run, continues printing all-time highs and is the top large cap pick at RBC. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984, and it is among the leaders in the world in innovation with the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Apple’s four software platforms — iOS, OS X, watchOS and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services, including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. RBC thinks the iPhone 8 opportunities are solid, as the firm, like others, feels the product will have significant upgrades. Toss in the easier comparisons and the strong average selling prices, and the new phone is a distinct positive. While the firm does note higher commodity prices are a potential headwind from NAND and DRAM pricing, it sees service growth and acceleration as another distinct positive. Apple investors receive a 1.6% dividend. The RBC price target for the stock is $157, and the Wall Street consensus target is $147.61. The stock closed trading on Friday at $142.27, and Apple is scheduled to report earnings on May 2. Arris International This stock has been an RBC favorite for some time and is the top small cap pick. Arris International PLC (NASDAQ: ARRS) provides media entertainment and data communications solutions in the United States and internationally. It operates through two segments. The Customer Premises Equipment segment offers various product solutions, including set-top boxes, gateways, digital subscriber lines and cable modems, and embedded multimedia terminal adapters and voice/data modems that enable service providers to offer voice, video and high-speed data services to residential and business subscribers. The Network & Cloud segment provides cable modem termination system, converged cable access platform, multichannel video programming distributors, programmer equipment, ad insertion technologies and equipment in the ground or on transmission poles, as well as equipment used to initiate the distribution of content-carrying signals. The $33 RBC price target is in line with the consensus target of $33.13. Shares closed most recently at $25.51. The earnings report is due on May 3. Lumentum This top company looks to benefit big-time from the Facebook Voyager project. Lumentum Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: LITE) manufactures and sells optical and photonic products in the Americas, the Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. It operates in two segments, Optical Communications and Commercial Lasers. The analysts at JPMorgan are very bullish on the company as it is working on several handset original equipment manufacturers for 3D sensing, and the CEO recently said he could see $100 million or more a quarter growing up to a $1 billion opportunity annually (last 12 month revenues were about $1 billion), which many believe could drive upside to current estimates. JPMorgan has set its price target at $54, and the consensus target is $49.35. The stock closed most recently at $45.20. The company is expected to share its results on May 3. Viavi Solutions This smaller capitalization company has solid upside potential. Viavi Solutions Inc. (NASDAQ: VIAV) is a global provider of network test, monitoring and assurance solutions to communications service providers, enterprises and their ecosystems, supported by a worldwide channel community, including Viavi Velocity Solution Partners. The company delivers end-to-end visibility across physical, virtual and hybrid networks, enabling customers to optimize connectivity, quality of experience and profitability. Viavi is also a leader in high-performance thin film optical coatings, providing light management solutions to anti-counterfeiting, consumer electronics, automotive, defense and instrumentation markets. The JPMorgan analysts noted this in a recent report: We continue to see material upside to Viavi’s earnings from 3D sensing in the new iPhone as well as ongoing restructuring. We also believe accretive consolidation deals are a possibility. The $13 JPMorgan price target compares with the posted consensus target of $10.56. The stock closed Friday at $9.90 per share. The company is scheduled to report its fiscal third-quarter results on May 3. Western Digital This long-time innovator in the storage industry is a leader in the total addressable hard disk drive (HDD) market, and it posted a very positive earnings pre-announcement earlier this week. Western Digital Corp. (NASDAQ: WDC) is an industry-leading developer and manufacturer of storage solutions that help to create, manage, experience and preserve digital content. Western Digital is responding to changing market needs by providing a full portfolio of compelling, high-quality storage products with effective technology deployment, high efficiency, flexibility and speed. Its products are marketed under the HGST and WD brands to original equipment manufacturers, distributors, resellers, cloud infrastructure providers and consumers. The most compelling news for 2017 and beyond is that the company made a stunning $19 billion purchase of SanDisk last year. This could be a strong addition to Western Digital’s current offerings, and the company could significantly benefit from SanDisk’s technology and portfolio leadership in the NAND flash semiconductor and enterprise flash systems market. Shareholders are paid a solid 2.4% dividend. RBC has a $96 price target, and the consensus price objective is $93.37. Shares closed Friday at $83.11. The company is scheduled to report on Thursday.

A new low-cost Surface device and Windows 10 Cloud OS combo could do some serious damage to Google's Chromebook ambitions in U.S. schools. On May 2, all eyes will be on Microsoft at its New York City event. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is expected to take the stage and unveil a new push into the education market, likely focused on the U.S. initially. Google has been making big inroads into the K-12 education sector with its low-cost and easy-to-manage Chromebooks. According to IDC's latest numbers,, Chromebooks represented 49 percent of that market last year, up from 40 percent in 2015 and just 9 percent in 2013. Another research firm, Futuresource, puts the number even higher at 58 percent, up from 50 percent in 2015. Apple, which has taken the brunt of the damage from the Chromebook wave in education in the U.S, meanwhile lost significant momentum in recent years. Apple's iOS, featured on the waning iPad series, went from a peak of 26 percent of the market in 2014 to just 14 percent last year, according to Futuresource. Microsoft's Windows, by comparison, did better, dropping from 25 percent to 22 percent in that same time period. For non-U.S. markets, the tale is very different. There, 65 percent of the education market is Windows, with Chrome OS at just six percent and Android at 17 percent. Apple held steady at just nine percent of the global education K-12 markets. The timing is right for Windows 10 Cloud Google is on to something with its Chromebook line, at least in the U.S. Combined with hardware support from major manufacturers, a mature app ecosystem, and ease of IT management, Chromebooks are the preferred choice for school IT departments. In speaking with some local school IT administrators – both public and private – here in Marlborough, Mass., it is the ability to lock down and secure Chromebooks, followed by cost, that is driving Chromebook adoption. 7 things you need to know about Windows 10 Cloud Microsoft is poised, however, to get back into education. Windows RT was a disaster for the company on many levels, including its confusing name, poor marketing, software limitations, and pricing. The Windows 10 Cloud OS, which may go by the name "Windows 10 S" when unveiled on May 2, is a different scenario. This time, Microsoft has a story to tell and a strategy to market this version of Windows to the right audience. Key differences between Windows RT and Windows 10 Cloud OSes include: A more mature Store for Windows Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps. The ability for the OS to be upgraded to a Home or Pro license. Capacity to run Win32 apps via "Project Centennial" bridge apps via the Store. A hardware team that's more in tune with commercial and consumer needs and desires. Combined with advancements in hardware and improvements to the OS, Microsoft has clear goals it wants to achieve with Windows 10 Cloud. In an internal document obtained by Windows Central (above), we can see exactly how Microsoft views Windows 10 Cloud as competing against Chromebooks in performance benchmarks. Additionally, recommended minimum specifications for a Windows 10 "CloudBook" are listed for hardware manufacturers: Quad-core (Celeron or better) processor. 4GB of RAM. 32GB of storage (64GB for 64-bit). A battery larger than 40 WHr. Fast eMMC or solid state drive (SSD) for storage technology. Pen and touch (optional). Microsoft is focusing heavily on all-day battery life, as evidenced by its new "Power Throttling" initiative that's being tested in recent Windows Insider Program previews for the "Redstone 3" release expected this fall. Windows 10 on ARM will go further Windows 10 on ARM is another big step for Microsoft that is expected to come to fruition this fall, as well. With the ability to run what was an x86/64 OS on mobile ARM processors, the company can further drive down hardware costs, improve battery efficiency, and make thinner and lighter devices. Intel is making significant strides in reducing battery consumption, and Microsoft's Power Throttling goes further. According to the company, its Power Throttling support will be extended to other processor types (currently it is limited to 6th and 7th Generation Intel processors), which likely includes ARM. The Achilles heel of Windows laptops has always been two-fold: poor battery life, and risk management due to viruses and installing .exe software. Both of those problems are now being ameliorated through Windows 10 Cloud. Windows 10 on ARM devices are expected at the end of 2017 in the fourth quarter. Today's Surface Book is too expensive The current problem for Microsoft and its Surface line is the price. At Microsoft's Surface Studio event in October 2016, Microsoft's Corporate Vice President of Devices Panos Panay used a photo of his son to demonstrate how children naturally adopt digital inking on a PC. In the picture, presented as a backdrop, the child is using a Surface Book. That device starts at $1,600 and increases to more than $3,000 for the high-end version. Kids love inking and the Surface Book, but how do you get it into schools? While in a perfect world all kids would be able to afford a Microsoft Surface Book, the chances of that happening are minuscule. Clearly, Microsoft needs a lower-cost, entry-level device that provides a similar experience with an emphasis on a touchscreen and digital pen. A new "Surface Laptop" running Windows 10 Cloud is the ideal solution, if it meets the minimum hardware specifications mentioned earlier. It also could also replace the now deprecated non-pro Surface 3. Microsoft is expected to announce such a device on May 2, though some of our sources say the new hardware may not come until Microsoft's Build conference the following week. A traditional laptop without a detachable keyboard would keep production costs down (fewer product SKUs), and it would work for schools, where losing a keyboard (or breaking it) could cause headaches for IT staff. As a solution to making the laptop more Surface-like, the keyboard could rotate around like Lenovo's Yoga series or HP's x360 line. I also suspect a Surface Pen will be a part of any Surface Laptop, because the recent Creators Update focuses on inking. The new EPUB support in Windows 10 makes sense when you think of a push into education for Microsoft. Likewise, the seemingly odd addition of EPUB support for the Edge web browser and corresponding digital book section in the Windows Store makes more sense once you bring education into the equation. However, one issue Microsoft could face in schools is app selection. While UWP is evolving and improving the selection of quality apps specifically related to education, it cannot possibly match the Google Play Store. That could change over time, and perhaps Microsoft has some strategies in place to help lure companies to create apps specifically for this genre. Windows 10 Cloud and Surface for schools makes sense Recently, a nephew of mine who is nine years old saw my Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon. He said, "That looks like my Chromebook." I jokingly corrected him by stating "No, your Chromebook looks like my PC laptop." The point should be obvious: The education market is critical to Microsoft's future based purely on familiarity. The debate between macOS and Windows preference, for instance, almost always comes down to what you were exposed to first. Rarely in today's world do adults try both OSes, evaluate them equally and come to rational decisions. Chromebook or PC? The answer may be age dependent. If Google is already at 50 percent adoption in the U.S. education market, that is a generation that's now in the Google and Android ecosystem. Microsoft needs a plan to take that on and, for once, I feel like it may have some significant advantages with Windows 10 Cloud and a new Surface. The recent announcement that it will align the servicing models for Windows 10, Office 365 ProPlus, and System Center Configuration Manager also likely plays a part in this plan. Windows 10 Redstone 3: Everything we know so far Microsoft's hardware partners are likely to pick up the slack and deliver even lower cost hardware to run Windows 10 Cloud in the coming months in preparation for fall 2017. All of that combined with Apple's declining popularity in schools is a perfect opportunity for Redmond. As such, Microsoft's May 2 event could be the start of a significant push for the company — one that will have a lasting effect on a new generation.

But do I believe it?</p> <p>* To succeed, I assume MS also aims at non-English speaking countries.<br /> * Does MS aim at primarl school only, or also at colleges/universities?</p> <p>MS faces some challenges..</p> <p>1. Living in Europe with a non-English mother language/keyboard, I still have chosen English as UI language in Windows 10. Why?<br /> * Why even ask? It is my own choice! Nevertheless...<br /> * Easier to google/bing for help to solve problems, and I recognize the names of settings, etc. in English<br /> * I use programs/applications with English-only UI, and it is easier when there is consistency across applications and Windows<br /> * I teach for international students (EU exchange students, students from Africa, Asia, Latin America, etc.) both at home and abroad. I need these students to understand settings in Excel, etc.</p> <p>2. Windows Cloud, based on UWP apps in my teaching? Not possible for now!<br /> * Windows 10 currently installs UWP apps on my computer where the UI language is either based on the region, my physical internet address, or the keyboard. In other words: using my national language.<br /> * This means that the installed apps use a different UI language than Windows. My students don&#39;t understand the UI language of my apps (e.g., OneNote)!<br /> * Most likely, the international students will face the same problem as I do -- at least if their computer is bought locally (with our national keyboard). This doesn&#39;t cut it.</p> <p>3. Other language &quot;challenges&quot;...<br /> * Several UWP apps choose spelling checker based on keyboard.&nbsp;<br /> * This is ok. in tablet mode, where I can use virtual keyboards on screen, and can easily switch keyboard by the flick of my finger.<br /> * This idea is absolutely horrendous when working with a physical keyboard!<br /> * And -- NO! The language auto detection doesn&#39;t work well. And I&#39;m tired to manually having to go through menus to change spelling checker language...<br /> * Yes, I can handle more than one language. I do write in my mother tongue. I do write in English. I sometimes write in German. I sometimes write in Spanish. And I do not change physical keyboard -- it is not possible (except for, e.g., Surface Pro, but I don&#39;t want to lug around a stack of TypeCovers...)</p> <p>4. And then there is Excel...<br /> * Yes, the situation *is* improving. A few years ago, Windows installed MS Office in my national language irrespective of the Windows UI language.&nbsp;<br /> * When the language problem with Office was fixed so that I got English UI language in Office, Excel *still* insisted on installing plug-ins (e.g., Solver) with my national language as UI... OK, that has been fixed (I hope...).<br /> * Current problem: tomorrow, I will give a class in Spain using Excel. I *hope* I can use my own laptop with English as UI language (I&#39;m not that fluent in Spanish). And I&#39;ll demonstrate some calculations using Excel.<br /> * Big problem: the function for random number generation (rand) has a different name in Spanish (aleatorio, or something). Programming constructs have different names, e.g., &quot;if&quot; is not denoted &quot;if&quot; in the Spanish version of Excel.<br /> * OK -- I can live with this, as long as I don&#39;t have to use a local computer -- and as long as the students can figure out what these constructs are called, but this is really, really bad when teaching.<br /> * OK -- can I make my Excel programs/sheets available to the students? In other words, do my sheets written for the English UI version of Excel work when opened in a Spanish language version? Are commands such as &quot;aleatorio&quot; automatically translated to &quot;rand&quot;? Maybe, but I do not feel confident...</p> 0 22 hours ago Reply Sin Ogaris I wouldn't exactly say this is the right time, pc's and tablets are already well and truly engraved in the education sector. 0 1 day ago Reply Michael Alan Goff So, serious question, has Microsoft cleared the gap in maintenance/management between Windows and Chrome OS? 0 1 day ago Reply Nect removed 0 1 day ago Reply bleached This article doesn't mention exactly where schools are saving money with Chromebooks. I don't think it is cost of the hardware. It is likely cost of supporting and managing Windows machines. There are plenty of low cost Windows machine as available today, but they are not easy for a school with limited resources to deploy. Microsoft needs to further simplify Windows and match the services available on Chromebooks. We will hear how Microsoft will handle this, but it seems they are being short sighted. 1 1 day ago Reply r4incs So MS is playing catch-up once again? It turned out really well last time (looks at Windows Phone/Mobile). 0 1 day ago Reply Drael646464 As importantly, the tablet market where windows on arm is targeted, is a sector where only windows and budget are growing amonst consumers. By making a budget hybrid, perhaps something like the transformer book, windows can be positioned in BOTH of the growth sectors of tablets, when both samsung and apple have been slipping for four years. a serious foothold in tablets will drive UWP development, as will any substantial sales of a cloudbook. Re-positioning Windows to re-enter the fray for pocket cellular devices.  So this year, I expect not simple a surface pro, but a budget model. I'm hoping with a transformer book design, so it can be also more laptop like. And without the ridiculous screen sizes - perhaps a happy 10.1 inches, or even apple like 9.7. I expect this is why the rumours on surface suggest both arm, and intel - it'll be both.  Basically its the whole budget thing that is MS's entire pathway back to market dominance, in particular larger touchscreen devices. And that's also the point of difference for a cloud book - its touch enabled, its stylus enabled (as you say, a rotatable design would suit education best). If windows can make gains on bigger screen touch devices, that breathes life into UWP. And you can see the push for UWP in all of MS's recent moves - the option to lock windows down to store only, the cloud device, and the cheaper arm devices. THIS is how they are tackling the app gap - by fighting in an area where they have strenth - bigger screens.   0 1 day ago Reply Aden Rossinni I've heard of many schools here in Australia wanting to drop the Chromebooks because they either didn't realise that they couldn't do **** or realised later in using them. They are just gimmicks, and have already been swapped for Surface Pros in some places, so what MS is doing is perfect in this situation. 3 2 days ago Reply yac man please quote your sources ( otherwise untrue / did not happen / fake news ).   0 2 days ago Reply Drael646464 sd 0 1 day ago Reply vEEP pEEP Get'em while they are young...

Who knows how close MS is to achieving those targets? Incidentally, my 2-years-old Chromebook Flip cold boots in 7 seconds. So Chromebook numbers are a little skewed to lower the bar for MS. It's interesting though that MS is trying to re-invent the Chromebook, only it will cost more, be less secure, and be restricted to a much smaller and lower quality application pool. 1 2 days ago Reply Drael646464 Cost more? Why would it cost more? It's using the same chipsets, the same type of hardware, and likely a free license.  Personally I wouldn't say that's better app quality, when the app pool (android apps) isn't even designed for the FF, and they are more geared to social networking and bus stop games than education. Chrome apps themselves number a paltry 10,000. Admitedly for the education sector, windows might have a small catch up, but its not exactly huge, nor are education apps demanding functionality. For the most part people use web browsers, and word processors.  The whole point of difference for Windows could is - its touch enabled, its ink and stylus enabled and its fully upgradable to full windows. Which makes chromebook seem kind of sad by comparison IMO, as an educational tool.  0 1 day ago Reply Aden Rossinni Yes, but they don't do much so ... 0 2 days ago Reply ProfessorMudguts You'd think for $3000, the Surface Book would teach Panos' son how to hold a pen correctly :-D 0 2 days ago Reply El Mac Funny.

Add in windows cloud with its stylus, touch support, faster local apps, robust educational apps, ability to run win32 and upgradeability, and I think you are right. I think this will kill the Chromebook in a few years flat. The fact that chromeos is only popular in a small part of the world, really doesn't help the developer base, and googles recent move to remove them from other OS's has put a lot of developers off, as they were only interested when it was universal.

Ah, ok 👌, I see how that makes sense. 0 2 days ago Reply MrElectrifyer There's 1 MAJOR advantage Chromebooks have in the Educational market that Windows 10 currently has nothing to match; NEVER need to reboot to update the OS. Chromebooks merely being the Chrome web browser on Windows means that to install security patches/updates, all that has to happen is the user closes the browser and the security updates are installed automatically without requiring ANY reboot. That is automatically and seamlessly done whenever a user logs out the system, and if a security patch didn't get the time to install prior to the chromebook going to sleep, that's easily and quickly done on next resume from sleep. So, literally 0 need for reboot to stay secure, literally 0 need for IT department keeping tabs on them for security reasons. Compare that to Windows 10 where when you wake it up from sleep, you'll be getting that stupid "Updating Windows, don't turn off your computer" message for several minutes, especailly when they've not been updated in a while due to them not being used in a classroom. Imagine getting that when you're about to write an online Exam (which is the only place where Chromebooks were used on my Campus, everything else is Windows). Unless an IT department is being paid to keep those Windows 10 Cloud Laptops up to date, or those Laptops never turn off (in which case they can do the restart when the user logs off and thinks they've put the Laptop to sleep), Windows 10 Cloud won't be able to remain secure, making them a security threat to the Campus. 0 2 days ago Reply Daniel Rubino Microsoft's policy is to not require a reboot for an update more than once every 4 weeks. I really don't see that as a big deal these days. Additionally, the Unified Update Platform (UUP) goes a long way to helping with this as well. 1 2 days ago Reply MrElectrifyer It's not much of a concern as a consumer, 'cause I'm only dealing with 1 PC (a Surface Pro 2 in my case), and I can easily take a moment to configure Windows Updates to match my workflow for the rest of my use of the Windows PC. No problem with that. In the case of a school campus, where there's 1000s of them - all of which don't get used for months until an Exam is coming up - it becomes a big concern in terms of both time and security. You'll need to pay an IT department to mange each and every one of those Windows Laptops/Convertibles, 'cause unlike Windows Desktops, they're not connected to a LAN 24/7, and thus can't be updated remotely. If you don't pay an IT department to do that, you risk having significant delays or interuptions when the Laptops are needed; during an online Exam. That's the major advantage Chromebooks have; savings in both IT department costs and time. With Chromebooks, any Teacher (regadless of background) could just grab a Laptop cart (contains about 50 Chomebooks I think) from some IT room (where the cart was plugged in charging the Laptops) at anytime of the year, bring it to the classroom, students simply unplug 1 of them and take to their desk, log-in, and can begin the exam (no waiting for any updates). Once they're done, they sign out, take the Laptop back to the cart and just plug in its power cable. To get the same with most of todays Windows Laptops, you'll need to be fussing with both power and ethernet cables for each and every one of those Laptops in some specialized cart, so that when in the IT room, they can be connected to the LAN and kept up to date remotely when not in use for months. That adds more room for human error, unless the campus pays some premium to get a custom Windows Laptop and Laptop cart that can get both power and ethernet over 1 connection. On top of that, would still need to pay an IT department to be keeping tabs on them remotely. None of which is a concern with Chromebooks.

MS is their competitor not their friend.   You give up control, you give your competitor more weapons to do harm and you give up revenue.... adobe is probably losing close to zero money not being on the MS's store.   I don't think you'll will see Valve products either... its really a no brainer.   The big developers have zero reason for the MS store to be successful especially if they have their own store.  Smaller developers, sure, they don't have their own store, don't have the means so another distribution path could be a benefit... big developers have a negative incentive.   There is actually a less incentive then it was to distribute via GFWL as at least with that... we were dealing with open and Win32.   MS is a competitor to Adobe, Autodesk, Valve, Epic, etc. not a friend, although their might be partnerships from time to time.   Which is why many of them have spoken harshly about UWP and the Store. -1 2 days ago Reply MakoDaniels Daniel, another comment.   The reason why this site keeps getting excited then disappointed by MS product sales and adoption, and ultimate leads to the dropping of the tech/product is.... most of this is the opposite of what these articles saying.   What I mean is you are geared towards your own consumer incentives... but when it comes to Windows, consumers have either dropped it or ignore it. Let me give you an example, you think this Cloud OS is a good idea, but basically its RT2.0.... fair enough, that is what you think.   But in the real world, in my experience at the enterprise level.... businesses have or want to strip not the Win32 stuff out but the UWP/Store from Windows 10.   So, I work with a medium size company that wants to deploy Win10 from Win7 which is virtualized and users use citrix.   Now do you want to know what those builds look like now in testing.... everything you write about in these articles are being stripped out... whether its the Store app, OneDrive, UWP, tablet mode, etc.   Windows without Win32 and open is kind of like Kate Upton without the rack, what's the point?   Windows with UWP might as well be a Chromebook, either way I doubt the consumer is going to come back in mass. What MS is doing is throwing a bunch a mud at the wall hoping the consumer is coming back, the problem is.... reality is much different.    0 2 days ago Reply CMDR_Shepard I work for a company that is considered medium (almost 500+ people) and we are moving to Windows 10 Enterprise at a fast pace.

So let's establish something, schools are enterprise.  You try managing thousands of these devices in the hands of children, it is a nightmare.  Apple's management utilities left a lot to be desired whereas Google knocked it out of the park with Chromebooks.  Chromebooks have significant advantages over Windows, OS X and iOS in the eyes of school IT decision makers: They are ridiculously inexpensive per unit.  You can buy 2 chromebooks for the cost of 1 iPad or PC. Hardware support warranties are inexpensive per unit. Management is all in Google's cloud and it is incredibly easy to maintain, control, distribute apps, secure and lock down these machines.  It is also low to almost no cost for the Chromebook management tools.  Most schools decided to focus their engineering time on faculty/staff machines that require more advanced workflows. Chromebooks are 100% integrated with Google Apps.  Google Apps is/was far more aligned with consumer needs and experiences than Office 365, so lots of people gravitate towards it because it feels less intimidating to them.   Lightweight, great battery life and are very reliable for teachers that have crafted their lesson plans around this piece of technology.  Consumers today expect more intuitive software and design that to them feels more natural.  What they get at work or school is just frustration, because they cannot reconcile the duality that this iPad at home works great, why can't my IT staff make it work this great here.  Chromebooks never had that problem, they are the same natural, simple experience both at home and at work or school. The consumerisation of IT is real, expectations have changed dramatically and has made the job of IT administrators harder everywhere. I see this new Microsoft device as the start of the great iPad and Chromebook purge, IF they can get the management right and work on their consumer experiences. Intune, Azure AD, Windows 10 and Office 365 together looks to be a winning combination for IT decision makers that is evolving every day.  I have already began moving in that direction at my school, it remains to be seen if other school IT decision makers will follow suit. 5 2 days ago Reply Tunde Fajimi Great insights jblank46!

But the numbers, to me, show that Microsoft's strategy of "US only" or "US first" is as wrong as it gets. Yes, the growth of ChromeOS in the USA may be worrisome to Redmond BUT the USA is just ONE country in 196. In 195 countries, Chromebooks are absolutely irrelevant. Now you may say "well, that's why they should focus on the US". But that's, to me, the wrong strategy. They hold a large margin worldwide but if they continue to treat the US as special and focusing all their offerings and services only on the US, all that Google or any other competitor needs to do is to open those same types of services to people in the other 195 countries. We can take a couple of examples from history: - Microsoft has always treated Europe as a second-rate (or third, or fourth) market for the Xbox (and most other things, really). As a result, Sony's PlayStation rules in Europe with over 70% marketshare (in some countries over 90%). They've sold over 22 million consoles in Europe. Xbox? Less than 8 million. - Nokia's Eflop years saw the company leave their European/Asian focus and move it to the US. Because "Europe was guaranteed". As a result, sales in Europe continuously declined without the US market growth making up for it. - Sony's Xperia phones, at the same time, saw great growth in the European market because Sony made an effort instead of bothering with focusing in just one country (the US). When Sony decided to change that - around the time of the Xperia Z4 - and start trying to focus in the US market alone, sales of Xperia devices started to come down.   So whilst it's important that Microsoft shows aggressiveness in the US market to combat the Chromebook infestation that has installed itself on Uncle Sam's lands, it will be a major flaw if they limit the efforts to the USA. In Europe and other Western or Westernised markets, if Microsoft doesn't make an effort to show some parity of treatment with the US, they risk Google or someone else to come along and show that parity. And then they'll not only risk not gaining back anything in the US, they'll be losing market in those other countries. It's also worth noting that the educational system in Europe and Western markets is far better than the American and more likely to adopt new technologies to tackle on new educational challenges. Microsoft simply can't let that pass and not take the chance. 13 2 days ago Reply Azizelh Simple... The focus on the US is not because of the US. It's because schools here offer items to their students and are ready to pay some money for that. None of the schools I personally know in France for example offer them to students. They have some in dedicated rooms and the libraries, but none in class. Pretty sure it's the same or close in other countries.

Now MSFT has caught up and gotten way better as a cloud computing platform compared to others like GSuite or IBM. 1 2 days ago Reply RohanRonQM Google Suite is cheaper compared to Microsoft Azure services 0 2 days ago Reply Tom Westrick Does it matter? Do students actually need every single feature in Word? They need to learn typing, proper sentence structure, APA formatting, etc. That can be done just as well within Google Docs as it can within Word.  0 2 days ago Reply VOMoreira I personally feel word is better, but that's what I grew up with. The issue isn't that word is better, the issue is that they are using software that is not at industry standards. So when they go to the work force, they won't have the knowledge to use company software (in today's industry it being MS office). 2 2 days ago Reply Tom Westrick So, my school used Windows XP and Office 2003. When I got to the working world, my company used Windows 7 and Office 2007 - now Windows 2013. There's still a learning curve between the different versions of Office, and I still have to walk people through finding some feature because its location changed from a previous version of Office.  If someone can adjust to the layout of a new version of Office, they can adjust to Office coming from Google Apps.  1 2 days ago Reply VOMoreira That I do not know about. If you have enough faith that students can handle change, then so be it. But at the moment we have students who don't understand how the cloud works, or even save a file to a computer. Both of which I learned in high school. 3 2 days ago Reply RohanRonQM so true. some teens even young adults think bad WiFi connection or Cloud Storage problems happens because it's raining outside. . All the kids these days - all dummies 0 2 days ago Reply RohanRonQM And then there is my employer that grew up in the 1970s and thinks that we should all be using Corel Writer or OpenOffice. 0 2 days ago Reply Dillan K Long live Word Perfect! 0 1 day ago Reply Andrew Hartley Clearly you have not tried Google docs. It is much more functional than word, much better for collaboration and works any where. Office products stagnate innovation. Teachers use Windows because teachers struggle to change with the times. They prefer to stay in their comfort zone. I have been a teacher for 30 years, have used Microsoft since the beginning and then moved on to Google. The whole ecosystem is far superior to MS. It works and works well. The only changes to Office  over the last 10 years have been minor and superficial. Kids brought up on G Suite have no problem transitioning to Office because they are adaptable. Office users are very rigid in their thinking and to be truthful rather dated -3 2 days ago Reply VOMoreira You clearly haven't used the recent office as microsoft has collaboration as well. They updated and have added online word, excel that allows multiple users to edit the same document (just like Google). I have tried to use Google docs as I often have to explain it to students. 2 2 days ago Reply RohanRonQM I can agree with you on Office XP till Office 2010, but the newest Office 365 version is so much better and more adaptable to how you want it. 2 2 days ago Reply nasznjoka Yes but it's playing catchup! You know you guys in here if you're really smart you could wish all the best for chrome as an OS! Competition is better for users, stop with your fanboysm stuff just be smart! Now you are bragging about office 365 having collaborations do you think micrsoft could've brought it if it weren't for competition? Wish all the best to the substitute services you are not using!  i use all OS and I HATE FANBOYS! 0 23 hours ago Reply DragonPoo Really?  A lot of the teachers I know have Macs through their school, not Windows.  Must depend on the district. I agree about Word versus anything else, though. 0 2 days ago Reply RohanRonQM Google Suite (Gmail, Drive, Google Docs) is cheaper per user than Microsoft Azure (Office 365+OneDrive+Outlook). Last time I looked in 2014 the pricing was: Google = $9 per user per month MSFT = $12 per user per month Apple = $8 per user per month (but limited to only Apple devices so no company/school chooses this) 0 2 days ago Reply Drael646464 We'll have to see what MS offers schools. MS often operates as a charity, and I expect they will see the humanitarian side of this. I'd put money on them creating a special deal for schools.  0 1 day ago Reply ozaz Is there any evidence that inking is beneficial from a learning point of view? Its a nice idea (and gives a good marketing story) but if it comes at added expense perhaps schools should be wary of spending extra money on devices with inking support, especially after so many wasted money on ill-considered iPads. At least until there is evidence of benefit. 0 1 day ago Reply Curtis Quick You're kidding right? I guess you never thought that a student could take notes with a pen. It is so much easier to handwrite notes and the ability to add diagrams and drawings is phenominal! A Windows 2-1 device and OneNote will draw circles around a Chromebook any day. Chromebook is last century in comparison. Teachers can share their lecture notes with students. Students can share notes with oneanother - all without ever needing to use a keyboard! Every subject benefits from easy pen input. Science, Math, History, Art. Everywhere you have more than just words a pen is a great idea. Try drawing a diagram for physics with a keyboard. Or doing math problems. Or Art. You will quickly understand what I mean. Modern versions of Windows on 2-in-1 devices are exactly what students need in the classroom. They provide almost every conceivable manner of input that a student might need and they do it well. The only thing Chromebooks had going for it was cost, setup and a strong ABM (anything but Microsoft) attitude. Modern Windows 2-in-1 devices can do both and so much more. Schools were burned by iPads, and when they see how much more they can do with Windows 2-in-1 devices than Chromebooks it will be like the iPad all over again. 3 1 day ago Reply ozaz I didn't ask what the idea behind it is. I asked if there is any evidence that it actually benefits learning. The idea is obvious but just because something sounds appealing in theory does not mean it is actually beneficial in practice. If there have been any convincing studies that show learning is enhanced by student use of a stylus equipped computing device (compared to just traditional pen and notebook for notetaking) please link me to them.  If they don't yet exist, I would question the wisdom of schools investmenting in stylus-equipped devices for students just because they sound good in theory. Stylus-equipped devices for teachers is a different issue, and would presumably make much less of a contribution to overall expenditure anyway. 1 1 day ago Reply Drael646464 It allows you to take your own notes, adding notes to web pages, documents, etc. If notation and note taking is considered useful, which of course it is, then ink is useful. I think the price difference, will be trivial. Adding acrive stylus support to a display doesn't cost a lot for a manufacturer. We are talking sort of 20 bucks here.  2 1 day ago Reply ozaz $20 to the manufacturer, but what about the added cost to the schools, factoring in inevitable regular loss and damage to styluses? Surely more than the cost of pen and paper. Hence my question above as to whether there is evidence it provides added learning benefit over notetaking via pen and paper. 0 1 day ago Reply Drael646464 Schools spend quite a bit of money on printing, so I think that pretty much neutralises out. It's basically its people making notes on digital stuff, rather than paper. So on the website, or document, or map, rather than printing it out and doing the same. So its basically more accessible digitally. You get some great digital art programs on windows too, which offers a new subject currently not given much focus, but of high commercial importance - digital media.  I doubt anyones done any studies on this though.    0 3 hours ago Reply Drael646464 Well, windows cloud, I imagine a free license product running on the cheaper ARM chipsets, will be basically the same cost as a chromebook. It'll be cheap. Windows has touch capability, stylus capability, and Ink. It also has the ability to upgrade to full windows 10.  0 1 day ago Reply Wevenhuis How should I interpret the performance of quad core "celeron" compared to arm (say snapdragon 800 or 835)? 2 2 days ago Reply RohanRonQM The Qualcomm SD810 v2, or SD617 would be comparable to a Celeron (2013), or Intel Core M3 (1st gen), or even a Core i3 (2nd gen) . Of course, from there you would be able to tell the newer ARM processors would be much closer to newer Intel Core M5, Core i3/i5, etc. . Just a heads up: The entire Intel Atom lineup was probably as powerful as a Qualcomm SD 400, 410, or 605. 0 2 days ago Reply ozaz For future reference, what do you base this on? I'd like to be able to do these types of comparisons myself. Thanks 1 1 day ago Reply Sukesh Ashok Kumar 600 & 800 series.

The most recent entrant however isn't particularly original, though it does suggest Apple is considering its options in the augmented reality space. The patent, which can be found in scanned form on the US Patent and Trademark Office, outlines a "method and device for illustrating a virtual object in a real environment". Yes, that's a somewhat vague description, though it's made up for by an overly elaborate summary: The invention relates to a method for representing a virtual object in a real environment, having the following steps: generating a two-dimensional image of a real environment by means of a recording device, ascertaining a position of the recording device relative to at least one component of the real environment, segmenting at least one area of the real environment unmarked in reality in the two-dimensional image for identifying at least one segment of the real environment in distinction to a remaining part of the real environment while supplying corresponding segmentation data, and merging the virtual object with the two-dimensional image of the real environment with consideration of segmentation data such that at least one part of the segment of the real environment is removed from the image of the real environment. To put it simply, the patent describes using augmented reality to replace or add objects to a real scene. The lead image of this story, taken from the patent documents, makes it pretty clear how this would work in practise. There's also this adorable sketch: Image: Apple / USPTO The patent is light on specific implementation plans and is broad enough to cover a large swathe of uses for augmented reality, so it's impossible to know how Apple might utilise the patent. That said, you could read a lot into the patent's focus on furniture — some sort of interactive interior decoration app, perhaps?

You should only get a patent when you supply a working prototype as proof of concept. This just slows progression down.

Apple was granted a permit to test self-driving cars on April 14 by the California Department of Motor Vehicles but the company has never said anything about its plan. The state released 41 pages of Apple application documents to Reuters that give some clues about the company's highly secret self-driving effort, which it has never openly acknowledged. The iPhone maker joins a long list of carmakers, start-ups and technology rivals, including Alphabet's Waymo, that are testing cars on state roads. Apple is looking for new hit products and autonomous car technology is expected to revolutionize the traditional auto industry. As part of the application, Apple included a 10-page training plan that appeared to be related to operators taking back manual control of the car during automated driving exercises of the system, which it calls a development platform. Apple declined comment beyond the filing. The plan includes a document called "Automated System: Development Platform Specific Training Overview" whose objective is "to train safety drivers in various automated driving conditions." "Development platform will be controlled electronically (e.g. joystick) and safety drivers must be ready to intervene and take control," the document reads. The document highlights different scenarios to be tested, from high speed driving and tight U-turns to lane changes. One letter sent from Apple to the state Department of Motor Vehicles noted that Apple's development platform "will have the ability to capture and store relevant data before a collision occurs." The document does not include detail on how Apple's self-driving platform actually works or other technical details. It also does not say what kind of sensors are found on Apple's three permitted vehicles, all 2015 Lexus model RX450h. The permit does not necessarily mean that Apple itself is building a full car. Apple could instead be designing a self-driving platform that can be integrated into other manufacturer's cars.

The highly anticipated completely wireless earbuds were announced alongside the iPhone 7 to make up for the lack of a headphone jack. Now that AirPods have been on the market for four months, are you using them? Take Our Poll Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case One thing worth noting right off the bat is that it’s still incredibly difficult to get ahold of Apple’s AirPods. They’re backordered six weeks from Apple’s online store and retail availability is scattered at best. AirPods were originally slated to be made available in October but ended up being delayed until December over what is believed to have been manufacturing issues. It’s possible that Apple still faces those same manufacturing difficulties. Nevertheless, seeing that they’ve been available for four months, anyone who really wanted them has likely been able to track a pair down. Scattered availability, however, has been one of the top complaints of users and rightfully so. It seems weird and out of character for Apple that, despite announcing them over 6 months ago, the company still struggles to keep up with demand. A six-week backorder window likely has not had a positive impact on sales, either. While Apple hasn’t released official sales numbers for AirPods, Tim Cook stated back in December that they are a “runaway success.” Cook also addressed the scarce availability and said that Apple is making units as fast as it can, but again, things haven’t approved in that area as of yet. Personally, I’m a huge fan of Apple’s AirPods. I’ve tried all of Apple’s W1 headphone options and walked away most impressed with the AirPods because of the truly wireless design, the carrying case, and their ear fit. AirPods offer the best combination of design, value, and performance in my opinion. What are your thoughts on AirPods now that we’re four months in? How often do you use them, or have you not been able to get your hands on a pair? Let us know in the poll above and in the comments below.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Apple Watch Series 3 May Potentially Incorporate A micro-LED Display By Ali Salman Apr 22, 2017 9Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple has a secret research and development facility in Taiwan which has been researching micro-LED display technology for as long as since 2015. Now, a new report from Business Korean cites that an advanced micro-LED could possibly be incorporated in the Apple Watch Series 3. If it does debut on the next Apple Watch, it will be replacing the flexible OLED panel. There are certain advantages associated with adopting micro-LED displays compared to OLED and LCD screens. So let’s dive in to see some more details on the implementation of micro-LED displays on the Apple Watch. Apple Watch Series 3 To Rock A micro-LED Display Instead Of OLED? According to the report, the iPhone-maker along with its suppliers will start producing micro-LED panels for the next Apple Watch in Taiwan by the end of the year. micro-LED panels are thinner, lighter and consume less power compared to OLED and LED. This will benefit the wearable in terms of both the quality of display as well as making it lighter. Related Apple and Nike Announce the New Apple Watch NikeLab – Space Gray Color Enthusiasts Will Love This We also came across Apple’s acquisition of LuxVue back in 2014, which was working on micro-LED display technology. Moreover, it is said that LuxVue has found out a way by which the micro-LED displays will consume less power in consumer electronics. Currently, all Apple Watch models feature an OLED panel manufactured by LG Display. Advertisement The upcoming iPhone is expected to feature an OLED or AMOLED panel, which initially will be exclusively supplied by Samsung Display. Moreover, by 2018 the panels will be supplied by Sharp, Japan Display and LG Display. In addition to this, the aforesaid suppliers have already invested and are geared up to support Apple’s demand needs for OLED panels. However, there is a possible scenario in which the iPhone’s adoption of OLED panels is implemented for a short span of time. After 2018, there are a whole lot of possible directions that Apple can move towards. Apple could also potentially make a shift to micro-LED screens in 2019 or 2020. Nonetheless, final statements at this point wouldn’t be the right way to go. Related Spotify Is Partnering With A Third-Party Developer To Bring The Official Apple Watch App If Apple decides to go with micro-LEDs instead of OLED, both LG and Samsung’s business would take an impact. Generally, both suppliers would have to forgo around $1 billion annually. Nonetheless, as we have mentioned earlier, it’s too early to jump to any conclusions. There will be more to the story, so be sure to stay tuned in for that. This is it for now, folks.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Influx of crime leaves private school in danger of losing business license Saturday Apr 22, 2017 at 7:34 PM Apr 22, 2017 at 7:43 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — A riot, gang activity and sex crimes represent a sample of incidents at a private school now in danger of losing its business license, which would displace 78 students and some 30 employees. Between Dec. 28, 2015, and March 11, 2017, San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department deputies in Apple Valley responded to 132 calls for service at Bright Futures Academy, according to Capt. Frank Bell. Bell said he presented a report on the calls to town officials during closed session of a recent Town Council meeting, and requested the academy’s license be revoked when it comes up for renewal. The town instead announced its intent to revoke the license posthaste, Bell said. Bright Futures, which serves many students with intellectual and emotional disabilities, has appealed the decision. The service calls “ranged from audible alarms, (Absent Without Leave/Runaway Juvenile), gang activity, medical aids, riots, simple assaults, assaults with significant injuries, sexual batteries, thefts and unlawful sex with minors,” according to a memo attached to the report. Deputies also responded to reports of burglary, vandalism and students threatening to jump from rooftops, Bell told the Daily Press. “The problem isn't so much the kids,” Bell said. “We understand these are kids that need a unique learning setting. We’re all for that. But there are other schools that serve these type of kids without any issues. The problem seems to be the staff can’t control the kids. “So they call us … That’s why we’re here, but we don’t see that type of volume anywhere else. It’s a drain on our resources.” Twenty-two criminal reports were filed and eight arrests were made during the nearly 15-month span, according to Bell. On April 14, during a meeting with Bell and Deputy Chief Lana Tomlin, Bright Futures officials received the report and a letter from Town Manager Frank Robinson detailing reasons for the revocation, including failure to provide a safe school environment. Bright Futures Chief Operating Officer Pamela Lamberth called the report misleading, however. “I’m not saying there aren’t issues,” she said, “but the copy (of the report) we got doesn’t tell much of anything. Follow-up calls are added as individual calls and it also counts 39 false alarms. It looks like there’s more calls. The report is a bit inflated.” Bell disagreed: “If the problem was false alarms, we wouldn’t have had that meeting (with Bright Futures officials). That’s not the purpose for the license being revoked. It’s the criminal activity and the lack of control.” Citing the academy’s use of local vendors for school supplies, repairs and short-term housing for teachers, Lamberth and President Betti Colucci urged the town to keep the business license active and proposed a plan to “reduce calls to the Town’s police department” in an appeal letter. Hiring a full-time deputy for the campus (which would cost about $204,000 annually, according to Bell), as well as an after-hours security guard, and attending meetings with the Council and Sheriff’s Department were included in the plan. In addition to forcing the academy out of Apple Valley, the revocation would short St. Timothy’s Episcopal Church — which leases the facility to Bright Futures — $1.8 million, according to Lamberth. “This is going to close that church down,” she said. “That’s really bothersome to me.” St. Timothy’s Clerk of the Vestry Jeanne Bryson told the Daily Press a contract with the academy provides 60 percent of the church’s operating budget, but she stopped short of agreeing the church would close as a result of Bright Futures losing its business license. “The church would have to find another tenant for sure,” she said. “Exactly how long that would take is hard to say, but it would cause some hardship because that source of income would be gone until we found another tenant.” Bright Futures contracts with Apple Valley Unified School District, among others, to provide year-round care, special education and behavioral services to students “with exceptional needs that can’t be met in a public school setting,” according to the appeal letter. The academy has operated in the High Desert for 25 years, first in Victorville before relocating to Apple Valley in December 2015. Two other campuses exist in Riverside and Twentynine Palms. “Of the 78 students enrolled at Apple Valley, about 65 attend daily,” the appeal letter shows. “Approximately half of these students have autism and intellectual disabilities, and the remainder have emotional disturbance or learning disabilities … We have never had a citation or license issue.” Those enrollment numbers made the situation “more severe” for Bell. “They’re open from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., Monday through Friday,” he said. “(That’s) 30 hours a week, and we’re getting these types of calls for service. I thought they’d have a couple hundred kids.” But Bryson defended the academy, which moved into its current location following the abrupt shutdown of St. Timothy’s Preparatory School in 2015 after 48 years. “(T)here seems to be a movement to force (Bright Futures) to leave Apple Valley because of the kids they serve,” Bryson wrote in an email. “The school has the complete support of the Desert/Mountain Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA), as well as the Special Education Departments at the local schools. The students they serve are all local students, including residents of Apple Valley.” Lamberth said a request was made to have deputies speak with students in an attempt to mitigate service calls, but was told the visits wouldn’t be possible due to low staffing at the Apple Valley station. Bell challenged that claim. “We told them absolutely, but we’d have to work out the timing,” he said. “In Public Affairs we have deputies whose job is to go to schools and talk about anti-bullying and staying out of gangs. That’s a resource available to them, but this request came only after they got word from the town that they would revoke the business license.” Town spokesperson Kathie Martin said the Council is aware of the matter, but has taken no action or position on Bright Futures’ business license. “The next step is the appeal to the Town Council,” Martin said. An appeal hearing has not yet been scheduled. Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254. Follow him on Twitter @DP_MatthewCabe.

However, does the new lower cost of the 128GB iPad mini 4 make it a compelling purchase? This review will look at the iPad mini 4 and give buyers advice on whether it’s worth the price even at the lower cost. The iPad mini 4 first showed up back in September 2015 and then got a lot of attention. Since it’s original launch, Apple hasn’t updated it or added new features. However, they did recently drop the 32GB model and offer the 128GB iPad mini 4 for $399, $100 less than it used to cost. We decided to take a second look at the tablet. Should potential iPad buyers opt for the cheaper mini or go with the new 2017 iPad just introduced at an even lower price of $329? iPad mini 4 v. 2017 iPad The iPad mini 4 has a nice 7.9-inch display with a 2048 x 1536 resolution. That’s 326 pixels per inch (ppi). It’s a beautiful bright display with a colorful look delivering faithful color rendering. The new 2017 iPad has the same resolution as the iPad mini 4, which means it has a lower pixel-per-inch resolution. It only delivers 264ppi making it less crisp, in theory. I couldn’t tell a big difference between the two despite the pixel per inch difference. The smaller iPad uses older A8 and M8 processors while the new iPad enjoys faster speed with Apple’s A9 and M9 processors. They’re both 64-bit, so they’ll work fine with the new 64-bit only iOS coming out later this year. They both include 2GB of memory to run programs. The new 2017 iPad sells for $329 with only 32GB of storage built-in. The larger iPad offers a smaller 32GB storage option at the base price of $329. The 128GB model costs $429 making it just $30 more than the 128GB iPad mini 4. The older iPad mini 4 drops the 32GB model and starts at $399 for 128GB of storage. The speed difference between the two iPads doesn’t show up in daily use and in the basic apps that I used. The newer larger iPad does boot a couple of seconds faster than the iPad mini 4. Most people won’t notice enough of a speed increase to matter. The iPad mini 4 weighs 299 grams while the larger 2017 iPad weighs 469 grams making it just over 50% heavier. The new 2017 iPad measures 7.5mm compared to 6.1mm for the iPad mini 4. Those numbers mean that the bigger iPad does weigh more and feel thicker, but not enough to make that a serious consideration. The screen size will matter. The larger 9.7-inch screen makes it easier to see the same thing on the screen compared to 7.9-inches in the iPad mini 4. However, it will feel bigger and might offer less convenience for reading in bed at night or carrying around. Smaller means more portability, while bigger means easier viewing of video, images and text. iPad mini 4: Hardware Design I love using an 8-inch tablet for reading, quick Internet browsing and checking email. I especially love using it for taking notes in meetings or classroom settings at professional development training workshops. It’s small and convenient. A good fine-tip stylus like the Adonit Dash 2 ($49.99 direct) works almost as well as the Apple Pencil on the iPad Pro. Apple sells the iPad mini 4 in Silver, Space Grey and Gold. I prefer the more conservative Space Gray look. Apple put the fast and reliable Touch ID Home button on the iPad mini 4. It’s quick and easy to open the iPad with it. The boring iPad design won’t get anyone excited anymore. We’re used to the rectangular slabs of glass, metal and plastic. The brushed aluminum edges with rounded corners feel good in your hands. Like all Apple tablet and phone designs, it screams quality and efficiency. The buttons for power along the top right corner and volume along the upper right edge feel sturdy. They should last and in my experience don’t wear out after normal usage even after more than a year of usage. I’ve only had this iPad for a short time, but it feels no different from other iPads I’ve owned for more than a year. Fortunately, we still get a headphone/mic combo port on the left end of the top edge. Sound is great through the headphones and adequate using the speakers along the bottom edge. Apple still maddeningly uses their proprietary Lightning port for charging and syncing. It’s a USB-C world and they need to change to the new standard especially since, they’ve added the faster and more reliable USB port to their MacBooks. iPad mini 4: Camera Not many people will use their iPad camera as much as their iPhone or smartphone camera. Apple gave the iPad mini a decent 8MP camera. It’s not the same as the iPhone 7 or 7 Plus camera, but it’s still pretty good for a tablet. Taking photos with a large 7.9-inch electronic view finder feels more satisfying than one might think. It’s easy to hold the iPad mini for stable shots since you can grip it with two hands. The camera app offers the following useful features: HDR Square shots Panorama Video When you finish shooting photos, you can use the built-in editing features to improve them. Apple offers a great system where third-party apps can add editing features to the built-in camera app to enhance photo editing. I use my tablet camera to scan handouts in meetings. Grab a snap of the page and import it into your note taking app. Grab a shot of the whiteboard to save class notes or meeting brainstorming sessions. The iPad mini 4 camera excels at this. Apple iPad offers the best tablet camera available. That makes it useful if you have to use it to get snapshots or scan documents. iPad mini 4: Bottom Line The iPad mini 4 easily wins the award as the best overall 8-inch tablet. It’s not the least expensive and other tablets might prove themselves a better option for some people. For example, if you mostly want to read books and watch video on Amazon or Netflix, get the Amazon Kindle, which costs about one-eighth the price of the $400 128GB iPad mini 4. However, almost everyone else should opt for the iPad mini 4. People heavily invested in Android might want to consider something like the smaller Samsung Galaxy Tab S2. The new Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 tablet doesn’t come in the smaller 8-inch size. Budget conscious buyers who want more than a digital reading device (Kindle) should look at either the iPad mini 4 or the new 2017 iPad. If you want a smaller and more portable tablet, then go with the mini. However, if you want something bigger, obviously go with the new iPad. The mini costs only $30 less than the new 2017 iPad with128GB, so price isn’t much of a concern. If you won’t install many apps, then the cheaper 32GB 2017 iPad will save you $70 over the 128GB iPad mini. We don’t recommend that you buy that one since it fills up quickly. I own both, but I’m returning my iPad mini 4 to the store. I like the larger screen and faster processor. In all other ways, they’re nearly identical so get the size you want and you’ll enjoy it. They’re both great tablets. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

And making all those iPhones, MacBooks and tablets takes an enormous amount of energy. That’s why it’s a big deal when Apple says it wants to be the greenest company on Earth. The company launched a massive clean energy program in October 2015. The goal was to convert all of its energy use in China to clean power sources. Apple clobbered past that goal and is now working toward 100% renewable energy worldwide. “In 2016, 96 percent of the electricity used at our global facilities came from renewable energy, reducing our carbon emissions by nearly 585,000 metric tons. We’re 100 percent renewable in 24 countries — and all of Apple’s data centers,” Lisa Jackson, Apple Vice president of environment policy, said in an annual letter released earlier this year. Jackson served as the administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency from 2009 to 2013. To go fully green, Apple has said it plans to “generate and source from more than 4 gigawatts of new clean energy worldwide by 2020,” according to a document released this month. So far, Apple is less than a quarter of the way toward its 4 gig goal, the equivalent of the energy needed to power about 4 million homes. It currently has 485 megawatts of wind and solar projects installed across China. The company also said last September that it’s committed to making sure all of the companies that supply parts to Apple follow its lead. Seven of Apple’s suppliers have already committed to going 100% renewable by 2018. Related: Why it’s really hard to pitch a green energy startup Not to mention Apple’s new corporate headquarters, Apple Park, will be powered solely by renewables. And to save trees, the company says 99% of the paper used in product packaging is from recycled materials. Tom Murrary — the vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund’s EDF+Business initiative — praised Apple’s efforts. He says Apple has been a leading player in sustainable initiatives, and now more than 70 companies have followed suit by committing to use only renewable energy sources. “For companies like Apple, usually 80 percent or more of the carbon footprint is in the supply chain. That’s why its critical that Apple is looking beyond its own operations and working with suppliers to become 100 percent renewable as well,” he said. 40.712784 -74.005941 Trademark and Copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Ten things we've learnt about this year's phones Posted on 23-Apr-2017 13:10 by Bill Bennett | Filed under: Articles : Bill Bennett Phone designers are running out of options. This years phones show less innovation than in years past.   Samsungs Galaxy S8 goes on sale this week. The early 2017 phone picture is now complete. We now know what the mainstream phone market will look like until Apple reveals its iPhone plans. Here are ten things weve learnt about the state of the phone market: 1. Samsung fans are forgiving, maybe too forgivingYou couldnt step on a plane at the end of last year with cabin crew reminding you of problems with the Samsung Note 7. Every safety announcement told passengers it was dangerous. The Note 7s exploding battery was news for weeks. The tech business has rarely seen such damaging publicity. It seems Samsung raced the product out before completing testing. According to Ben Bajarin at techpinions that bad publicity is not enough to stop todays Samsung owners from considering the Galaxy S8. 2. S8 aint done until Bixby runsBixby is Samsungs voice-controlled virtual assistant. If it works it will rival Apples Siri, Googles Assistant and Amazons Alexa. Samsung says Bixby is different because it strings tasks together. It then manages complex tasks the others cant. Among other things, Bixby can wrap-up and send your most recently taken photo to, say, your partner. It promises to hunt down, then stream a specific video to a Samsung TV set. Soon after announcing the S8 Samsung said Bixby features will not all be available on day one. Unfinished software is not on a par with unfinished and unsafe battery designs. Yet it seems Samsung hasnt learned all the important lessons from the Note 7. If the signature feature of a new phone isnt ready by launch, you might wonder if Samsung still cuts corners. Will anything else emerge, Note 7-like, after the launch? 3. The case of the disappearing bezelBezel is the name given to the rim around a phones screen. All phone makers have reduced the size of their bezels in recent models. Huawei and Oppos 2017 phones have tiny bezels. Samsung has taken this almost to the logical extreme. There is almost no bezel on the Galaxy S8. The front is almost all glass. In practice this means two things. First, you get more screen in a smaller package. The display on the Galaxy S8 is larger than the display on the Apple iPhone 7 Plus. Yet the S8 is roughly the same size as the non-Plus iPhone 7. 4. Much ado about fingerprint scanner placementPut Note 7 fires and Bixby to one side for a moment. What is the main aspect of the Galaxy S8 that every phone reviewer wants to discuss? Is it the camera technology, the processor speed or large 5.8-inch screen? Its none of these. Almost every review mention Samsungs decision to move the fingerprint scanner. A smaller bezel on the phones front means theres no room for a fingerprint scanner. Samsung moved it to the rear of the phone. Using the S8 fingerprint scanner is now a little more uncomfortable and a touch more awkward. Both points are true. It says a lot about phone innovation that reviewers focus on fingerprint scanner placement. 5. Cameras, cameras, camerasEvery phone maker at every launch says their latest model has the best camera on the market. Ive been to five launches in the six months or so and have heard five different phone makers make that claim. They cant all be right. For what its worth, all premium phones have great cameras. They can all take excellent pictures in the right circumstances. Exactly what makes up the right circumstances varies a little from brand to brand. To a degree the camera innovation battle has moved on from hardware to software. At least four of the five big phone brands now offer some form of software-generated bokeh effect. 1 6. Enough with the fashion paradesSo far this year Samsung, Huawei and Oppo have all had big splashy phone launches with a fashion theme. Each launch included beautiful people from the fashion world. Oppo took this furthest with a Sydney Harbour boat cruise. It featured lurid coloured cocktails, a DJ and fashion models cat posing with phones. A fashion-industry big wig made a speech. She told boat passengers to throw their iPhones overboard and replace it with an Oppo. Its worth pointing out that fashion-themed phone launches are not new. LG held a similar event in Auckland 10 years ago. The message, in case you didnt get it, is that premium smart phones are fashion items. 7. Hardware innovation slows in 2017 phonesRelated to the fashion metaphor is the fetish with phone colours. There are different shades of black, metallic blues, greens and reds and so on. Again, weve been here before with premium phones. In a sense modern phones have reached the point American cars got to in the 1960s. Then Detroit covered cars in chrome and added tail fins. They did this to create the impression of innovation where, in fact, there was little new. Innovation isnt quite dead in the phone business, but it has slowed to a crawl. The fact that people fuss over the fingerprint scanner tells you that. Almost every hardware improvement in the last year has been incremental, cosmetic or unimportant. Screen resolution passed the point where the human eye could notice a different a few years ago. Its been even longer since a phone processor wasnt fast enough for all everyday tasks. 8. The price isnt rightPremium phone price have climbed faster than inflation. This isnt because of currency effects, phone prices are going up everywhere. In part this is because phone makers did not make much profit in the past. Although Apple has always enjoyed a good margin. Even Samsung struggled at times to earn a decent amount from selling hardware. In 2013 the Samsung Galaxy S4 cost NZ$1150 and the 16GB iPhone 5S was $1050. Today the cheapest iPhone 7 is $1430 and the bottom of the range Galaxy S8 is $1300. You can go all the way to $1830 with Apple or $1500 with Samsung. You can argue that you get more phone, or at least more memory and more screen. But thats not the point, it now costs Apple fans over 30 percent more to buy the least expensive iPhone. Samsung customers pay around 20 percent more. Huawei has pushed its prices up even faster. Four years ago it made bargain basement phones, today the P10 is NZ$1000 and the Mate 9 is $1100. Bucking the trend Oppos $700 R9s has most of the features found in a Samsung phone for almost half the price. Theres a huge opportunity for a brand selling good phone hardware at that price. 9. Everyone has a phoneAlmost every person in the rich world who wants a modern mobile phone now has one. This means phone sales have slowed to a crawl compared with the past decade. It also means phone makers rely on shortening the upgrade cycle to turn over more product. That keeps the money rolling in. There is one big problem with that 10. There are few compelling reasons to upgradeTodays premium phones are good. When it comes to practical functionality they are not much better than the handsets on offer two years ago. Most of the changes in that time have made little difference to an owners everyday life. There are always going to be performance obsessed geeks who argue for some esoteric reason they need an even faster processor. But in reality, its been a long time since phones were slow in everyday use. Likewise, any new hardware feature, is often only of interest to a minority. Few people will hold onto phones for, say, 10 years, as they do with PCs. Apart from anything else, they take a physical beating day-in, day-out and get dropped or otherwise worn out after a few years. Most users who are not on plans have already moved away from annual or bi-annual phone upgrades. In the future more of us are likely to hang-on to devices for even longer. I cant remember if Sony or Oppo mentioned anything about blurred image backgrounds. Apple, Samsung and Huawei all did. ??Ten things weve learnt about this years phones was first posted at billbennett.co.nz Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Trending now » Hot discussions in our forums right now: The President Of The USA: Donald Trump Created by TimA, last reply by Fred99 on 24-Apr-2017 17:41 (4044 replies) ... 268 269 270 The case for mandatory internet filtering Created by shanehobson, last reply by freitasm on 24-Apr-2017 10:26 (66 replies) ... 3 4 5 New Immigration Changes Created by Oriphix, last reply by joker97 on 21-Apr-2017 21:01 (40 replies) ... 2 3 Belkin Wemo Light Switch - I want to buy but who has them?

Apple Fanboys have always claimed that a lot of Android device owners did not buy their devices by choice- they are just poor and could not afford the iPad and iPhone heaven. Under all that clamouring and FOSS ideology lies a secret desire to own an Apple device-they say. Thanks to a new piece of software called Cider, Android users might just be able to install some iOS apps on their Android devices thus at least sating part of that secret desire. Before you get all excited, you should know that the software is just a prototype and the creators have said that they have no intention to commercialize it. The six PhD graduate students from Colombia who created the software said they did so as part of a research to bypass current restrictions on tablets and smartphones. They cite two drawbacks of such restrictions: “Users who want to run iOS gaming apps on their smartphones are stuck with the smaller screen sizes of those devices. Users who prefer the larger selection of hardware form factors available for Android are stuck with the poorer quality and selection of Android games available compared to the well populated Apple App Store.” “Android users cannot access the rich multimedia content available in Apple iTunes, and iOS users cannot easily access Flash-based Web content.” They feel this is stifling innovation and depriving users of choice as some App publishers simply choose to target one platform because of resource restrictions. For example much as I would like to test Office for iPad I am stuck with a poor half-hearted imitation from the Play Store because I am unwilling to spend money buying a mobile device that will cost me three full grown cows! advertisement Cider Vodoo From the mumbo jumbo in the research paper Cider sounds a lot like WINE which allows MAC and Linux users to run PC software by providing the requisite API calls. “Cider enhances the domestic operating system,Android, of a device with kernel-managed, per-thread personas to mimic the application binary interface of a foreign operating system, iOS, enabling it to run unmodified foreign binaries.” Whatever this means it allows you to run iOS apps on your Android device. It’s not going to be in the Play Store in our lifetime. Cider was presented last month at APPLOS 2014 in a presentation titled Cider: Native Excution of iOS Apps on Android by Jeremy Andrus and his colleagues. They made a functional version of the software and tested a couple of Apps including Papers for iOS, Passmark benchmark and the Calculator for iPad but for now it remains just that-research. There are a lot of hurdles to be cleared if the software is going to become publicly available. Besides swatting the bugs and releasing the alphas and betas there are our friends from Cupertino California to deal with. If there were willing to sue people for rounded corners and bouncy features one wonders how they would react if Cider were to be released. We know how Apple loves to bilk, cheat and overcharge its customers via the Apple store and God forbid if someone was to introduce a way for users to circumvent that and allow Apple users to access the wider ebook world of Android for example. For now the researchers have said that they have no intention of commercialising the software despite the positive tone from their paper. Maybe someone got to them or maybe it means they are just going to release the software as an Open Source project. I hope it is the latter and I am anxiously waiting to get my hands on the software and take it for a spin. Picture Credit: Mashable Enjoyed this article?

And the company has set some lofty goals for itself. The company has a few long-term ambitions, such as stopping mining altogether and getting its entire supply chain to switch to 100% renewable energy, for one. But Apple‘s efforts are already underway, with some impressive steps to be had. For starters, it said that seven major suppliers have pledged to power their Apple production line with 100% renewable energy by the end of 2018. It also revealed progress in the packaging department. “To preserve precious resources, over 99 percent of the paper in our product packaging is from recycled or responsibly managed sources. And, in only two years, through partnerships with the Conservation Fund and World Wildlife Fund, we have achieved our goal of protecting or creating enough sustainably managed working forests to cover all of our product packaging needs.” Apple is embracing the use of its Liam robot to disassemble iPhone 6 handsets Apple also shed light on its initiatives to reduce reliance on mining, with the previously revealed Liam robot being one of these solutions. The robot was designed specifically to quickly disassemble iPhone 6 devices for recycling purposes. “For example, we’ve melted down iPhone 6 aluminum enclosures recovered from Liam to make Mac mini computers for use in our factories, and we’re transitioning to 100 percent recycled tin solder on the main logic board of iPhone 6s.” The company also revealed that with two Liam lines running, they can disassemble 2.4 million iPhones a year. Apple also said that for every 100 000 iPhone 6 devices, Liam has the potential to recover 1900 kilograms of aluminium, 800 kilograms of copper, 300 grams of gold, 400 grams of “platinum group metals”, seven kilograms of silver, 55 kilograms of tin, 24 kilograms of rare earth elements, 550 kilograms of cobalt, 3.5 kilograms of tungsten and 2.5 kilograms of tantalum. Otherwise, Apple says it will also be encouraging people to recycle devices via its Apple Renew programme.

Review: Gamemaker 2 Why Understanding Food Serving Sizes Is Important For Weight Loss Why Does Every Car Infotainment System Look So Crappy? Thorin Klosowski Apr 24, 2017, 1:00pm ⋅ Filed to:  bluetooth cars driving infotainment rants updates Share Cadillac has perhaps the ugliest option of the bunch User interface design is hard, but we've been getting better at it over the years to the point where even a thermostat is easy to use. Automakers, however, seem to have their heads in the sand, taking their design inspiration for their infotainment consoles from old Winamp skins instead of any type of modern interface. I've been car shopping recently, which means I've sat in a variety of models new and old with a salesperson attempting to justify why their shitty infotainment system — the little dashboard that usually controls at least the radio and phone options — is better than the competition. Pair that up with a number of rentals over the years and I've seen about every car infotainment system around. With a couple very rare exceptions, they're universally horrible and feel like they're designed by someone who hasn't used a computer since 2000. Most automakers have their own brand of infotainment systems and their bad design is more than skin deep. For example, Audi has MMI, an insane system that uses dials for menu navigation instead of a touchscreen unless you pay to upgrade it. Audi isn't the only one to eschew modern innovation either, BMW's iDrive and Mercedes's Comand both rely on dials for input as well. For years, Lexus has relied on what was basically a mouse for navigation which is as insanely stupid and challenging to use in real life as it sounds. Most carmakers at least use touch screens, though their interfaces are cluttered and ugly. Ford has SYNC, Nissan has Connect, Toyota has Entune, Kia has UVO, Subaru has STARLINK, and so on and so on. As an example, here's Entune one of the worst options, which looks more at home on a laptop running Windows ME than it does in a brand new car: Or look at this insane mess of nonsense, from Cadillac's CUE: On most of these infotainment systems, the menus seem devoid of logic, settings you need to access frequently are often buried beneath several submenus, and when there is a touch screen, they seem sluggish and clunky. There is a 100% you will need to look in the manual to change a very basic setting. Even something simple, like icon design, is the worst. The icons on Chevy's MyLink look like they were pulled from a cheap clipart collection: On most of infotainment systems you'll find horrible icons that are probably included free with MS Word, weird fonts that don't suit the screen's size, and app integration for services that I'm pretty sure nobody actually uses. Like, who goes to movietickets.com and why would I use whatever Aha radio is? After sitting in a bunch of cars, I was actually longing for classic Winamp. Heck, cram this into a Toyota's center console and I'll buy it today: I'm not going to even touch on how bad the navigation systems included with these things are, but rest assured, they're as horrible as you remember. For whatever reason, classic car GPS systems have been behind smartphone options for a long time, and even if it didn't take 35 minutes to type an address into one of those things, there's a very good chance that all you'll see on the screen is a pixelated blown-up mess of a map that's near impossible to read. It's not all bad news, of course. Tesla at least seems to be on the right track, though the 17-inch touchscreen includes in their cars is so comically large that I imagine it's a huge distraction. Not that I'd know, since I can't even afford to sit in a Tesla let alone drive one. Volvo also seems on the right track with Sensus, which for some oddball reason is a vertical screen instead of horizontal, but is otherwise the minimally designed interface that you'd want in a four ton moving vehicle. It's easy to use, you can customise it to a small extent, and it's generally inoffensive. It's also brand spanking new though, and the previous Volvo systems weren't much to look at. Then there's Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which feel like what happens when the carmakers give up on their own systems and just let someone else make it. Both options leverage the power of the phone you already use for music and navigation to power the car's infotainment options as well. This comes with its own set of pros and cons. Android Auto and CarPlay are pretty much universally improvements to automaker's awful first-party infotainment options, but they still have some issues. Namely, apps have to actually support the two services, which means that you can't always access every app. For example, with CarPlay, you're locked into mostly first-party Apple apps, like Apple Maps. For iOS users, this is a huge downside, because even though Apple Maps has improved over the years, it's still not as good as Google Maps or Waze. Thankfully, you're not locked into Apple Music or Apple Podcasts at least, as Spotify, Pandora, Pocket Casts, Overcast, and others support CarPlay. Android Auto is a little better, but still pretty limited in the third-party options you have. With either option, there's a good chance at least one of the apps you use for audio won't work with it. One minor quibble with both is that you'll still need to actually use your car's shitty infotainment system occasionally, as neither CarPlay nor Android Auto can handle any car-wide settings changes. Still, both are an improvement, and if nothing else is at least a sign that automakers have given up entirely on trying to force their awfully designed systems down our throats. But still, not everyone has an iPhone or Android device, and not everyone wants to link up their phone to their car stereo in the first place. No matter what, these car infotainment systems and their stupid names will be a part of lives for years to come, so it'd be nice if they could at least look like they were designed in the last decade. We don't need much here! Just don't nest menus deep inside other submenus, hand over your icon design to an actual designer instead of snagging some icon from Shutterstock, use large buttons that are easy to tap while driving, and spend a few extra bucks to give the whole thing a modern sheen so it doesn't look straight out of 1998. Look, I know this is hard and expensive to do. I know that cars often only have ancient hardware in them that can't run much more than a text interface. I know this is near the bottom of the list of priorities in cars, but maybe it's time to move it up a bit. Heck, you could even cut off access to any setting that could get me killed if I adjusted it wrong, then open up the entertainment portion Linux-style so I can install whatever I want on there. If nothing else, it'd be nice to at least have OS upgrade option so that I could at least have hope of change.

It also evolves overtime so it can get updated much more regularly than the inbuilt system. When my wife plugs in her iPhone, it isn't great (First party map support only etc) however the potential here is massive. Reply 1 soutarm @soutarm Apr 24, 2017, 1:44pm My mum recently bought a new Holden thing, looks like a tiny SUV pretending to be a sneaker. Anyway, the inbuilt system is hilariously bad, same thing you're talking about here. My mum was having trouble accessing the GPS too until she figured out that while there was a button for the GPS the car didn't actually have one, you had to link your phone to it through some magic crap. She ended up buying a new iPhone just to use the car's GPS. Reply 1 psyartisan @psyartisan Apr 24, 2017, 1:58pm Mazda make beautiful cars but their stereos from the basic Mazda 2 through to the premium CX-5 are an absolute disgrace. Bluetooth support is unreliable, drops out, and has very poor audio quality. Their own voice recognition system interrupts Apple's Siri and there is no simple way to trigger Siri (which often fails anyway because their own system interrupts!). It's grotesque that in 2017 that Mazda can't properly support one of the most popular phones on the planet. Reply 1 Sparhawk Guest Apr 24, 2017, 1:59pm I gave up and just use Android Auto directly on my phone. It starts automatically when the Bluetooth connection makes, so all I have do do is place it in the dock. The head unit is then just for volume control.

(Photo by Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images for RFK Human Rights)    Tim Cook Once Thought He Caught Uber Spying On iPhone Users. So He Called For A Meeting Eric Lieberman Tech and Law Reporter 10:42 PM 04/23/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5610590 Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly threatened to remove Uber from its App Store when he found out the company tracked customers’ whereabouts even after they deleted the app. “So, I’ve heard you’ve been breaking some of our rules,” Cook calmly told Uber CEO Travis Kalanick during a 2015 meeting, according to Mike Isaac of The New York Times. Cook was unhappy with Kalanick for tracking customers by surreptitiously pinpointing and tagging iPhones even after the app was deleted. Kalanick was reportedly unnerved, perhaps worried that his carefully crafted business could be completely upended if Cook cut off his access to millions of current and potential users. “Travis’s biggest strength is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals,” said Mark Cuban, the billionaire investor and occasional mentor of Kalanick, according to The NYT. Uber, though, vehemently refutes that they are doing something illegal, immoral, or out of the ordinary. “We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they’ve deleted the app. As the New York Times story notes towards the very end, this is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone—over and over again,” a representative for Uber told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “Similar techniques are also used for detecting and blocking suspicious logins to protect our users’ accounts. Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back onto our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users.” Isaac of The NYT conceded over Twitter that a number of other companies engage in similar, if not the same, practices. The tech reporter even Tweeted he would add clarification to the article to ensure he was not causing confusion. Kalanick’s aggressively creative and audacious tactics have led to scandals for the ride-sharing startup many times in the recent months. Uber has been accused of operating at least three invasive spy programs on riders and regulators with programs referred to as “God View” (or “Heaven”), “Hell,” and “Greyball.” The Heaven software would allow workers (usually at a higher level) to track riders without their permission. The company eventually agreed to pay a $20,000 penalty and change its privacy and security protocol, after the New York attorney general’s office launched an official investigation. A whistleblower alleged the company would use Heaven to “track high profile politicians, celebrities, and even personal acquaintances of Uber employees, including ex-boyfriends/girlfriends, and ex-spouses.” Do You Think Uber Is Telling The Truth?   Yes         No        Login with your social identity to vote Sign out.

Greyball, a secretive proprietary tool of Uber’s, would use data gathered from the Uber app to identify and elude officials who sought to catch it in the act of providing its service, according to another march report from The NYT. The program would allow the company to detect and evade undercover law enforcement authorities and regulators, as well as pinpointing competitors who were aggressively trying to disrupt its platform. Uber, at the time, did not deny its existence. The company defended the practice, saying it deterred competitors and regulators from entrapping drivers with secret sting operations. Uber also used the Hell program, which would allegedly create fake Lyft passenger accounts with locations dispersed across a certain area to track as many of the company’s drivers as possible. Uber reportedly wanted data on its main competitors, including its pricing, how many drivers were available, and who was working for both companies. Such spying schemes not only embody the general theme of Uber’s general business conduct — doing whatever it takes to survive and thrive in the ride-hailing market — but also why Cook chose to confront Kalanick.

Still a long way off the often mooted all-Apple ‘iCar’ that has been suggested previously, Business Insider reveals instead that the unlikely combination of a Lexus RX 450h and a Logitech video gaming wheel and pedal set mark Apple’s first step into vehicle control systems. As cartoonish as it sounds, the Apple Autonomous System is the genesis of a potential multi-billion dollar revenue stream for Apple, and will help bring the company up to speed with Google’s Waymo self-driving program, as well as OEM systems from BMW, Mercedes-Benz, General Motors and other carmakers. Californian law states that for vehicles to be tested on public roads under its permit program a human driver must be in the vehicle, and must be able to assume control of the vehicle at any stage, overriding the autonomous system. Lexus RX 450h Training documents provided to Apple staff indicate potential system failures like the car not following lane markings, not following its indicated direction, or unable to maintain its speed - and the recommended course of action, usually assuming control of steering or braking to assume manual control. Images provided with the documents show that rather than using the factory installed (and physically connected) steering wheel and brake pedal, Apple has fitted a second steering wheel and pedal set in the back seat, from computer peripheral supplier Logitech, tapping into the by-wire driving systems developed by Apple, not Lexus. The permit application documents deal with the safety aspects and rules of human intervention, but don’t divulge technical details of Apple’s systems, sensors, connectivity, or other changes to the Lexus vehicles nominated for the trial fleet. Further details about Apple’s automotive program, including the likelihood of an Apple-branded car or EV are still (as is so often the case from the tech giant) shrouded in mystery, but with public testing about to occur more details of Apple’s plan are sure to follow in short order.

LG and Samsung already have their guns ablazing and, in just a few months, so too will Apple. And because there’s still a lot of time before that happens, there’s plenty of time for leaks of what the iPhone 8 could look like. This latest photo dump supposedly doesn’t come from mere schematics. According to Benjamin Geskin, Foxconn confirmed that these are CNC dummy models of what we’ll soon gawk at as the iPhone 8, in all its shiny, glassy glory. Much of the iPhone 8 “models” we’ve seen so far have been of schematics or renders based on those schematics. These photos seem to match most, if not all, of what we’ve seen so far and, if Foxconn is on the mark, then this could very well be the final form of the iPhone 8. Give or take a few features. There is no head-on view of the screen itself, but we can pretty much see it’s almost all screen on the front. There’s just a hint of nothing but a speaker grille at the top. No visible fingerprint scanner, front or back. Which means either Apple as indeed been able to develop that under-the-screen sensor or the iPhone 8 won’t have Touch ID at all. The back is also clean as a whistle, missing even the iconic Apple logo in at least one incarnation. It could, of course, simply be an early version of the dummy model. One other dummy does have the cutout. The very black glass back curves at the edges in typical 2.5D fashion, with front and back joined together by an aluminum edge. This could bring back memories of the iPhone 4. Geskin also shares familiar schematics of the iPhone 8. That includes the “hidden” row of sensors at the top and the vertically arranged dual cameras at the bottom. New, however, is a small circle right beside the LED flash, indicating the possible location of the noise-canceling mic.

It was his favorite setting for thought. Apple Park captures his spirit uncannily well,” said Laurene Powell Jobs. “He would have flourished, as the people of Apple surely will, on this luminously designed campus.” “Steve invested so much of his energy creating and supporting vital, creative environments. We have approached the design, engineering and making of our new campus with the same enthusiasm and design principles that characterize our products,” said Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer. “Connecting extraordinarily advanced buildings with rolling parkland creates a wonderfully open environment for people to create, collaborate and work together. We have been extremely fortunate to be able to work closely, over many years, with the remarkable architectural practice Foster + Partners.” CategoriesUncategorized TagsPress Release Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Apple Reports Record First Quarter Results Next PostNext Apple introduces iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition Search Recent Posts DJI Introduces Ronin 2, A More Powerful, Versatile and Intelligent Stabilizer for Film and Video Professionals Tianzhou-1 docked to Tiangong-2 space station Progressing Cavity Pumps Market Manufacturers Sales, Price, Revenue, Gross Margin and Share Analysis in 2017 Report at ReportsnReports Act Now – Shareholder Alert: Monteverde & Associates PC Announces An Investigation Of C.R.

This year, through its partnership with WWF in China, Apple has transitioned approximately 320,000 acres of forest in China toward Forest Stewardship Council certification. This advancement means, in just two years, the company has now reached its goal of protecting and creating enough sustainably managed forests to cover all its packaging needs. Apple’s forestry work is just the beginning of its efforts to conserve the world’s precious resources. The company also announced the ambitious goal of creating a closed loop supply chain, where products are built using only renewable resources or recycled material.

Review: Gamemaker 2 Why Understanding Food Serving Sizes Is Important For Weight Loss Is USB-C Really That Good? Anthony Caruana Apr 24, 2017, 9:30am ⋅ Filed to:  Australian Stories feature usb-c Share As part of my project to find a perfect Windows 10 device for me, I'm currently testing a Dell XPS 13. I'm not going to pre-empt my review as it's still a work in progress. But The Dell, MacBook and several other systems on the market have decided to put all their eggs in the USB-C basket. And that's proving to be an epic pain with suitable devices, cables and other peripherals still relatively hard to get. The case for USB-C There's a lot to like about USB-C connectors. Unlike the more common USB-A, it's an anyway-is-up connector so you don't have to be too careful about which way to poke it into a connector. And it can replace a bunch of other connectors as the one connector is good for power, data and video. So, in theory, you can carry one or two identical cables in your bag and you're set for almost anything. Assuming the cable is well made, the connector is physically robust with no annoying pins to bend or snap. As the connector is very slim, it means devices can be kept slim and therefore easier to carry and a little lighter. The market seems to be the problem The problem I'm finding is many computer makers seem to be of the mind that if a port can do lots of things that you need fewer ports. Apple, of course, is the worst offender with the MacBook with just one port that's meant to manage you peripheral connections, power input and video output. Apple's solution is a very inelegant and expensive array of dongles. Or you can resort to one of the many USB-C docking devices. Or you can buy a bunch of new cables. Neither alternative appeals to me and, as a frequent traveller, dongles and adapters are just one more thing for me to pack and have to keep tabs on when working remotely or organising my kit. Even Apple, who was first to market with USB-C, makes a USB-C to Lightning cable for iPhone connection an extra cost. I'm packing for a week long trip to the US and find myself packing several extra cables and a mini-docking station in order to make sure I can connect something as simple as a USB stick. What should the market do? Apple, Dell and all the other computer makers that offer USB-C only devices should either include USB-C to USB-A adapter or make it a very inexpensive optional accessory - and not $75. At least Dell's option is just $29 - which is still about $24 too much in my view. I know we are in a transitional stage with USB-A connectors still prevalent after a two-decade legacy. But it seems that many hardware makers don't really care and just expect us to re-accessorise completely when we buy a new computer. Perhaps I'm being hypersensitive about this as I'm currently switching computer every week or so so every thing that makes that more difficult tends to get on my nerves a little. Have you had to make the USB-C switch? What were your solutions? WATCH MORE: Tech News Also on Lifehacker Is It Cheaper To Buy A Samsung Galaxy S8 On A Plan Than An iPhone 7? The Best NBN 50 Plans (From ISPs You’ve Never Heard Of) Planhacker: The Best Phone Plans With Rollover Data Comments Cameron @moonhead Apr 24, 2017, 9:46am I don't think USB-A will ever go away, well, not for a very, very long time now. It's been around for far too long, there's far too many legacy devices out there that won't be replaced for a very long time, and even now, new devices are still being made with it. Until all devices change over, you won't even start on the journey of getting rid of USB-A. My main problem with USB-C right now, is the crazy stories and "information" going around about chargers and cables. It seems like you need to spend $50 on a cable to make sure it doesn't burn down your house (according to the ever reliable internet commentators). I don't understand how all of a sudden, changing cables, you've managed to make your chargers these incendiary devices just waiting to get you. That needs to be better cleaned up before more widespread USB-C adoption takes place. Reply 1 Ogre Guest Apr 24, 2017, 10:46am I think there's a bit of confusion here (and it's very widespread). It's not USB-C so much that's the issue, it's the fact that the USB 3.1 and 3.0 allows for delivering 100W as part of the USB Power Delivery spec. It just so happens that USB-C was also added to the standard around the same time, and I think that's where the confusion lies. I'm sure there'd be USB 3.0 Type A-A and Type A-B (both standard and micro sizes) cables out there which could have similar issues, but the cables (and devices with the ports that aren't the full size Type A) weren't as common as Type C is becoming. Anyway, the point is, 100W is a lot of power, and you need to handle that a bit more carefully if you don't like electrical fires :) Reply 0 icarys @icarys Apr 24, 2017, 9:53am There are companies out there making the transition simple.

Moderately annoying, but I got a 3-pack of adaptors from Kogan for $7 that mitigated most of the issue. I figure we're just in a transitional state between the old and new, and it's going to remain mildly annoying for that time. There is bound to be a better solution for laptops than multiple fiddly docks, cables and dongles, though. We need hardware manufacturers to start bragging about how many USB-C ports they can fit on a laptop body, not how many different peripherals you could connect to a single port. Reply 0 darren @darren Apr 24, 2017, 11:05am Love it on phones, it charges nicely and quickly, is satisfying to plug in and it's never the wrong way. I can see it being pretty annoying with a computer, but my current laptop has two old school USB plugs so I'm OK for now. Only thing that ever is used is a mouse. Reply 0 sa_penguin @sa_penguin Apr 24, 2017, 4:35pm Things I have (that need USB-A or even USB-B): Mouse, Wacom pad and stylus, Printer, Scanner, Multiple types of SDR (Software Defined Radio) including HackRF, RSP1, and RTLSDR .

Reply 0 memeweaver @memeweaver Apr 24, 2017, 12:23pm It's the resilience of USB ports on phones and tablets that troubles me.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 80 Plus 1 on G+ 389 Share on Facebook 115 Share on Twitter Total Shares584 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? HSidhu David is Google staff. lol netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. MikeOxlong That's because there was no David Rudduck involvement. Think about it... 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K.

And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

We hope to be opened internationally within the next 3 weeks, will keep you informed! ipsofact LOL I was in a group messaging with 4 other iphones. 1 android. iMessage & RCS do not play well... Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. Hernán Guerra It seems you are under the assumption that Allo messages are not encrypted and Hangouts messages are, which is incorrect. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tomás O’Mertà How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here. Markoff the article doesn't make sense: 1. what's cost benefit splitting Allo hand Duo into two apps? 2. what's cost benefit developing Messenger/Android Messages separately from Allo? mattman723 Tbh I don't mind multiple platforms, I just tell people I'm accessible through any and all methods. I only hate that you cannot "leave" a group SMS. Jadephyre Most people I know that use an iPhone exclusively use Whatsapp, except when needing to send an SMS to people not using any form of smartphone. James Briano Google has no coherent messaging strategy. Their internal teams are either competing with each other, or simply not communicating (maybe they should all get WhatsApp). Recall Google insiders bragging that the Pixel was designed in complete isolation from the Android team. That's nothing to brag about—that's a problem. scy breaking news is a business, of course what it does is about making money, what business isn't?

By Jennifer Dudley-Nicholson 8:32 AM Monday Apr 24, 2017 SHARE: Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Not saved Email Print Banking Mobile Business By now we should be paying for everything with our mobiles, right? Photo / Supplied The technology is ready. Banks know how to use it. Consumers want it now. So just when will we get the digital wallets we've been promised? What seems like a straightforward question with an equally straightforward solution has become mired in ­politics, as tech companies and banks disagree on the right way to deliver convenient mobile payment exper­iences and Australia's competition watchdog and courts are forced to step in to mediate. But there have been small breakthroughs lately in what experts say is a sign that digital services will replace dog-eared wallets and overstuffed purses within years rather than decades. While Google Android phones were first to add secure Near Field Communication chips for digital payments, it was Apple that debuted a branded payment solution in its phones. Apple Pay arrived in the US in 2014, and in Australia the following year. But the service, which securely turns your smartphone into a debit or ­credit card to be tapped at the cash register, was only compatible with ­directly issued American Express credit cards. It's now supported by 48 smaller financial institutions and one of the four big banks, ANZ. Similarly, Google launched its Android Pay service with a host of smaller banks and credit unions, albeit many more of them. ANZ has since joined their ranks. But it's Samsung Pay, the last of the three to launch, that claimed a significant victory this month, slipping Westpac into its digital wallet. Continued below. Related Content Labour MP Stuart Nash apologises over mental health comments Your Views: Readers Letters Tauranga worker must pay $66,681 damages after bidding for contract against employer More than nine million Westpac customers can now use Samsung Pay to buy goods with the tap of a smartphone or a Gear S3 smartwatch, in addition to Citibank and American Express customers. Samsung Australia mobile division vice-president Richard Fink says signing up Westpac means "about a third of the market" can now use Samsung Pay in their smartphones rather than flash the plastic. But he admits launching a digital wallet everyone can use will take time. The big banks are not adopting external payment systems quickly, preferring transactions delivered from their own apps. "It's still a developing space for everyone; for Samsung as a tech­nology provider but also for the banks," Fink says. "The pieces are all falling together. We certainly have been ­engaged with all the big four banks since launch." Westpac's move to Samsung Pay could be the start of a drift from the big financial institutions towards Android-based solutions. It follows their failure to collectively ­bargain for access to payment technology within Apple's iPhone, a move designed to let the banks, including the CBA, NAB and Westpac, deliver their own in-app payments rather than pay transaction fees to use Apple Pay. A spokesman for the group, Lance Blockley, says the case had been "about consumer choice" and ensuring "the course of development for ­mobile wallets in Australia (was not) dictated by a single overseas corporation". "Mobile wallets are currently overwhelmingly focused on mobile payments but will soon take in loyalty programs, mass transit ticketing, access, identity, and a great number of other future innovations," he says. "Ultimately, there is no technical barrier standing in the way of our ­entire physical wallet becoming digital." - news.com.au By Jennifer Dudley-Nicholson Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

NEW YORK: Days after an error led to false iCloud cancellation emails sent to subscribers, Apple has followed up with another note apologising for the bug and reassuring them that their plan remains in good standing. On Wednesday, a number of iCloud users received messages saying their subscription was discontinued. The bug appeared to mostly affect 50GB tier subscribers, a report on Apple insider website said. On Saturday, Apple followed up with the same users to issue an apology. “You recently received an email incorrectly stating that your iCloud storage plan has been discontinued. Your 50GB iCloud storage plan is not affected and will continue to renew automatically,” the tech titan was quoted as saying.

SAN FRANCISCO: Apple Inc outlined a plan to train operators of self-driving cars in documents submitted to California regulators earlier this month, the latest clues to the company’s autonomous vehicle technology aspirations. Apple was granted a permit to test self-driving cars on April 14 by the California Department of Motor Vehicles but the company has never said anything about its plan. The state released 41 pages of Apple application documents to Reuters that give some clues about the company’s highly secret self-driving effort, which it has never openly acknowledged. The iPhone maker joins a long list of car makers, start-ups and technology rivals, including Alphabet’s Waymo, that are testing cars on state roads. Apple is looking for new hit products and autonomous car technology is expected to revolutionise the traditional auto industry. As part of the application, Apple included a 10-page training plan that appeared to be related to operators taking back manual control of the car during automated driving exercises of the system, which it calls a development platform. Apple declined comment beyond the filing. The plan includes a document called “Automated System: Development Platform Specific Training Overview” whose objective is “to train safety drivers in various automated driving conditions.” “Development platform will be controlled electronically (e.g. joystick) and safety drivers must be ready to intervene and take control,” the document reads.

Chris Davies - Apr 23, 2017 12 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit After my Galaxy S8 review, of the most frequent questions I’ve been asked is whether people should buy the new Samsung now, or wait until the new iPhone is revealed later in 2017. Samsung deserves some serious kudos for what it’s done with the latest Galaxy flagship. Not only is the design on a par with the best we’ve seen from Apple’s smartphone team, top-notch specs like the beautiful curved Super AMOLED screen make it just as pleasing to use as to hold. Factor in a proven camera and speedy Android, and you can see why the consensus on the S8 has been that it’s Samsung’s best phone ever. Indeed, with bells & whistles like waterproofing and wireless charging that Apple is still yet to embrace, and the fact that the Galaxy S8 manages to include the 3.5mm headphone jack that proved so controversial in its absence on the iPhone 7, you might think the decision was a no-brainer. That’s certainly the case if you’re an Android user. While Samsung may not have opted for a dual-camera system on the S8 – it looks like we’ll have to wait for the Galaxy Note 8 for that – I’d happily argue that the results from its single lens are at least on a par with what you’d get from a dual-camera Android rival. Factor in the easy upgrade process from one device running Google’s OS to the next, and really the only issue is figuring out whether to go for the 5.8-inch Galaxy S8 or the 6.2-inch S8+. No, the tough decision comes if you’re currently an iOS user. Never before has the allure of jumping ship to Android been so appealing. Problem is, along the way you have to find Android equivalents to the apps you currently use, figure out how you’re going to port across purchased music and video, and potentially re-invest in a whole bunch of accessories because your current Lightning ones won’t work with the S8’s USB-C port. My first inclination is to say “go for it” because there’s no doubt that the S8 offers a compelling alternative to the iPhone 7 today. Indeed, if you simply have to buy a new smartphone right this moment, I’d lean toward the Samsung. Of course, it’s more complex than that: a choice between making your decision based on what we know today, or waiting for Apple’s play to become clear. As problems go, it’s a nice one to have. Do you buy an excellent phone today, or wait a little longer and have the choice between two excellent phones later in the year? Still, while it may be the epitome of a #firstworldproblem, it’s nonetheless a tough decision for someone due an upgrade and maybe considering a jump from one platform to the other. If the rumor mill is to be believed, Apple has some big changes in the works. For the tenth anniversary of iPhone, the so-called “iPhone 8” – which is also being referred to as the “iPhone Anniversary Edition” but which could end up named something else instead – will finally get onboard with waterproofing. It’ll have an iPhone 7 Plus scale display in a more iPhone 7 sized body, courtesy of skinnier bezels and a switch from LCD to AMOLED screen technology. It’ll also do away with the physical home button and use a virtual one hidden behind the display, we’re told. Apple might have even figured out how to include a Touch ID fingerprint sensor behind the AMOLED too, something Samsung is said to have attempted for the S8 but been forced to put on the back-burner. Wireless charging, a faster processor, and new industrial design are also expected. In short, it’ll be a very different device to what we’re familiar with from the iPhone 7 today – and which itself was an evolution rather than a revolution from the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6 before that. Should you be an iOS fan, that might sound like everything you’ve been hoping for. Why would you want to jump ship before it arrives? Honestly, my answer right now really comes down to budget. Yes, Apple is seemingly preparing an incredible new iPhone that we’ll see in just six months time or so, but it won’t be the only model. Instead it’ll be the super-premium option, with the broader market served by what are likely to be the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. As the names suggested, they’re going to be more evolutions of what we’ve already seen. The addition of a third model to the line-up means Apple can charge significantly more for its newest, fanciest flagship. Indeed, $1,000+ is the expected starting price for the iPhone 8, and while that’s not out of line for some, it’s a significant premium over the Galaxy S8 (which, frankly, is at the top end for a modern smartphone already). Some won’t blanch at that premium. Certainly, we won’t be surprised by it: Apple products hardly have the reputation for being cheap. I don’t doubt that the iPhone 8 will do plenty for its price, too. NOW READ: Samsung Galaxy S8 Review Will it do more then the Galaxy S8 does, however? That I’m not convinced by, and if you’re not thoroughly wedded to iOS then suddenly the Samsung starts looking like the more cost-savvy selection. In short, while I could well understand you choosing to wait it out and see what Apple has prepared in half a year’s time – and that’s still probably the most sensible route, albeit the one with least immediate gratification – I wouldn’t blame you for opting for the Galaxy S8 today, especially if you have a hard price ceiling you can’t or won’t break through. I don’t think you’ll regret it: Samsung’s phone really is that good. Did you buy the Galaxy S8? Are you waiting for the new iPhone? What made you decide? Let me know in the comments!

Business Apps | 11 Apr 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (4) BusyCal 2/Google Calendar Users Should Upgrade by Adam C. Engst We’re fans of BusyCal, the replacement for Apple’s Calendar app from BusyMac. The company has announced that on 20 April 2017, Google will no longer allow apps to sign in to Google Calendar using “web-views,” basically embedded mini-browsers. Instead, all apps will have to send sign-in requests out to a full Web browser. This change doesn’t affect the current BusyCal 3, but it will prevent the older BusyCal 2 from connecting to Google Calendar entirely. There are three possibilities for those still using BusyCal 2: If you sync with Google Calendar and want to keep using BusyCal, you have to upgrade to BusyCal 3. If you sync with Google Calendar, but either don’t want to pay for the upgrade or are using OS X 10.10 Yosemite or earlier, falling back to Apple’s Calendar app is likely the easiest course of action. If you don’t sync with Google Calendar at all, you don’t have to do anything — BusyCal 2 will continue to work fine. The upgrade to BusyCal 3 costs $29.99 for existing customers, or, if you purchased BusyCal 2 after 1 March 2016, the upgrade is free. BusyMac provides full instructions on how to get the upgrade pricing and perform the upgrade. BusyCal 3 requires 10.11 El Capitan or later. BusyCal 3 improves on BusyCal 2 in numerous ways, including: Alerts that are sensitive to travel time and traffic conditions A redesigned menu bar app that provides a mini-month calendar Inline display of timed to-dos with other calendar events Quick entry of events and to-dos using natural language See “BusyCal Updates Mac Calendar Alternative, Expands to iOS” (1 July 2016) for more on what BusyCal 3 has to offer.   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

Your comment will appear after you follow a link in the one-time confirmation message we send to verify that you're a real person. A change in Google Calendar will make it incompatible with BusyCal 2 as of 20 April 2017. The solution is to upgrade to BusyCal 3, if possible. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Derek Roff   2017-04-11 22:32 I bought BusyCal on the recommendation of TidBITS, and upgraded to BusyCal 2, again following your recommendation. It was a competent program for me, but I never got that excited about it. I had some trouble with the way it handles time zones when I travel, and had a bad customer service/tech support experience in trying to solve those problems. When BusyCal told me that I needed to pay for yet another upgrade, I started to reconsider my calendar options. I've also had Fantastical 1, which I bought after a TidBITS review. It was a bit quirky, but I like the menu bar widget and the natural language input options, so I used it to input many of my calendar events, while using BusyCal to view the calendar. Facing the BusyCal upgrade decision, I contacted Fantastical, and discussed some of the things I wanted from a calendar, asking whether Fantastical 2 addressed my concerns. I got a detailed and useful response. They also told me about their current 20% off sale. I decided to upgrade to Fantastical 2.3.x. I've been very happy with the change. Fantastical does a number of things in ways that I like. Their training videos are short, focused, and informative. Technical support has been very good, quick to respond, and helpful. I have no connection with the company, except as a satisfied customer, who would like to see them succeed. If you are unsure about upgrading to BusyCal, take a look at Fantastical, and see if it appeals to you. Reply Christopher Ruebeck  2017-04-18 06:57 I'll have to look at Fantastical based on Derek's comment. I've stuck with Apple's Calendar after trying BusyCal because Apple displays overlapping events so nicely. (I admit—with a nod to another article in this issue— that overlapping events are less important to me now that the three kids are out of the house, but my wife and I still view each other's events.) A feature of BusyCal that I wish Apple would follow is allowing different time zones for the start and end of a given event. Right? Not many things are more confusing than entering a flight arrival and departure when crossing time zones. Reply rex wilson  2017-04-22 17:35 my version of busycal 2 is still working with google as of 22-Apr. Anybody know if somehow BusyCal misunderstood Google's new requirements, and if this will keep working afterall? Or maybe Google dealyed the change? I didn't want to pay $30 for an "upgrade" to a new version of busycal which offers no improvements, and which has drawn much criticism for being harder to use than the classic version 2. I figured I'd keep running v2 until it broke, at which point I'd go to Apple's calendar (and, by the way, I would have been happy to pay $5 for the repair to v2 for google signin, but $30 for something Apple gives away free didn't seem to make asense). Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-23 13:28 I talked with John Chaffee at BusyMac about this, and Google was utterly clear about the date and what would happen — here's a link to their developer post: http://developers.googleblog.com/2016/08/modernizing-oauth-interactions-in-native-apps.html John is checking into what Google has or has not done. Regardless, the upgrade from BusyCal 2 to BusyCal 3 is far more than just compatibility with OAuth, as outlined in the article. There's certainly nothing stopping you from switching back to Calendar (personally, I hate Calendar with a passion), but I presume you bought BusyCal originally for a reason. Reply  Search   Cached.

The one-bedroom, two bath loft is one of the more expensive properties in the neighborhood (above the average $3.5 million). The draw for the 2,800-square-foot unit is the massive open space and the exposed brick. L.A.  In September, Oscar winner Viola Davis purchased her Toluca Lake estate for $5.7 million. It’s 7,545 square feet and has with five bedrooms — including a master suite with private terrace — a screening room with a 133-inch screen, a wine cellar and marble decked kitchen. The backyard boasts a saltwater pool and fire pit. D.C.  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson bought his $5.5 million property in February from AOL exec Richard Hanlon, who originally snagged it for $3.1 million. He joins the Obamas, the Kushners and Jeff Bezos in the popular Kalorama neighborhood. That means, says Sotheby’s Russell Friedman, "We’ll see even more [big names] moving here as time goes on." Tillerson’s 5,478-square-foot pad is spread over four stories, with three bedrooms and seven baths. $10 MILLION N.Y. In February, Trevor Noah traded his $15,000-a-month rental for a $10 million duplex in Hell’s Kitchen. The 3,600-square-foot place boasts wall-to-wall windows for skyline views. Its three bedrooms and three and a half bathrooms are spread over two floors, and there’s a 936-square-foot outdoor patio accessed from the living room. L.A. Jessica Alba paid $9.9 million in February for her 9,000-square-foot abode in Beverly Hills, which she picked up from producer Mike Medavoy (who purchased the property for just north of $6 million in 2011). The house sits on a 1.85 acre hillside lot and has a wraparound balcony with views of the pool and outdoor patio. Lisa Vanderpump lives next door. D.C. "It’s bulletproof," says Sotheby’s Russell Friedman of the front door of this 5,680-square-foot house in Georgetown. The property is loaded with six bedrooms, four and a half baths, seven skylights, heated floors, a four-car parking garage and a heated lap pool. In the same hood as John Kerry, it’s currently at the upper end of the market for D.C., but Friedman expects that is about to change. "Upper bracket was about $5 million, but the Trump appointees are bringing a higher level of wealth to town." See more photos and take a virtual tour of this listing here.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 80 Plus 1 on G+ 389 Share on Facebook 115 Share on Twitter Total Shares584 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? HSidhu David is Google staff. lol netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back.

Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it.

Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. MikeOxlong That's because there was no David Rudduck involvement. Think about it... 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Adrien Aubel We wanted to focus on making a good product for the US before opening it to everybody. But we're revamping right now our support system and allowing a manual IM registration (Americans are automatically verified) to allow us to offer our features to other countries, and we're about to translate our materials and app, while giving multi-language to the Awesome Bar, to make it more relevant. We hope to be opened internationally within the next 3 weeks, will keep you informed! ipsofact LOL I was in a group messaging with 4 other iphones. 1 android. iMessage & RCS do not play well... Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. Hernán Guerra It seems you are under the assumption that Allo messages are not encrypted and Hangouts messages are, which is incorrect. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tomás O’Mertà How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here. Markoff the article doesn't make sense: 1. what's cost benefit splitting Allo hand Duo into two apps? 2. what's cost benefit developing Messenger/Android Messages separately from Allo? mattman723 Tbh I don't mind multiple platforms, I just tell people I'm accessible through any and all methods. I only hate that you cannot "leave" a group SMS. Jadephyre Most people I know that use an iPhone exclusively use Whatsapp, except when needing to send an SMS to people not using any form of smartphone. James Briano Google has no coherent messaging strategy. Their internal teams are either competing with each other, or simply not communicating (maybe they should all get WhatsApp). Recall Google insiders bragging that the Pixel was designed in complete isolation from the Android team. That's nothing to brag about—that's a problem. scy breaking news is a business, of course what it does is about making money, what business isn't?

The article is a wide-ranging profile of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, describing him as a leader who is willing to break and bend rules to get his way, even if it means running afoul of one of the world’s largest tech firms. The attitude has led to Uber’s rapid rise, but has caused the company to run into numerous crises. The article describes how Uber faced problems with account fraud while it was trying to expand into China, and devised a way to identify an individual iPhone, even after its app had been deleted from the phone, or if the phone had been reset. Uber geofenced Apple headquarters to hide its activity from the company The practice, called fingerprinting, is prohibited by Apple. To prevent the company from discovering the practice, Uber geofenced Apple headquarters in Cupertino, changing its code so that it would be hidden from Apple Employees. Despite their efforts, Apple discovered the activity, which led to the meeting between the two CEOs, in which Cook told Kalanick to end the practice. If Uber didn’t comply, Cook told him, Uber’s app would be removed from the App Store, a move that would be a huge blow to the ride-sharing company. According to the article, “Mr. Kalanick was shaken by Mr. Cook’s scolding, according to a person who saw him after the meeting,” and ended the practice. Uber has faced backlash on numerous fronts in recent months, following revelations that the company has used secret programs to evade government regulators and to track rival drivers, tracked customers without permission, and is being sued for allegedy stealing proprietary information regarding self-driving cars from Alphabet’s Waymo. The company has also faced criticism for its toxic workplace culture following a blog post from a former engineer, and company trips to a South Korean escort bar. This latest revelation adds to the mounting PR problem that the company faces, due in part to the leadership style of its CEO. Update: an Uber spokesperson issued a statement to The Verge, : “We absolutely do not track individual users or their location if they’ve deleted the app. As the New York Times story notes towards the very end, this is a typical way to prevent fraudsters from loading Uber onto a stolen phone, putting in a stolen credit card, taking an expensive ride and then wiping the phone—over and over again. Similar techniques are also used for detecting and blocking suspicious logins to protect our users' accounts. Being able to recognize known bad actors when they try to get back onto our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users.” Next Up In Tech Nintendo’s NES Classic will be available at Best Buy stores Monday morning This retro Mac-shaped iPhone stand looks nice, but is kind of pointless There’s an anti-dog label inside the Galaxy S8 — here’s what it means These are some of the cutest cases for your Samsung Galaxy S8 Neil Young’s high-quality streaming music service will be called Xstream The 7 most interesting cars at the Shanghai auto show Now Trending Nintendo’s NES Classic will be available at Best Buy stores Monday morning This is probably your last chance to get one from Best Buy — or anywhere else.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Mon, Apr 24, 2017 - Page 15　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Apple touts more use of recycled metal in gadgets AFP, NEW YORK Apple Inc wants to “one day” end the need to mine materials from the earth to make its gadgets, the technology giant said in its annual environmental responsibility report released on Thursday. “Traditional supply chains are linear,” it said. “Materials are mined, manufactured as products and often end up in landfills after use. Then the process starts over and more materials are extracted from the earth for new products.” “We believe our goal should be a closed-loop supply chain, where products are built using only renewable resources or recycled material,” it added. The company’s research concluded that recycled aluminum should come from Apple products rather than recycling facilities because of the high quality required. Apple has been encouraging customers to return used products and has melted down iPhone aluminum enclosures to make mini computers used in its factories. “For tin, we took a different approach,” the company said. “Unlike aluminum, there is an existing market supply of recycled tin that meets our quality standards.” The ultimate aim is “to one day end our reliance on mining altogether,” the company said, without specifying a date. Apple did not disclose the amount of recycled products used in its products. “Apple’s commitment to 100 percent recycled materials is ambitious, and highlights the need for greater urgency across the sector to reduce resource consumption and e-waste that are causing significant impacts on the environment and human health,” Greenpeace senior analyst Gary Cook said. Making gadgets with reclaimed material reduces demand for mined metals and increases the tendency for devices to be recycled, the environmental group said. Samsung Electronics Co last month said it would sell some Note 7 smartphones that were recalled for safety reasons as refurbished devices. A Samsung statement said that salvageable components from devices would be detached and the metals extracted by companies that specialize in recycling. Apple is also among Silicon Valley titans investing heavily in “green” energy for operations, saying that 96 percent of the electricity at its global facilities comes from alternative energy sources and that its new “spaceship” main campus is powered entirely by “renewable” energy.

According to a khaleejtimes.com report, citing Arabic daily Emarat Al Youm, the UAE’s Ministry of Economy stated that only specific iPhone 6s which contain defective batteries made in China during September and October 2015 will be recalled. Apple has recently expressed that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. If you have experienced this issue, the firm has urged residents to use the serial number checker (www.apple.com/ae/support/iPhone6s-unexpectedshutdown/) if your iPhone 6s is eligible for a battery replacement, free of charge.

To keep the A-listers relaxed and beautiful, they've filled the bags with beauty and spa treatments, including a dermal face lift mask and a skin-tightening laser treatment. Need some help?

The head of the National Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (NTRA) has dismissed such reports as “rumors”. “There is no truth behind the rumors circulating about the blockage of VoIP services for some applications. The NTRA has confirmed more than once the inaccuracy of this news," the authority said. An NTRA official told Egypt Independent on Sunday that the authority has no information regarding these interruptions and that VoIP services should be working smoothly. Meanwhile, widespread reports of disconnection, service cuts and calls not going through left customers with more questions than answers about the status of VoIP -- the technology that allows voice calls to be made online. Ahmed Halawa, a computer engineering student, shared his experience with Egypt Independent on Sunday after he tried to call his friends abroad using Facebook Messenger -- but to no avail. “I even tried calling on WiFi but it didn't work. We all know other ways to get around this interference if it remains this way any longer, like using VPN, but I think it won’t last long,” said Halawa. Egypt Independent experienced problems making online calls using 4G SIM cards to all of Egypt’s three mobile operatoring networks on Sunday, but the problems were different depending on the app and the service provider used. Facebook calls worked smoothly for Orange and Vodafone, but not for Etisalat. FaceTime experienced sporadic disconnections throughout the day for all mobile operators, but reconnected shortly after. Using Viber, the call appeared to connect, but the audio did not transmit. Customer service representatives from Orange, Etisalat and Vodafone told Egypt Independent that VoIP service blockages have nothing to do with the mobile operators. “There is no confirmed information from the NTRA about any restrictions on these applications. Orange provides an internet service for running all applications but is not responsible for the functioning of these applications," an Orange customer service representative told Egypt Independent on Sunday. Vodafone also said the issue is not related to the company as long as its mobile internet service is working fine. An executive source from Vodafone, who preferred to remain anonymous, said these interruptions might be due to the general network disruption due to the lack of frequencies available for the 4G application in Egypt. “The issue of frequencies and what to prioritize is still an ongoing issue of discussion between mobile operators and the state,” he said. On the VoIP interruptions, another telecom source said: “It’s strange and I’ve been experiencing it myself throughout the weekend. Even though I work at a mobile operator company I haven’t been notified about any blockage, nothing has been disclosed to us ... but VoIP services are clearly unstable right now.”  Back in March 2010 and 2015, media reports said the NTRA had issued a ban on mobile calls made through internet-based services like Skype due to Egyptian laws dictating that all international calls must pass through state-owned Egypt Telecom. It’s still unclear whether there is a move to reapply the 2010 ban or if the NTRA has issued a new, non-communicated declaration. The motive behind the ban is still contested, with many claiming that the NTRA would frame it as an issue of national security, while others say it could be so that telecom companies can regain profits lost to international call services. However, with frequent service outages in Egypt, it can be hard to figure whether a problem is caused by an official decision or a technical bug. VoIP services are being blocked in many countries across the Middle East, such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.

Alexandria Sage Apple is looking for new hit products and autonomous car technology is expected to revolutionize the traditional auto industry. Photo: Reuters San Francisco: Apple Inc. outlined a plan to train operators of self-driving cars in documents submitted to California regulators earlier this month, the latest clues to the company’s autonomous vehicle technology aspirations. Apple was granted a permit to test self-driving cars on 14 April by the California department of motor vehicles but the company has never said anything about its plan. The state released 41 pages of Apple application documents to Reuters that give some clues about the company’s highly secret self-driving effort, which it has never openly acknowledged. The iPhone maker joins a long list of carmakers, start-ups and technology rivals, including Alphabet’s Waymo, that are testing cars on state roads. Apple is looking for new hit products and autonomous car technology is expected to revolutionize the traditional auto industry. As part of the application, Apple included a 10-page training plan that appeared to be related to operators taking back manual control of the car during automated driving exercises of the system, which it calls a development platform. Apple declined comment beyond the filing. The plan includes a document called “Automated System: Development Platform Specific Training Overview” whose objective is “to train safety drivers in various automated driving conditions”. “Development platform will be controlled electronically (e.g. joystick) and safety drivers must be ready to intervene and take control,” the document reads. The document highlights different scenarios to be tested, from high speed driving and tight U-turns to lane changes. One letter sent from Apple to the state department of motor vehicles noted that Apple’s development platform “will have the ability to capture and store relevant data before a collision occurs”. The document does not include detail on how Apple’s self-driving platform actually works or other technical details. It also does not say what kind of sensors are found on Apple’s three permitted vehicles, all 2015 Lexus model RX450h. The permit does not necessarily mean that Apple itself is building a full car. Apple could instead be designing a self-driving platform that can be integrated into other manufacturer’s cars.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide Samsung Galaxy S8 Review: The Prettiest Phone Wins Mario AguilarFriday 2:07pm Filed to: Samsung galaxy s8 review samsung galaxy s8 galaxy s8 android smartphones gadgets mobile reviews 460 13 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink All product photos: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo With the exploding Note 7 battery fiasco, Samsung inadvertently did something that’s increasingly difficult these days: It made smartphones interesting for a flickering moment. Super interesting in fact. Besides the intriguing mournful saga of the Note 7, whose embarrassing recall cost the company billions, Samsung also set up a dramatic release narrative for the Galaxy S8. This wasn’t just another smartphone—this was a make-or-break device charged with saving a company in the throes of an existential crisis. A smartphone that screams at the void—yikes! Advertisement With the stakes high, Samsung has delivered a device that legitimately stands out from the rest. The Galaxy S8 is a good enough phone that Samsung can likely leave that Note 7 drama behind. (Though, you know, we’re still waiting to see what unfortunate cataclysm will befall the S8 now.) Ultimately, what makes the S8 a winner isn’t any of the assistant smart features that manufacturers have been pushing hard over the last few years—in fact Samsung’s entrant here, Bixby, falls short. The S8 wins with an industry-leading hardware design that challenges the iPhone’s aesthetic supremacy. The Pixel (right) always looked dorky with it’s home button free bezel, but it looks even worse next to the micro-bezel on the S8+ (left). If you buy the Galaxy S8, you’re buying it because it’s the most beautiful phone available. While it falls short of being completely bezel-less, it might as well be. Though LG released a similarly bezel-less device earlier this year, it suffered from an excess of simplicity. Samsung is way ahead of most competitors you would realistically consider, like the Google Pixel, and the iPhone 7, which are both encased in unsightly prisons of bezel. The S8+ (left) versus last year’s S7 Edge (right). The design is a huge leap forward for Samsung, which has been inching in this direction for years with its edge display devices. This thing is practically all display on the front, and Samsung even got rid of its physical home button. The phone’s gently rounded edges and curves create the effect of a display that’s simply floating in the air or hovering just above your hand. There are no jarring interruptions to the minimal design. It feels like you’re looking at a phone from the future, rather than a tired rehash of a winning design from the past—unsurprisingly, Apple is reportedly considering a similar look for its forthcoming iPhone. Advertisement The S8 comes in two display sizes—a 5.8-inch Galaxy S8 ($750), and the 6.2-inch S8+ ($850). I tested the S8+, but the only difference between the two devices is size and price. Those display sizes make it difficult to compare them to other devices. Both S8s have an 18.5:9 aspect ratio, as opposed the more traditional 16:9 shape. Consequently the S8+ is a little thicker and taller than the iPhone 7 Plus, as well as very slightly narrower. Nitpicking aside, they’re basically the same size: The S8+ and iPhone 7 Plus (bottom). There’s been some debate about the merits of the new 18.5:9 aspect ratio (LG, again, did something similar this year, too). Most of the content you will view on websites, Netflix, Hulu, and so on is 16:9 so it fills up the entirety of devices like the iPhone. Meanwhile, watch the same content on the S8, and the picture will be surrounded by black bars. It feels wasteful, but, as you see in the image above, it isn’t the end of the world. Galaxy S8+’s display is bright and vibrant. Compared to the other phones you might consider buying these days, the S8's OLED is noticeably brighter and more vivid. Your photos will pop on this display. Bixby’s dashboard looks a lot like the old Google Now interface. Besides the hardware design, the other fresh addition in the S8 is Bixby, Samsung’s newly acquired digital assistant tech that’s meant to compete with Google Assistant, Apple’s Siri, and Amazon’s Alexa. Advertisement Sponsored At launch, Bixby will not support voice commands, though Samsung promises that feature will land this spring. I promised myself I wasn’t going to nail Samsung for shipping unfinished product (despite what happened the last time Samsung did). In the end I don’t need to. Most voice assistants are dumb as hell, including Google Assistant, which is also built into the S8, but Bixby’s bad enough that adding voice support wouldn’t even make a difference. Many of Bixby’s features seem amazing at first glance. Like the hardware button Samsung has built onto the side of the phone. It wakes Bixby up with a touch instead of a shout. There is nothing I hate more than invoking assistants by name. OK Google—tell me I sound like an asshole! Push the button, and Bixby’s Google Now-like dashboard display pops up, showing your appointments, the weather, and information from supported apps like Samsung Health and CNN. The Galaxy S8 is the prettiest phone you can buy right now. In practice, the additional hardware button just causes confusion. I frequently hit it instead of the volume down button, pulling up the assistant instead of taking a photo or reducing the loudness of my music. Worse, one morning when the S8's alarm clock woke me up ungodly early, I dumbly fumbled around for my phone and instead of waking the phone up to turn off my alarms, I pressed the Bixby button was presented with all the meetings I had planned for the day, as if Bixby’s sole purpose was to remind me that my every waking hour will be toil and suffering. The assistant’s potentially most impressive feature is Bixby Vision, which allows you to use the phone’s camera to search by image. This kind of technology has existed from years—Amazon introduced an impressive feature called Flow three years ago. So it’s incredible how bad this feature is. When you tap the little Bixby Vision button in the S8's camera app, the tool takes a moment to process what you’re looking at, and then presents you with the option to use the image to do a general search, a shopping search, or in the event that it identifies wine or text, to treat the visual information accordingly. The only Bixby Vision tool that works with any level of consistency is the shopping tool, which identified a Monster energy drink (SUGAR FREE!) and a Neil deGrasse Tyson book correctly. When I pointed it at very expensive over-ear headphones headphones, it tried to sell me moderately priced earbuds, which fair enough, I don’t need to spend $900 on headphones. Bixby’s shopping search works reliably. The more general image search capability is a joke, and feels like a failure. The only image it was able to identify correctly is an old photograph by German documentary photographer August Sander. Sure, this is just a Pinterest search, but I’m having trouble figuring out what the hell the point of this is. Bixby’s Pinterest-powered search is not very useful for anything. As for the wine and text tools—they need serious work. The only time Bixby identified a wine bottle, I wasn’t pointing it at wine. The text tool has a hard job, and tends to interpret everything but the cleanest Helvetica typography as a garbled mess. Hello Bixby, you suck. Beyond the frustrating assistant, Samsung’s software is actually really nicely refined. TouchWiz, the company’s proprietary spin on Android, is no longer the unattractive horrorshow it was for years—mostly because Samsung has increasingly stayed out of Google’s way. Some of Samsung’s software additions are quite useful, like the Apps Edge drawer, which slides out a customizable collection of your favorite apps with a swipe from the right edge of the display It’s hard being this hard . Advertisement Advertisement Samsung’s camera is good enough for your snaps and ‘grams. There’s no dual camera like you’re finding on some other devices, but at least it comes with some built-in Snapchat Lens-like filters—Cool? The S8's most annoying quirk is the oddly-placed fingerprint sensor. Less cool is Samsung moving the fingerprint scanner to the back of the phone to the side of the camera was a mistake. It’s not placement on the back so much, which was likely necessary to make that beautiful bezel-less front. It’s that the sensor is off center so it lacks the intuitive feel of fingerprint sensors that are smack in the middle, as in the case of the Google Pixel and LG G6. What’s more, Samsung has gone and put the freaking camera exactly where your brain wants the sensor to be. Instagram your fried chicken dinner at your own risk. In the end, the Galaxy S8 handily smokes the Android competition as the top phone you can buy. It’s prettier and slicker than the Pixel, and though Bixby feels a little unfinished for the moment, you can still use Google Assistant. The S8 also measures up favorably with the iPhone 7, and whether you choose one or the other probably comes down to something as simple as whether you want Samsung’s forward-thinking ideas or Apple’s refined simplicity. Or maybe you want a headphone jack—the S8 has one! Advertisement As for whether you should upgrade, well, that’s another question entirely. How busted is your current phone? Is it broken and you need a new one? The S8 is a great option. Is your phone less than two years old and humming along fine? Wait until next year. What’s truly interesting about the S8 is just how compelling a phone can be on the merits of its great design alone. Bixby is basically rubbish, and yet the phone is a winner. Perhaps it shouldn’t be all that surprising: Top flagship phones with beefy specs are going to perform very well without fail these days. They all have good cameras and day-long battery life and processors that can chop through huge mobile games. It’s so challenging to make a device stand out that manufacturers are employing all manner of gimmicks, like voice assistants and modular accessories, to see if they can’t make their devices standout. None of those technologies improve your life quite as much as a design that plays into our crudest superficiality; I stare at my phone all goddamn day—I want to look at something pretty. README The prettiest phone you can buy right now. The new 18.5:9 aspect ratio doesn’t really make a huge difference, but you will notice black bars around your YouTube videos now. Bixby Vision is really only good as a shopping tool. Bixby, like all AI assistants, is too half-baked to be really useful in a life-changing way.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 80 Plus 1 on G+ 389 Share on Facebook 115 Share on Twitter Total Shares584 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? HSidhu David is Google staff. lol netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. MikeOxlong That's because there was no David Rudduck involvement. Think about it... 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

But we're revamping right now our support system and allowing a manual IM registration (Americans are automatically verified) to allow us to offer our features to other countries, and we're about to translate our materials and app, while giving multi-language to the Awesome Bar, to make it more relevant. We hope to be opened internationally within the next 3 weeks, will keep you informed! ipsofact LOL I was in a group messaging with 4 other iphones. 1 android. iMessage & RCS do not play well... Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. Hernán Guerra It seems you are under the assumption that Allo messages are not encrypted and Hangouts messages are, which is incorrect. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tomás O’Mertà How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here. Markoff the article doesn't make sense: 1. what's cost benefit splitting Allo hand Duo into two apps? 2. what's cost benefit developing Messenger/Android Messages separately from Allo? mattman723 Tbh I don't mind multiple platforms, I just tell people I'm accessible through any and all methods. I only hate that you cannot "leave" a group SMS. Jadephyre Most people I know that use an iPhone exclusively use Whatsapp, except when needing to send an SMS to people not using any form of smartphone. James Briano Google has no coherent messaging strategy. Their internal teams are either competing with each other, or simply not communicating (maybe they should all get WhatsApp). Recall Google insiders bragging that the Pixel was designed in complete isolation from the Android team. That's nothing to brag about—that's a problem. scy breaking news is a business, of course what it does is about making money, what business isn't?

Trending in Apple Here’s what the Hackintosh community wants in the new modular Mac Pro Yesterday AAPL: 142.27 -0.17 iPhone 8 dummy model surfaces with edge-to-edge display, no rear Touch ID, elongated power button Benjamin Mayo - Apr. 23rd 2017 5:14 am PT @bzamayo iPhone 7 iPhone 8 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit The rumor mill for the iPhone 8 is seemingly flip-flopping between two distinct designs for Apple’s 2017 flagship iPhone, one made of aluminium and another more drastic look with a curved glass front and back. The latest unverified leaks from today depict the latter device. These photo show an iPhone made of glass and stainless steel with the front screen seemingly going edge-to-edge with no discernible bezel. There is also no Touch ID visible on the back, implying it will be integrated under the display. More photos after the jump … The best, strongest, Lightning cables ... buy braided cables here This latest round of leaks comes via Benjamin Geskin on Twitter. The photos are supposedly CNC dummy models of the iPhone 8 chassis. It isn’t clear at what stage in the production process these models are from; the back Apple logo is missing from most of the photos. Taking the photos at face value for a moment, they do mostly gel with what we’ve been hearing from other sources. Most interestingly, the back has a vertical rectangle for the new dual camera system … and nothing else. Purported iPhone 8 rear Purported iPhone 8 right side Purported iPhone 8 left side There is no rear Touch ID fingerprint sensor in sight here, which implies that this design would see Apple integrating fingerprint biometric scanner into/underneath the display itself. This still remains a very contentious issue; can Apple integrate the fingerprint sensor into the display at scale? The front of the device is dominated by the black screen which looks incredible with no discernible bezel (although again, it’s not clear if this dummy includes screen components at all). The earpiece is just about visible at the top middle of the front; cutouts for cameras, proximity sensors and other parts are not distinguishable. Purported iPhone 8 CNC Model Purported iPhone 8 front Purported iPhone 8 front The sides of the device look like polished stainless steel, echoing an iPhone 4 aesthetic for sure. It almost looks like an iPod classic backplate with how shiny and curved it is. As you would expect, there are separate volume buttons and a mute switch on the left side. The right side looks a lot like a current iPhone too, with a power button and SIM tray, except the power switch seems to be elongated/longer. The same leaker has also posted updated schematics, which show an array of components hidden underneath the front screen and the addition of a noise-reduction microphone in the dual-camera bulge. The red outline indicates where the bezel stops and the OLED display begins, approximately. These schematics imply that the display would feature a hole for the front speaker … one of the most unbelievable elements honestly. These images are certainly very exciting, the device depicted here is a major upgrade over the current iPhone 7 design. However, we don’t really have any concrete evidence that this is what the iPhone 8 will look like. It certainly seems like it is one of the prototypes Apple considered but there’s no ‘smoking gun’ to say it is the design the company is going to use. Bloomberg summarized the various prototypes Apple has considered for this year’s flagship phone. Whilst the rumor mill remains divided on the iPhone 8 industrial design, the features of the phone seem locked down. Many reports indicate that the iPhone 8 (or whatever Apple ends up naming it) will feature a 3D sensing front camera, wireless charging, 3 GB RAM, 5.8-inch OLED 521 PPI display and more. Apple will unveil the new phone in the fall alongside iterative updates to the existing iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models. Update: The same source has provided some more details: the iPhone 8 will supposedly be the same 7.1mm thinness and approximate physical size as the iPhone 7, and the steel surround will actually be a Space Black color. Geskin provided another image representing this Space Black finish: Benjamin Mayo @bzamayo Benjamin develops iOS apps professionally and covers Apple news and rumors for 9to5Mac.

In fact, skimping on not just a powerful laptop for college, but the correct laptop for your major can significantly hinder your productivity and more importantly make or break your success. That’s why we suggest you take a hard look at your major and make sure that your laptop of choice can accommodate the tasks at hand. Not sure what those are? Speak to your guidance counselor and email your professor. If they’re an invested educator they’ll be happy to provide guidance around this subject matter. After all, the more prepared you are for the class, the easier the job. Our Top Laptops for College Picks Best for a Computer Science Degree Dell XPS 13 The Dell XPS 13 laptop might be on the pricier side, but with that you get ultrabook performance. Price: $942.39 | Read Full Review: Dell XPS 13 Review | Features: InfinityEdge display, touchscreen, Intel i5-6200U 2.3 GHz Processor WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The Dell XPS 13 puts portability and power in a punchy, flexible package. A little on the pricier side – though cheaper than the Surface Book – Dell’s XPS13 is entirely worth it, and is truly one of the best laptops for college students in price and tech specs. With a 13.3-inch Full HD Infinity display, 4GB of RAM, 128GB SSD, the XPS 13 is the perfect mix of power and flexibility that college students need from their daily driver. The Dell XPS 13 will be able to keep up with even the most demanding tasks, whether that’s using tools like Photoshop and AutoDesk 3DS Max, or programming software like Android Studio and Eclipse. The Dell XPS 13 is also the perfect entertainment machine. With its 13.3-inch Infinity display, it has one of the sharpest images you’ll see on a portable machine. It’s perfect for the media professional, but also great for watching movies, TV shows, and even doubles as a halfway decent gaming laptop. View on Amazon – $942.39 Best Creative Arts College Laptop Apple Macbook The Macbook first got cool on college campuses, and it still hasn’t lost its edge Price: $1,269.00 | Features: Force Touch trackpad, Retina display, 10hr battery life WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: No other laptop has the same “cool” factor as a new Macbook. Although Apple and its ubiquitous Macbook line of laptops may not be the dominant force among college students these days, the company still knows how to make a solid machine that goes the distance when it comes to software integration and unique hardware tweaks. Apple still makes the Macbook Pro in both 13″ and 15″ flavors, but unless you know you’ll be doing a lot of heavy rendering or running intensive applications, the regular 12″ model should handle nearly any job you can throw at it with ease. The inclusion of the Force Touch mousepad is perfect for students who need to navigate through a lot of content quickly and easily, while OSX continues to be the operating system of choice among departments dedicated to the creative arts. If you have to run OSX for your particular program, or just want a dependable all-around laptop that’s perfect for any kind of project, the Macbook is still king with college students everywhere. View on Amazon – $1,269.00 Best Durable College Laptop HP Stream 13 The HP Stream 13 is a low-end laptop, intended for basic tasks like paper writing and spreadsheet construction. Price: $219.00 | Features: Durable shell, 32GB of SSD storage, one-year subscription to Office 365 WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The HP Stream 13 wins on its raw ability to take a punch. If there’s one thing parents know about their kids, it’s how clumsy they can be when it comes to keeping their technology in one piece. The HP Stream is definitely the most durable (and colorful) laptop on this list, available in Cobalt Blue, Orchid Magenta, Violet Purple, and Horizon Blue. With a 13.3-inch display, an Intel Celeron N3050, 2GB of RAM, and 32GB of SSD storage, the Stream 13 is decidedly low-end, making it one of the cheapest laptops for college on our list. But what makes the HP Stream 13 one of the best laptops for college students? It’s ultra portability and the fact that it comes with a free year of Office 365, something that costs almost as much as the laptop itself.

View on Amazon – $499.99 How We Chose the Best Laptops for College When looking for the best laptops for college students, we pulled from a wide range of options both in price and features to give you the broadest spectrum of options available. Just like every college student is different, so is the laptop choice that’s right for them. Some don’t need a lot of power and prefer portability over everything else, while others might require a machine that can render 3D models and watch lectures streaming online at the same time. Because laptops go everywhere with their corresponding college student, every choice we’ve made here is durable enough to stand up to punishment for all four years they’re earning their degree, but also light enough to slide into a backpack quickly and easily without any hassle. A laptop for college needs to boot quickly, run smoothly, and be able to run almost any program you can think of (in case next semester you decide you want to pursue VFX design instead of biochemistry). Ultimately the laptop that’s right for you or your kids will combine all the best aspects of a laptop into one complete package at a cost that’s manageable for your expectations. Key Factors to a Top Laptop For College Performance: There’s no need to overbuy in power. Find the right power for your needs. For instance, if you’re just picking up a laptop for writing papers, you might not need something with a large capacity SSD, a hefty processor, and 8GB of RAM..and with it a hefty price tag. Likewise, if you’re buying something for a Graphic Design or CAD class, you’ll likely need something much heftier than just 4GB of RAM and a dual-core processor. Find a laptop that meets your needs and sets you up for success. Portability: Make sure to purchase a thin and lightweight laptop. There’s nothing worse than carrying around a chunky laptop that’s awkward and heavy to lug around campus or to the library. It’s also good practice to make sure your laptop has a small footprint, allowing you to easily put it in most backpacks or carrying bags alongside textbooks and other study materials. Battery: Find a laptop with a good battery, preferably one that’ll last you all day and then some. For instance, the ASUS C201 has a battery that lasts up to 13-hours, giving you plenty of study time during the day and then some. While you might not need that much, it’s good to search for laptops that will last a little over three hours. Who Should Buy a Laptop for College Of course, you don’t have to be straight out of high school to be in the market for a new college laptop. Whether you’re unpacking your bags in a dorm away from home for the first time or returning after a long hiatus to finish up your master’s degree, buying a fresh laptop before classes start in the fall is always a solid investment. What classes you plan on taking, as well as the degree you’re pursuing should have an impact on the laptop you eventually choose to go with. If you need something sleek and powerful that can turn on instantly for rapid-fire notetaking, the Dell XPS 13 or Zenbook UX360AC should suit the job just fine. But, if you’re worried about spending a ton of cash on a laptop that not might last more than a few months without getting beer spilled in the keyboard, the HP Stream 13 and Acer C201 are cheaper, durable options that can weather any alcohol-related storm. Mistakes to Avoid When Buying a College Laptop Don’t make the mistake of buying the wrong operating system. Some school programs will specifically require either a Windows or OSX-based laptop (be sure to check your syllabus) for programs like Photoshop and Gimp. If your learning is strictly reading books, writing papers, and taking quizzes, then you might not need the aforementioned operating systems. In that case opt for a Chromebook, especially if all your activities will be Web based. Another thing to avoid is having too little RAM or hard drive space. The a solid laptop for students will have just enough storage capacity and RAM for studying, completing assignments, and play. If your degree program requires a lot of heavy duty software, find a laptop that has 4GB of RAM or more and a hard drive with 500GB of storage space or more. This will be enough to ensure that any software you throw on your computer runs smoothly without any hiccups.  And keep in mind that an SSD hard drive will increase speeds as well, especially start up time. And never buy at full retails.  As a student always be on the look for those student discounts, even if something already seems cheap! Most Important Features Hard Drive As far as Windows laptops go, and you don’t use many programs, look for a hard drive with a capacity of 256GB or higher. It’ll meet your needs and then some. If you’re a power user, look for 500GB or higher so there’s more than enough space for other content. If most of your activity takes place on the Web, then you might not need a hard drive larger than 32GB, which is just enough space for the operating system and storing a handful of documents offline. If possible, find a solid-state drive over a traditional hard drive. Performance and speeds will increase astronomically. RAM If you need to do anything more demanding than just using a web browser, find a laptop that has at least 4GB of RAM or more, ideally 8GB, especially if you plan on using programs like Photoshop. If you’re just using a web browser, look for a laptop with a minimum of 2GB of RAM. Your computer, whether it be Windows or Chrome OS, won’t even use that much, but it still ensures the speed and responsiveness of your machine. Alternatively, find a machine that you can upgrade the RAM yourself, which can save you money during the initial investment. Operating System It’s important to find the right operating system for your College program. If you’re in Computer Science or something that requires you to use Windows or Mac applications, it’s good to shy away from Chromebooks. If your studying takes place online and doesn’t require you to use any Windows or Mac applications, jump the gun and get a Chromebook. Processor A lower clocked dual-core processor below 2GHz won’t slow down your laptop if you’re using it for minor tasks like writing papers, browsing the web, watching media, and so on. If you’re in a degree program that has some demanding programs (e.g. Photoshop, Autodesk 3DS Max, and medical software), make sure you look for a quad-core processor with a clock speed of 2GHz or higher. Not only will it last you longer running these types of programs, but rendering and general speed will be a lot faster and more efficient than a dual-core CPU below 2GHz. At the same time, don’t overbuy in processor clock speed. For instance, there aren’t many differences between a quad-core 3.7GHz processor and a quad-core 3.9GHz processor. The only real difference is the much higher price tag. There’s little effect as far as processing power and efficiency goes. Display Finding a good display has much to do with the size that you’re comfortable with and need to work with. Whether it be 11-inch or 17-inch displays, they’re all good as long as they have a resolution of 720p or higher. Anything below that is often blurry and has very little clarity. You’ll want to make sure your display has a refresh rate of at least 60Hz to avoid any screen tearing or altered graphics when playing games and watching movies. The display you purchase should have built-in features for reducing eye strain, such as dimming the brightness or even having a feature for night use. This will help a lot as far as eye strain goes. Battery Some lectures can last over four hours in a single sitting, which is why you’ll want a laptop that can at least double up on two of those a day without needing a recharge. Most good quality laptops will have built-in power saving features that can stretch their life to 10 hours or more. You should be able to get a full charge in just two to three hours, allowing you to quickly get back to work whenever needed. Ports The best laptops for college students will have more than a single USB port. More manufacturers are headed towards just including one USB port, but it’s truly a hassle to deal with, as you can’t really plug in any extra peripherals or accessories without connecting a USB hub first. Make sure the laptop you buy has an HDMI, DVI, VGA, or Display Port. You never know when you might need to switch to a bigger screen, and having one of these ports will let you do that, with VGA being the most common for projectors you’d find in the average classroom. Which Best Laptops for College Students are right for you? Need something powerful that can handle the demands from Photoshop and/or CAD? Then the Microsoft Surface Book and Dell XPS 13 are laptops that are right up your alley. Alternatively, if you’re looking for something more humble for doing your everyday tasks at college and maybe a little media consumption when you have some time off, then the ASUS X551MA or HP Stream 13 are both laptops to consider. And, then there are Chromebooks, web-based laptops. Some are hesitant to jump on the Chromebook bandwagon, and might not consider them the best laptops for college students, simply because you can’t use Windows-based software on it. You might be surprised, but more often than not, we just don’t use the programs on Windows, strictly using web browsers like Chrome and Firefox for all of our computer use. Still not sure if these are the best laptops for college students? Then take a look at our laptops for college reviews, as they might just be able to help you make that final decision.

Reply Chris Stobing on Hey Les, Unfortunately Windows will always have problems with viruses, and are also the only machines (under $3,000) that can run CAD software effectively. Lighted keyboards generally only come on Dell ultrabooks (which don’t push past 15″ these days), so with all those factors in mind my best recommendation would be the Predator 17 from Acer.

Google's messaging mess is about money, not making your life easier (opinion) Trevor Newman View All Posts 2017/04/21 10:51am PDTApr 21, 2017 80 Plus 1 on G+ 389 Share on Facebook 115 Share on Twitter Total Shares584 Applications Editorials Article Contents 1 Explainer: business case 2 The falling tower of Babel 3 Money in the messenger 4 Say ‘ello to Allo 5 I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one 6 Jibe talkin’ 7 Conclusion I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem to make sense, look for the money. What I mean is that profitability is often the simplest explanation for a decision that might seem to make little or no sense to someone on the outside of a company looking in. How does this rule apply to Google’s messaging mess? Much ink, and possibly much blood, has been spilt over Google’s recent messaging app strategy (or lack thereof). To some, it is a mangled and unfocused mess of half-baked concepts sent out into the world for us to shill to our increasingly impatient friends and family. To others, it is part of Google’s master plan to move the world forward in a big way that most are too naive to see. In my humble opinion, the explanation may be much simpler: To understand the mess, look for the money. Explainer: business case What does business case have to do with Google’s inability to get its messaging app mess straightened out? We’re getting there, but that requires an understanding of another bit of business jargon called the business case. At large corporations, significant investments of time and resources usually require the approval of the chief financial officer (CFO). In the case of Alphabet, this person happens to be Ruth Porat, a highly successful and talented businesswoman who not only advised President Obama during the financial crisis of ‘07-’09 but who was also rumored to be a potential nominee for Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line. If the bottom line is a net loss, there can be no justification for approval; if the bottom line is a projected gain, then the conversation can continue. And if the business case is compelling enough, a project can move forward. Edit: A portion of this section has been removed for potential inaccuracies around the concept of fiduciary duty in regard to a publicly traded corporation. -Man. Ed. DR. The falling tower of Babel So what does a compelling business case have to do with a simple messaging app? With the hiring of Ms. Porat and the consolidation of Google’s various business ventures under Alphabet, business lines were brought under increasing pressure to bring their costs in line with their revenues. In other words, a business unit can only receive money if it is making money. Under Alphabet, Google’s messaging platform must justify its contribution to the profitability of the company or, like any money-loser, it must either be reimagined or trotted out back to be put down. With that in mind, let’s take a look at Google’s messaging strategy prior to its consolidation under Alphabet. By 2015, all signs pointed toward the idea Google was moving toward a more integrated messaging platform. Two years prior, rumors of “Babel” were rampant and it seemed that Hangouts (though tragically named) would be the platform on which this integration would occur. But what we ended up with was an app that consolidated the instant messaging capabilities of Google Talk and Google+ Messenger with the video chat functionality already offered by the original Hangouts for Google+. Eventually SMS integration was added to the trifecta of instant messaging, video chat, and VOIP and the result was the closest thing to an iMessage for Android as we were going to get. While this may have been near single messenger nirvana (theoretically), in light of what we know now, the question remains: How was this strategy going to generate revenue? Money in the messenger For Apple, iMessage sells iPhones: it is often cited by customers as a reason for their allegiance to iOS. RIM (now Blackberry) made a similar justification when they shot down Jim Balsillie’s business case to make BBM compatible with competing platforms in 2012. The hardware team argued there would be no more reason for folks to buy Blackberries, and we all know how that played out. (Fortunately for Apple, iMessage is not the only reason people continue to buy iPhones, though that's a discussion for another time.) But as I alluded to in a previous column, Google is not a hardware company, it is an advertising company. Google makes its money by surfacing advertisements it deems most relevant to the the consumer. It started off with search results, then email, then your phone--each new platform giving Google a little bit more insight into who you are, what you like, and what kind of ads you are more likely to act upon. Knowing this, what is the business case for a merged messaging platform? Where is the money? One potential business case for generating ad revenue from Hangouts would have been to read your private chats and insert recommendations and links to sites supported by Google’s ad platform into your conversations. In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity. Rather, instead of shoehorning the functionality into an app with a notoriously complicated backend and hoping that users would be amenable to the inclusion of this new functionality, it is my belief that Google sought to instead build a new app from the ground up. Not only would this give Google a chance to reframe the chat intruder as an “Assistant,” it would give them a fresh foundation upon which to build out a messaging platform with a revenue driver already in place. Finally, I feel that the introduction of Allo enabled Google to repurpose Hangouts into a diminished but more focused role as an enterprise chat and conferencing client within the high revenue, low margin G Suite. A money loser on its own, Hangouts is now part of a high earning team. Say ‘ello to Allo I previously mentioned that one way to generate revenue from messaging is to somehow use the content of the messages to drive ad revenue. This is essentially what Google Assistant is in Allo (and now M in Facebook Messenger). For those of you who have used Allo: Do you remember connecting your Google account to the service when it suggested doing so as it would give you more personalized recommendations? Do you remember how friendly and enticing it was to give it access to your location? “I may share your location when I help you in chats with friends.” Heck it even pre-populates a response for you to tap that says “Ok, go on.” As shady as this sounds, these are very masterfully designed opt-ins and I cannot fault Google for crafting them in such a friendly way. The more information Google gets from your chats, the more relevant content the Assistant can generate for you to click on. The more relevant the information surfaced by Assistant is to you, the more likely you are to click a link to a website that hosts Google ads. The more of these websites you are driven to the more money Google makes which increases profits, and enables them to bring that good news to shareholders. Allo was built from the ground up to earn its keep. Whether it is successful is yet to be seen. I’ve got 160 characters but "$" ain't one Now that we know how Google plans to make money from Allo, why not just build SMS fallback into Allo and call it a day? Well for one thing, most of the world has moved on from SMS and uses the much better over-the-top (OTT) method of messaging that serves as the basis for Allo. Additionally, SMS gives Google zero insight into your personal habits and provides them little opportunity to generate any form of revenue. Even if Google were to build SMS fallback into Allo, it would still require both ends of the conversation to have Allo installed in order to drive the rich messages and site links that drive their revenue model. Therefore from a business perspective I can see little incentive for Google to invest in building a reliable SMS fallback system that serves only a portion of the user base and cannibalizes the revenue model upon which Allo is built. Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful. In fact, SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada. The only ones who have ever made money from SMS messages are the carriers and it is clear that they will not give it up unless there is a more viable alternative capable of making them more money than SMS charges. That alternative may already exist in the form of Rich Communications Services (RCS). Jibe talkin’ RCS is a rich messaging standard which many thought would have already replaced SMS by now. Like OTT messaging platforms, RCS is capable of handling the kind of rich communications that would enable a company to indirectly drive revenue by surfacing a link to a partner website, a coupon to make a sale, or the ability to quickly pay off a bill, all within the four walls of the instant messenger. However, unlike OTT messaging services, RCS is dependent on carrier and OEM buy-in and integration to support its proliferation. It is no wonder, then, that it has taken so long for RCS to catch on. However, now that OTT messaging services are showing carriers the compelling revenue models around rich messaging services, slowly but surely they are catching on. Google showed its hand in 2015 when it purchased an RCS platform developer called Jibe. On Acquiring Jibe, Android RCS Software Engineer and Minister of messaging Mike Dodd said “Jibe is a leading provider of RCS services and they’ll continue helping carriers easily deploy RCS to their users.” He mentions carriers for a very specific reason: Because almost nothing runs through a carrier’s pipes unless it’s profitable for the carrier to use it. Since the acquisition, Google has worked quickly to build RCS support into the Android Messages App and has begun exerting its influence on weaker OEMs to pre-install it on their Android devices. Now all that’s left is for the carriers to support the universal RCS profile, which is no mean feat. While the big four US carriers are all signatories of the universal RCS profile, and a number of carriers and OEMs have either vowed to implement the universal profile or have at at least implemented a proprietary version of RCS, time will tell if the standard takes off or gets stuck struggling in the mire of hubristic competition that has dragged out the long slow death of SMS. Conclusion From a frustrated consumer perspective, Google’s messaging app strategy looks scatterbrained and impulsive; appearing to make little or no sense. However, from a business perspective, it shows a company actively seeking out new ways to generate revenue, drive their bottom line, and keep their shareholders happy. This then leaves you, the end user, with a couple of options: Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS or some other niche operating system which won’t have any appreciable effect on Android’s market share. Keep doing what you’ve been doing; keep an app folder called “messaging” on your home screen and continue to piss off your stubborn iOS mates by sending them SMS messages until they download WhatsApp and stop telling you to buy an iPhone. I wish I could end this on a more enlightened note but Google is, at the end of the day, a business - and a business has to make money. And while they remain an impressive and innovative enterprise, I think we as end users falsely expect them to have a robust and seamless solution for everything. Android is a platform, and an open platform at that. There may be no all-in-one messaging client like there was in the halcyon days of desktop instant messengers and the XMPP (Jabber) standard, but Android as a platform is continually evolving and what the future holds is anyone’s guess. Perhaps then, we will one day look back upon this time with nostalgia as we tell our children’s children about what is was like “back in the day” when we communicated with many messengers and our home screens looked like this.

Google needs to understand that a functional, cohesive messaging platform is vital to Android, even if it's not directly profitable. Basically like the Android OS itself. David Ruddock Why? Why does it matter? What about a cohesive messaging model helps Google sell Android to the real customers (vendors - not you and me), when Android itself isn't even profitable? I understand it's a fairly cold and clinical way to look at it, but Google is very much shifting to a revenue-first strategy on products. Just look at Pixel: it is designed to make money, not to win grass-roots fans or showcase Android's diversity like the Nexus line was. Things are very much changing at Google (Alphabet), and it's pretty ridiculous to think that it's just that Google doesn't "get" messaging at this point. They're the second-most valuable company on earth. I think they "get" more than we give them credit for. It's just that their priorities and yours and nowhere near aligned. It's having negative ramifications for consumers, certainly, but I wouldn't call it an "excuse." Kyle Gospodnetich If Apple is also publicly traded and revenue-focused and they "get" messaging, why does Alphabet not? Arthur Dent Apple has a VERY different model for profitability. Luxferro I'm not an Apple user, but they also appear to have much more polished products, both software and hardware. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The display and S Pen of a Note are the only things stopping me from switching to an iPhone. Arthur Dent I gotta say, the display of the 7+ is pretty spectacular, as is the camera. Obv no S-Pen or equivalent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I haven't seen the 7+, but the 6S+ has a very nice display. Much better than I thought it would be. It's just that I'm so addicted to AMOLED. I will definitely be weighing my options on the Note 8 vs. the iPhone 8 this year. Arthur Dent Yeah, coming from a GS6, from the specs I thought OMG the Plus models "only" have 1920x1080 on a 5.5" LCD screen? Weak! Turns out I was wrong (which I can admit), that resolution is just fine at that size (no PenTile), and the colors are excellent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. When my wife got her iPhone 6S Plus, I thought it was a terrible idea because of the LCD display. After I used it several times, I was really impressed with how good it looks. I also like the software. No, it's not as configurable as Android, but that novelty has worn off for me. And I'm so sick of Google's BS. Everything on the iPhone just works. With one exception. When an iOS update is waiting to be installed, some apps will crash. After I apply the update for her, everything just works again. I don't know why that is. Maybe the apps got updated first. Knowledgeborn Allah Interestingly enough, I bought my first iOS device - the iPhone 7 Plus - last year when it came out, just to see what all the hype was about. And, needless to say, I can definitely understand the appeal. It's better than any Android device I've owned, including the Pixel XL and Galaxy S7 Edge. So, I guess there's that... Jason Edwards Well the next iPhone is suppose to get an OLED screen (Made by Samsung ?) and several document leaks from Apple have mentioned the Pencil working with the iPhone. Whether they bring the Pencil to the iPhone or not is anyone's guess but if they do then you can move on over. We will gladly accept you. Scott Ricketts http://media2.giphy.com/media/IoQBWXhpwsd0c/giphy.gif David Ruddock Apple is almost 100% hardware revenue. Completely different business approach. Lock-in is very important to their success. Kyle Gospodnetich Isn't the high-price of the Pixel evidence of Google going down that path? PS: I am a Pixel XL owner and am definitely locked into Google's ecosystem. Arthur Dent A path on which they have only just begun. One Android phone model, out for less than a year, in the hands of maybe a couple hundred thousand customers vs. several thousand OEM phone models over nearly a decade in the hands of a billion. They have a long way to go, and yet, will never cut out their OEMs either, while Pixel will likely not dominate the market. So it will continue to have to rely on software/ad revenue much more than Apple. Knowledgeborn Allah Unfortunately, these aren't the same thing... Being locked into Google's ecosystem doesn't require any type of specific hardware. In fact, you can use almost all of Google's services on a regular PC by just going to their website. That's their ecosystem. Being locked into Apple's ecosystem is entirely different. For example, you can't make iTunes purchases, read iBooks, send and receive iMessages, talk to someone on FaceTime, or do any of that other Apple-specific stuff without an Apple device. In order to use their services, you have to buy their hardware products. I'm primarily locked into Google's ecosystem too, and my primary devices are an iPhone 7 Plus and an iPad Air 2. I have Android devices too, but I don't need them to stay connected within the ecosystem. dcdttu As easy as it is to say that Google's services (and ads) work perfectly well on both Android and iOS, that may not always be true. Of course you want your own platform to be the best it can be, and Android is 90% there - the glaring exception is messaging. Knowledgeborn Allah How do you explain the fact that nearly all of Google's apps run significantly better in iOS than they do on Android? Google Drive, Google Docs, YouTube, even Gmail - they're all much better and more optimized on iOS than they are on my Android devices, including my Nexus 6P and Pixel XL. Why do you think that is? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Because, Android, as a platform, sucks compared to iOS. Android has a richer API and gives app developers a lot more flexibility, but the basic platform is a mess. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I wouldn't necessarily say that Android "sucks" as a platform, but they definitely have their shortcomings. I'll just say that there's plenty of room for improvement. Lol ddevito Three reasons: 1. Java 2. JVM 3. Flexible app store approval policy Knowledgeborn Allah I see how that's true when it comes to traditional third-party apps... But Google's own apps? Why would they (Google) make THEIR apps more structured and standardized on a competing platform than on their own Android platform? Personally, I think it's because Google doesn't really care about Android. It's a means to an end (establishment of their software and services), and it's not the focus of their business. That's also why they won't fight SOC manufacturers to update Android for longer than 2 years. They don't really care about that, as long as you have Google Play Services installed. ddevito I don't know if I'd go that far, but I'd say their iOS devs are not the same devs who write their Android counterparts. Say what you want about Apple, but their dev platform is pretty sweet. Swift is amazing, Java can't compare. Time for Java to go. Knowledgeborn Allah I would completely agree with you concerning the Swift vs Java factor when it comes to development, if it wasn't for the fact that it's been like this for quite some time. Even when Apple was still using Java, iOS apps were still significantly better than the same apps on Android. Regarding their developers, I can't argue with that, because I honestly don't know. I just know that it seems to be a pattern. Most apps tend to be better on iOS than they are on Android, even though Android has a much larger consumer base. And Google's apps are included in that, and there are very few exceptions. ddevito It's also not just the language but the toolsets. Fire up XCode and open Interface Builder. Then run Android Studio and try to do the same thing. It's a joke. Even Microsoft's Xamarin solution is way better at designing UI elements for Android apps than Android Studio. Apple's software is light years ahead of Android's unfortunately. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... I guess that's the unfortunate position Android is in right now. dcdttu This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution like Assistant later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Jason Rittenhouse Because if you have both then you will use both, and Google doesn't want you using SMS at all because they can't monetize it. dcdttu The majority of Android users using the monitizable data-messaging service while a small minority are using the fallback SMS service is a helluva lot better than virtually nobody using Allo as it is today. Their gamble that Assistant was enough to get people to use Allo without SMS fallback/web client/multi-device support failed miserably. Jason Rittenhouse i didn't think that SMS fallback specifically was the reason nobody is using it (could be wrong though, just going off of personal experience here). personally, i don't care about SMS and don't know anyone else who does either. we all dislike allo regardless of SMS fallback. for us, the other missing features you mentioned are far more important than SMS. dcdttu SMS fallback is crucial for a universal app because it allows you to message people that don't also have the app. Just like iMessage. Most people that don't care about SMS are from a country that's not the USA. wicketr People buying Android phones vs Apple phones is more profitable to Google, right? I would hope that Google is concerned about indirect gains vs direct gains only. Right now, iMessage is the best. It not only locks people into iOS, but it draws people away from Android to iOS. That hurts Google financially. Google should want to create something that frees Apple users of the chains that lock them into iOS. They apparently don't care about that. I mean, why does Google/Android even have voice calling and SMS functionality at all. It's not like adding those features is directly helping their bottom line. Just let Apple make all the devices and focus on making apps/services for iOS, right? /s Knowledgeborn Allah Google makes their iOS apps better than their Android apps, interestingly enough... However, they still need Android to market their services on a wider platform for one major reason: Google Play Services, or, to be more specific, app permissions. Since Apple keeps their ecosystem locked down, there are a lot of things that Google Drive (for example) has access to on an Android device, that it doesn't have access to on an iPhone. The more Android phones are sold, the more information Google (Alphabet) has access to. bekifft No actually it's not necessarily more profitable. Google has tons of apps and services on iOS, many of which are (far) superior to their Android versions. wicketr Well if Android isn't as profitable as iOS for Google then they might as well shut Android down based on the entire point of this article. The only reason to have Android is to make more money than if they just ran all their services on iOS Bottom line is you are completely ignoring the value of Google Play and their entire ecosystem and not having to give Apple a share of their revenue. dcdttu If you're shifting to a revenue-first strategy, I suggest looking at one of the best in the business: Apple. Pay particular attention to their not-directly-profitable-but-massively-important-as-to-why-people-love-their-iPhone messaging platform. Again, iMessage isn't directly profitable for Apple but it's the #1 reason why my iOS friends will never leave the iPhone. I don't think you can find a better argument than that, direct profits be damned. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But we have to keep in mind that Apple is a hardware company. People stick with iMessage, among many other reasons, because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem. Android is too fragmented and diverse for Google to implement a plan like that. Not only do different OEMs have their own messaging services, but, in many cases, the carriers do too! It's very unlikely that all of them with consolidate under Google's banner, which is why Google is now experimenting with this new "Android Messages" platform. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ People stick with iMessage because it's universal across Apple's ecosystem AND you can still use it to SMS people who aren't on Apple's ecosystem. dcdttu That delicious SMS fallback that iMessage and only iMessage has. Allo's product manager flat said (via Twitter) that SMS fallback wasn't necessary because no one wanted it - showing how little Google actually knows about what makes messaging apps successful. This whole argument is ridiculous because if Google would have just made a kick-ass messaging platform with SMS fallback to begin with, they could have then baked in a unique and profitable solution later. Everyone swears you can't have both and I don't know why. Knowledgeborn Allah That's true, and I don't know why people say Android can't have SMS fallback because of Apple's patents. It's not too hard to add SMS fallback into a messaging service on Android. There's a prominent one that already exists on Android: Signal! If you message somebody who has Signal, it sends a Signal encrypted message. If that person doesn't have Signal, it falls back to SMS by default. Google could easily make a messaging app that does something similar to that, but they don't want to do that. Maybe it's because it's not profitable, or maybe it's something else. But, in any case, they could do it. They're just choosing not to. Suicide_Note Maybe Google should buy Signal, and put them in charge of Google's messaging platform for Android? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 As nice as that would be, Google would never go in the direction of Signal (or even Apple), making messages end-to-end encrypted by default, because that would prevent them from getting more information about their users. They need as much information as possible. They couldn't get anything like that from something like Signal or iMessage... Even though, ironically, WhatsApp also encrypts their messages end-to-end, and they're owned by Facebook. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ bekifft Please God no. Leave Signal alone. Craig Nelson In his defense WhatsApp is hugely popular and doesn't have SMS but I agree with you pretty much Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed... Plus, of course, it's the dedicated default standard. Nobody with an iOS device needs to download iMessage. That helps out a lot too. dcdttu Samsung just made Google Play Music its phone's default music player. Gmail is a required app if you want Android with Google Play Services. I guarantee you that Google, if they wanted, could force a messaging standard on Android. Even if they couldn't force it, they surely could have created one good enough that they wouldn't have had to force it - but it may be too late for that. Knowledgeborn Allah Yeah, I think it's too late for them to try to force a messaging app that people would actually use, lol. Now, they could force their hardware partners to put their proprietary messenger into their dedicated Android services package, like how they did with Hangouts. I heard they're halfway trying to do that with Allo, but we'll see how that holds up. dcdttu Yea, that ship has sailed. Makes you wonder how the author thinks all these barely-used apps are going to be profitable when everyone is using iMessage and WhatsApp instead. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... 😂 DragoCubed Yeah. By doing that they can at least enforce that app on devices running that version of Android and higher. That would be the best solution but the thing is that it can't work on iPhones. I've said it before but it seems that Google doesn't want to put any Android exclusives. Google just won't ever do it, even though it would solve the messaging problem. And yeah, it is way too late. Sir_Brizz Android Messages isn't on everything, either, if we're going that direction. Hangouts was a required app so something like Allo that is actually competitive could be as well. Even if it's not, if Google had an app they could recommend that was competitive with iMessage, that would set the right tone for the platform. The fact that you have to go to third parties whose apps aren't even in the same ballpark to get such a popular (in the US) feature says a lot about the tone of Android. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree, but I think people have the wrong idea about iMessage. One of the best things about iMessage is the fact that it's the default messaging platform. Google needs a good messaging app, but they also need it to be the default messaging app on Android. At this point, I don't think that's ever going to happen. Sir_Brizz I don't disagree, but I do think at this point they just need something they can talk about and recommend that is actually competitive and it would at least help improve the platform's image. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. abc All Android users have access to Chrome and every other Google app. Nothing is stopping Google from having a pre-installed messaging app along with their other pre-installed apps. Certainly, more useful than a G+ app that barely anyone uses. Ryan You dont really understand what you are talking about and if you're even remotely correct, Google doesnt understand selling products at all. Messaging is part of a platform. You don't have to make money directly off of messaging. Hell, you can lose money on it directly and still have it contribute to success. Its a loss leader, something you intentionally dont make money off of but it makes you more appealing to customers (and you're wrong on the vendors being the real customers) so you have their focus when you do sell them something that is profitable. Having a better platform means more people want to use it, more peoples data can be sold, more people will buy stuff on Google Play, etc. And that isnt the vendors, its US. The vendors only care if WE will buy their phone, and making Android more appealing means more people will buy their phone than the competing platform (IOS). Josh Brown How do the make money off of Google Photos? How do they make money off of Google Translate? It makes Google's Android attractive to use so that people will use their services. Messaging is a huge part of it. If they are not careful someone will sink money into services and use AOSP to rival Google. Google could be the next Microsoft if they don't stop wasting time and money. ddevito No way, I totally disagree. All these messaging apps make it confusing to the average Android user. When they see their friends and coworkers use iMessage on iPhones and how much SIMPLER it is because it's all in one app, people will use that (among other reasons) to dump Android and get an iPhone. perfectalpha David...you are correct in what you're saying, but Google is really taking a beating in areas that are going to increasingly become important over the next few years. We rave about Google Assistant, but Amazon Alexa is the one getting the play with 3rd party products. You saw it at CES, you see it with smartphones from Huawei, and I even saw it in my email with the Ecobee 4 (cause I'm all bout the smart home as well). Samsung is doubling down on Bixby. Those are the two largest Android smartphone OEMs. That isn't good. For all the great work Google does, they're increasingly shutting themselves out of areas that will prove important in the future. Google relies on services and if consumers are choosing other platforms, it has the chance to negatively impact their existing platforms. Case in example...Facebook has messaging on lockdown. The more users on that platform, the more that will look at Facebook videos and Facebook Live for entertainment vs YouTube. There are people in powerful places anticipating messaging apps being the browsers of the future. It isn't about having a platform out there, as Google+ has shown, you need to have legitimate mindshare with your platform. I personally believe they're past the point of no return when it comes to messaging. They're like Microsoft with Windows Phone...rebooting and hoping they strike gold (they won't). Google is doing well (every tech company is to be honest that doesn't make hardware minus Apple), but they need to be relentless about user experience first and foremost. Saying it is only about money is a bad strategy, especially when Facebook will be kicking their ass with 2 messaging platforms sporting over a billion users a piece. h4rr4r Such a shift among older tech companies is what left a place for Google to exist. The same will happen again. Raymond Hawkins Isn't Android itself quite profitable though? Not just selling to device manufacturers but the portion of every play store purchase that they get? HSidhu David is Google staff. lol netizen Of course It is, what else is something else for from G? :-) George Yup, its just as we suspected... it's definitely about monetizing those stickers... dash It's not so much about money as it is Google not wanting to get sued EU regulators if you ask me they're already under scrutiny in the EU for having a mobile Monopoly if they baked a standard messenger into Android the way iOS has imessage the EU would be all over them for taking money away from carriers and other apps Rod Why doesn't Apple get sued as well? dash Apples market share is much smaller in comparison and they are a closed system only apple makes iphones. Google would be seen as forcing other oems to use it's messaging system Rod Time for Google to pull an Apple! Yay jak_341 I went to WhatsApp. Haven't looked back. Antony Me too this is what this whole Google messaging mess made me do .. TechGuy22 I can't wait for them to unveil a new one at I/0 K77bkny lol and then it'll be discontinued for something else 3 month's later... Mace Moneta The new app is called "G'Day" and it's essentially the same as Allo, but adds sparkle effects to messages. Unfortunately, Allo's code could not be updated to include sparkle effects; a complete rewrite was required, hence the new app. The problem that Google has at this point is that some people would have read that and believed it. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And the text is upside down in this hemisphere. K77bkny and backwards like everything else they do... Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

TechGuy22 nay, they are going to have a go at snapchat lol they tried to copy IMessage, Whatsapp. now only Snapchat and Instagram is left. Adrien Aubel I'm not aware of any new effort from Google, but I'd bet like you on a Snapchat style if there was any new app popping up at I/O this year. Hey G Day could even be their name for it :D Rod The saddest part, is that I can imagine they pushing Instagram-like stuff into Photos. thespacecowboy No. It's called 'Yo'. Oh. Wait. chris tayah that was good lol BoFiS Or just keep using Hangouts, since that allows me to chat across devices and on computers resuming the same conversations everywhere, shame about SMS going away, but that's what Handcent is for ;-) Andrew Well https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/19cc43bc3b8c8f3f63a34987e2e80e342783e665185aa0e887382395eb564e73.jpg bdbplatano That's alotta words Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is why I don't trust Google's ad block strategy. I don't see how they can resist the temptation to use the blocking algorithm to drive more people to use adsense, doubleclick, or any other means of advertising that Google can monetize. Jesse Corbett If I may propose a theory, Google knows that for ads which are otherwise equal in quality, their ability to serve personalized ads is without a doubt the best, this is likely less about improving user experience and more about creating a level playing ground, where other companies can't use cheap tactics like bad ads to get the upper hand. No need to prefer their own ads, because when all ads are equal, Google will win every time. b_boogey_xl I like Allo. Arthur Dent Al-lol b_boogey_xl Oh, and Duo is NOT a messaging app. Please stop grouping it in when you need to make the lame point of the amount of messaging apps that are available from Google. Antony What do you like allo for ? Does it offer anything different from an app with much bigger user base like WhatsApp ? Really curious to know b_boogey_xl I use Allo to talk to friends and family, whom we've all switched from Hangouts. Honestly, I don't need the entire world on the app so long as the people I talk to the most are on it. I'm in the US so WhatsApp isn't that big over here. I also do enjoy using all the little features that it offers, like shout and whisper, Assistant in conversations is actually useful, not for everything but useful and I'm sure Google will have more tricks up their sleeve for it. Allo the app isn't a bad messenger at all, by far. It's light weight, fast and runs really well. I find that people who complain about All aren't really talking about the experience of using the app but more about having to download a new service and convince others to use it (hence no one is using it jokes 🙄) but to me, you're either part of the solution or apart of the problem when it comes to who uses it. Funny thing is, if we all decided to use it, there wouldn't be a problem. 7-down I like Meelo more. Google's new messaging app in beta testing right now. b_boogey_xl … 🙄 abc At least there's one of you. b_boogey_xl HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Oh man!! That was so funny. You are hilarious!!! It's so funny and clever!!! I totally get it. It's like you're trying to imply that Allo isn't popular so I must be the only one using the app!! Wow! Genius!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/05459ebf579e28adaea54382e65d7597fa0c10c35ea549fbe30b5a8e142a42aa.gif Shane Redman "Unfortunately for Allo, not having SMS fallback in North America all but ensures it cannot be successful." Is this not the incentive that they need to get more users on Allo? Sure, it doesn't bring in anything from messages, but it DOES bring in more users! Which have to be minimal right now (even though I think Allo is an awesome messenger, no one I know uses it beyond 2 friends). Sir_Brizz I'm the same. I actually like Allo but almost nobody I know uses it for several reasons. Marty That's probably the case with Chrome too, why Google won't ever improve it. Ryu "I have a simple rule in life—if something does not seem make sense, look for the money." Is the typo in the first sentence intentional because it has money in it? If so, clever. If not, you are missing a "to" before make. :P Anyhow, good article. David Ruddock Fixed, I may have messed that up. mark555055d yep, this is no longer yesterday's Google. "Don't be evil need" not apply. Antony Yep . Since the created alphabet that model seems to have changed 😭 Charles This is so very very true, it started with The death of Nexus, then Pixel pricing, and continues today in the smallest of changes such as moving your Google Home shopping list from the more convenient Keep to the lagging Google Express. There's a huge push at Google campus right now for profitability over consumer appeasement and sadly enough it is starting to show through in the end results more and more frequently... Antony Totally agree with you .. this is one of the main reasons why I am considering switching to iPhones ddevito Same here. I just switched full-time to my iPhone 6s (from OnePlus 3) and I don't miss Android yet. The apps are WAY better, the OS is way more polished and simpler, and the whole device is frankly just more reliable. I use my OP3 less and less everyday. Google is sinking their own ship Sir_Brizz I don't really get the "iOS is simpler" POV. I find it harder to do just about anything on iOS. Having a consistent and friendly messaging solution is one thing, but has nothing to do with the OS really. ddevito I find Android way more powerful, flexible and capable. But on it may do fewer things than Android, but it does (most) of them better. Notifications are still rather rubbish, and sharing data between apps still isn't there yet. But everything else is great. 3D touch is so amazing, I wish more apps used it properly. Sir_Brizz I've had to use iPhones for work in the past but I can count on one hand the number of times I even remembered that 3D Touch was a thing. My wife exclusively uses an iPhone 7+ and she doesn't even know what 3D Touch is. It's a gimmicky feature that sounds good in a presentation but really doesn't end up being used much. I'm not arguing that iOS doesn't have some advantages over Android. I would rate the platform higher in some key areas. However, if notifications are an important facet of your device, I don't see how you can rely on iOS. They really are that bad in comparison. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know several people with iPhones. I've never seen them use 3D Touch or Siri. Sir_Brizz I feel the same. I've showed my wife 3D Touch a few times on her 7+. She thought it was interesting at the times, but I asked her about it today and she said "What is that?" ddevito Just because most people don't know it exists doesn't make it not useful. I agree most people don't know what it is, then again most people who have iPhones don't care about tech at all really, they just want to text and post to Facebag. ddevito 3D Touch isn't gimmicky at all, I'd argue every smartphone should have it. Hell Android copied it. It's very useful to get something direct out of an app. Android had app shortcuts which were essentially the same thing but it never caught on. Notifications aren't the worst, rich notifications are actually really powerful, but really they just need to be simply grouped in iOS and it'll be much better. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'd argue that it's not intuitive, and not easy to use. You have to get used to the pressure that gets the result. The S Pen hover for the Note is much more intuitive because it just happens. You don't have to think about it. That's one of the main reasons I'd miss the S Pen if I get an iPhone. The other is that the S Pen makes selecting text incredibly easy. Much easier than using your finger. ddevito I totally disagree - just push down with your finger, it's quite easy. Once you use it a few times on a few apps you know how to do it. My wife borrowed my iPhone for a few days and she even got used to it and said she wished her 6P had something similar (which it does, but the context is way different). I do agree with copying and pasting text. I like Android's way better, it's faster. On iOS it takes a while, quite annoying. Using the Google Keyboard takes even longer. Sir_Brizz App shortcuts and 3D Touch aren't anything alike really. In one scenario they kind of offer similar results. App shortcuts never caught on because there is a fundamental problem with the concept and that is lack of intuitiveness. The current implementation has the same problem. However, I think Google just realized it was pointless to remove just because most people won't ever use it. And you can now add app shortcuts directly to your home screen which actually increases the usability in the end. Anyway, 3D Touch is still a gimmick designed for a presentation. And the notifications are abysmal on iOS. I'm not being overly critical about it, it really is just that much worse on iOS than Android. I literally rely on receiving and responding to my notifications. I would constantly miss them on iOS. ddevito How is getting a direct result, or a specific screen within an app (or others) gimmicky? It provides a faster way to get the data you want, then get out. So since you're such an expert it seems, besides not being able to respond directly to notifications, and not being grouped, what else makes iOS notifications so "abysmal"? I don't disagree that Android's are better, I'm just generally curious on why you think this is so. I'm looking forward to your OBjective answer ;-) Sir_Brizz The specific capability you are talking about may or may not be gimmicky. The 3D Touch functionally is a gimmick, though. It's entire purpose is to present well. The majority of iOS problems with notifications are just discoverability. But that by itself is a big enough problem that it really drops it down that far. Most people I know with iPhones have a tendency to just completely miss notifications of texts and messages if they don't see and respond to them right away. I understand because I had the exact same problem with my iPhone. ddevito I totally agree without having them stay persistent you can totally miss them. Android's notification tray is very underrated and underappreciated Sir_Brizz Yeah, that's all I was saying. Sorry for the confusion :) ddevito Thanks mate. Trust me I'm a huge Android fan, rocking a OnePlus 3 right now also. I prefer Android, just hope this hardware holds up. Sir_Brizz I really hope the Pixel 2 is actually no compromises. ddevito You and me both. ddevito What's important to me is getting updates when they're released, having good and consistent battery life, having good customer support if I need it, having a good and consistent camera, and enjoying great apps. Sure Android can give me most of that, but never all of any of them, I love the OS and ecosystem but the hardware is lacking. I'm not a Samsung fan so I feel I don't have any great high end options. And the Pixel isn't proven yet, it needs to show massive improvement for the second iteration. Is the iPhone perfect? Hell no, it's a toy, it's restrictive and dumbed down in lots of ways. But the damn thing just works, every time. Sir_Brizz Honestly, most of that is regularly subjective. If you like the iPhone, that's great. But it's not an all around improvement from Android, it's trading one set of compromises for another set. ddevito Oh I agree, I'm not saying the iPhone is the smartphone I've been waiting for all these years. I'm just saying my priorities have shifted, I expected Android to catch up in a lot of areas. It has for most of them, but I feel personally it still needs a alot of revamping for the most basic of things, like the ones I mentioned. Rod Faulty battery? ddevito I hope not. I've had it since October and it's been great, but ever since upgrading to Nougat battery life has gone South. I'm hoping OnePlus can fix it. Rod What caused such drain, then? ddevito No idea, I don't see too many wakelocks so the only culprit left is Android OS - so probably Oxygen OS ersouza It's an interesting theory, but there's no real concrete evidence here that the approach is at all profitable. And if this approach is somehow a profitable one, why aren't other companies diversifying their messaging apps like Google has? David Ruddock No one is saying the approach is profitable. That's a very different question. The issue is that apps like Allo and Android Messages RCS *can* have profitable business models. There's no guarantee any of it will work. ersouza But you're saying "follow the money" while showing no concrete proof that this is a profitable approach. It kind of needs to do that. There's been more than ample time to determine one way or the other, giving how long they've been messing with at least 2-3 different messaging services at a time. newtonfb That was one of the best articles on AP in a long time. Finally, a well fact based article arguably the most controversial aspects of Android. Morten Ulv People always ask "WHY?", but never stop to think on that question before going on a rant of how stupid Google is and how they don't understand what is so obvious to everyone else. Why didn't Google just focus on Hangouts? The ability to advertise on the service may have been a factor, but I'm not convinced that this has ever been a driving factor for Google. "Build a great service (that people want to use) and the money will come" has always been their motto. Hangouts is a niche product with little chance to capture significant market share. There are currently 3 ways to make a successful messaging app: 1. Piggyback on a social network like Messenger. And that is what Google tried with G+. 2. Bundle it on the users of an OS like iMessage, but Google can't force Hangouts on users like Apple can. 3. Spread through the use of phone numbers. And since this is the only currently known option left, Google had to create a new app to ever have the chance to capture the market. But what chance do they have in a saturated market? At the end of the day, what we enthusiasts think, matter little to the strategy Google has to go for. It may bother our OCD that Google has multiple apps, but there is no better way to succeed, unless you have a time machine. Christopher Bement They can totally monetize Hangouts. Gmail saves a chat log, they already scan your Gmail for ad service and Google now information. Morten Ulv I'm inclined to agree. The problem with Hangouts was it's low growth potential. makapav Everything has a low growth potential if you don't have a vision and you throw idiotic developers at it. makapav Google already has everyone's email address in your contact address book. That should have been enough to integrate your communication with everyone else on your contact list without the need for having the invite b******* that currently exists and hangouts. This would have been just like What's App. Every Android phone is activated with a Gmail account. Link that to a phone number and your set from all three points. Morten Ulv Hm? Whatsapp uses phone numbers, just like Allo. And the problem isn't getting people's contacts, its to get people to use the app. Rod The own name is questionable. makapav Google didn't care and thought they could take the same lazy half baked approach with Allo as Hangouts. Even today Hangouts has 10% feature parity with mainstream competitors while Allo has 5%. They took one year to develop features into Hangouts. You can't capture market with poor app discoverability, immature product and no user engagement of feedback. The failure of Hangouts is not happenstance or competition, it is Google's laziness and poor product management. UtopiaNH Hangouts was under the google + team which lost direction, leadership and backing when Google+ became a wide joke and leadership backed away from the plan and the main architect of it left the company. It only recently got moved internally to the Gapps team as things got restructured internally. Rod Allo is even worse. They must not think about how the app name sounds in other languages. Telegram, for example, sounds OK in other languages as well. It's straightforward. abc Yeah, except nobody is using their messaging apps, so maybe they should have listened to what people were saying. So many people said they had no reason to switch from an app that all their contacts use to an app that no one uses. Until Google has an answer to that question, they are wasting their own time. Morten Ulv Capturing huge market shares with any social app is extremely hard to do. Sure you can win over us geeks with the right features, but that doesn't convince the market at large. You just have to have the right app at the right time and get lucky. No successful messaging app started with a core of geeks (not that it would hinder success, it's just not needed). They may fail, but how would you know that without trying? You don't. makapav Saw your other responses. You are borderline a fanboy or trolling. Google dropped the ball and didn't even give Hangouts a chance. They are fully to blame. Morten Ulv Hangouts didn't live up to it's potential, but it is unlikely that it could have gained a lot of traction among regular people. As you, I would have loved it if they just made one great app for us, and not giving a fuck if they had a billion users or not. Here I was only offering explanations as to why, just as the article did. I may very well be a fanboy, while you take the role of armchair geniusbesserwisser. Fresh360 I thought I was about to read a satirical rant about greed but was pleasantly surprised that this article is so well written and informative. I really thought Google had it all wrong but maybe, just maybe they are doing it all right (financially). dcdttu Except, you know, if Google wanted to really profit from messaging, they'd create something that drove people toward their messaging products, not away. I highly doubt their current approach profits at all with such low adoption rates. They'd have been better off with one solid app. MikeOxlong That's because there was no David Rudduck involvement. Think about it... 4Ui812 Make it now break it .... remake it now break it. That seems to be Google's strategy. Antony The only thing that this strategy from Google made me realize is that Google is no longer a company that wants to change the world it is just yet another company that seeks revenue and the only thing I did here is totally neglect any messaging or social app by Google. and just switch to someone who is actually passionate about connecting people which is Facebook's WhatsApp and a small company like telegram and one day maybe even switch to iOS . Their business model is clearer pay for what you get while Android is too complicated . Steve Jobs was right Ailín Ó’S This is why I just use WhatsApp. It has all my friends/family on it and all the features I want. No need to bother with Google and their ridiculous policy of "let's have a million messaging apps" Andrew Whatsapp would be a solid 9/10 for me if they let me use the system emoji, I get that it makes it universal but I like my yellow blobs Ailín Ó’S Yeah I agree, I get that WhatsApp do it for uniformity but it's annoying to see different emoji on Facebook Messenger and Hangouts (for example), but WhatsApp is by far the king of messaging in Europe so ho hum! Rod What? Whatsapp is horrid. Telegram stomps on it. Sir_Brizz That's ok, but you are dealing with Facebook and their let's have a million ways to message people. I feel like WhatsApp still has a huge question mark over it for the foreseeable future. Who knows what will happen when Facebook finally decides to try to make back their 12 billion dollars. Cakefish Thank Gaben that Valve isn't a public traded company. Sam Del Valle Google has a messaging addiction https://media.giphy.com/media/l4Ki2obCyAQS5WhFe/giphy.gif Jose Romero I gave up on Allo and Hangouts. I also ported my Google Voice number into T-mobile. All I use now is Android Messages and I don't miss the others at all. Suicide_Note Messages is one of their best apps, for sure. Adonis K. I don't even use Messages anymore switched it to Facebook's Messenger. freshprince_87 Facebook messenger is buggy and garbage. Your better off using Whatsapp Adonis K. First of Android Messages is an SMS app. I said I use Messenger as an alternative to Messages which means I'm using Messenger to send and recieve SMS. How on earth will Whatsapp help me with that? It's completely offtopic freshprince_87 No it isn't off topic. Most people don't Facebook messenger for SMS. They most likely use their default SMS app on their phone. And since you said you use Facebook messenger, I assumed you used it for instant messaging. And if that was the case, whatsapp is the better option in most cases. The new iMessage for Android called invi is something you should use instead of Facebook messenger. It does both IM and SMS Ryan It seems more simple than all of this, they a disjointed and unorganized organization. They want to change things but nobody is actually controlling the monkeys at the typewriters. Messaging is a critical part of the PLATFORM. The platform that secures Google's space in mobile search, music, etc. They dont monetize messaging or Android, the monetize selling you the crap through it AND selling your information. So there is money to be made in losing money developing messaging. Its used everywhere and its called a "loss leader." Its something you dont expect to make money on to get people in the doors to buy something you do make money on. Its not as simple as "make money or be taken out back to be shot." You dont understand business well enough. Law One of the biggest flaws people bring up when they talk about Android is, "oh, it seems so hard to use" I don't think it is but sometimes, most times, consumers want a unified type of service across the board that is recognizable. ddevito Let's compare Apples to Apples shall we? (I use an iPhone 6s and OnePlus 3 daily) Despite this mess, Allo whips iMessage. The Google bot, gif search, and easier (and way more flexible) file share makes iMessage look outdated and slow. All iMessage is good for is for SMS, sending confetti and balloons. Jordan L I think Allo works great too, me and about 5 other people I chat with use it. web client and chat back up will make it even better. Suicide_Note I like Allo a lot, but use it only with my wife, since it lacks SMS fallback. For all of my other contacts i just use Google Messages. I don't want to ask people to install a particular app just to be able to message them. If Google incorporated SMS fallback into Allo, it'd be the only messaging app i need/use. Sir_Brizz Same, but it does really need chat history backup and a web client and maybe integration into Fi/Voice for me. Jordan L I've always said this: google just needs to make Allo enrollment mandatory on ALL android devices. solved. I guess this can't happen. iMessage enrollment is automatic when you setup a new iphone, so EVERYONE iphone user is enrolled! most people with phones are REALLY bad at tech. they can barely install/setup apps. BUT they sure as hell will go though the initial phone setup. this is where you have to put the enrollment. Adrien Aubel But then you still couldn't reach all your iPhone friends right? Allo won't support SMS :( Jordan L But a default enrollment/install of Allo would lead to 1+ billion installs. At that point iPhone people might actually install Allo.... Ahhhhh but I just contradicted myself. Most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps. Hmmm.... Then we do need RCS or SMS. Adrien Aubel Hehe, basically Btw, most iPhone users don't like installing chat apps because they have one that works great for them out of the box, called Messages, doing almost everything they'd want to and letting them reach *any* friend. Which is what we're trying to build for Android at invi :) Rod Monopoly. Grey Look at Hangouts Chat - the new app. Look at how it integrates with all of Google's other offerings. THAT is a way to generate revenue. THAT is the power of a good messaging app. If Hangouts Chat features were integrated into regular Hangouts, you'd see an app everyone wanted to use. And guess what, Hangouts already supports stickers. It's not hard. Don't make excuses. Google is clueless, not trying to "drive their bottom line". ddevito While I generally agree with this article, this is obvious - if you're going down this route, then why not just mention that Android in general is a simpler, better and most effective way to generate more ad revenue for Google? This messaging mess isn't a way to make money, it's a clear sign of lack of leadership and product vision. mickeyB88 Its either nostalgia or naivety, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been continually growing more cynical of products over the years, and it just like you said. When it doesn't make sense to/for a consumer, follow the money. It seems as if there was a "back in the day" of technology where all anyone made was something that improved over a previous iteration, but it's always the money, whether they generate a faithful install base and change later or just keep that base by slowly changing so the shock doesn't cause mass exodus. Any product that starts out as genuinely useful either continues to be so, but loses money because they're not "innovating", or it changes to the detriment of the user because it's losing money. This can apply to pretty much any product marketed, whether it be games (f2p especially) or a product with apps that are "free" to use. We take all the data collection that Google does for granted because they deliver useful products, but then you have situations where they can't stop making new apps and refuse to market them properly, or don't seem to try to get new users at all. Then the app ends up like Allo, with a huge initial install number then quickly dying off. This bullshit is exactly what's pushing me to lean towards an iPhone, but I know eventually that bubble will burst (if it isn't already) and we're left with two platforms that don't seem to be very consumer-friendly. Bill Didn't Google try to buy WhatsApp for a lot of money? Sir_Brizz Rumor has it. Luxferro be glad they didn't, as they likely would have ruined it Sir_Brizz Don't get too excited. Rod As if it wasn't bad enough already. Lol Luxferro I have never used it. but considering how popular it is worldwide, they did something right. The same can't be said for anything Google has made. The only reason their messaging apps have 1/2 the stats they do is they pre-installed them at one point in time, and probably count app updates as install #'s. Rod It came out when there was barely any competition, and SMS was expensive in developing countries. People loved the idea of messaging "for free". That's why it sticked. But, as a service, Whatsapp sucks. The backup sucks, the in-built gallery sucks, the database code sucks.... SunnyStroker Always believed that a prerequisite for employment at Google was you must have ADD, (attention deficit disorder). They simply cannot complete anything stable without moving onto something else. Google; Always Half-Baked, Always in Beta johdaxx You figure their bill paying for an SMPP connector isn't cheap either...someone's got to pay the tremendously exorbitant prices for the SMSs, even if you're buying them wholesale. Kevin Davis The screenshot at the end of the article says it all for me. Not no, but HELL NO. 1/2 a dozen apps to communicate effectively. GTFOH. perfectalpha Hands down one of the best articles written that clearly illustrates why silly decisions get made and PERHAPS provides them with insights why their place of employment makes silly decisions. Here's the deal, everything you posted above is EXACTLY why Google cannot build a successful messaging app. The whole purpose of a communications app is to help people communicate. If Google is more concerned about getting data from the content, it is an automatic failure because they're putting internal interests ahead of user experience. We have heard time and time again what folks want, yet Google continues to fail on delivering that. Again, everybody posting knows what is common sense, but it is what it is. Margaritas Ante Porcos IMO the only thing Google achieved by now is that we all ignore Google messaging solutions in favour of Whatsapp. Google lost millions of users in that regard. If Google sees money in losing apps users than be it. Jokes aside, Google has not only lost millions of specific apps users but also reputation. That will be hard to rebuild. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ca30070f6fabc67579625a0df20395e6b673d828a835fe66eaf0b630f8d66a7.jpg F4LL0U7 Very well written article -- I bet you're 100% right. I'm sticking with Hangouts. Since I use my Google Voice number for everything, my texts and voicemail still go through that app, as well as my Hangouts obviously. I was forced to install the Android Messenger, but basically only for SMS updates from my carrier. Brett Linking Google's messenger mess to a fiduciary duty is quite a reach. Shareholder derivative suits are a threat for any public company, but this is a vast overstatement of Google's Board's obligations. The Business Judgment Rule gives the Board wide latitude to make decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of the company (whether immediately leading to a profit or not). And Google/Alphabet has shown time and time again that it will allow experimentation to occur -- even at a great loss -- for years with only the potential for a payout far down the road. See driverless cars, Glass, Chrome etc.which don't directly make a single penny. Even these *vastly more expensive* projects don't lead to shareholder derivative suits. And investors are warned in the 10K that: "The idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term. We won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking "What if?" and then working hard to find the answer. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm Google may have decided each of its projects needs to be more self-sustaining, but that's a typical business decision and has nothing to do with a fiduciary duty. Contrary to what's presented here, Google's Board does not have an "obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability." If that were the case, every public company not consistently increasing profits would be in breach of the duty. That's simply not the case. The decision may be part of a realization that Google's traditional ad business cannot print money forever (and certainly not at an ever-increasing pace). And it may even be fair to cite that as a reason for the messaging strategy. But there are all sorts of motivations, turf wars, and simple bad decision making which are just as likely to be the real reason. Sir_Brizz This is very much right on. I think Occam's Razor does apply a bit here: the simplest explanation is simply that Google doesn't have (or at least hasn't had) a clear vision of their messaging strategy and split themselves in too many directions a few years ago when they bought Jibe. Essentially, bad decision making over the past 2-3 years if not as far back as when Hangouts was announced. IMO part of the issue is that Hangouts started getting feature bloat, and adding things like chat bots to it was probably not possible, or at least caused enough problems that they didn't want to. Hangouts Chat looks like a fundamental rewrite probably as was Allo. These represent the future concerns of a Google messaging strategy. Expect chat bots to make up a major part of that over the next couple of years. My personal frustration is simply the fact that Google doesn't have one messaging platform that is competitive with one single competing messaging platform. All of their solutions together aren't, either. Monetarily it doesn't make sense for them to live so far behind the curve on something that has been increasingly becoming a fundamental function of the markets they are trying to survive within. t_newt It is not just about money--it is also about people. I get the feeling all the drama we hear rumors about, and the result of people leaving at the top of the company, has created a vacuum of leadership, and powerful people move quickly to fill that vacuum. Innovative companies that start letting their accountants, lawyers, or even HR start running the company quickly lose their innovation, and if there is effective, innovative competition, they quickly lose their marketshare. The reason Google has a lot of customers (or, more accurately, lots of people using their products that they can sell to advertisers), is that Android provides a useful ecosystem. If they lose track of that, they will lose people and will lose advertisers. Saying that messaging has to be profitable by itself is like a car company saying that the car trunk has to be profitable. A CFO at GM can tell the trunk engineer "show me how this is making us money or take it out of the design!" I like Android products. They are useful in organizing my life. But if Google loses track of that, I will (reluctantly) switch to an iPhone. A CFO doesn't think that way, which is why the CFO should be an advisor, not a leader. I hope Google doesn't become the next MySpace. headpiece747 This article was making me think of something that I hope Android Police would write about. What is the best messaging app with sms? I have been a die hard Hangout user since I have been on Android and never used nothing else. Would like a comparison of each. I am stuck using sms because everyone at work is on different platforms (ios, android and flip phone no joke) and they won't all go to one chat app like whatsapp or allo even though I haven't used either one. Suicide_Note I use Google Messages since it allows me to send/receive from anyone, whether they are on Android/iOS/Windows, or using a smart/dumb phone. Adrien Aubel Please try out invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi). It's an app that we're making, that is quite new and trying to solve specifically the problem you're talking about, transparently bringing IM when both people have the app. Another great option is Textra, more customization (we're about to ship significant changes though), although it doesn't support IM and even though they initially talked about supporting RCS I believe they gave up. We're actively talking with both Google and Samsung to be on top of it. Would love to get your feedback! Maybe try both? MeCampbell30 There is a lot wrong with this article and a few questionable journalism decisions. "In order to get a business case approved by a CFO like Ms. Porat, little else matters but the bottom line." Even in an editorial it's generally best to avoid assertions that could be considered borderline defamatory unless you have evidence or facts to support it. Perhaps the author does, but it isn't made clear in the body of the article. I also have to say the explanation about the law on fiduciary duties, shareholder derivative actions (lawsuits on behalf of the corporation), and the actual practice of Wall Street law firms is not accurate. I wrote more on reddit but an editor should go back and double check the sourcing on those statements. Also, typically, at least with organizations I'm familiar with, it's the job of a project manager to submit a proposal to the project management office (PMO) to get funding approval for big changes or more developer time. For even larger changes, it goes to an executive committee. The CFO is typically part of that committee (sometimes depending on expertise) but the day to day of the CFO is usually regulatory (complying with SEC, CFTC, import, ect. regulations and managing all of alphabets various accounts globally). At a company like Google it would be staffed by hundreds of people all around the world. As far as the logical thrust of the article, its not very consistent. RCS doesn't really provide a new income stream for Google. Nor does Googles noble effort to improve Android Messages. From a financial point of view, it would be more worthwhile to have a greater share of high spending users (attracted by a cohesive messaging system) than it would be to have more information on less spendy users (or more clickthroughs from those users). Brett Amen. I wrote a similar response before seeing yours: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah Trevor Newman Not sure it was borderline defamatory. It was a simile describing the generalized thought process of generalized people hired to ensure the financial success of a company. I do appreciate your thoughtful explanation of the project funding approval process (not being facetious). I understand that many companies have a tiered approval process with dollar amount thresholds granting certain persons the authority to authorize funding. My statements were meant to infer that business cases generally require a financial upside to receive funding, whether that is by the PMO or the CFO. While I am not positive that Allo required approval of the CFO, that was not the point of the article. It was meant as an opinion piece, not a scholarly treatise on Google. Just wanted​ to remind people that Google is a company and that they are subject to the same pressures as any other business. John Marshall’s Ghost Just FYI, this obligated by law to generate shareholder value through regularly increasing profitability. is not true. Fiduciary duty does not require anyone to increase. It merely requires a company to not engage in fraud, self-dealing or other instances that basically amount to theft, embezzlement, etc. This is a misconception that has gone hand in hand with the maxim of "maximizing shareholder value." It's wrong and please stop perpetuating the myth. Profits are subject to business decisions and business decisions that do not result in profit are not actionable in court absent a finding of fraud, self-dealing, etc. Source: Corporate attorney Yu Ping Hu It's not just that fiduciary duty wouldn't require maximized or increased profitability; there IS NO FIDUCIARY DUTY of a corporation to its shareholders. https://www.nixonpeabody.com/en/ideas/articles/2017/03/13/massachusetts-high-court-rules-that-public-company-directors-owe-fiduciary-duty-to-corporation John Marshall’s Ghost There is a fiduciary duty because officers and employees can't self-deal. Also, you liked a case from MA. There are 50 states plus federal law. That means 51 sets of laws. In NY officers owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. But that duty does not require the maximization of shareholder value. MeCampbell30 You're misreading that. First, that is not a uniform rule among all states. Alphabet is a Delaware corporation, not a Massachusetts one. Second, there is little practical difference. A corporation's officers have a fiduciary duty to the owners (either the shareholders outright or their representatives on the board of directors). This rule is mostly procedural in that it acts as a bar on cases that tend to have less merit. MeCampbell30 Also an attorney in finance. I wrote as much in my post. Brett Yup. See my similar response: http://disq.us/p/1i1bpah David Ruddock Thanks for the insight here. I've removed the section on fiduciary duty pending some more discussion of this internally. Appreciate everyone who pointed this out - we don't want to mislead anyone here, and a note has been placed in the relevant section. John Marshall’s Ghost I just have to comment that that was very responsible of you and commendable. Thank you for doing that. The whole "maximizing shareholder value" is required by law is a huge pet peeve of mine. Responses like this are why I trust AP. Christopher Bement This is the biggest reason I read AP every day if my life. You guys have a fucking scary commitment to integrity and I love that. extesy You only have to look at Amazon for specific examples: zero profit for 15+ years, as decided by Jeff Bezos. Trevor Newman You are right, I misstated that it was a legal obligation. The black letter text defining fiduciary duty in Delaware state law, where Google is incorporated, does not list increasing profitability as a fiduciary duty owed by a corporation to its shareholders. However, like any statutory language, it possesses ambiguity and it is open to interpretation. Case law on the matter suggests that legal opinions are admittedly mixed. However, courts have interpreted the language of the fiduciary duty to include maximizing the economic value of the company, and by extension its shareholders. I based my intentionally hyperbolic statement on the basis on court opinions like the following written by Justice Chandler, formerly of the Delaware Court of Chancery: “Having chosen a for-profit corporate form, the craigslist directors are bound by the fiduciary duties and standards that accompany that form. Those standards include acting to promote the value of the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. The "Inc." after the company name has to mean at least that. Thus, I cannot accept as valid for the purposes of implementing the Rights Plan a corporate policy that specifically, clearly, and admittedly seeks not to maximize the economic value of a for-profit Delaware corporation for the benefit of its stockholders—no matter whether those stockholders are individuals of modest means[106] or a corporate titan of online commerce. If Jim and Craig were the only stockholders affected by their decisions, then there would be no one to object. eBay, however, holds a significant stake in craigslist, and Jim and Craig's actions affect others besides themselves.” - Ebay Domestic Holdings, Inc. v. Newmark Civil Action No. 3705-CC. Court of Chancery of Delaware It was never my intention for this to be a legal opinion and I do appreciate you calling this out as it was also not my intention to mislead. I also appreciate David's swift action in removing that portion so as to also not perpetuate the misstatement. I will be sure to avoid this kind of “absolute” language when describing matters such as that. 4Ui812 Sorry for your loss Cuba https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7396d722df5e3e069a320bcb2bded5cf4f113d3dc4d757cf83ec05f4c0c39f4f.gif John That makes no sense whatsoever. Google for Android forced everyone to use Assistant. It could have done the same for Hangouts. Or at least offered it as an option without creating a bunch of separate products, losing Hangouts users, and losing the ability to monetize on the desktop. Moreover, SMS, while not ideal, can still be analyzed and monetized if it's used within a Google app. By informing users that not all features are available without carrier RCS support, it would have put pressure on carriers to add support. I.e., Hangouts user base could have been used to promote RCS. NoNotTellingYou Fantastic article. There really is a madness behind the madness. Anthony Maki Well written! I think this makes a very compelling case. What about Duo, though? Hard to make revenue from E2E-encrypted video/audio. David Ruddock Probably just to couple it up to Allo as a value-add if you ask me. I think the two are destined only to become more tightly integrated - if Allo succeeds. If Allo doesn't, then Duo doesn't have to die alongside it. Sir_Brizz The article essentially heads off the "value-add" argument, though. Why would they have one value-add app and not another? David Ruddock I won't pretend to have all the answers here, and I agree, it's not exactly clear why Duo exists. I was offering a potential explanation, though I admit it's not rock solid. Sir_Brizz I'll be honest, the article leaves me sitting here more confused than resolute about what is going on :) Adrien Aubel App developers will be able to integrate with Duo although it'll be more of a button that opens the app full screen. They almost did that with Hangouts but eventually didn't. Like you I could see this popping up in the dialer (although RCS is coming up), messages, and possibly any other Google app. Nick Felker I wonder how Google will respond to this article. It hits very hard into their reasoning and I imagine it will rustle a few engineers. Suicide_Note They won't say a peep. They never do. Adrien Aubel They do read it, at least their execs do. Although for them, whenever they write publicly online, it suggests that they write the opinion of Google as a company, even if it was probably their own, so they're not as free as you or me. But whenever I bring up something I saw online that wasn't officially public yet they're like "Where? Android Police? Probably." Lateef Alabi-Oki Projects now have to be approved by Porat? Hmmm... not too sure about that. From what I've heard the culture at Google is heavily anti-suit. I don't think Larry or Sergey will go for that. I know Porat is reigning back on moonshots, but I hear even she has to thread a thin line. And before you say, "Google is a publicly traded company...shareholders...blah blah blah." Google has been a publicly traded company for almost two decades, and Larry and Sergey have publicly told shareholders to go fuck themselves on several occasions. Google at a fundamentally level is a company that just doesn't care about shareholders. And while Porat may have been hired to try to instill financial discipline at the company, I don't think it will ever be at the expensive of the engineering ethos of Google. Messaging is a value-add to a platform. It's not a revenue generating endeavor. I doubt any monetization from messaging will shift the needle at Google. The messaging fiasco at Google is the result of a lack of vision, mismanagement, and bad leadership. Google just never took messaging seriously until it was too late, and Facebook started kicking its ass. Holla Is it still not common in US that everybody uses Whatsapp? Gabriel Macys Does it support SMS? Because I have zero interest in shilling apps on my friends and family unless it supports a cross-platform communication standard. Adrien Aubel We're building an iMessage-like app for Android that has 2 main goals: - Try to solve texting on Android (interestingly we're quite close to Google and meet with them regularly) - Bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages being plain text. A bar suggests relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps them make their messages more personal (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. If any enthusiast person wants to try it out, I'd love to receive brutally honest feedback: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi (it's US only for a couple more weeks though, sorry) AP won't really talk about us but to be fair they've heard about us from previous iterations as well, before we recoded the whole app with a different dev team etc. ipsofact I will download and test the state of the art technology. Although I have a few ideas myself. Lets connect and talk Adrien Aubel Sounds good :) I don't mind sharing with you part of our roadmap and exchange over it. We're in some way trying to bridge the gap between SMS and IM hassle-free, while bridging the gap between texting and Snapchat. ipsofact Sent you a linkedin request. Thanks Mike I'm very interested in this app and just downloaded it! Any chance of RCS being added to it in the future? Adrien Aubel We absolutely want that! We're actively talking to both Google and Samsung. Google is shy sharing their client and some technical details. It may not be stable or documented enough, but they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more interested actively contributing but we're still in early talks. Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to! Actively talking with the relevant people at Google and Samsung. Google is a bit shy sharing their client or technical details. It may be not as stable or documented as they want before sharing externally, and they eventually want to make it part of Android system APIs in a future version. Samsung is more actively collaborating but we're still in early talks. Can't wait to have another technology to transparently upgrade our users to when available :) Adrien Aubel We absolutely want to!

Adrien Aubel We wanted to focus on making a good product for the US before opening it to everybody. But we're revamping right now our support system and allowing a manual IM registration (Americans are automatically verified) to allow us to offer our features to other countries, and we're about to translate our materials and app, while giving multi-language to the Awesome Bar, to make it more relevant. We hope to be opened internationally within the next 3 weeks, will keep you informed! ipsofact LOL I was in a group messaging with 4 other iphones. 1 android. iMessage & RCS do not play well... Wesley Da’Nomad WhatsApp? How about some love for Signal? freshprince_87 What about loving the invi app instead. It's basically iMessage for Android Rod No messaging service can compete with Whatsapp's user base. Maybe WeChat. Isaac Fischer So, just so we're clear between this post and the last one: Trevor's official job function is to be the disgruntled malcontent who kinda likes Android but doesn't really like Google? He's "mansplaining" to us why we're sheeple? 🙃 Trevor Newman I actually love Google. I wish they made a single messaging app but I've come to terms with the fact that as long as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger have billions of users between them and my family clings to Skype for video chatting...a single Google messenger would just be one more on the pile. People think I don't like Google but it's just not true. Mostly I'm just trying to understand them. Ben The problem is, Allo has catastrophically failed to collect any data because the Google nerds (essentially the entire readership of this site) were the only ones that downloaded the app. Given that, it's highly likely Allo is a massive net loss for Alphabet. Google's messaging strategy is simply not working from a financial or practical perspective while Facebook is flying ahead. This is might be a sign of a company trying to live up to its fiduciary duties, but failing at them on the messaging front. Christopher Robert Not a fan of Facebook Messenger, out of all of the ones on the market it violates privacy the worst of all of them. If you know anyone who works in digital advertising just ask them. Facebook sells your most private conversations as marketing meat to the highest bidder. Ben I honestly don't care too much but your comment is totally unrelated to my point. Christopher Robert Please explain to me why you "Honestly don't care" that Facebook reads all of your messages. I am not trying to be rude just curious how anyone could be okay with that. It's so out there to me that I have a hard time understanding how people are just okay with there private conversations being read by completely strangers. Ben Because my messages really aren't that secret and I know there's not a Facebook employee personally reading all my messages but rather they're just being used to target ads to me. Wolf0491 Yeah my buddy got the hangouts update other day removing his SMS and he told me he is uninstalling it and to use normal text now to get in touch because two apps is obnoxious. I don't blame him. Christopher Robert I was thinking this same thing, but was really hoping it was just a paranoid delusion. Is anyone actually okay with letting Google or anyone read all of their private chat messages. It is exactly for this reason that I can't get on board with Allo. If they end up shutting down Hangouts for non gapps users I will be switching over to Signal PRivate messaging along with most of my contacts. Google Give users what they want and they stay loyal and then you make money. Going after profits first just drives away users to find companies who are willing to listen to them. Hernán Guerra It seems you are under the assumption that Allo messages are not encrypted and Hangouts messages are, which is incorrect. RNTMPX Totally agree with your opinion! 2 Men-E If RCS would just be fully adopted by all US carriers, and designated OEMs...Google would see a massive increase in "Android Messages" usage. Sir_Brizz Probably not, because it's not the default SMS app on many OEM phones. Adrien Aubel I think they actually did a decent job on that end, shipping the app on more OEMs and carriers, they've spent so many endless meetings on this. I just hope that they'll let more easily app developers integrate with the technology to let their users benefit from a stronger RCS usage. kalehv And yet, even if that happened, most probably only be in North America. The world is beyond carrier-based-messaging now and won't look back IMO. bekifft Spot on assessment. For me it raises the question then, when does the damage being done outweigh the direct pursuit of the bottom line? No one is adopting their messaging platforms because they are too little, too late. At this point it's seeming more like outright hostility / incompetence from Google than anything. Spoonie The cost savings in not having to continuously update and run multiple apps by producing and maintaining one messaging app would probably be a very compelling business case; the increase in uptake and usage of the Allo app if SMS or RCS were add would also look very good on paper. I'm not sure this article is really on the money with the conclusions you have made. Po Lite Uninstall Hangouts and install use built in messenger how does that help google? I refuse to go anywhere with google messaging anymore cant trust it will be around next year. This is also making me look at Gmail and getting away from that. Its upsetting to be treated this way. None of these apps are free in the sense they get us to use the google eco system buy apps subscribe to google play music and google drive. but constantly ripping apps away that we like is a real drag. so H-Allo Spotify , Office 365 , I will stick with android and Messaging - Mail - and install every ad blocker / Firewall I can find. I will pay for apps not ads and by having me then constantly change my apps ( I have a whole bunch of friends that are going to hate me on May 22 ) I am paying for it. I cut the cable now its time to cut google. They now seem to be inline on how apple operates. Not sure how to dump YouTube ( cant ) Google ( Alphabet ) should change their name to YouTube thats all they are to me now. I am done. If I am forced to try something different then ............................ Ms. Porat shame shame shame. How is this taxing the rich. ( the rich is Google ) .... Just as greedy as anyone. Lets see how fun it is to work for Google over the next few years now that they have a new bottom line financial boss. Craig Nelson Apple will eventually open iMessage to android much like blackberry did with BBM. Apple is a business too and iMessage makes them money so eventually they will want to increase to even more profits and will expand the app. As for Google, I lost hope for them after the disappointing Allo. Oh well Sir_Brizz It's doubtful they will ever do that as iMessage is a huge selling point to their devices. JD They won't and don't need to do it. They went the other way made SMS available on all Mac products as long as you have an iPhone. DoctorRabbitfoot As much as I hate it - Facebook has Messenger figured out. Its pretty usable on every platform, even a web browser, they keep adding fun things that are "sticky", and in most social circles, Facebook is a constant. If they ever add SMS fall back....wow. I've used it for friends groups, co-workers, and sports teams. I know someone will come here and tell me how their social circle doesn't apply or Facebook is the devil, blah blah. I get it, you are a fringe case. Facebook is hugely popular and their messenger is doing really well in the States. No idea how it is outside of the country, but well, thats why they bought Whatsapp (maybe?) TheZiltoid Messaging is super important to me messaging my friends and co-workers (who all use iPhones). I hate to say it but I may have to make the switch to iOS. I'm due for an upgrade too. Was looking forward to getting the Pixel. Ugh... Martin I think If they did one of them right, like iMessage and selling stickers and other BS to dumb people who use them, they would make more money... :) Michael Hazell I honestly don't want companies to be trying to harvest my SMS messages in the same way that companies try to harvest messages in general, like Google with harvesting email messages. I'm just using the "stock" SMS app in Lineage OS at this point, because I can no longer use Hangouts, which I've been doing ever since KitKat. It's a shame that they've gone this far in this ridiculous suite of messaging apps. The good news is that a lot of folks, at least around me, either use SMS or Facebook Messenger. The more Google can't keep themselves straight on what they do, the more they look inferior to other platforms. I'd like universal RCS to be a thing with carriers, sooner rather than later. I'm kinda sick of the whole notion of companies profiting via message apps. At least with carriers they're regulated to an extent when it comes to handling information and what they can do with it; these other companies aren't. abc "In my eyes, this would have been a very difficult case for Google to make to the consumer, as it would have been seen as an invasion of privacy into a known entity." It's never been an issue for them before, it's practically what they do. JD Done and done. Move to iOS and use Whatsapp. To hell with Hangouts and Google. YuCMi I chose to give Google the middle finger and use Signal instead. I don't need Assistant in my messages, and I want my conversations private. fonix232 I'd argue slightly with this. While it definitely makes sense that Google does this for business, what makes more sense is that they're separating messaging services to separate apps because of the trust/monopoly lawsuits and allegations that popped up recently in Europe. To make it more clear: Android has an open-source SMS app. Play Services packages Google's own messaging app (let's call it X for simplicity), which can do SMS, Hangouts, RCS, Allo, Duo, et cetera. It's an all in one solution. As it is part of the GPS package (GPS being Google Play Services here), it would be installed on most, if not all phones, by default. Manufacturers, such as Samsung, modify the AOSP apps (theming, adding features when deemed necessary, etc.). Google of course won't add X features to the AOSP app, partly because of licensing/proprietary bits, and partly because, why should they? Samsung/Sony/Huawei/OnePlus/LG take the AOSP source, theme the default app, but do not touch it much since there's an already working and complete solution by Google that WILL ship with the device, which means nobody will really use the AOSP app, so there's no point working on it. This means that the overall best app to use any/all mobile messaging services will be the only one developed by Google. Which ships with most/all phones. And we got a nice Internet Explorer case on our hands. Something that Google wants to avoid. Hence, they break up the solutions into separate bits that manufacturers can (optionally) replace with their own solution. Want a proprietary chat solution? Replace Hangouts/Allo! Want SMS and RCS? Replace messaging! Want 1-on-1 video calls? Replace Duo! DragoCubed It doesn't justify why Allo can't run on all platforms purely through the web like hangouts or telegram. Michael Payton Another option: just use the native texting app that already comes with your phone and ignore everything else. I do not use Allo or any of the other Google or 3rd party messaging apps, including Facebook Messenger and yet, somehow my life carries on. I still manage to communicate with everyone that I need to. Bruce Wayne Right. Peterson Silva You're ignoring one part of the equation: for the guy who's talking to the CFO to convince her to create Allo he'd have to show a profit motive, right? But what profit can come out of a product no one uses? Because that ship's sinking. Wouldn't it make more sense to first build the user base and then present assistant? And for that first thing to be done right a more cohesive, all-in-one approach would be better, I guess. blueman24 1. Google should make Android Message's a part of g suite. 2. For me, having 2 apps is OK but Allo having all the functionality like proper desktop support and universal chat backup (*cough* hangouts *cough*) is far more important. Rod WhatsApp is already the world standard for messaging. Google's services don't make any difference. Rod Sometimes I'm actually glad WhatsApp is the go-to app for messaging, worldwide (except the US). John Edwards Good article. I definitely lost sight of he business aspect...Makes more sense that it doesn't make sense. Hridja Tripathi One of the most insightful articles i've read. Thanks David This was a really good article. I have been using an iPhone for two months now and iMessage has been one of the bright spots when using it. If you don't have an iPhone you get a regular text but if you do you get all new ways of messaging whether it be with games or all the other stuff Allo offers as well. The point is that it works and I'm hoping Google can eventually get to that point. I won't hold my breath though. Timmy Turner Great write up! Couldn't have said it better myself. Soda Nebula Android is all about customization, personalization and options. Since when is that a problem? I always think its wrong when people want a ubiquitious standard for android to be like fb or iphone. Why cant they 'fix' hangouts? Because it alienates those who like it as is, when it was going to be built from the ground up anyways. Imagine all the confused old people who wake up and theyre unable to use basic text functions because its different without warning. Inb4 muh integrations Tomás O’Mertà How do you get from "most of the world has moved on from SMS" to "SMS usage has increased in North America and represents almost 75% of all mobile messaging in the US and Canada"? Do you have figures to support this, or are you revealing a bias when you say "Abandon Android altogether and switch to iOS"? Ed Malcolm Great article. But as a 52 yo, tech semi-savi, Nexus 5x, project fi user; I'm NEVER going to use any texting app but the what's behind the icon at bottom right of my home screen. Whatsapp?? What's that?!? Hangouts?? I'd hang up. If can't send a text to ANYONE with a cell phone- I ain't using it. I use Slack for work. Know why? There are a select group of people I must communicate with, but not all of whom I want to have my phone number- Privacy. l always choose the highest privacy settings, not because I don't want anyone to know what I'm saying or where I'm at, but I just don't I want to see ads as a result. So this article did was show me that I'll pay for not having ads. I'd pay an extra $5 a month to eliminate ads. Maybe I'm an iPhone guy after all. Who knew? drorharari Trevor, you miss the point just like the Google folks. I, as much of the Android and iOS ecosystem already have WhatsApp and many also have Facebook Messenger and other messaging apps like Skype, Hangouts, etc. There is no incentive for me to try Allo as no one I know uses it and on the have if it, no value proposition (for me, not for Google) is evident. So the question then boils down to "does Google care about me using Allo at all?" because if it doesn't then why should we bother. On the other hand, if Google does care about people using Allo then they should act this way. SMS support is not what Google strives to offer in Allo but it is the only sure way to get people on board. Had Google made Allo the replacement to Android Messenger, people would have had no real reason not to use it, moreover, it would have been the default (just like IMessage is in iOS). Then Allo would have been able to automatically switch to RCS or to their own protocol when they detect the other side also have Allo (currently and extremely unlikely event but being the Android's default, that would have been a rather likely event). Hence, and contrary to your theory, I and most others are getting the (probably correct) message that Google does not care much about messaging and there's no real reason to bother with it. It will be gone in a quarter or two like many trial balloons Google had floated in the past. Michael Oghia Fascinating. Thanks for this! kalehv I think the whole point of Allo supporting SMS fallback is only relevant in North America where people still use SMS. Rest of the world doesn't care about SMS at all. Almost all of my friends using iPhones use WhatsApp as de facto messaging app. they care the least about iMessage. cyc Is iMessage seriously reason enough for people to buy iPhones?!? Jeez... Also, hangouts is or was way more advanced than any other IM platform: it was only truly multiplatform, connected to your Gmail not your mobile number, with great video conferencing. Kirk Broadhurst If the "bottom line" is the only thing that mattered, they'd have improved Hangouts. It's far riskier - in terms of user base - to start a new app. And without users there's no "bottom line" improvement. Mathieu Laflamme You should add to the list YouTube since you can now chat in it (maybe only in Canada yet)! And Google+ plus too because sharing a post to one person is pretty much sending a message... D.Smithee I've got a friend who I thought was Android for life--and then he tried iOS and could never leave iMessage..or at least that's the way he explains it. As for all these messaging apps--I just choose the one that has everyone I know on it...Facebook Messenger. Marti Abernathey Eh. What you're saying makes sense if users move from the old Google messaging apps to the new. I've been a Hangouts/Google user since the beginning. I'm now using Textra/WhatsApp for messaging. Google messaging apps are just less elegant and more fragmented. Why would I use them? I don't mind being data mined if you're giving me something. But I personally don't see the value here. Markoff the article doesn't make sense: 1. what's cost benefit splitting Allo hand Duo into two apps? 2. what's cost benefit developing Messenger/Android Messages separately from Allo? mattman723 Tbh I don't mind multiple platforms, I just tell people I'm accessible through any and all methods. I only hate that you cannot "leave" a group SMS. Jadephyre Most people I know that use an iPhone exclusively use Whatsapp, except when needing to send an SMS to people not using any form of smartphone. James Briano Google has no coherent messaging strategy. Their internal teams are either competing with each other, or simply not communicating (maybe they should all get WhatsApp). Recall Google insiders bragging that the Pixel was designed in complete isolation from the Android team. That's nothing to brag about—that's a problem. scy breaking news is a business, of course what it does is about making money, what business isn't?

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search The Best All-In-One Windows PCs: Seriously, They’re Actually Good Now By Michael Crider on April 23rd, 2017 All-in-one PCs are the domain of the novice, the hotel business nook, or the interior decorator who can’t stomach seeing a “real” PC in a pristine living room. With the exception of the iMac, they were seen as boring, underpowered boxes with laptop components stuffed behind a cheap screen. But that’s changing. It’s true that all-in-one machines are mostly cheap and simple, but the form factor has been undergoing a quiet revolution for the last couple of years. While Apple has been comfortable to trim dimensions and call it a day, manufacturers like Microsoft, Lenovo, HP, and others are filling the space with new and exciting designs. You should really check some of these models out before making your next desktop purchase. Microsoft Surface Studio The first desktop machine from Microsoft’s self-branded hardware initiative, the Surface Studio is surely the poster child for this new generation of all-in-one machines. Combining a 28-inch touch screen, a fold-down artist’s easel hinge, and the much-praised Surface Pen from the tablet line, the Studio makes a compelling argument for Windows as an artist’s platform. Prices start high and go higher, but with a GTX 965 graphics card and an optional 980 upgrade, the all-in-one can also double as a competent gaming machine (albeit a not-very-upgradeable one). The $3000 starting price (with a rather paltry 8GB of RAM, no less) and slightly older Intel processors are two bummers in an otherwise amazing hardware package. Ditto for the unique Surface Dial: this rotating wireless tool can be placed directly on the screen for digital manipulation, but it’s a separate $100 purchase and currently limited to only a few applications. Even so, for those who want the absolute cutting edge in desktop design, the Surface Studio might be worth its steep asking price. HP Envy The Envy series has long been HP’s showcase for its more bombastic designs, and the latest all-in-one machines to wear the badge are no exception. These desktops combine huge, small-bezel displays with a horizontal component body that integrates a quad-speaker Bang & Olufsen soundbar. At a glance, the design looks like a high-end home theater setup that’s been shrunk down to desktop size, and that’s basically what it is, with a mid-range Windows machine crammed into the package. The latest Envy designs are also surprisingly affordable, considering their displays. The base configuration for the massive 34-inch model starts at around $1800, though those who want more RAM, a bigger SSD+HDD combo, and a more capable graphics card can spend a bit more. The Envy design also comes in 24-inch and 27-inch versions, some of which offer touch screens, which isn’t an option on the largest version. Digital Storm Aura, CyberPower PC Arcus, and Origin Omni Even among these next-gen designs, gamers looking for truly high-end graphics can find their options a bit limited, thanks to the tight packages and non-upgradable components. Boutique PC makers are getting around that by cramming a full desktop into a 34-inch ultrawide monitor, in three separate products that seem to come from the same OEM supplier: the Digital Storm Aura, the CyberPower PC Arcus, and the Origin Omni. Slip off the back cover and you’ll be able to swap out every component, including a massive full-size PCIe desktop graphics card, RAM DIMM slots, SSD and HDD storage bays, and yes, even the desktop-class Intel processor and Mini-ITX motherboard. Other neat touches include an integrated liquid cooling system in some packages, an optional top-mounted webcam and microphone combo, and a full VESA mount adapter on the Aura (though you might not want to mount this 50-pound behemoth on a load-bearing wall). Configurations from the various suppliers can go well above the $4000 mark, but frugal customers can save a bit of money with the $1800 CyberPower PC model and invest in upgraded Mini-ITX compatible parts later. Lenovo IdeaCentre Y910 Lenovo’s take on the gamer-focused all-in-one takes a slightly different approach than the boutique models above. The motherboard in the IdeaCentre Y910 is custom, meaning that the processor can’t be swapped out, but the RAM, storage, and full-sized graphics card can. The speakers are larger and front-facing, putting a focus on audio—a nice bonus for anyone who isn’t already using a good pair of headphones. The screen is a more conventional 27 inches, which is less impressive but perhaps more practical for a wider array of games. The Lenovo design has an extra trick up its sleeve, too: it works as a standalone monitor for other systems. Plug in an HDMI cable to the input and you can play just about anything via the screen and speakers. Other little design cues include an integrated headset storage arm, a DVD drive, a height-adjustable stand, and side-mounted ports for easier access. There’s only one model available at a reasonable $2,300 price tag, which includes a 6th-gen i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a GTX 1080 graphics card. Dell XPS 27 Dell’s XPS brand is making headlines thanks to some fantastic work in the laptop division, but it’s no slouch in other form factors. The XPS 27 uses a 4K screen with an optional touch upgrade and fold-down hinge for more direct tablet-style interaction. The design isn’t as sleek as other all-in-ones, but Dell says that the bulky speakers have three times as much power and 50% more clarity than the ones on the iMac. The XPS 27 is priced to move at just $1500 for the lowest tier, including a 4K non-touch screen. Upgrading to a touchscreen will cost you $400, and another $100 on top of that grants access to an AMD R9 M470X graphics card. Even the cheaper tiers can be upgraded after purchase thanks to a pair of user-accessible 2.5-inch hard drive bays, one M. PCIe X4 SSD slot, and four RAM DIMM slots supporting a maximum of 64GB. Lenovo Yoga Home 900 This all-in-one desktop is basically a gigantic Windows-powered tablet. Unlike the other touch-enabled machines in this list, the Yoga Home 900 can fold completely flat, its 27-inch screen and integrated battery inviting multiplayer games and shareable video. Though its older processor and relatively low-res 1080p screen aren’t necessarily built for gaming, a GeForce 940A graphics chip has more power than its pedestrian looks might suggest. The Yoga Home 900 includes a mouse and keyboard for full desktop-style operation, but extended use might benefit from a monitor riser, since the kickstand design keeps the screen quite low on a desk (which is not great for ergonomics). Its large size and weight and a limited three-hour battery life make it less suitable than a standard tablet for road use. Even so, with street prices dipping down towards the $1000 mark and an included suite of kid-friendly games and apps, it’s worth considering for anyone who wants a shared family computer. Acer Aspire C22 and C24 There’s not much to these minimalist Acer designs—they’re low-power all-in-ones, based on an Intel Celeron processor in the 22-inch model and a slightly speedier Core i3 in the 24-inch model. But they have two things going for them: one, they’re absolutely gorgeous, combining ultra-thin 1080p displays with silver or gold-colored accents. And two, they’re cheap, starting at just $450 for the smaller model. Even the larger version with a respectable 8GB RAM and terabyte hard drive upgrade is just $700 (and cheaper from some retailers), not much more than an equivalent desktop and monitor combo. HP Sprout Pro G2 Like the Surface Studio, HP’s Sprout Pro G2 wants users to get up close and personal with digital content. But instead of refining the all-in-one monitor design, HP has augmented it with a wild top-down projector that creates a virtual second screen where the keyboard lives on most desks. Combined with a multi-touch capacitive mat and an included digital pen, the Sprout Pro allows for a surprising amount of digital manipulation without any kind of external hardware. There’s another aspect to that unique projector mechanism: 3D scanning. Place any object on the touch mat area and the computer can make a full three dimensional model of it, which can then be imported into HP’s various tools for further projects. It’s a dream come true for 3D printing enthusiasts, but probably a bit of a gimmick for everyone else. Other downers include a relatively small 23-inch main display, and the fact that it’s still not ready for retail sales just yet, though the original model is now heavily discounted.

The company is now extensively testing an Automated System for self-driving cars with a special training program being conducted for select staffers to acclimatise them in operating the vehicles. The internal documents detail Apple's "Development Platform Specific Training" and a new self-driving car system called "Apple Automated System". The company is reportedly testing three new Lexus RX450h SUVs, which use a Logitech wheel and pedals to enable drivers to disengage the electronic driving mode and take over manual controls via 'drive by wire' mode. The document further clarifies that Apple drivers must clear seven different tests in order to qualify for actual training session with self-driving cars. Each driver gets two practice runs and three trials to pass each test in a seemingly private course.

Recent hires suggest the company is now also looking to the skies. The iPhone maker has recruited a pair of top Google satellite executives for a new hardware team, according to people familiar with the matter. John Fenwick, who led Google’s spacecraft operations, and Michael Trela, head of satellite engineering, left Alphabet Inc.’s Google for Apple in recent weeks, the people said. They report to Greg Duffy, co-founder of camera maker Dropcam, who joined Apple earlier this year, the people said. They asked not to be identified talking about Apple’s private plans. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment, as did Google. Fenwick, Trela and Duffy didn’t respond to requests for comment. With the recruits, Apple is bringing into its ranks two experts in the demanding, expensive field of satellite design and operation. At the moment, these endeavors typically fall into two fields: satellites for collecting images and those for communications.In a regulatory filing last year, Boeing Co. detailed a plan to provide broadband access through more than 1,000 satellites in low-earth orbit. The aerospace company has talked with Apple about the technology company being an investor-partner in the project, a person familiar with the situation said. It’s unclear if those talks will result in a deal. At the annual Satellite 2017 conference in Washington DC last month, industry insiders said Boeing’s project was being funded by Apple, Tim Farrar, a satellite and telecom consultant at TMF Associates Inc., wrote in a recent blog. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. “It’s not hard to discern why Apple might want to consider a satellite constellation,” Farrar wrote, noting a Wall Street Journal report that Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. has forecast $30 billion in revenue from satellite internet by 2025. A lure for technology companies like Apple, Google and Facebook Inc. is to connect billions of people who don’t have internet access yet. The broadband services being explored by Boeing and others would feature low latency and faster speeds than existing cellular systems. “You have a new wave of enthusiastic people who aren’t inhibited by the hard knocks of the past,” said Roger Rusch, who heads satellite consulting firm TelAstra Inc. Also Read:  Apple self-driving car testing plan gives clues to tech program Still, TMF’s Farrar said there’s no guarantee Apple will get involved in the Boeing project. The satellite industry is littered with bankruptcies and other failures. Satellite telephone company Iridium LLC filed for bankruptcy protection in 1999, and Teledesic abandoned its “internet from the sky” plan more than a decade ago. Indeed, Apple may have hired the Google executives for something other than satellite work. It’s already trying to use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans. And in 2015, it acquired Aether Industries LLC, which develops near-space technology such as high bandwidth radio transceivers and high-altitude balloons. Duffy, Fenwick and Trela’s new boss, has mostly consumer product experience from Dropcam. It’s internet-connected security camera stored images and video of homes and sent alerts to a smartphone app. Alphabet’s Nest acquired the business in 2014. After a tumultuous stint there, Duffy joined Apple to form a new team reporting Dan Riccio, who oversees hardware teams for the iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple’s augmented reality efforts, the people familiar with the matter said. Also Read: Apple iPhone 8: Touch ID will be at the back, claims new leak Fenwick and Trela joined Alphabet’s Google in 2014 when the search giant acquired Skybox Imaging, their satellite-imaging startup, for $500 million. However, this year Google sold the renamed business, Terra Bella, to startup Planet Labs Inc., a one-time Skybox rival. Google also planned to invest about $1 billion in an internal satellite internet initiative run by industry veteran Greg Wyler, however Wyler left to start satellite communications firm OneWeb Ltd., and Google ended up investing $1 billion in SpaceX. Fenwick co-founded Skybox Imaging in 2009 while Trela joined soon after as the company’s first outside hire, according to their LinkedIn profiles. Skybox produced satellites about the size of a refrigerator, equipped to take detailed, near-constant images of the earth’s surface. Prior to entering the startup world, Fenwick served in the U.S. Air Force and Trela was a spacecraft engineer at John Hopkins University.

The first openly gay CEO on the Fortune 500 was handed the award for his protection of the First Amendment and support of LGBT rights. In his acceptance speech, Cook spoke about the importance of the first amendment and freedom of speech in journalism and digital technologies. “We [at Apple] know that these freedoms require protection. “Not just the forms of speech that entertain us, but the ones that challenge us. “The ones that unnerve and even displease us. They’re the ones that need protection the most. “It’s no accident that these freedoms are enshrined and protected in the First Amendment. They are the foundation to so many of our rights.” The Newseum Institute, a Washington DC-based nonprofit who support journalism and media, gave Cook the award this week for his work promoting First Amendment rights in data privacy issues. He was recognised for speaking publicly in support of LGBT rights, the protection of the environment as well as his stand against racism. In February, Cook hit out at President Trump’s Executive Order banning people from seven Muslim majority countries. On Tuesday Cook spoke about the importance of digital technologies in helping people speak up and hold others accountable for injustice. He reinforced the importance of listening to alternative opinions, experiences and arguments, not alternative facts. “If democracy obligates us, in a sense, to express ourselves, it also demands that we listen to one another. That we stay informed, we act, and we participate. “We owe it to ourselves to listen. We need to challenge our own thinking and in doing so allow that someone else may just be right.” He called for people to be free to express their values and opinions: “When we are all willing to listen, to think, even to change our minds, thats how the arc of history bends towards justice. “That’s how freedom continues its slow, brave march.” Cook spoke publicly about his sexual orientation for the first time in 2014 saying, “I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me.” Recipients of the Newseum Free Expression awards are recognised for taking personal and professional risks to protect the First Amendment. The Free Expression awards are presented in five categories including Lifetime Achievement Award, Arts and Entertainment Award and Free Press Award. 2 reader comments Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Previous story Barry Manilow chokes up at the 'thrilling' way fans have reacted to him coming out Next story Hillary Clinton tells Donald Trump: 'Gay rights are human rights' More like this Lord Browne calls for more gay business people to come out Apple launches iPhone ‘to fight AIDS’ – but won’t say how much money is going to charity Apple takes stand against Trump on transgender rights Apple CEO Tim Cook meets with Trump at tech summit Apple CEO Tim Cook was one of Hillary Clinton’s vice presidential candidates Apple joins fight for equal marriage in Australia More: LGBT rights Apple tim cook free speech Apple CEO Gay Apple CEO Apple CEO Tim Cook support of lgbt rights award for lgbt rights free speech award digital protection digital free speech Trending Trending Now Lesbians brutally beaten by gang of fifteen men Magic Johnson: I love my 'amazing' gay son Chechnya's president: I will eliminate the gay community by the start of Ramadan Watch: Gay cyclist gets round of applause for shutting down homophobic street preacher Trending Lesbians brutally beaten by gang of fifteen men Magic Johnson: I love my ‘amazing’ gay son and support him no matter what Chechnya’s president: I will eliminate the gay community by the start of Ramadan Watch: Gay cyclist gets round of applause for shutting down homophobic street preacher Latest stories Hacker who targeted ISIS with gay nudes subjected to beheading threats Texas Governor to work with politicians to pass ‘bathroom bill’ Anti-gay marriage Marine Le Pen through to French Presidential run-off Google ad features gay parents and it is no big deal (VIDEO) Queer trans man speaks at the March for Science Lesbians brutally beaten by gang of fifteen men © 2017 PinkNews Terms Contact Advertise

This name change has been in use by the American manufacturer for several years now, but according to Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz, Apple will already switch to the iPhone 8 this year. The new iPhone 2017 model gets a completely new design. The full glass housing will be the first iPhone to get equipped with an OLED display and an integrated Touch ID fingerprint scanner. Also, the new OLED iPhone will follow the trend of the virtual home button. In addition to the home button, the 3.5mm audio jack will also disappear. A welcome addition is wireless charging support, to charge the new iPhone 8 wirelessly. iPhone 8 becomes OLED iPhone There has been a lot of speculation about the new 2017 iPhone model in recent months. The information that has been published so far is in line with the analyst's story. Although sales in America are still unprecedented, Apple is slowly losing a part of its market share worldwide. With the new OLED iPhone 8 Apple expects to boost sales figures again. Apple iPhone 8 specs Apple will celebrate the 10th anniversary of the iPhone this year. It is expected that the iPhone 8 will not only come with a completely new design, it will also sport some spectacular new features. There have been previous rumors about a 3D selfie camera and a dual camera. There have also been noises that the iPhone 8 will not only feature a OLED display and a new fingerprint scanner, the phone is most likely to get equipped with an iris scanner as well. Augmented Reality In addition, there are indications that Apple provides its new iPhone 8 with Augmented Reality. Chairman of the Board Tim Cook has already announced the company is planning on releasing an AR iPhone in the future. The only question that remains is whether we are talking about the iPhone 2017 model. It does seem that the first OLED iPhone offers Virtual Reality support.    Previous  Galaxy S8 price details for phone components    News by brand:iPhone    News by category:Rumors & Speculations    News by brand and category:iPhone Rumors & Speculations Latest news headlines iPhone 8 becomes OLED iPhone Galaxy S8 price details for phone components Motorola Moto Mods compatible with Moto Z2 Force How Samsung will test its new Galaxy devices Samsung picks Google Music for new Galaxy devices HTC video shows U 11 Edge Sense Samsung premium TV lineup support HDR10+ Samsung semiconductor components powers Galaxy S8 Availability announcement Galaxy S8 smartphones Nick Jonas 2017 video contest How Samsung recycles Galaxy devices Best Gear smartwatch face 2017 2017 QLED TV design advantages Apple CarPlay available in new Scania trucks Sprint Galaxy S8 Duo deal       5G Accessories Android Galaxy iPhone Camera Mobile phones Rumors Premium Smartphones Smartwatches Tablets TV   CES CeBIT IFA Photokina PMA

These are my favorites! Apple's got a whole new 9.7-inch tablet — iPad (5th generation) — and it's more affordable than ever. So affordable, you might just have enough cash left over to trick it out. (What iPad Pro, right?) iPad Smart Cover I've owned one of these since they first launched alongside the original iPad Air and, as soon as I got iPad 5, I slipped it on, and it fit like home. Or a glove. Or a clove that's finally come home. Whatever. It fit great. It doesn't protect the back. If you want that, you'll need to track down an iPad Air Smart Case — which is also great. But it protects the glass front just fine. It also folds back so you can either type at a slight angle or watch videos at a sharp angle. You can even get it in (Product) RED from Apple, if you want to support the charity — and get a wicked hot color. What it won't do is protect that back. For that, you'll need to track down an original iPad Air Smart Case, which is also great, or get one of the many knock offs available on Amazon. If you want something cooler, I love the old world style of the Pad & Quill Walden Case. If you want something heavier-duity for work, kids, or travel, check out the Fre from Lifeproof. Because the Smart Cover attaches magnetically, it has minimal bulk. It's just a hinge and foldable front panel. That'll keep your iPad screen safe from scratches, scrapes, and small impacts. It will also prop it up at more comfortable typing or viewing angles. See at Amazon Adonit Mark No "Pro" means no Apple Pencil. But that doesn't mean no stylus pen! Adonit has been making amazing capacitive stylus pens for years and their latest, the Mark, is their best ever. It's not Bluetooth, which means it doesn't have any pressure or sensitivity support, but it also means it doesn't depend on batteries, pairings, or connectivity. You simply pick it up, touch it down, and draw, write, game — create. If a wider grip is your thing, check out the Cosmonaut by Studio Neat. If you simply must have Bluetooth, there's the Pogo Connect 2 from Ten 1 Design. No matter which way you stylus, thanks the length and change in angle of articulation, your fingers stay out of the way, and you can see more of the screen. You can also work in a way and with a tool that feels familiar. Which means you don't need to go Pro to feel pro. See at Amazon Apple Magic Keyboard Since iPad (5th Generation) is new, it's hard finding a lot of accessories specifically made for it. That's especially true when it comes to keyboard cases. Since iPad (5th Generation) has the exact same physical dimensions as the original iPad Air, though, you can cheat your way around it. If you can find the Logitech Ultra-Thin, for example, it's a great case that will serve you well. Ditto the Zagg Folio. If you can't or simply want to wait for updated, iPad 5-specific versions, but still need a Bluetooth keyboard now, now, now, I'd suggest the Apple Magic Keyboard. You'll need to use a case that props up your iPad, like the Smart Cover, but what you lack in a physical connection you make up for in flexibility — place the iPad anywhere you want and the keyboard anywhere that's comfortable. Pairing is quick and easy and the typing experience is exactly what you'd expect from a pre-MacBopk Apple keyboard. Not too shallow, not too deep, and perfect for productivity. See at Amazon Mophie power station Apple prides itself on iPad providing 10 hours of power, no matter how big or how thin they get. The same holds true for iPad (5th Generation). But those numbers come from an era where browsing the web and checking email were the toughest tasks people did while online. Nowadays everything from Facebook to Snapchat to Pokémon Go hits mobile batteries like battering rams. Some of those you'll probably use more on iPhone than iPad, but even if you're on the road, in the car, or flying around the world, if you need power, you need power. And mophie provides it in spades. I've been using this particular model — in rose gold if you must know — going on two years now and it's kept both my iPhone and my iPad, as well as my Apple Watch and AirPods, charged trip after trip after trip. See at Amazon AirPods Yes, they're still embarassingly long to order but, yes, they're totally worth it when you do. If you don't want to wait, you can get BeatsX immediately and if you prefer over-the-ear, you can get Bose QuietComfort 35. Once you go AirPods, though, it's tough to go back. Even with iPad, the ability to listen to music, movies, podcasts, audio books, and more, and take FaceTime, Skype, and other calls, without having any strings to hold you down, is damn near miraculous. See at Apple Your favorite iPad accessories? If you have a new iPad (5th Generation) or an older iPad Air, what are your favorite accessories? Let me know your top picks and if I missed anything great, I'll add it in an update!

I went with the TwelveSouth version which is excellent but a bit bulkier than I prefer. The non leather SmartCover feels and looks cheap/junky. 0 19 hours ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

She's been talking, writing about, and tinkering with Apple products since she was old enough to double-click. In her spare time, she sketches, sings, and in her secret superhero life, plays roller derby. Follow her on Twitter @settern. Very, very slow ones. But Elon Musk wants to make us faster with brain-machine interfaces. Much, much, much faster. If you're a fan of PayPal, Tesla, and SpaceX founder Elon Musk's many ambitious ventures, you may have read a piece or two by Tim Urban of Wait But Why; Urban focuses on existential, humanitarian, and scientific history — what's happening, how did we get there, and where do we go from there. He also decorates his lengthy articles with delightful stick figures and graphs — because sometimes you need a bit of levity in-between understanding how artificial intelligence may be the doom or savior of us all. Urban's latest Wait But Why opus is on Musk's newest venture, Neuralink, which is ostensibly creating more advanced brain-machine interfaces. But before talking about that, the article deep dives into (surprisingly understandable) neuroscience concepts, including why the human brain is so difficult to map and comprehend.  Why would we want to map the human brain and hook it up to computers in the first place? Because we've been doing so already for decades — just very, very slowly. From Musk: We already have a digital tertiary layer in a sense, in that you have your computer or your phone or your applications. You can ask a question via Google and get an answer instantly. You can access any book or any music. With a spreadsheet, you can do incredible calculations. If you had an Empire State building filled with people—even if they had calculators, let alone if they had to do it with a pencil and paper—one person with a laptop could outdo the Empire State Building filled with people with calculators. You can video chat with someone in freaking Timbuktu for free. This would've gotten you burnt for witchcraft in the old days. You can record as much video with sound as you want, take a zillion pictures, have them tagged with who they are and when it took place. You can broadcast communications through social media to millions of people simultaneously for free. These are incredible superpowers that the President of the United States didn't have twenty years ago. The thing that people, I think, don't appreciate right now is that they are already a cyborg. You're already a different creature than you would have been twenty years ago, or even ten years ago. You're already a different creature. You can see this when they do surveys of like, "how long do you want to be away from your phone?" and—particularly if you're a teenager or in your 20s—even a day hurts. If you leave your phone behind, it's like missing limb syndrome. I think people—they're already kind of merged with their phone and their laptop and their applications and everything. From this perspective, our iPhone and Android smartphones are a part of our neurological system already — they're just harder to interface with than, say, our limbic system or prefrontal cortex. This concept defines everyone's rush to get into wearable technology, digital assistants like Siri, and AR: The easier it is for us to interface with the Internet-connected part of our brain, the faster we can collectively learn and evolve. Though I've rarely thought of humanity like this before now, it's really rather true: We're the first fully cyborg generation. We recall information from the Internet as often as our own brains — we just use a much slower method of recall than our brain's neural pathways to get to that next section of information. You're already digitally superhuman. The thing that would change is the interface—having a high-bandwidth interface to your digital enhancements. The thing is that today, the interface all necks down to this tiny straw, which is, particularly in terms of output, it's like poking things with your meat sticks, or using words—either speaking or tapping things with fingers. And in fact, output has gone backwards. It used to be, in your most frequent form, output would be ten-finger typing. Now, it's like, two-thumb typing. That's crazy slow communication. We should be able to improve that by many orders of magnitude with a direct neural interface. It's a bit terrifying to think about, honestly. As technology evolves to provide that bandwidth and connects us instantly to the Internet (and each other), it opens up a host of other frightening concepts: If we can communicate telepathically and instantly, where does language go from here? Could we evolve to understand language as empathic signals, or circular concepts? Is this how we fix worldwide communication? Does this open up an entirely new universe for the creatives and scientific pros in this world — or turn everyone into a person who can express themselves creatively? If we can think collectively, does that mean we get further as a species, or instantly destroy ourselves? Do we essentially become the Expanse's protomolecule, or the Formics of Ender's Game, or Arrival's Heptapods (or any number of proto-futuristic science-fiction concepts) if we have communal processing? I'm going down a rabbit hole here, so I'll stop before I disappear into Wonderland forever — but it's interesting to think about, no? We're on the precipice of technology not only changing our everyday lives, but the very way we think, communicate, and use the world around us. And smartphones are a pretty big stepping stone on that journey. Come what may, I'm pretty excited for the moment that I get to call myself a cyborg. (And seriously, if you have a few hours, find a good place to sit and ingest Urban's incredibly comprehensive explainer on Neuralink and our potential machine-linked future.)

I don't think those kind of technology is good for humanity... 0 2 days ago Reply quakerotis It's too late. Everyone criticized Obama when he said we fetishize our devices a little too much. And yes, the context of that was perhaps wrong. But the argument does have merit. We spend far too much time with tech ****, convenience **** and the desire to move the ball forward. But tech has a downside. The current American administration is supported in part by people who got swallowed by tech, ignored by its creators, and left behind with no real options. They naturally fled to the warm embrace of a narcissist who told them, "I alone can fix this". Technological advance without the moral restraint to be as humane as possible leaves us as inhumane creatures. We never give a second thought to those who are adversely effected by technological change. One might argue that this is inevitable. And, it may well be. But, we need to mitigate the influence that this has. To be blunt, there are far more unskilled humans than there are jobs for unskilled humans. No amount of retraining is going to fix that in the short term. As we face educational institutions that are defunded by political frauds, cheats and hacks, we are left with the burden of what to do with the large amount of people who will never be a computer programmer, hipster or creative. Watch how fast the landscape changes in this example: I live in a former industrial center where good paying factory labor contributed to a robust middle class. Those jobs disappeared 30 years ago. Then, lower paying service jobs filled the void. We are now the home of a gargantuan Amazon fulfillment center, that disproportionally uses resources when compared to the amount of jobs it creates. For its size, it will never employ more than 1400 workers. Amazon's long term goal is to ELIMINATE workers, thus reducing the fragile workforce even more. In its wake, companies like amazon, and to a lesser extent Walmart,, have destroyed American retail. It is impossible to start a small mom and pop operation anymore because the barriers to entry in retail have been erected to prevent behavior like this. Also, to get Amazon to relocate here, significant tax breaks were given, thus eroding the ability of local government to do its job adequately. Within 5 years, the Amazon workforce will be reduced by more than 50%. What did it get us for our multiyear tax break? Nothing. And it gets worse from here. 0 2 days ago Reply cuttheredwire What? No mention of Ghost in the Shell? ;) 0 2 days ago Reply JaySeeDoubleYou Terrifying and exciting, both! Is this a testimony to how far we've risen, how far we've fallen, both, neither, or other? I cannot say. Something deep inside me says it's some flavor of all three (both, neither, AND other.) I suppose the whole "you're already a cyborg" thing makes good sense out of the phenomenon we've all noticed about ourselves and just about everybody else around us that we are tethered to our phones like they're a part of us, and feel lost without them. Although, whether the age of pop cybernetics is truly upon us RIGHT NOW, and it's just a matter of moving from [figuratively speaking] the "really slow external HDD" of today to the "really fast internal SSD" of tomorrow that separates us from our pop culture vision of the cyborg, or whether we're not quite there yet because we (as a whole) are not yet permanently integrating tech directly onto or into our bodies, but rather, are actually witnessing the final stages of "pre-cyborg" life just as an expanding city runs water, sewer, electric, and builds roads before houses start going up and people start moving in? Are we "'external USB' cyborgs" right now? Or are we making the final tweaks to our brains, and our psyches, and our societies to prepare us for the true dawning of the cyborg? (longest run-on sentence ever?) :-) Are we now running the underground water and sewer lines for that future "cyborg city" that is seemingly so imminent? While my answer to this question is based FAAAAAR less on anything tightly defined or reasoned in my mind, or any kind of intellectual argument, and is far more based on something vaguely sensed in the depths of me somewhere - urges and impulses aren't the right words, nor are instinct, intuition, or hunch, but it's something on that level - I say the latter. This is not the dawn hours of the age of the cyborg, but rather this is the final prepwork for it, laying the final infrastructure in the predawn hours just before. And again, I'm both exhillerated beyond measure, and terrified beyond measure by the massive weight of implications all this brings.

They're Google's attempt to define itself as a hardware manufacturer worthy of comparison not just to Apple's iPhone, but the very products its Android operating system has allowed to flourish over the past eight years. Or, as the refrain goes: Google is finally going to compete with other smartphone manufacturers. This narrative can get in the way of discussing the Pixel for what it is (a smartphone), so I'll try to avoid confusing what this phone means to Google as a company and what it means to you as a consumer. I've been using the Pixel XL for five days. I specify this because as this review goes live, so will dozens of others. Almost all of these people have been using the phone for more or less the same amount of time, and the vast majority of impressions you read from blogs and news outlets today will be based upon five or fewer days with the phones. I am going to keep thoughts on certain items - battery life and general performance, for example - a bit more concise because of this. It's hard to know confidently just how good the battery life is for me yet. It's also hard to know how much the phone will slow down over time. So I don't want to leave anyone with the impression that this review is the end-all, be-all of our thoughts on the Pixel phones, nor to suggest that our impressions are definitive and supported by the week or two we typically afford to the review process. Thoughts are still evolving. That said, we did want to provide this review at the time Google allowed us to publish it, and I hope that this disclaimer gives you some transparency into that whole process. With the pleasantries and meta-discussion out of the way, let's get to what you're actually here for: the phones. Are they good? Great? The greatest? Has Google whipped up a smartphone that transcends a mere list of specifications and a software version? Well, no phone really, truly does, and setting the bar quite so high is to prime yourself for disappointment. But the Google Pixel is a great smartphone - I am convinced. Does its battery last the longest? No. Is its screen the best? Not likely. Is it the fastest smartphone on the planet? Eh, no (sorry, Apple still wins that battle). Is the Google Assistant as life-changingly intelligent as Google seems so amped for us to believe? Hardly. In fact, it is almost obscenely easy to pick apart Google's phone - one might even say pixel by pixel - because it clearly doesn't afford itself of every bleeding-edge technology or feature it could have. The Pixel lacks waterproofing. The rear camera doesn't use optical image stabilization. The batteries aren't unusually large. There's no microSD slot. The processor, while it is the best part Qualcomm has on offer, isn't really much better than the existing Snapdragon 820. Motorola builds phones that charge more quickly, Samsung makes phones with more features and better components, Xiaomi's phones offer far more value for money, and LG's phones probably do something better but I'm struggling on that one at the moment. What does the Pixel offer that is so special? Well, some of you will want to see me hang for this line, but: it just works. Need to switch to a new carrier? That's not a problem - the Pixel supports all four US providers, plus Project Fi. Take a lot of photos? Google will store all of them in the cloud at full resolution, for free (and the Pixel will automatically delete old photos when on-device storage nears capacity). There's no bloatware. Live remote support is built into the phone. Say "OK Google" at any time, even with the display off, and Assistant stirs to life. Break your phone? Google offers - in the US - accidental damage protection. Can't decide precisely which moment you want to photograph? Burst shot makes the call for you. Tired of shaky-hand video? Google's electronic stabilization is the real deal. Questions remain, though. Why is the Pixel commanding such an exceptional premium over last year's Nexus devices? Does the Pixel really do anything those phones don't, or will soon be able to? Can Google really claim to be a competitor on the level of Apple and Samsung? The answers here aren't so clean-cut. (Note: This review will refer to the Pixel as a single phone in many places for the sake of brevity and my own sanity. While there are two versions, with the screen and battery being the only differences, they are essentially one phone in two sizes. Even Google's retail boxes for them are the same. Constantly having to refer to the Pixel and Pixel XL would become tiresome and pointless. When the two devices diverge in experience or aspect, I will be clear about which I am discussing.) The Good Camera This may be the best smartphone camera ever. It's not just the quality of the photos, but the experience - this camera is so fast. Battery life So far, I'd say the Pixel XL has offered battery life basically comparable to the Snapdragon version of Samsung's Galaxy S7 edge, which is very respectable indeed. Google's Android and perks Well, it's a good thing in my opinion. No bloatware, the latest version of Android, and some Pixel-exclusive (for now) features like Google Assistant, Smart Storage, unlimited full resolution Photos cloud storage, and more. Speed The Pixel is a very quick phone indeed. While it probably won't be running laps around an iPhone 7, it's consistently snappy and responsive in a way some phones this year have struggled to manage. Four carriers Google's new phone is SIM unlocked and works on all four major US carriers, and you won't get the runaround from Verizon, either - this is a true four-carrier device. The Not So Good Price There's no way around it, the price points are high. iPhone high. And you're going to be hard-pressed to convince the value-obsessed that there's nearly $800 of smartphone in a Pixel XL. Speaker While not without its merits, the single bottom-firing speaker is a definite downgrade from last year's Nexus 6P. Non-expandable storage Yeah, we know, Google - you don't like microSD cards on phones. The Pixel was a chance to make a clean break on this stance, but no such luck. No ruggedizing The iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 are IP67 and IP68 certified, respectively. The Pixel is IP53, which is basically to say it has no real water-resistance. A bit dull This one is personal, but I just can't get excited about the way the Pixel looks. In Very silver, it's a kitchen appliance. In Really blue, it's an aluminum blueberry. In Quite black it's at least inoffensive... to the point of boredom. This phone's design just feels too "playing it safe." Design and materials Historically, Google's Nexus phones have always been a bit of a toss-up in regard to their actual look and feel. The Nexus 5 looked great, but its plastic frame was unashamedly cheap and things like the power and volume keys seemed to reflect that. The Nexus 6 was an awkwardly upsized Moto X - I don't think much more needs to be said about that. Even the Nexus 6P, often considered by fans to be unimpeachable, simply isn't all that cohesive and coherent. Its cyclopian glass cover for the camera and various antennas was divisive at best. And while it was the first all-metal Nexus, it did feature a plastic piece on the rear "chin" area of the phone that seemed to say "we did what we could with what we had." Not to mention that its smaller sibling, the 5X, looked completely different. The Pixel and Pixel XL feel like solid bricks of aluminum (if lighter). The antenna bands are barely able to be felt. The glass window on the rear transitions smoothly into the metal frame. Does the Pixel have the almost bizarrely perfect tolerances of Samsung's Galaxy S7 edge? No. But the Pixel is clearly a cut above any Nexus in the highly unscientific "how expensive does that smartphone feel" test. Sitting on the right edge of the phone, the buttons for power and volume are responsive and exceptionally clicky (even better than Samsung's, in my informed button-feel opinion). The USB-C port is bottom-center, and the headphone jack is up at the top-left. The fingerprint scanner, the same model as last year's Nexuses, is on the back. The look of the Quite black finish is uniform, with a slightly smoother texture than the 6P. Everything just looks like it's supposed to fit together here. I find the silver and white version gels considerably less well. If you're going to put up with a white surround on the front of the phone, the slightly absurd but fun Really blue color is the way to go (sadly, Google did not provide a blue unit to us). The 2.5D display glass surround gives the Pixel a gentle accent on an otherwise sparse front panel. Apart from the front-facing camera and the occasionally-visible sensor window below the earpiece speaker, there's not much that stands out. Go around back, and there's nothing too loud happening, either, at least on the dark finish. The "G" logo is the only branding on the exterior of the phone, and it's not even all that prominent. Lacking a camera hump on the rear, the Pixel really is a minimalist phone design. Frankly, for what praise I can give to Google on the look and feel of quality (seriously, screw camera humps), I can't award much for actual appearance. At its best, in the black finish, the Pixel looks vaguely generic. I realize the Pixel team has been all about relatively stealthy, sleek designs, but nothing about the Pixel to me really makes it look or feel related to the Chromebook Pixel or Pixel C. At best, I'd say Google has made a phone that won't have the issue of creating design baggage for a successor device. I suppose the Pixel is uninteresting to look at in the way a 1990s Lexus is uninteresting to look at. It's boring because it's supposed to seem grown up. But the more I look at it, the more I use it, the more I feel that Google was deliberately inoffensive with its industrial design here, and I'm really not sure that was a great decision in a market where making a product stand out has become increasingly difficult. The Pixel is a phone that seems to say "You're just going to put a case on me anyway, why should I dress up for the occasion?" And with Google's new flashy artist live cases, that could well be a point. I don't think it means the phone has to be quite so drab, though. Display The Pixel XL's 5.5" Quad HD Super AMOLED display is excellent. It offers adequate brightness outdoors, the superb viewing angles we've come to expect of AMOLED displays, and vivid contrast. Google also hasn't tuned the display to rigid color accuracy, instead seeming to end up somewhere between the typical oversaturation of, say, Samsung, and the highly-calibrated iPhone. Comparing to a Galaxy S7 edge in the "basic" mode, which is exceptionally accurate, the Pixel XL clearly provides more saturation of colors to give them the "pop" factor that most other OEMs using AMOLED displays do. On the one hand, the extra saturation provides the perception of more contrast, which can be important for things like video, gaming, and virtual reality. On the other, for a phone so focused on providing an excellent camera experience, I always feel like I should be seeing the photos I take as accurately as possible so that I can better judge how they'll look not on my screen, but on everyone else's (read: iPhones). But this is an admittedly fringe concern, and one that simply won't bother most people. As calibrated out of the box, it's not as though the Pixel XL looks like Samsung's almost comically bright setup. It's just adding a bit of drama. There's an sRGB mode in developer settings if you want to use that, and it offers a far truer white point and colors, though you'll probably find it a bit dull if you're used to typical AMOLED displays. But if you want to be serious about your smartphone photography, it's an excellent toggle to have. Unfortunately, I sent our 5" Pixel off for a video review the moment I received it, so I couldn't compare the displays of the two. I would assume a similar calibration and character, though the fact that the smaller phone's screen has a lower resolution could mean there's more variance between the parts than normal. On the whole, though, the Pixel XL offers an excellent display, if not one that's going to have Samsung looking over its shoulder. After all, they probably make it. Battery The section you may have jumped to immediately is, I am afraid, going to leave you feeling unsatisfied. I have only used the Pixel XL, and while I would say the battery life has been solid overall, it's also been a bit unpredictable at times. But after the first two days, which I am ignoring out of hand (I find Android needs a day or two to "settle in" on a fresh install), things have been pretty good. You're looking for screen-on time figures, and we'll get there, but first: please remember that these apply to the way I use my phone. Not necessarily, or even probably, the way you use yours. I'm not trying to extract the very maximum screen-on figure, nor do I leave my phone's display on, idle, sitting next to me. Sometimes I'm on Wi-Fi (reducing power consumption), sometimes I'm not. I also have rather annoyingly poor AT&T reception in my apartment which can cause the mobile network to scan much more frequently if a phone is in my pocket. On average, I'm seeing between four and five hours of screen on time with the Pixel XL. If I were to be on Wi-Fi in my office all day, I could probably manage six without much trouble, too. I would say this is comparable to what I typically get with the Galaxy S7 edge (SD820 version), a device that has been lauded for its battery life. As such, I'm actually pretty happy with the Pixel XL in this regard. ... That all considered, I'm going to say my thoughts here have plenty of evolving to do. I'm on day six here - barely (as I write this, day five). I just don't have the data points yet to really say confidently that the Pixel XL provides good battery life, just the initial impression that it does. We'll put a pin in this and return later. As for the battery life of the 5" Pixel, I haven't used it, and can't really offer you anything there. Storage, wireless, and reception The Pixel is the first smartphone from Google to utilize UFS 2.0 storage, meaning substantially faster speeds than the eMMC chips of years past. How fast is that storage? Well, our favored storage benchmark appears to be having some bugs with Android 7.1 and is yielding very strange results - some weirdly fast, some oddly slow - and for now I'm going to forego publishing figures. (Of note: this was an issue with 6.0 last year, too.) But this is a Samsung storage part and I would strongly assume that it is very fast, because the Pixel feels quite fast, and operations like app installs and photo capture feel exceptionally quick, as well. As you know, the Pixel is available in either 32 or 128GB storage models, and I'm actually OK with that. Many people have bemoaned the lack of a 64GB model, but I think the real complaint is that the 128GB model costs $100 more than the 32GB, not that there is some missing storage "sweet spot" here. Out of the box, a little over 24GB of storage is available on the 32GB model. By the time I loaded up all of my apps and signed in to everything, that number was around 18GB. Needless to say, you know what your storage needs are better than I do - the 32GB Pixel is plenty for me, but it may be woefully inadequate for others. If you're the kind of person who rapidly fills up your device's storage with photos, though, that ceiling may not be a worry - Google's new Smart Storage feature will automatically delete local copies of photos and videos taken on your phone that are more than 90 days old when your local storage starts to run low. It will only delete photos and videos that have copies in the cloud on Google Photos, of course. On the wireless front, the Pixel has the standard array of features you'd expect of a modern smartphone - Wi-Fi ac support, Bluetooth 4.2, a host of LTE bands (four-carrier compatible in the US), and NFC. The real question is whether or not any of them have posed any issues during my testing, at least for me. I will say that mobile data has been stellar, even in my AT&T-deficient apartment. The Pixel gets better reception than most phones I test on AT&T, actually. My AT&T-branded Nexus 6 will miss about half my calls if it's just sitting on my desk - the Pixel misses none, and only loses reception if I put it in my pocket. It seems Google and HTC did their homework here. Bluetooth, too, has worked very well for me. Pairing to my car was exceptionally quick, and I've not had any issues with it at all (unlike last year's Nexuses), though I will say the range doesn't seem fantastic, as streamed audio will cut out if I put my phone in my pocket instead of the cup holder. Wi-Fi is where I've had hiccups. My router's signal is poor in many areas of my apartment, often causing devices to flip between the 2.4 and 5GHz networks. The Pixel has had significant trouble with this at times, forcing me to manually toggle the Wi-Fi on a number of occasions to get it to reacquire a reliable connection. There's also a visual bug that correlates with this issue - my quick settings interface will show I'm connected to one network, but when I go into settings, it says I'm connected to the other one. It's an annoyance, but if my Wi-Fi reception wasn't so crappy I doubt it'd be an issue in the first place. Speaking of Wi-Fi, like the Nexuses now have, the Pixel supports Google's Wi-Fi Assistant to automatically secure connections to networks that may pose privacy concerns. It's nice to have. Call quality has been quite good - the Pixel's earpiece speaker is actually one of the best I've used, and even non-HD voice calls have surprisingly decent clarity. The earpiece speaker is loud without being shrill, so I think that helps, too. Audio and speakers The Pixel's headphone amplifier is reasonably powerful, though I did find it's not quite as potent as the one on Samsung's Galaxy S7. Testing with a number of pairs of headphones, I found the audio quality excellent and never saw a need to crank the volume beyond 65-70% or so. I'll be flying in the next couple of days, so I'll get some more experience with how the output of the headphone jack does in loud ambient conditions. As to the single, bottom-firing speaker? Well, it's not going to magically sprout into a front-facing stereo array, nor is it going to convince anyone that there was a worthy tradeoff made here. The quality of the speaker is actually quite good, I'd say it sounds more natural and full than those on devices like the Galaxy S7 and Moto Z (sorry, I don't have a 6P to compare to). But its output is noticeably lower, and it's no substitute for two speakers that actually face... your face. Google did a good job given the design directive here, but beyond that, it's nothing to write home about. As to that second, speaker-grille-looking thing on the bottom? It's just an oversized inlet for the microphone so that the phone looks symmetrical. Nothing to see here. Camera Google did it. In my opinion, the Pixel is the best smartphone camera on the market. It's not just the quality of photos, it's everything that makes the camera so capable and simple. To start, it's incredibly fast - just as fast as Samsung's world-beating S7 camera to launch, but even faster when actually shooting. You can fire off five or six photos in a row without skipping a beat, something that will cause most other smartphones to choke and stutter on buffer. Granted, after those five or six, the phone does need a few seconds to collect itself - but it gets those shots every time. I've simply never used a smartphone camera that is this fast. That's not to even speak of Google's Smartburst mode, which automatically picks the best shots in a rapid-fire capture initiated by holding down the shutter button. While not as reliable on focus as Samsung's crazy-fast dual pixel AF, or as able to draw out light in extremely dark conditions, the Pixel makes up for these technical shortcomings with a host of practical advantages and photo quality that, to me, feels the most natural and realistic of any smartphone this year. The level of detail the Pixel can capture in a macro shot is incredible - the kind of thing that I'd only previously associated with the iPhone. In well-lit conditions, photos are incredibly crisp and detailed, without the over-processed, punchy look that can render a photo worthless at anything beyond a full-width square crop. This is so much more important than I think people tend to realize. Reframing a photo can completely change its character, and when your smartphone is doing all kinds of crazy edge contrast to make photos look "crisp" and colorful, things can look a lot messier when you really zoom in. The Pixel is an absolute cut above the competition in this regard, and as someone who does occasionally photograph things as an activity, I feel I can rely on it not just to capture a scene, but to allow me to manipulate it after the fact. Say what you will about manual controls, but this feels like a photographer's smartphone camera. You can capture candid moments with the exceptionally quick launch, use Smartburst to make sure you get the right shot, and let Google's brilliant HDR+ worry about the exposure and contrast. Google does offer an exposure value slider (handy) as well as white balance modes, too. You can even lock the focus by long-pressing on the viewfinder. In the dark, the Pixel still performs well, though it doesn't quite have the magic trick level of light gathering that Samsung's phone does (I mention the S7 because it was my previous smartphone camera pick). Though, the S7 tends to seemingly create light where there is none at all, while the Pixel is just very good at making use of the light that is available. So, the Pixel may not offer world-beating autofocus speeds (it's a bit wonky at times, actually - hopefully it will get better), have the widest aperture lens, or use two sensors in tandem, but I firmly believe it offers the best overall camera experience on any smartphone, full stop. As for Google's touted video stabilization? It definitely works. I didn't have any extreme circumstances under which to test it, but for just holding your phone and walking around shooting video, it makes a huge difference. I mean, I doubt you'd think I was using a gimbal, but it's still very smooth. And up to this point in the camera section, do you know what all of the samples share in common? They're all heavily cropped versions of much larger photos. Here are the originals of the four I've shown you. And now, for the larger sample gallery (some images here have been cropped as well). Previous Next Finally, let's talk about the electronic image stabilization. It works! I have a video sample, shot in 4K, below, to demonstrate it. It does give video a slightly jarring panning effect if you're too subtle with your movement, but overall? For something shot with one hand over my head, this is incredibly smooth. Performance Is the Pixel fast? Yes. But it isn't going to change your definition of phone speed forever. I'd say the Pixel is roughly as fast as a Moto Z, which is a Very Fast Phone indeed - probably in the top three quickest Android phones currently out there. The Pixel feels very responsive, but I tend to think all of Google's "we can't talk about it, but we did things to make this phone fast, evil, terrible things" was a lot of huff and puff. It gets predictably decent scores in Octane. It gets predictably decent scores in pretty much any benchmark. But they're exactly what you'd expect of a Snapdragon 820 phone - they don't tell a story, they don't give you any actionable information. I can still make enough touch inputs that the animations start to lag behind my finger, and there's still a stutter when you open up the don't-call-it-Google-Now pane in the launcher, and the settings app sometimes takes a second to catch its breath and populate the menu list when you start it up. Where the Pixel has shined for me so far is in the consistency of its performance. Yes, in a side by side app load test, you might see many phones basically keep up with the Pixel. But it's that one time you go to bring up Maps and it's out of memory on your Galaxy S7 and it takes like 10 seconds to load up but you really need to get directions somewhere because you're stopped at a light and you have to decide if you're going left or right ahead. When it's crunch time, the Pixel always seems to maintain its composure and get you where need to go. In short? It feels a bit more like an iPhone. That's not to say I think the Pixel is as fast as the new iPhone - it probably isn't, by virtue of silicon alone. Whether this performance manages to remain consistent over the coming weeks and months will be the much bigger question, and it's one I just can't answer now. Software You know what Android 7.0 is all about - I'm not going to re-review it here, because that would be silly. But Android 7.1 and the various Pixel-exclusive features are definitely worth taking a look at, so let's break them down. Google Assistant Do you use Google voice queries or commands? No? Then you're probably never going to use Assistant, either, unless you have a deep and unrequited love of chatbots. Google talks a big game on Assistant, but the reality is that we've already had everything Assistant can do embedded in the Google app for a long time now. Assistant just gives us a new conversational interface and some slightly more human dialogue on occasion. That demo on stage where the presenter made a dinner reservation with only their voice? Well, it can do that... with a limited number of restaurants that basically cannot be discovered in any easy way. It might support more places in the future, perhaps even probably will, but who knows when? This is the problem any time Google unveils a major new software product: we're given the dog and pony show with all the grand possibilities and then... we wait. I appreciate what Google is trying to do here. Really, I do. I think the potential of Assistant is amazing. But the experience right now is... not. It's just Google's intelligent search results with a more streamlined interface. Can you reserve a table for dinner with Assistant? Yes... if Google Maps knows it supports Open Table, and not all that many restaurants in Los Angeles presently do, meaning I would never book a table this way in the first place - I'd just go on the web. Can you buy movie tickets? No such luck - I can get showtimes with links to click to start the checkout process, but not actually automate the activity beyond that. What about something easy, like ordering a Lyft? Nope... even though that's literally functionality built into the Google Maps app. And I'm not saying Assistant has to do all of this right out of the gate - it doesn't! It's just that the current Assistant experience simply isn't as intelligent or powerful as Google wanted us all to believe when it got on stage and talked about it like it was ready to change the world. Maybe it will be ready in a few years. Right now, we've got a skeletal version - a promising blueprint. But sorry, this isn't going to sell phones, not as it works now. Is it better than Siri? Sure. But so were the standard Google voice queries and commands we've had for years. That's not new. It's always a bitter pill to see Google paint us this picture of an amazingly useful product and then give us... not that thing. But if we've learned anything over the years, this is just how Google works. Assistant will evolve, it will get better, and eventually, maybe we'll all be using it. As is, Assistant is an easy way to do voice queries and commands, especially given it can be launched by long-pressing the home button. If you're tired of "OK Google"-ing every time you want to set a timer or an alarm, relief has arrived. That's a neat feature, but it says something that I think that's about the coolest thing Assistant does right now. Launcher shortcuts Launcher shortcuts are to Android as 3D touch shortcuts are to iOS. That's really the deal here, except launcher shortcuts are slightly more narrow in scope. To activate launcher shortcuts, just long-press on an icon on a homescreen or in the app drawer. If the app has shortcuts, they'll appear. A bunch of Google apps already have them, though their usefulness is of varying degrees (Photos has an "I'm feeling lucky" shortcut - talk about a potentially risky click). So, you ask, how do you tell between the action to pull up launcher shortcuts versus move an icon? And the answer is you don't. It's the same thing. Yep, this is a a bit odd. Launcher shortcuts will immediately pop up when you long-press an icon, to move it, you then have to drag beyond a certain threshold, after which the shortcuts will hide away. It's really weird, because you end up getting two vibration feedbacks, which always makes me think for a moment that something has gone wrong. I can't say this implementation is exactly ideal, and it's almost certainly going to confuse a few people who will think they've done something other than try to move their icons by long-pressing them. Anyway, here are a few examples of the shortcuts. YouTube: Trending, subscriptions, search Settings: Battery, Data usage, Wi-Fi Play Music: Recent activity, My library, I'm feeling lucky Calendar: New reminder, New event Play Store: My apps Photos: I'm feeling lucky, Free up space I'm still not 100% sure how to feel about launcher shortcuts. On the one hand, I love that Google is looking into more power user style device tools, things that can speed up common activities and tasks. On the other? This feels slightly clumsy as implemented. Maybe a gesture would have made more sense here? I don't know. I am definitely curious to see how many apps implement this feature, though, as it's part of Android 7.1 and can be used by any launcher via an API. Enhanced backup This one actually has flown under the radar, and I'm not sure why. The Google Pixels automatically back up your apps, app data, contacts, SMS (!), Wi-Fi passwords, call history, and various settings in Google Drive. Now, Android has done some of this for years. Contacts in your Google account, for example, are old hat. But SMS is new, and automatic app data backup in Drive is still fairly low on adoption, so hopefully this "all in one" backup being advertised as a Pixel feature will get developers to utilize it more. But the big idea here is that Google wants you to have an iPhone-like experience when you set up your next Pixel a year or two from now - everything should just come over. Whether it will work that well in practice, we'll have to see. I did not test the new cabled restore system on the Pixel, but Google seems pretty psyched about it, especially since it works with iPhones. I'd be curious myself to see how that experience would be. Moves (gestures) Android's settings app has a new menu, and it's called Moves. Moves currently is home to three features: double-tap power to launch the camera, double-twist while in the camera to switch between the front and rear facing sensors, and the ability to swipe down on the fingerprint scanner to access your notification shade. They all work! There's not much else to be said. The swipe-down gesture on the fingerprint scanner can be initiated a second time to bring up the quick settings interface, and swiping down will hide the tray again. Honestly, it's not terribly responsive and can be difficult to get to work reliably sometimes. I never was a fan of this feature on Huawei devices for the same reason - it just feels a bit gimmicky. But it's there if you want it. Night light Night light is a simple feature you've probably seen on other phones already - it lowers the brightness of the screen's blue pixels to reduce eye strain in low light, supposedly reducing the chance the display will stop you from falling asleep when you should. You can turn it on at any time, as well as set a schedule or use Google's sunrise and sunset data to engage it automatically. I find the sunset timing less than ideal, since I don't go to sleep around sunset, so I use the custom schedule. There are no options to adjust the intensity of the effect. Wallpapers Holy crap there are a ton of new wallpapers on the Pixels, including a bunch of new live wallpapers. Live earth wallpapers are 3D renderings of famous landmarks that shift perspective when you unlock your device or swipe between homescreens. I hope to see even more of these published as time goes on, because they're awesome. Live data wallpapers either correspond to your battery level, the time of day, or weather conditions - they're very stark and abstract. I love everything about this, it really gives you some interesting new ways to personalize your device. This is in addition to literally dozens of new static wallpapers that you can have change daily, with categories like landscapes, cityscapes, life, earth, and textures. I love that Google is using things like 500px and its own social network, Google+, to source the images, too. That means the potential for a lifetime of beautifully curated wallpapers. Sure, there are great apps for this as well, but a lot of people never discover them. It's just one of those little things I appreciate. OS look and feel, Pixel launcher, Nougat generally Many of us have been using Nougat for months now, and we know what it entails. There are few things that the Pixel phones bring to the software equation that aren't available right now on a Nexus 6P, and those it does are covered in detail above (seriously, you are not missing out on Assistant - Pixel owners are Google's beta testers). One thing that won't be coming that we haven't discussed, though, is the overall aesthetic of the Pixel's software. Google has updated the entire look and feel of the device setup, given many items in the system UI blue accents, and changed the navigation keys - they're solid, with a concentric circle around the home button. When you tap the home button, four little colored dots fly out briefly, with a long press causing them to fully extend and activate the Assistant. There is also the Pixel launcher, leaked extensively in the last couple of months. The Pixel launcher is basically just the Google Now launcher with that weird pill-shaped "G" button to bring up the search box and a date and weather widget (it no longer displays time redundantly). Oh, and some round icons, but they're not mandatory (thankfully). Anyway, if you know the Google Now launcher, you know the Pixel launcher. There are no new settings to tweak, it really is just a light re-skin. What we're seeing here, though, is much more important in a wider context: Google is making an Android skin. A skin that, presumably, it will not share with anyone else. I will watch with great interest as Google's Pixel skin evolves and changes over time, and what makes it into stock Android versus what remains exclusive to the Pixel devices. And because I didn't know where else to put it: Google added a reboot button. Yay. Stability At this time, aside from the Wi-Fi issue I mentioned above, I have one bug to report: "OK Google" always-on listening sometimes stops working, and the only remedy is to reboot the device. The phone is stable and works as expected. Of course, given how long I've been using it, it's very possible issues may arise - things I just haven't noticed yet. For now, though, it's smooth sailing. Value I've decided to add this category to our phone reviews, at least for the time being, because I think value is a discussion worth having in its own right, not merely as a fulcrum upon which to balance an entire review. It can make having conversations about a product's merits difficult, and make it too easy to dismiss some products on what really is a single facet alone. So, how does the Pixel stack up on value? We're going to be judging this on the basis of prices in the United States, as we are a US-based blog with a largely American audience. The Pixel line is priced exactly as the iPhone 7 is. You start at $649 for the smaller, 32GB variant, and the larger 128GB variant goes up to $869. Google lacks a 256GB SKU, so technically it's not an exact match, but for the models Google does sell, it really is a mirror image. Is a Google Pixel worth iPhone money? I think if you contend that an iPhone is worth $649, then yes: the Google Pixel is absolutely worth that. But many people vehemently disagree with that premise. If you take the Google Pixel merely as the sum of its parts and put up the $769 Pixel XL against the $499 Nexus 6P, are you going to find nearly $300 of extra "value" there? I mean, no. You're not. That's like taking a $40,000 Mustang GT and comparing it to a $100,000 Porsche 911. Is there $60,000 more performance there? No. If all you care about are the raw numbers, the Pixel isn't an amazing value proposition, and Nexus fans understandably take issue with this. the Nexus 4, 5, 5X, and 6P all had MSRPs that were competitive, if not highly competitive, when they were released. The Google Pixels aren't really concerned with this, and I don't think Google is making an argument that they are. You're buying into Google's promise that these are the devices that will receive the highest level of support and exclusive features going forward. If that proposition is appealing to you, let's consider a few other factors. First, Google does not and likely never will offer the in-store support experience Apple does. If you buy direct from Google, using your warranty, extended or otherwise, means phone or email support and physically mailing out a device that is broken. This is not ideal, and we'll have to see if Google's support staff offers an experience a cut above typical phone manufacturers (I heard that for last year's phones, they were generally pretty good about this stuff, but I'm sure there are horror stories). Next, there's the ecosystem argument. If you buy an iPhone, it does stuff in concert with your other Apple products - be it a MacBook, an iMac, an iPad, or an Apple Watch. You can read your iMessages on your laptop, for example. Google has... Chromebooks. And Android Wear! But really, Google has built those device ecosystems around a much more open model, and I think we'll have to wait until next year to see what their grand vision for a tightly-integrated hardware ecosystem really is. But given people pay basically as much for a Galaxy S7 or S7 edge, which similarly lack such ecosystems, I think that's a bit of a red herring. So, are the Pixels good value for money? Sure, if you're of the opinion that an iPhone is good value for money. Are they great value for money? Probably not. In that sense, they're typical. What you're paying for here is more the promise of future support, advanced software features, and for an experience that is purely Google. Conclusion I feel that after the pricing was leaked, many people expected that Google would pull a rabbit out of its hat with the Pixel. There had to be something more. The truth is, it's just a very good phone, and one that Google is now making the focus of its efforts. It is the first phone with a Google software skin, and the first phone developed by Google independent of the actual Android team (well, as independent as any manufacturer). That's quite interesting: Google has made clear that the Pixel team and the Android team have a "firewall." But that doesn't stop the Pixel team from working with all the various other groups and products inside Google, and that's how we've ended up with the first, and for now only, phone with Google Assistant. The Pixel offers an incredible camera, fast software, premium materials, and high-end components. But it doesn't revolutionize the market, and it doesn't take any big risks. The Pixel, frankly, probably isn't that exciting to most people with a relatively new high-end smartphone. And I don't think it's meant to be - Google's marketing makes clear that a mainstream audience is being targeted here. The Pixel does almost everything well. In fact, it does most things very well. And it does a few things exceptionally, like taking photos. So if you've pre-ordered a Pixel, I have a feeling you won't be disappointed: it's a delight to use, and I'm already deeply attached to the Pixel XL I've been carrying for the past five days. Even the notification sounds are just right to my ears. But if you were a skeptic looking for some hidden killer feature, some justification for a price you found unthinkable? It's not as though Google was hiding the ball when they announced it. They told us what it was, and that's what it is. Google will almost certainly lose some Nexus fans over the Pixels and their high prices, and that is probably something they're well-aware of. Google isn't going after the people buying smartphones on a cost-to-spec basis, that much is obvious. Still, I very much like the Pixel, even with its slightly boring design and iPhone pricing. I like the idea of quarterly maintenance releases - releases I will get first - that install silently in the background while I continue to use my phone. I like my monthly security patches. I like having phone or chat support just a few taps away if I break my phone and need to replace it. I love the camera. The Pixel is a very hard phone not to like, and that really is a rare thing.

As always. I love your ruthlessly considered review style (something I think applies to all AP staff) compared to so many other fluffy tech blogs and mainstream news sites. I have a silver Pixel on pre-order and I'm now more excited than ever. The things that have always been most important to me are speed/performance, Google's version of Android, timely updates, decent battery life, a decent camera... and build quality. I've been holding onto my Nexus 5 for three years now despite it now falling short in the final three criteria. With the Pixel, I'm finally going to get the full package (assuming the battery is better than my N5!). The one thing I'm not entirely sold on is the EIS for video. It looks amazing... until you pan. It's a bit "video game". I think it needs a little more work, but that said I think it will work perfectly in certain applications. Google is on to something. I'm totally in love with the design. I find it wonderfully understated. The word that comes to my mind is confident. It doesn't scream "look at me" like Samsung and others tend to. Google is taking a page out of Apple's book - not by copying the iPhone design - but by taking inspiration from its philosophy and crafting something new. If the iPhone is Adam, the Pixel is Eve. N6P->PixelXL ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Well stated. Except that I'd say the iPhone is like Satan. whispy_snippet Hahaha indeed... JD Stan? N6P->PixelXL ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Yes. Stan D. Satan. Savan I have preorder Pixel XL on Oct 4, I don't care about free unlimited full resolution upload to Google Photo, I can still do that with standard resolution which works great. What are your thoughts on google giving some additional freebies to Pixel owner, such as free You Tube red subscription, some additional data for project fi users or something which actually give you pride in using it. N6P->PixelXL ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ You get a free Daydream View. MJ Think bigger... Blonde with big boobs for a night. Marty Just compared prices of this Pixel and the iPhone 7. Pixel XL - 128GB: $869 IPhone 7+ - 128GB: $869 Since the Pixel is questionable because of being made by HTC, I'd rather have an iPhone 7. Also considering Safari is so much better than Chrome web browser, that's a plus. Falcon And support for 4yrs instead of 2yrs saltyzip Unlimited photo and video backup at original resolution is a big plus for Pixel, not forgetting 24/7 support too Max Johnson I'm going to admit, I am very impressed by this phone's camera. I also admit it is stupid to not allow a 64GB option. mrjayviper one of the selling points of pixel is Google assistant. So Google wants to charge more for the chance to mine my personal data even more? They should be paying me instead? Bryan Breguet I really, really dislike that you think asking for a properly calibrated screen is nitpicking or for annoying people. It is not. It's not a fringe problem. yojetski i must say - this is one of the more honest reviews out there right now for the pixel. talks about the pros and cons (ahem-price) without the hate from naysayers. seriously it is understandable to not like a phone because of its price, but for alot of people to say that it is utter garbage because it's the same $ as an iphone without even trying it? kind of ignorant. my wallet is hurting but i am excited to replace this n6. Sir_Brizz I don't think most people here think it's necessarily bad (aside from the huge bezels and lack of stereo speakers maybe) but at the price it's at it is a much different conversation. I think it looks like a nice upgrade for my 6P... at almost double the price. RNC what is the space wallpaper on phone? looks good...any link for it? thnx 4ui812 I stopped reading after ... Does its battery last the longest? No. Is its screen the best? Not likely. Is it the fastest smartphone on the planet? Eh, no (sorry, Apple still wins that battle). Is the Google Assistant as life-changingly intelligent as Google seems so amped for us believe? Hardly. In fact, it is almost obscenely easy to pick apart Google's phone - one might even say pixel by pixel - because it clearly doesn't afford itself of every bleeding-edge technology or feature it could have. The Pixel lacks waterproofing. The rear camera doesn't use optical image stabilization. The batteries aren't unusually large. There's no microSD slot. Leon Not everyone buys phones to be on the bleeding edge. Sometimes, people just want a good phone that works and is well supported. For them, this might just be it. 4ui812 I see. Thanks. Falcon Its not as well supported as apple. With the same price abc People who pay 700+ for phone, definitely expect the bleeding edge. Otherwise, they'd buy a $200 phone that works. SHunter What the hell man; do you live in a Faraday cage? angryone The only reason I switched from an iPhone to an Android years ago was to have MicroSD storage, and I'm not interested in any phone without it. If I were going to give up on MicroSD, I would just go back to an iPhone. Max Johnson Google phones, aside from the first one, never had microSD. So to complain about no microSD on Google devices are pointless, now it's valid to say you rather get a different phone. Also going to iPhone doesn't fix the problem of not having microSD. At least on Android you can connect an external USB device. me me So a few hours later I scroll in. I see 3 types of replies: 1) those who decided to buy the phone, justify themselves. 2) Those who say it is not worth buying at any price due to lack of what they want (SD slot, IP68, etc). 3) Those who say it is not worth the price but with a price drop would accept buying. If Google had set it at say half the price then it would be: a) moaning about its out of stock b) those who won't buy for lack of a feature. Prices will fall, it is just a matter of when, and really, the earlier we get the 1) morons out of the way who prop up the price, the earlier we can get to serve 3) whispy_snippet Prices will fall when the Pixel 2 launches. Part of what makes something a premium, desirable object is a high price tag. This is marketing 101. charlie Jason I'm a current 6P user. The battery life is not ideal. Under intense use the phone can noticeably heat up, slow down and stutter. The camera app lags. Screen not bright enough and too reflective, leading to poor sunlight performance. Still, there are enough reasons to love this phone for its price. Still photography is still incredible. Front facing speakers are great. I think I will stick with it for another year or two. My next phone would probably be an Oneplus, now that they don't have invite system anymore. Nexus has died and Google isn't offering a good value phone in the foreseeable future. Can't bear heavily skinned Android either. Jay Happy to read the review. Glad people are excited for this. Lots of IPhone comparisons here. If Google is really trying to take the IPhone approach, why can't they change the update OS policy to match Apple's as well? black What about the fast charging capability? Is it as fast as they claim? Does it make up for the small battery capacity? I'd like to know more about the Pixel's battery (not the XL's). Presjar Do a side by side vs the S7 Edge. It is even better than the Iphone7. Samsung make a far superior camera. The Sony sensor in the Pixel is not good enough considering the phone costs the same! Pedro Diego Fernández I don't know... I'm not a nexus fan but for a 800$ phone, I would expect something better than "very good"... that sounds like something you say at a restaurant meaning it's good enough not to send it back but nothing to get you excited... Maybe it's because for my budget I only consider phones for less than 300$ and feel really satisfied with them, so a 800$ phone should be something special to get my attention. So far the only thing special about the pixels is the "made by google" part which I don't think is enough... but time and sales will tell if this was a hit or a miss. I think the real question for the author would be "if you had to spend your own money, would you have bought this phone?" If I had the money I think would have gone Samsung S7 in a heart beat. olivrstal I really appreciate the detailed information about the display saturation in this review. Great job! I guess I probably have to go with that sRGB mode from the developer settings once again. Really enjoyed my time with the Nexus 6P but if there wasn't the sRGB mode I probably would've returned it. Out of the box the colors looked ridiculously oversaturated imo. (I do quite a bit mobile photography, so I want the photos to look somewhat natural on the screen for further editing.) With that Nexus 6P in the sRGB mode, the mode always was turned off, after the phone was shut down, so I always had to activate it again when I restarted the phone (which fortunately didn't happen that often because of that large battery.) Does anyone know if this is still the case and, if it is, if there is a way that I can maintain that sRGB mode even if I restart the phone? Garrett Bridges I was going to skip the first Pixel and go with next year's instead, but my 6P decided an impromptu trip from my pocket during a roller coaster was in order, so I pre-ordered one from Verizon the other day. Sadly it keeps saying it won't come until the 28th. :( I do have to say, this review dampened my expectations and excitement a little. You say it's a good phone, repeatedly, but not having much "great" to say about it made it seem like it has no wow-factor. I'm almost second-guessing my decision and thinking of going for another 6P. Someone help! :-x saltyzip Perhaps the Verge Review will convince you to stick with Pixel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJOgF15LLZk Garrett Bridges That's somewhat better. I envy reviewers getting sent these things! I have to finance this sucker because I'm still paying off my nuked 6P. Eric Horchuck To me this guy came off as a Samsung fan. I know that this is an opinion piece and not "journalism", by any stretch, but my god; I was waiting for "and the lack of a physical, front, home button...". ☺️. Also, for an Android site with Android fans maybe don't use iPhone comparisons (I haven't had an iPhone since the 4), I mean, who cares? I'll be ordering the Pixel XL (I'm thinking in silver since it's the first 'white front' Google phone (Nexus were always black front)) as soon as it's back in the Google store. I think it's awesome and not in a trendy way. Take care, all! JD David a samsung fan? What you smoking? C64 It's still an overpriced iPhone lookalike with huge bezels / chin evo34 Why do you care about looks so much? Do you pose with your phone in front of the mirror in the morning? C64 I look every day at it. So yes i care about the looks. If you can choose to wake up everyday next to a beautiful women or a ugly pig. You'll choose the pig? evo34 The fact that you compare your phone to a woman speak volumes... evo34 I don't fuck my phone C64 I doub you fuck anything JB Nice shoes 👍 Marcelove What a surprise David, with you praising the Pixel and trying to convince readers to buy it... /s Finally we found the android version of Nilay Patel... And like him, always denying any bias towards anything from Apple, everyone can cleary see now who personificates the same pattern when speaking about android... Phone_Addiction This is basically an android version of an iPhone and, yet it still gets love Benjamin Lehto I wonder how long the $1000 smartphone era will last, or more like, how long will the means remain viable for the majority of people that either buy them or get them on contract (which results in paying more over the length of the contract yes)? I get the impression that money is getting much tighter for more and more people and eventually you'd think that that would result in less "Things" being bought, and therefore ends in a new shift of premium devices simply not being purchased in the numbers needed to justify building these devices. I dunno. abazigal The smartphone remains an integral part of many people's lives. As long as this is the status quo, I daresay there will be no shortage of people willing to pay a premium for what they perceive to be a better user experience. BoFiS It's unfortunate that Google still refuses to put MicroSD slots on their devices, or stereo speakers, or waterproof them...but really I'm upset that the smaller Pixel is still pretty large, larger than the GS7, so really they have a large phone and an XL phone, how about a smaller, compact model?? Why is Sony the only company to understand that? Testraindrop "larger than the GS7" ... while having a smaller screen and onscreen buttons compared to the GS7... Singh Nexus 4 mentioned in the article ! Yay Max Johnson Still the best looking and most comfortable to grip Google phone. Singh And running Nougat like a boss 😎 JD When Google can offer 4-5 years of support then they can start charging iPhone like prices. Borgman You're going to be waiting a long while thereasoner You get 3 full OS versions(3 years)at minimum and all point updates with security patches continuing into year 4. What's more is that the phone won't slow to a crawl like old iPhones do when they try and run the latest OS version. What's more is the live on device support provided with the Pixel phones that is 24/7, now that's great support ! I know people with old iPhones who are afraid to update because of the associated performance issues old iPhones get. JD Where do you get 3 years? Just because some phones and tablets got didn't make it Google's official policy. They only promise 18 and 24 months for OS and security updates respectively which is a joke. I said I want 4-5 years of support, I never said I want 4-5 years of full OS (Letter change) updates, it would be great if Google did that but I'm looking for Product support. As much as people complain that Apple's updates slow down phones, at least the 4S had 5 years of security updates with it and you have the option of taking the update or not. You don't get a choice when a device is abandoned. A custom ROM isn't nearly the same I don't want to pay the money Google is asking for to hope that some volunteers will create a ROM with a homebrewed device tree in year 3. Sure 24/7 Live support sounds good (it's a start), but I want the option of a store front as well so I can walk in and show them a physical defect. thereasoner 18 months? Where did you get that from? Got a link? Nexus devices that I'm aware of have seen 3 OS versions in their life and when Google announced monthly security patches a while back they said that they would continue after OS updates stop. I came home with a "physical defect" ony wife's Motorola, the carrier changed it out on the spot the next day, no Moto Store required for that. JD Have you been living under a rock? https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705#nexus_devices thereasoner Lmao!! You need to check that again. " at least 2 years" of support is in addition to the 1st OS version/year you already have in the first year and Google only mentions 18 months when talking about devices AFTER they are no longer sold on the Google Store, as in 18 months MORE support than they already had while for sale on their online store. I know, math is hard :-) JD I know right math is hard. But you know what's harder learning to read. Look at the hard end dates of support for the Nexus phones dumb ass. But you know what's easy? your mom. thereasoner What are you like 12 years old? Lol. It says no guaranteed OS update for the 6p and 5x AFTER September 2017. There's no reason to believe that they won't get their 3rd OS version next fall like Nexus devices before it. You're reading it as support ends September 2017 but they're NOT saying that. In fact they should get next years OS version AND any related point updates over the following year as well as security patches for 18 more months seeing that they just came off the Google Store earlier this month. That puts both of those devices 6 months into year 4 before support end exactly like I said ! JD Let me go tell my 2013 Nexus 5 it's going to be supported in to march 2017. Oh wait... thereasoner Lmao! Your Nexus 5 launched with Android K and also received Android L and Android M. That's 3 full versions and years of support. Google wasn't doing security patches for long so their improved support that has devices getting security patches into year 4 or 18 months after they stop selling them may not apply to 2013 devices. The point is that Google has improved support into year 4 now and you have them getting worse with only 18 months to 2 years of support apparently because math and reading comprehension isn't your thing! Just stfu already! JD Listen you fucktard Google hasn't said shit now stfu while I go line up and plow your mom dcdttu tl;dr Design - meh Display - meh+ Battery - meh Storage - meh Wireless - meh Reception - meh+ Audio - meh Speakers - meh Camera - great! Performance - meh Software - meh Google Assistant - meh Launcher Shortcuts - sure Backup - great! Moves - meh Night Light - meh Wallpapers - great! OS look and feel - meh Stability - fine Value - meh Conclusion - review might have been written on an extremely dreary day Testraindrop Sums it up perfectly, that comment should be featured under the article ;) Da Fuq "Right now, we've got a skeletal version" Is it rich in calcium? Zack Kibler Wow a mention of a Samsung screen that includes the Basic mode. I get so mad when people compare, say the iPhone 7, to the GS7 and talk about how super-saturated the Samsung is compared to the natural colors of the iPhone. Basic mode is pretty much perfect, if realistic color is what you're after. MyClRental AtGmail I'm surprised that there is no mention of the Pixel's value in the increased availability/timeliness /frequency of OS/security/bug/feature/function updates and upgrades that are often delayed and/or undelivered by the double negative lock gates of third-party android device vendor & mobile device carrier, PARTICULARLY that Bastion of Inactivity otherwise known as Verizon. abazigal I will believe it when I see it. arthur if the price would be arround 500 euros = good phone... ... but its not! ps: nobody likes those bezels! Cat Astrophy Those regular security updates better not break my root Rod Those should be the least of your concerns. https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/58npsl/71_appears_to_aggressively_fix_errors_to_the/ Melannie Sandi If it is not as good as other devices (including iphone) and as expensive as an iphone I would rather spending that much money on an iphone. Coming from google I couldn't be more disappointed. As you said it doesn't have anything new, cool, killer, is not even better, is not even among the best, is even boring, but just because it is from google it is easier to forgive all those things missing for tiny details like a "great camera" giving excuses like mainstream market targeted. Is too expensive for no reason, just cause they wanted it to be expensive Devin Rodriguez How is Android Auto with the Pixel? Is there Assistant integration or maybe Auto 2.0? Ben Sin that part of the review where it explains how unremarkable the phone is "is the battery the largest? no is the screen the best? no" onto the part where David justifies the phone's high points sums up why the Pixel isn't worth it to me, as someone who lives in Asia. all the cons he mentions -- no waterproofing, no microSD expansion, no OIS -- are all quite real complaints. but the pros he lists? being able to switch carriers? no bloatware? lol those are all US carrier BS problems. there's no bloatware in international phones, there's no problem switching sim cards. and stuff like "google photos stores your pics at full resolution" is cool but google photos already let you store unlimited photos in a slightly compressed, but still more than enough for most people, format. Testraindrop Yeah, while its mentioned that this review is from a US point of view, outside of the US the positive points just don't really exist (except camera). - Assistant: Will be more or less useless like Google Now outside US - Cloud backup: 4K videos up+downloading eats all free data in day - Carriers: GSM, would be bad if it would not work on any carrier - 24/7 support: lets see about that in each country outside US Marco I have played with an XL at the store, and while shooting 1080p videos at 60fps, I've noticed the display is flickering, and also the video stuttered a couple of times for the first 2 seconds. Anyone noticed that? Maybe it's just because they are demo unit? I really want to switch to this baby and finally ditch ios.... Danske I believe that would the camera frame rate picking up the store's lights "frame rate" if you know what I mean. For example, fluorescent light tubes usually flicker at a frame rate higher than the human eye can see, but when they're on their way out, they flicker low enough to be seen with the classic eyeballs. Rod "Classic eyeballs" I lol'ed Luiz Marin i really hope that theres a led notification... _jack_ that should be much more mentioned and appreciated in reviews :) Rod There is a RBG led. bugdroid It's sooo beatiful :-) I want to eat it. likurges this phone gives me no reasons to buy it if I look at the competition Rod The competition doesn't deliver stock Android and quick updates. likurges Well in my case I really don't care about stock, if anything I prefer some skins because of the more festures that they offer. As for the updates its Nice to have them quickly but again it's not really that important to me. I want a fast phone with good battery like, great Camera that looks good, I would buy the note 7 but well... I think the 7 edge will do Rod Pixel looks ok, and has the best camera. Give it a try. likurges I personally don't like how it looks and the Camera is comparable to the se but it has a lot less features. Another thing that I really don't care about nor can I fully use in my country is Google asistent. This is why I can't think of a single reason to buy this phone Rod What features? Unlimited backup for photos/videos is nice, too. Michael Pahl When HDR is set to ON and not Auto, the camera is PAINFULLY slow.... 4-5 times slower than the Note 7 Like OG Droid Turbo slow. Mike Mine was delivered today and I am very, very impressed. It feels damn near perfect in every respect. I know it doesn't have every desirable feature and it's priced at a premium - but just use the device before rushing to judgement. Đức Thành I am happy to hear that. Sounds really great. kaibosh What a dull, uninspired phone. Can someone tell me one single thing a Pixel can do better than an Axon 7 at half the cost? Also, what is with you guys talking about lag because of how many apps you have installed? Seriously? I have over 400 apps on my OPO 1 and there is no lag - ever. Are you people actually running stock operating systems? Like, for real? There is not one single feature listed in the above review that I don't have on my phone. Yes, that includes the Assistant. I can't believe reviewers don't have the balls to call Google out for a cookie cutter boring brick of a phone that is 40% overpriced. It has a fast camera - and that is *all* it has. Rod Getting updates. The-Sailor-Man Who cares? First- Google always lag with the new features that other phones have. Second, many updates slower the phones. Rod I didn't say anyone cared, I simply responded to the author's question: "Can someone tell me one single thing a Pixel can do better than an Axon 7 at half the cost?" illstplaya . I only have one problem and that's the very weird and extremely ugly white or colored background behind the apps. Why does the camera have that ugly white circle behind it? Same goes for the play music app and the play store and YouTube etc... That's just very ugly. The phone app has a blue circle behind it. The messaging app and a stupid circle behind it. Why do most of the apps have this crap? It's so bad. I've included a picture of my home screen, just to compare to the home screen on the pixel which shows the apps with the ugly circle behind it, and my screen that does not have that strange crap. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5c2677ae1ac8e07a727b2a9b8e72d8470bfe08e23d7466a2a554b2672c2ec2ff.png Đức Thành Because Google just started a circle icons trend for their apps. We all know it looks weird, but not much we can do about it but wait until we get used to it. [email protected] Is the new Assistant really better than Siri ? I can't get Assistant to even take a simple note. Sure, it does better with searching the internet for the Presidents birthday. But I want an assistant that can change an appt on my calendar. Siri can do that but Assistant can't. I want to be able to modify reminders. Or create reminders that show up in a specific place where I can see them all together. With Google who knows where your reminders are stored. Are they stored in Calendar or Inbox or Google Now or Keep. I don't know because reminders created in Assistant don't show up in any of those places for me. I asked Assistant the other day for my calendar. It brought up a Google search. WTF. Want Assistant to open an app. The reply I got yesterday was another Google search. So in the future it may be better, but right now I don't agree. I don't think Siri is necessarily better, but I would say at this point they are about equal. And with the recent companies Apple has purchased you better bet Siri is going to be getting much better. Assistant better work a lot better when Google Home comes out or there are going to be a lot of pissed off people. I want what Google is advertising not what they are working on. I don't want to be a tester. If it can't maybe someone will sue the crap out of Google for false advertising. And you better bet I will return mine if it can't do what Google shows in their videos. I am excited Google is getting into fully into hardware, but they better make sure it works or people will abandon it as fast as this bought it. Rod https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFiu5rfnhzo Yay Bubbles I will act as the voice of alarmist reason and tell you the truth. Don't buy it. I don't care what it costs or what it does. Google is a child with ADHD. It has dropped, cancelled, and screwed people on ALMOST every single hardware item it has sold. PROOF? SOURCE?: I bought a GOOGLE TV, a year later, Google dropped support, made a half ass update, and to this day, either the current apps don't work like they should or I am restricted in some manner from downloading apps which would make it work like ti should. Not a big deal, but here's the thing, when apple has a product, even if it's not the best, such as apple tv, they stick with it, support it, and refine it over time (or at least they used to under Jobs) Why commit to something which past experiences have proven will end in failure and heart ache. The choice is yours. Bye Felicia! Rod Well, I feel sorry for you, but I've had 4 Nexus devices, and all of them had 3 years of support. Nothing to whine about. Falcon I dont think he is talking about security updates. All nexus only received 2 major updates (name change updates) Rod Sorry, I didn't specify the type of update. But, 3 years of support for a smartphone is pretty decent nowadays. Of course Apple nails it with those 5 years, though. Hexlattice I just saw a Verizon Pixel commercial and I'm honestly confused by how Verizon gets away with this "only at Verizon" lie that they're saying in this commercial... Like, I feel bad for anyone that believes it. João Victor Schiavo "and LG's phones probably do something better but I'm struggling on that one at the moment." LMAO Msinko I could never. Looks too much like a iPhone, Android 7 as well. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Awesome, tremendous phone. The best all-around phone on the planet, bar none. JohnyNoLegs Although not perfect, it makes my enjoy using my phone. Zero lag, always keeps apps in the background, amazing speaker and camera, display is fantastic (not the best compared to my note 7), but as a whole I would take this phone over 6p or note 7 any day. Roberto Virga "The Pixel is IP53, which is basically to say it has no real water-resistance." I disagree. Here's a real-life anecdote. A few days ago I went to play Pokemon Go under a light rain. From time to time, a few drops of rain fell on my Nexus 6P, which I promptly wiped with a paper tissue. At the time, the phone looked fine. However, later that day, I experienced several random reboots, something this phone had never done before. Luckily, whatever humidity had accumulated inside slowly dissipated, and I haven't experienced any more random reboots since that day. This experience has taught me several things, such as - you could do much worse than IP53; - while for a smartwatch I wouldn't settle for anything less than IP67, for a phone resistance to light or moderate rain might be enough for me. Linked Devices Besides the camera and Google assistant. What features does this phone really offer over the 8 month older S7? The S7 has the Gear VR already fully up and running with enough quality titles that I haven't been able to get through all of them. It has the exclusive SAPA engine compatible with iRig, sound camp, thumb jam etc to do ultra low latency studio quality audio production and live processing for on stage without missing a beat (the only other phone line that can do the same is the iPhone). It has Samsung cloud and simple sharing which lets you share hundreds of pictures or any file actually of any file size to anyone in your contact list which basically amounts to free web hosting It is IP68 water resistant which allows the phone to be used as an underwater camera which works amazingly well with their auto sensitivity adjusting screen. It can take pictures on raw mode and has a fully fleshed out pro mode making it a truly professional camera. It's display is literally the most accurate available on the market right now. It features the Knox Subsystem which lets you run two fully encrypted separate isolated Android environment simultaneously. It has Samsung pay which has far broader compatibility than Android pay--it literally works anywhere you can swipe a card. It's battery lasts a full hour or two longer. It runs faster and with less lag as demonstrated in side by side comparisons. It has 24/7 tech support by voice, text or even video chat via the Samsung + app. The list can go on. Why would the pixel cost more than the S7? That just doesn't make any sense. You're getting so much less. Pursuer The laggy iPhone 7 still wins the battle??? Amit Avasthi I think the game is very different. Google is taking a leap to be first movers by controlling hardware to demonstrate what AI can do. It may also mean the new OS could come on pixel next Jeremy V. Riedl Hey, i know this is off topic, but when are you going to publish a review for the LG V20? You guys are dead last in doing this and usually the people i go to first for reviews. You published a hands on review almost two months ago and haven't published an actual review yet. Meanwhile Google releases a phone and you have a review published in like five days. Jeremy V. Riedl How long till you finish your V20 review that you started 2 months ago? This one you managed to get done in 5 days. Magdee Alshbith Hi I'm from London I just bought two of the Google pixel XL 128g and spend £819.99 on each one of them with the total cost of 1639.98 pounds for the two of them there's something really annoying and I didn't expect that from such a high-end phone by Google , it doesn't actually show the notification on each app !!!!!!🤔🤔 like how many missed calls I have received or how many emails I have received or how many WhatsApp messages or calls I have received UNTIL i must drop the notification bar from the top of the screen to be able to see and check them all or I have to go in to each app to see how many messages I have received !!!!!?? i expect that each app should have a notification sign and a number of how many messages or emails or calls received like any other Android and iOS device . and one more thing while you are typing a message and you want to go back between words and you want to add some adjustments and try to point between letters it's NOT actually flexible and accurate it will freezes up for a second because of spelling suggestions even when the words are correct this actually slow down the typing procedure a little bit . the typing experience is fine but switching between lines while you are typing it's slow and not flexible like the Samsung or the iPhone typing experience and even if you want to compose a message by Google voice typing it's slow and not always accurate . the two XL devices I have are the same with the typing and message voice experience!! I know this could be a little things but those are a MAJOR problem for Android users especially with this Price Tag you just don't expect some little problems like this and i know that Google has taking a long time to develop this device and they should be aware of such a little things that could be a major problem not to having this particular device compare to other smartphones in the market today . I hope this all could be fixed as soon as possible by in update from Google or I'm returning the devices back before the 28 days off not satisfaction time will end . Thiago Oliveira I know a bug: like some iPhone 5S, when Google Pixel is plugged on third party USB, the touch screen gets a bit irresponsive. kingRoot One one question : Can this be rooted easily by sing apps like KingRoot? Or we need a lengthy process? Владимир Петров First year for Pixel is just a test priod. Peaple will look at support, development of features, polishing the os and UI. If it held well until Pixel 2 come, then the smartphone worth it's money. By this I mean also working on mistakes like getting rid of the glass panel (it tends to break and create flares, scratches), improved durability (doesn't pass drop tests at all), portrait camera (50mm+), waterproofing. Assistant doesn't have support in other countries as well as 24 hour google support. Allo lacks backup. Etc... Now there is too much compromice. And google experience could be even better on the iPhone (the phone with the same price I mean). I used to have nexus 5 and I loved it! But 1 year waste with snapdragon 810 (let's tell the truth, it's unsuccessfull processor) made me switch to iPhone. This year I hoped to move back to Android, but Pixel dissapointed a little. Hope, that next year everything that google promised would work exactly right. TreasuresQueen This is a great phone! I do, however, have an issue with the Messenger app. It doesn't LOCK messages at all. The camera is awesome on it though I miss the ability to shake my phone and access the camera as I did on my Motorola phone. I wish the phantom space on the end of the phone was an additional speaker! My phone also overheats but then again, I'm playing Pokemon Go on it LOL KingRoot Google Pixel is just brilliance <3 - kingRoot Anas Ali This article is well written and very informative.
