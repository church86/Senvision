According to 9to5Mac, the iOS 10 beta 6 introduces a new face for the News and Music apps, and the widgets for the Lock and Home screens. There is a new Home app for HomeKit, and new iMessage features are also added along with tons of new additions. The iOS 10 beta 6 is only available for developers, but the public can now get ahold of the iOS 10 beta 5. To download the latest beta of the upcoming iOS 10, interested users have to sign up for Apple's beta program. Those who have already signed up can download it over-the-air (OTA). The iOS 10 beta 5 features minor improvements such as a new lock sound and louder keyboard clicks. Other new features are discussed in the video by 9to5Mac below. Many developers noted that this might be the last beta to be released by Apple for the next iOS, iDigitalTimes reported. There are rumors that Apple is planning an event in the first week of September, reportedly on Sept. 7, when the next-generation iPhone is expected to be unveiled along with the final version of the iOS 10. The new iPhone 7, 7 Plus, the rumored 7 Pro and operating system (OS) are then expected to be available the week after or more specifically, Sept. 14. However, Apple has not officially announced an event or a date, so they are just rumors for now and therefore should be taken with a grain of salt. The iOS 10 beta 6 for developers and beta 5 for the public can already be downloaded and tested on the iPhone 5, 5c, 5s and up to the latest, iPad 4, iPad Air 1 and 2, iPad Pro 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch, iPad Mini 2 and up, and the sixth generation of the iPod Touch.

Wednesday November 23, 2016 US WORLD PERSECUTION MINISTRY CULTURE VIDEO Subscriptions Homepage CULTURE iPad Pro update, latest rumor: Three new iPad models may arrive in 2017 including a 10.5-inch iPad Pro Catherine Salvador 17 August, 2016 11:42 PM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (REUTERS/Stephen Lam)The new iPad Pro on display during an event at the Apple headquarter, Cupertino, California. iPad enthusiasts are always on the lookout for latest news about the release of a new model and alleged sources say that Apple is planning to launch three iPad models to add to the iPad lineup in 2017. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that the iPad may most probably have a conservative improvement on its hardware by 2017 as Apple is reportedly planning to launch three future models, which almost have similar designs with the previous models. The anticipated 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2 may come along with a 10.5-inch model and it may be priced more expensive than the low-cost model version of the 9.7-inch iPad. It is also speculated that the 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2 and 10.5-inch variant will be run by an A10X processor, utilizing 10nm process technology that will be solely supplied by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Mac Rumors reported. Kuo further predicted the possibility of the Cupertino tech company positioning the 10.5-inch iPad Pro as an alternative choice to the 9.7-inch model. In an article by Apple Insider, the current flagship model, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, is installed with the A9X, which implies that the next model will already be run by the A10X and launched in 2018. Meanwhile, most fans are still checking out the alleged iPad Pro 2's leaked specs, which were shown on Apple Insider. An anonymous source who apparently works at an Apple supplier in China showed two images of the supposed upcoming device. It shows the tablet's settings written in Chinese characters, though the publication noticed that the model number is different from what Apple usually use for their previous and current iPad models. However, they did spot that the number system is similar to the traditional numbering method of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro.

And inside, the highlights of the functional and neatly arranged instrument panel are the state-of-the-art IntelliLink infotainment systems. Together with the personal connectivity and mobility assistant Opel OnStar, they make the Mokka X the best-connected compact SUV in Europe. Its new generation IntelliLink infotainment gives owners a simple way to bring the world of smartphones and apps into their Mokka X. In Germany, NAVI 900 IntelliLink is optionally available for €950, while R 4.0 IntelliLink is standard with the Edition equipment level. The Mokka X with R 4.0 IntelliLink features a seven-inch touchscreen as well as USB and Bluetooth connectivity for hands-free phone calls, audio streaming and looking at photos, videos and films. Like NAVI 900 IntelliLink, it is also compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Using either application in the Mokka X is easy. A 'Projection' icon on the infotainment touch-screen is visible when a phone is not connected, then changes to indicate either Apple CarPlay or Android Auto (whichever is applicable ) when a compatible phone is connected via USB. Android Auto requires a phone running Android Lollipop 5.0 operating system or above, while Apple CarPlay requires an iPhone 5 or later. Navi 900 IntelliLink is for customers who prefer an integrated navigation system. Display and operation are via the eight-inch colour touchscreen. IntelliLink enables audio streaming, having incoming SMS read aloud and voice control as well as watching films and videos – the former, of course, only when the car is stationary. The navigation system also features maps of more than 30 European countries and it can be displayed two or three-dimensionally according to personal preference and controlled via voice command. Sixty radio stations, destinations, contacts, telephone numbers or playlists can be saved as 'Favourites'. For connoisseurs of music, the Mokka X with NAVI 900 IntelliLink is additionally available with a high-end Bose sound-system. Optional DAB+ digital radio further extends the range of radio stations and the audio quality. OnStar offers peace of mind for Mokka X drivers with the personal connectivity and service assistant Opel OnStar, Mokka X owners get a 'guardian angel' at their side – 24/7 365 days a year. OnStar automatically reacts in an emergency. If the airbags are deployed in an accident, vehicle sensors automatically alert an OnStar advisor which contacts both the driver and the emergency services immediately. At the press of the red button, the driver can get emergency assistance if needed. By pressing the blue button, the driver can get help from the OnStar advisors with destination download, or to find a restaurant, fuel station or place of interest. The OnStar’s myOpel mobile app for your smartphone shows you your vehicle diagnostics, can lock or unlock doors remotely (if you’re not sure you have done so already ), or locate your vehicle at airport or underground parking by instruction via the app to flash the lights and sound the horn. Owners can also call up important data such as oil condition or tyre pressures, send destinations to the in-car navigation system, and from September they will be able to manage the car’s embedded Wi-Fi hotspot, which allows up to seven devices to connect in and around the vehicle.

The industry clearly lost a true visionary who absolutely changed many things about how we live our daily lives. I had met and covered Jobs in the early days of the industry, and he was truly charismatic and could see things others flat out could not. But five years have passed and Jobs' influence over the products that Apple builds is gone. We are no longer seeing category-changing product introductions like the iPod, iPhone and iPad. The Apple Watch was very likely the last product Jobs had influence over. So it's now Tim Cook's company, and it's different. Cook is also a longtime industry player, having worked at IBM early in his career. But I got to know him a bit when he was chief operating officer of Intelligent Electronics. IE was one of the multibillion-dollar channel companies back in the late 1980s, early 1990s. [Related: Why Cisco's Chuck Robbins Is Able To Move So Fast] Cook is smart, disciplined and, frankly, a very good manager. But he's not Jobs. Apple has always been a disrupter of other people's technology. Even the original Macintosh was a play to dramatically improve what others had started. But to be a disrupter you have to be a visionary, and nothing in Cook's background signals that to be his strong suit. Can he manage disruptive thinkers? Jobs once said a lot of his job was deciding what not to do. When you are the one leading the disruption agenda you can do that, but I'm not sure you can manage other people who are in that role. Cook today is managing declining sales in iPhones, iPads and computers. The Apple Watch is a marginally successful product. There has been no major innovation coming out of the company since the Jobs influence has waned. And there are other problems. Siri still isn't world-class and pales in comparison to Amazon's Alexa. Apple's mapping app is not nearly as good as Google Maps. This fall Apple is going to release less-than-remarkable upgrades to the iPhone, which may help it catch up to Samsung's Galaxy but is unlikely to be better. It will refresh the MacBook Pro with more speed and some software enhancements, but so what? Google and Tesla are way ahead of Apple in self-driving cars. Samsung has caught up in phones. Apple has no advantage in notebooks. The tablet isn't growing as a category. Its enterprise deals with IBM and Cisco have produced nothing of value. So unless there is a Jobs protégé we don't know about, Cook and the Apple board need to decide where the company is going. Cook and Apple also need to begin acting a bit humbler. Perhaps, dare I say it, they need to start realizing Apple no longer has the swagger to be able to convince entire industries to change the business model to its benefit. Maybe Apple should start looking for partnerships that can help it gain share in categories it plays in. Become a true business partner where both sides benefit. Apple destroyed what was once an incredibly loyal VAR channel, something Cook saw firsthand in his IE days. New Macs and a channel attack could make inroads in corporate America. I've never understood why Apple doesn't embrace the channel more fully and leverage the huge advantage it can bring. Unless Cook and company take to heart the phrase of its old advertising line and begin "thinking different" about the channel and its entire approach to the market, we will be saying its best days ended two years ago when the last of the Jobs' influenced product came to market.

That means that Apple, the world's largest company, is also one of the few that can post a $13.6 billion (roughly Rs. 91,079 crores) profit and still miss expectations because the product it's sold a billion of isn't selling quite as well as it once did. Those sounding the alarm bells over Apple point to a few factors, chief among them that the smartphone market is slowing down and growing "saturated" - a term analysts use when they want to say that most people interested in buying a new smartphone probably have one already. For Apple, which makes nearly two-thirds of its revenue from the iPhone, it looks like that could be a big problem. Of course, Apple chief executive Tim Cook is aware of this. It doesn't really bother him."This is actually a privilege, not a problem," Cook said in an interview with The Washington Post. Talk about turning lemons into lemonade and bugs into features. Cook's optimism - some might say denial - is not particularly popular, even among devoted Apple watchers. Some are even saying that Apple's crested the peak and is on its way back down. (Also see: The Privacy Debate Is Personal to Tim Cook) The bears continued to roar after the company reported that its revenue had dropped from the previous year for the second quarter in the row. That just doesn't happen at Apple, or at least not at the Apple we've come to know in the past decade. Yet even that doesn't seem to faze Cook. "I realize that the people who are focused on this 90-day clock say, 'Oh, my God, the smartphone industry only grew by 1 percent or decreased by 6 percent.' You know, the global economy's not that great right now," Cook told my Post colleague Jena McGregor. "But if you're in it for the long haul, this is the best market on earth." He believes that, over time, "every person in the world will have a smartphone." And he's willing to wait for it. In that way, Cook is an outlier in a go-go-go tech world. His accomplishments are on a long-term scale. They take investment. They're about refinement, about maturity. As chief operating officer, Cook was credited with what some could arguably call Apple's greatest but most boring accomplishment - the massive manufacturing and distribution chains that made it a household name in Beijing, Baltimore and everywhere in between. So Cook's ears are closed to the criticism Apple gets for not being as flashy or open about its moonshots as its competitors. Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook, for instance, are all very vocal about the spaghetti they throw at the wall. Sure, Apple may try a wearable here or a cheaper smartphone there, but it's not running headlong into anything. "Technology is one of these industries where every week there's a new shiny object that people are skating to," Cook told The Post. Further, he said, "Regardless of who you are, there's only so many things that you can do at a very high-quality and deep, deep level - personally and in business. And so we're not going to change that. That's core to our model and way of thinking." There's a touch of (dare we say?) Jobsian hubris in that. But it does speak to Cook's own brand of innovation, which is in setting foundations rather than breaking ground. He cements success. It's no coincidence that, as Apple's hardware divisions see slower growth on the horizon, its services division is seeing more investment. In Cook's mind, the addressable market for the iPhone is 7 billion - and he knows those people will constantly need things to watch, listen and do on their phones. That's great for a company that's looking for stability. It's great for a firm making sure it has enough money to stoke the future flames in research and development, which has grown under Cook's watch. But the slow innovation philosophy can be hard to jell with a company vocabulary and culture that's steeped in superlative. So much of Apple's appeal has been due to its dramatic history, its deep lows that made its highs all the more breathtaking. The truth is that Tim Cook could probably keep Apple humming along forever. The question is whether the rest of the world can ever accept an Apple that isn't run by one of the crazy ones. © 2016 The Washington Post Tags: Apple, Tim Cook, Steve Jobs Nasa's Space Robotics Challenge Aims to Design Robots for Mars Journey Putting a Computer in Your Brain Is No Longer Science Fiction Tim Cook's Own (Slow) Brand of Innovation     Advertisement   In Mobiles and Tablets Latest Ziox Mobiles Zelfie Intex Aqua E4 HTC Desire 650 Panasonic Eluga Mark 2 HTC 10 evo Ziox Mobiles Astra Prism Ziox Mobiles Astra Zing+ Huawei Mate 9 Lite Vivo Xplay6 Vivo X9 Plus Vivo X9 Lyf Wind 7i OnePlus 3T Gionee S9 Vivo V5 Huawei Mate 9 Pro HTC Bolt Hyve Pryme Panasonic P71 Zopo Color F2 Popular iPhone 7 Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Motorola Moto Z Moto Z Play Lenovo K5 Note Xiaomi Redmi 3s HTC 10 OnePlus 3 Moto G4 Xiaomi Mi5 Galaxy J7 2016 Redmi Note 3 iPhone SE Sony Xperia Z5 Micromax phones Samsung phones Android Phones Smartphones Google Phones From Gadgets 360 Shop » Yu Yureka Plus In Mobiles Buy Now Rs. 12,500Rs. 6,389 Celkon Millennia Q599 Ufe...

So now, consumers should not expect a third variant of the iPhone 7 to show up during Apple’s September event. Earlier today, MacRumors learned that the iPhone 7 Pro was simply created as a backup device to the dual-lens variant of the upcoming iPhone 7. Hence, Apple may have  thought of naming the dual-lens variant prototype as the iPhone 7 Pro with the contingency plan of scrapping this variant if the introduction of the new camera technology to the larger iPhone backfires. Now that things have worked out, however, the Cupertino giant is said to have ditched the idea of launching a variant with the “Pro” moniker and reverted its naming system to include just the iPhone 7 for the standard version and the iPhone 7 Plus for the larger 5.5-inch dual-lens device. Though this new report has clarified the official names of the iPhone 7 devices ahead their launch, it is still not clear if Apple will only be releasing an iPhone 7 Plus handset with a dual-lens system, or if it also plans to release one without the dual-lens technology. Should it release both variants under the Plus line, consumers could expect that the dual-lens camera would most likely come with the most expensive price tag and the biggest memory onboard. Related Stories Apple Launches watchOS 3 Beta 6 Ahead Of Fall Release, Apple Watch 2 Meanwhile, with this new report coming into light, 9To5Mac claims that everyone can now consider the iPhone 7 line as the second “S” line after the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus smartphones, since both 2015 and 2016 variants can be considered as minor upgrades from 2014’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s Plus, design-wise. Still, it is work noting that the iPhone 7 line will be the most revolutionary yet, given that the universal 3.5mm headphone jack has been excluded from these devices. With the absence of the audio jack, there are sources claiming that the new iPhones would either rely on Bluetooth connectivity or a Lightning dongle to provide users with a means of listening to sound or music from the devices. As for the other specifications and features of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, Mac Otakara’s sources stated that the phones will indeed feature the rumored flush, pressure-sensitive Home button and the powerful A10 chip. Other than these two, the internals and the external features of the devices would be the same ones found in the current iPhones. The iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus are expected to be publicly announced at Apple’s Sept. 7 event. Pre-orders for the two are expected to commence on Sept. 9, while their wide release is expected to begin on Sept. 16.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Cash Money Records, a hip-hop label co-founded by Birdman (a.k.a. Bryan Williams), has signed a deal with Apple for a new documentary, according to Bloomberg. On Tuesday, Birdman posted a photo on Instagram that also features Larry Jackson, the head of Apple’s original music content. Many people took this to mean Apple had struck a deal for Cash Money’s upcoming albums, but that’s apparently not the case. Instead, the alleged documentary is in an effort to further bolster Apple’s original programming lineup, which will also reportedly feature a mini-series based on the life of Dr. Dre. Apple is also developing a show called Planet of the Apps, which will focus on developers seeking venture capital investment. Strangely, Birdman links to a post on MusicBusinessWorldwide that suggests the deal, which hasn’t been officially confirmed by Apple, could potentially be music related, saying it “spells bad news for Spotify.” Earlier this year, Drake, who signed an exclusive deal with Apple reportedly in the $19 million range, released his much-anticipated new album, Views, on Apple Music as a timed exclusive. Drake is signed to Cash Money Records, along with other artists such as Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj and Tyga. Apple will may discuss the deal further during its alleged iPhone 7 event on September 7. http://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/apple-music-signs-game-changing-label-deal-cash-money-records/ @thelarryjackson @applemusic #Biggathenlife #lifestyle A photo posted by Birdman5star (@birdman5star) on Aug 16, 2016 at 2:46pm PDT Source Bloomberg Via Instagram Image Source CashMoneyRecords Topics #Apple #Apple Music Brandon Russell Brandon Russell enjoys writing about technology and entertainment.

Next on the docket for Apple Pay support appears to be Chick-Fil-A, according to a tweet from the restaurant chain. Last year, it was reported that Apple Pay support was coming to Chick-Fil-A locations around the country, but the rollout never fully began, though a handful of users have been able to use the service sporadically. According to today’s tweet, however, Apple Pay will be accepted at all Chick-Fil-A locations as of this Friday, August 19th. The mobile payment platform will be supported in-store and in the drive thru. Chick-Fil-A’s adoption of Apple Pay comes after the company has experimented with QR-based solutions in the past. Those solutions ultimately failed, according to employees, much like other QR-based offerings we’ve seen. Chick-Fil-A has, however, supported Apple Pay in its recently revamped app on iOS. Apple keeps a list of retailers that support Apple Pay on its website, though it has not yet been updated to acknowledge Chick-Fil-A’s support. The fast-food chain is still listed as “coming soon” on Apple’s website as of now. Other entities listed as coming soon including Forever 21, Johnny Rockets, T-Mobile, and L.L. Bean. Some retailers, however, continue to resist Apple Pay. Just last week, CVS announced their own “CVS Pay” QR code-based mobile payments solution. Walmart also resists Apple Pay, instead opting for its own QR solution, Walmart Pay. As is usually the case with Apple Pay rollouts in national chains, some users have already reported being able to use the service at their local Chick-Fil-A. The full rollout, however, should be completed by this Friday, August 19th. Let us know in the comments of your experience using Apple Pay in Chick-Fil-A locations in the comments! @loneswords Yes, as of August 19th, Apple Pay and Android Pay are available for payment both in-restaurant and in the Drive Thru. — Chick-fil-A, Inc.

Apple has already forecast a third consecutive quarter of revenue declines, led by weaker sales of its top-selling product, the iPhone. Target CEO Brian Cornell said the weakness in Apple’s sales at the retailer was seen in all products, and that the company is putting plans in place to better capitalize on new devices when they hit the shelves. Hot spot for pot Los Angeles is to the marijuana industry “what Silicon Valley is to technology or what New York is to fashion and finance.” At least that’s how Steve Gormley, CEO of Seventh Point LLC, sees things, which is why his company has secured more than $100 million in commitments for its first fund in the legal cannabis industry. If those commitments come through, Seventh Point would have the largest fund ever with that approach. Seventh Point invests in medical marijuana dispensary assets, which include businesses as well as licensing and cultivation facilities, and focuses on California, particularly Los Angeles. D’oh! Sometimes even the best intentions can get you in trouble, which is why the Philadelphia Daily News apologized Wednesday. A column by Ronnie Polaneczky — “She Can Vault Over the Vitriol” — describing how American gymnast Gabby Douglas had been harassed on social media, along with a photo captioned: “Gabby Douglas: Olympic Gold Medalist, need we say more?” Very nice, except the photo was of Simone Biles.

Fox Business1:49 UP NEXT VENICE BEACH, Calif. — For half a decade, the launch of an Apple iPhone triggered the same kind of global hysteria once reserved for beloved music groups — customers camping for days in front of a store, often in Apple-themed costumes.  Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 110.80 -1.01 -0.90% Target Corp TGT ▲ 78.74 +0.87 +1.12% Samsung Electronics Co Ltd SSNLF ▼ 1,250.00 -175.00 -12.28% That may be changing. Low expectations for major changes to the next upgrade, and data showing consumers are holding onto their smartphones longer, suggest the Apple buzz is fading.  Apple has reached the point where “the phone is so good, I’m just not as stoked to get the new version,” says Blake Rose, who recently moved west from Kettering, Ohio. He owns the iPhone 6S, released last September.  Sales of Apple products dropped more than 20% at Target Corp. during the retailer's quarter ended July 30, said Target CEO Brian Cornell on Wednesday, contributing to a 7% drop in total sales.  Apple historically introduces new iPhones shortly after Labor Day, and if it follows past years' patterns, it would launch a phone with a major redesign and upgrade, say the iPhone 7.  This fall, however, some analysts including Tim Bajarin of Creative Strategies expect Apple to hold off on a major upgrade, waiting for 2017 and the tenth anniversary of the phone instead. "I wouldn't be surprised if next year, Apple skips 8 and 9 and introduces the iPhone 10, for the anniversary," says Bajarin.  Apple didn't respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.   Analysts expect three key new add-ons for the next iPhone: --A dual-camera sensor, that is designed to dramatically improve low-light images, and make it easier to zoom in on photos. --More internal storage, at 32 gigabytes, up from the standard 16 GB. --Removal of the headphone jack port, which will require consumers to plug their phones and earbuds into the Lightning charging port. This will probably cause them to buy new headphones and buds. How does Apple sell a new edition with minimal new features? If the camera is really good, "consumers will respond," says Bajarin. "It depends upon the quality." Sales for the latest iPhone, the 6S and 6S Plus, didn't catch fire with consumers like previous models. Apple has reported slumping sales for the previous two quarters, a first for the company, which sent revenue down 15% for the June quarter. Iphone unit sales fell to 40.4 million in the recent quarter, down 15% year-over year. Earlier this year Apple introduced the smaller iPhone SE, which introduced no new features but carried a lower price in a smaller body. While Apple says sales have been strong for the SE, they haven't been been enough to push iPhone unit numbers higher than previously.  © Michel Kofsky The current iPhones so good Blake Rose from Ohio "not stoked" to buy new one. The last major re-design for the iPhone was in 2014’s iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models, which remain Apple’s best-selling iPhone models. Consumers loved the larger screens and improved camera. But 2015’s 6S and 6S Plus failed to impress in an equal way, with new features like 3D Touch shortcuts and the ability to add short seconds of video clips to your photos. “They don’t really change anything except the camera and speed,” said Lala O’Malley, of Los Angeles. “It ended with the 4S." For the next version, Maya Borski of Riverside, Calif., doesn't mind losing the headphone jack. “Now you’ll only have to worry about one hole in the phone getting wet instead of two and ruining the whole phone,” she says.  And speaking of water issues, many of the  consumers we spoke to here on Ocean Front Walk said they would love to see a 100% waterproof iPhone--like the new Samsung Galaxy Note 7, unveiled this week.  “Where’s Apple with that?” says Rose. But even though the innovation from Apple over the past few years has slowed, Apple fans are still out there. Ryan Seron of Boyton Beach, Florida says he’ll be “standing online,” on opening day to get the latest iPhone. “Everyone always wants the newest thing.” And O’Malley, though she seemed ho-hum about a new iPhone’s prospects admitted that she too will probably opt for the new model. How often does she get a new one? “Sadly, every year,” she says.

But prices are dropping, and external drives with deep storage are fast becoming something we all want on our desktops or in a travel bag. Samsung’s T3 SSD lineup is perhaps the best known of the bunch. We put the 2TB USB-C offering through its paces, comparing it to cloud storage as well as spinning drives. It’s small TNW Answers Your questions answered by founders, experts and thought leaders in business, design and tech. Join a chat The first thing that jumps out is how tight the package on this 2TB model is. Compared to the Porsche Design drive I recently tested, it’s downright dwarfish. That size is possible because SSD has no moving parts; it doesn’t need to spin, and creates very little heat while operating. Every bit of this drive is storage. While it’s nowhere near as pretty as the Porsche Design drive, the size more than makes up for that. Faster than a Porsche (or moving clouds) Speed kills, and the T3 simply murders anything comparable. It’s roughly twice as fas as the spinning Porsche drive, and typically about five times as fast as cloud storage on a Wi-Fi connection hovering around 15Mbps for uploads. Those gains are for simpler transfers — something most users will run into, like moving 10-20 files around at a time. When you start moving huge folders, the T3 shines. I cached my entire Google Drive (about 50GB data) to shuffle it around from my computer’s hard drive to an external source. The T3 completed the transfer in about 45 seconds. The Porsche drive took about five minutes (not bad), and cloud storage took roughly 10 minutes (I tested with iCloud and Google Drive). Cables matter I tested the 2TB T3 with a 2013 MacBook Pro and 2016 MacBook. The drive comes with a USB to USB-C cable, which is adequate for file transfer. If you want to use it with a MacBook, Apple’s included cable won’t help you much. It’s not meant for high speed file transfers. I purchased an Aukey USB-C cable for about $12 on Amazon, and that fixed the speed issues I was having with Apple’s cable. For the price, Aukey’s nylon-wrapped cable is a worthwhile upgrade from Apple’s standard white offering — especially if you want to use any sort of external drive like the T3. You get what you pay for For 2TB, you’ll pay about $730 for the T3. That’s a lot of cash. The Porsche drive will run you $160, and it’s easy to find similar drives even cheaper. Spinning drives are seeing the end of days for consumers. The upside is that if they fail, data recovery is typically much easier than it is with SSDs. And the argument for cloud storage data safety trumps both arguments. The trouble with the cloud is that it typically requires a subscription unless you want to keep data spread out all over the Web by using the 5 to 15GB free tiers available just about everywhere. For consumers, 1TB is likely enough storage — and the best price you’ll find from a reputable provider like Google or Apple is $10 per month. Apple tops out at 1TB. Google scales up to 10TB, and the pricing matches that scale at $100 per month. Tucking information into the cloud is almost inarguably the easiest method, but if you plan on having a large backup for a few years or more, finding a good external drive is probably more cost effective. I was using iCloud to store files I accessed across multiple desktops, and it was getting bulky — handy, but crowded. In offloading much of the larger files and stuff that I wasn’t going to access any time soon onto the T3, I was able to reduce how much I spent on cloud storage. SSD is better (sometimes) For desktop users, I’d say the T3 is a no-brainer. It’s fast, transfers a ton of files quickly (with the right cable) and is highly portable. It’s also worth the spend if your new MacBook came with a small amount of internal storage. It doesn’t replace the cloud for every purpose, though. As a macOS and iOS user, Photos and Notes are two apps I rely on — and both need iCloud. I can’t get away from spending a few bucks monthly on iCloud for that reason, but I can put a glass ceiling on my spending by managing my data every few months. I don’t need to keep large Xcode builds or wireframes for apps in the cloud, and storing legacy personal files I won’t access makes no sense for the cloud, either. And with the 2016 MacBook Pro likely carrying USB-C, cables matter — and finding a good USB-C to micro USB-3 (the standard most modern external drives use) cable won’t be easy. I like the T3’s portability, which was a big reason I began using it to better manage my cloud storage. I often take my MacBook and work remotely, but don’t want to carry around a large spinning drive in the off chance I’ll need a file. The SSD fits in a pocket. It’s spendy, and that’s maybe it’s only downside. As time goes on, SSD pricing will drop, but I still prefer accessing files on the T3 to any other method so it’ll stay in my bag (and on my desk).

According to the well-respected Japanese blog Mac Otacara, Apple will once again go with the standard and Plus models for its next-gen iPhones. The site also alleged Apple has chosen the iPhone 7 name after all, despite this year's upgrade not seeming like a particularly substantial progression. Related: iPhone 7 2016 - everything you need to know It's thought the company didn't want to go with another 'S' variant, but with some sources (like Twitter leakster @evleaks) claiming otherwise, we'll have to wait and see. The prospect of an iPhone 7 Pro has hung around for a while, despite it seeming an unlikely path for Apple to tread. According to the report (via MacRumors), it was only ever a fallback plan for Apple in case plans to integrate dual-lens cameras into the iPhone 7 Plus were unsuccessful. However, all recent leaks have suggested that the iPhone 7 Plus will indeed be the home for that dual-lens snapper. Elsewhere in Mac Otacara's report, the site alleges that we will indeed see that flush, touch-based Home button, which has been the subject of more recent speculation. Apple is believed to be revealing the handsets, and perhaps a new Apple Watch, at a yet-to-be-confirmed event on September 7.

Leaked images of the new phone that have made their way online have generated excitement -- and some criticism -- ahead of the smartphone’s official release.  CNET Editor Brian Tong gave CBS News a roundup of some of the rumors of what to expect from the iPhone 7 when it likely debuts next month. A familiar look One thing that won’t really change is the phone’s look. Just by looking at many of the leaked images that have hit the Web, Apple​ watchers have noticed that not a lot will visually change with latest phone.  The phone is said to come in a “space black color” and will have a new home button, among other little tweaks. For those constantly on their apps, the phone will reportedly possess much better battery life than its predecessors. The iPhone 7 will pretty much look “almost identical to the current iPhone 6s,” Tong said. Headphones controversy While iPhone​ users can always expect tweaks in the design of the iPhone with each update, one rumored change has been causing quite an uproar. Apparently, the new phone will not include a headphone jack, which will force music-loving users to either use wireless bluetooth headphones or buy a separate adapter.  Users who have invested in high-end headphones​ to better listen to music or podcasts might not be happy.  “People that ... want to hear a fuller sound are paying at least $150 or $300 for headphones that will now require an adapter,” Tong added. “And let’s be honest, a lot of us are going to lose that little mini adapter, that’s just the way it is.” A better camera While music enthusiasts might be bummed out by the reports of the latest iPhone design​, those who like to post their photos to Instagram are in luck. The latest phone is said to boast a pretty impressive camera.  The phone will reportedly have an “improved, dual lense camera,” Tong said. The camera will have better color image quality, will possess a better zoom function to make photos even clearer, and will have the ability to take better low-light images. The downside? The new camera will only be available on the larger, deluxe version of the iPhone 7. Is it worth it? It’s the question that always comes up when a new phone is released -- is it worth the upgrade? Tong suggested that the safest bet might be to just hold on to their old iPhone 6s and 6s Plus phones until the company’s next big reveal.  “Everyone is really looking forward to the 2017 iPhone -- this is the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. Apple​ is expected to do a lot with the design,” he said.  That being said, if you enjoy buying the latest gadgets and for the photographer who wants to take those extra-special pics, it might be worth making this 2016 upgrade.  © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

In addition to an original TV show starring Dr. Dre, Apple has already committed to releasing a Taylor Swift tour documentary, a reality show that focuses on developers creating apps, and most recently, the rights to a spinoff of the popular Carpool Karaoke segment from the Late Late Show with James Corden. The latest addition to Apple's already varied stable of media content will be a documentary of some sort that will be shot in cooperation with Cash Money Records. According to Bloomberg, Apple will reportedly be funding the project that will become an Apple Music exclusive upon completion. While the focus of the documentary hasn't yet been confirmed, Music Business Worldwide notes that the program will primarily focus on "Cash Money and Birdman." DON'T MISS: iPhone 7: Our biggest question was just answered Now for those unfamiliar, Cash Money over the years has served as the recording home to some of the biggest names in Hip-Hop, including Lil Wayne, Drake, Flo Rida, Nicki Minaj and Ace Hood. And even though Cash Money's roster is always evolving (Lil Wayne is no longer there), one has to marvel at the fact that Cash Money has remained a relevant record label for nearly two decades now. Bloomberg adds: Co-founder Bryan Williams, who performs under the stage name Birdman, posted a picture to his Instagram account on Tuesday alongside Larry Jackson, the head of Apple's original music content, with both executives holding their chins pensively. The photo celebrated Apple agreeing to fund a documentary for the label, according to people familiar with the deal. It is not, as many had speculated after the photo, an agreement to secure all of Cash Money's new albums exclusively, the people said. The Instagram photo in question can be viewed below. https://www.instagram.com/p/BJL2cRnAN5_/?taken-by=birdman5star We can only hope that the folks at Apple working on the project show Birdman the respect he deserves. As an aside, it's becoming increasingly clear that Apple's plans to develop original, at least for now, will primarily be musically oriented. In other words, it remains to be seen if Apple has any intention of rolling out an original series a'la Netflix. While some have suggested that Apple should buy Netflix outright, we've previously highlighted how it would be much more affordable for Apple to produce its own content than to buy Netflix, which currently has a market cap of $41 billion. To wit, Apple could produce 7 top-notch shows for less than $500 million, as evidenced by the cost to produce one season each of the following hit shows: Game of Thrones – $60 million Breaking Bad – $39 million House of Cards & Orange is the new Black – $100 million Homeland – $36 million Netflix version of Arrested Development – $45 million LOST- $100 million over the course of a 25 episode season Boardwalk Empire – $60 million Trending right now: iPhone 7: Our biggest question was just answered I just got Netflix’s price hike email, and I did the only reasonable thing to do The 7 best features on Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 (none of which are on the iPhone) See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next A laser pointer from the stands helped the Oakland Raiders beat the Texans BGR News iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech Donald Trump’s advisors are lying to him Quartz T-Mobile has some of the best Black Friday deals we’ve seen BGR News Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo News Network

August 17, 2016, 09:30:00 AM EDT By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo For Immediate Release Chicago, IL - August 17, 2016 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Ford Motor Company ( F ), Baidu ( BIDU ), Alphabet Inc ( GOOGL ), Tesla ( TSLA ), Fiat Chrysler ( FCAU ) and Apple ( AAPL ). Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free . Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog: Your Ultimate Guide to the Self-Driving Car Market The ever-developing autonomous car industry was in for a major shakeup Tuesday as Ford Motor Company ( F ) announced that, alongside Chinese search engine Baidu ( BIDU ), it will be investing a combined $150 million in Velodyne Lidar Inc., a maker of light sensor technology. Lidar will use the new cash to improve its sensors, which bounce light off objects to determine location and shape. In addition to its stake in Lidar, Ford is doubling the size of its Silicon Valley lab in an effort to expedite the development of its self-driving cars. Ford's latest move in the autonomous vehicle market comes as a reminder that both automakers and tech companies are rapidly developing this new technology, and consumer-level options will be available to the public sooner than some might think. Today we'll take a look at the current state of the industry to determine when drivers can expect to be taking their hands off the wheel and what brands will be leading the way when they do. Defining Key Terms Before we really dive in to the companies involved in this technology, we need to get on the same page about what it is that we are talking about here. Technically speaking, "self-driving" and "autonomous" mean different things and can cause some confusion when talking about the development of these cars. A good place to start is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) system of defining automated vehicles . The NHTSA has a 5-tier system that categorizes vehicles from Level 0 (No-Automation) to Level 4 (Full Self-Driving Automation). Typically when we talk about "self-driving" cars, we're talking about Level 3 vehicles. In fact, the NHTSA cites Alphabet Inc's ( GOOGL ) automated car program as an example of a Level 3 vehicle. Tesla's ( TSLA ) Autopilot falls somewhere in between Level 2 and 3. The word "autonomous" is used to describe cars that can control absolutely every condition during the entire duration of the trip. These cars start the journey, navigate, execute turns, and park-all without any intervention from the driver. Self-driving cars are nearly available for widespread public purchase, while fully autonomous vehicles will still take some time to develop and release. Leading Companies As I mentioned before, Alphabet and Tesla are both working on self-driving technology and promise to be leaders in the market. In some capacity, Alphabet/Google has been working on its self-driving car for many years, and its fleet of data-collecting vehicles have racked up millions of miles already. In May, Alphabet announced a partnership with Fiat Chrysler ( FCAU ) to develop 100 Chrysler Pacifica minivans to be used as test vehicles. On the other hand, Tesla actually has a self-driving product available right now. In October of 2015, Tesla released a software update that enabled its Autopilot feature, which basically functions as a "hands-off" version of cruise control. With Autopilot on , Tesla vehicles can change lanes, brake, and detect other objects without help from the driver. Tesla also made automation one of the primary focuses of its new "Master Plan." Elon Musk and the company hope to use Tesla's technology in buses and will continue to develop the Autopilot feature, which they claim will eventually be 10 times safer than regular driving (also read: Tesla Unveils Second Master Plan ). Throughout both the automotive and technology industries, nearly every major company seems to have some sort of self-driving vehicle research and development underway. Tech behemoth Apple ( AAPL ) is also working on its own autonomous car project. We don't know much about Apple's plans, but we do know that the company greenlighted a 1,000 person team, led by former Ford engineer Steve Zadesky, to work on a top-secret car project. Apple is keeping the details of its car closely guarded, but we do know that it's called " Project Titan " and could be modeled around a minivan. Bottom Line With all of these companies making major investments in self-driving car technology, the actual products are not that far out. People are already using software that enables them to take their hands off the wheel while going full-speed on the highway, and it won't be long until every step of the trip is handled by the vehicle itself. The only major roadblock right now is regulatory approval. Entities like the NHTSA and other federal agencies are in the process of figuring out what to do with self-driving cars from a legal standpoint, but the government has been mostly supportive of the technology to this point. If I was a betting man, I'd guess that the major automakers will have their own lines of self-driving cars out by 2018, with automated driving becoming a standard feature of new cars by 2020.

Yesterday, speculative rumors claimed Birdman signed his label to an exclusive partnership with the tech titan, one that would involve Lil Wayne and Nicki Minaj (who have ties to rival TIDAL), and Drake (who has his own exclusive deal with Apple). However, that has turned out to be untrue. Instead, multiple reports now say that Apple has agreed to fund a documentary about one of the world’s most successful hip-hop labels. http://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/apple-music-signs-game-changing-label-deal-cash-money-records/ @thelarryjackson @applemusic #Biggathenlife #lifestyle A photo posted by Birdman5star (@birdman5star) on Aug 16, 2016 at 2:46pm PDT Earlier this year, Birdman revealed that a script was in the works for a Cash Money biopic, inspired by last year’s N.W.A blockbuster Straight Outta Compton. “I think that Dr. Dre and Ice Cube…I think they are geniuses for what they have done and accomplished,” he said. “For them to do that and to make it trend-setting, they opened doors for us. And I just think that what we have is way more special, because we’re in modern times.” Apple Music has long been in the fight to secure more video content and rappers have been a part of that battle. Dr. Dre, for instance, is reportedly filming a mini-series titled “Vital Signs” as part of that initiative and will.i.am will act as a judge on the platform’s “Planet of the Apps” game show, along with Gwyneth Paltrow and Gary Vaynerchuk. Other video content has also been secured recently. In addition to all of the above, James Corden’s “Late Late Show” segment “Carpool Karaoke” will also have a spinoff through Apple.

Yahoo Finance reports that Target management cites a 20% year-over-year decline in Apple product sales during the quarter for overall electronics sales dropping. Comparable store sales at Target overall fell by 1.1%, but Target executives noted that electronic sales decreased by double digits and “accounted for 70 basis points [0.7%] of overall comp decline.” Even more notably, Target specifically pointed out that Apple product sales were down by “more than 20%” year-over-year and were to blame for a third of the overall plunge of electronic sales at Target. It’s not very surprising to learn that Apple product sales at Target have declined year-over-year in the last quarter. Apple’s own earnings results for the same quarter had a weak year-over-year compare for revenue and iPhone sales. Interesting in Yahoo Finance’s report is this line: “Target noted that it was working with Apple to try to improve sales.” Yahoo Finance suggests Apple could be focused on driving sales through its own channels where profit margin is higher. Target carries iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, Apple TVs, Beats and accessories both in-store and online, but not Macs. The retailer was also among the launch partners for Apple Pay when it debuted in October 2014, but only through its app. Target has said in the past that it’s open to accepting Apple Pay in its stores in the future while reports have also said the retailer is working on its own mobile wallet.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Hayley Tsukayama August 17 Follow @htsuka An person demonstrates the new Apple Pencil with the iPad Pro tablet computer in San Francisco on Sept. 9, 2015. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News) Apple, it seems, would like to see more tablets in briefcases next year. A new report from MacRumors cites noted Apple analyst Ming Chi-Kuo, who says there will be three new iPad models in 2017 — including a brand-new iPad Pro. The iPad Pro is an interesting device, introduced last year as something more than a tablet, though a bit less than a laptop. What do you call such a thing? Apple's currently making the case that the iPad Pro, which supports a keyboard and a stylus, is a “computer.” There’s a good reason to sell the iPad Pro as a “computer” rather than a tablet. Tablet sales have been slowing. And while computers are also in a sales slump, there is growth in the “detachables” category — devices that blend the tablet and the traditional laptop and have, well, a detachable keyboard. Casting the iPad Pro this way is important to Apple to catch the eye of businesses and business people, who may want something light but still functional for work. It is a bit of a departure from Apple’s past. Steve Jobs, Apple’s co-founder, famously disliked courting businesses. Per ZDNet, in 2010, Jobs told then-Wall Street Journal writers Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher: “What I love about the consumer market, that I always hated about the enterprise market, is that we come up with a product, we try to tell everybody about it, and every person votes for themselves. They go ‘yes’ or ‘no,’ and if enough of them say ‘yes,’ we get to come to work tomorrow. That’s how it works. It’s really simple. With the enterprise market, it’s not so simple. The people that use the products don't decide for themselves, and the people that make those decisions sometimes are confused.” Given that Jobs thought of Apple’s products as a counter to the computing grip that IBM and Microsoft had on offices, his disdain for the enterprise sector makes sense. But the business market has changed in ways that blunt Jobs’s old criticisms. He didn’t like that enterprise devices weren’t personal; that’s no longer the case in a BYOD world. Even when there’s a set list of devices approved by a workplace, it almost always includes an iPhone, an iPad or at least some iOS-friendly apps. And businesses are a great market for the tablet and the “post-PC” vision that Jobs envisioned with the introduction of the iPad. With a more mobile workforce, the iPad and the iPad Pro — along with the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 and other 2-in-1 devices — make a lot of sense for moving from hotel room to living room to board room. It must also be said that the enterprise market isn't the only that's changed since Jobs vocally dismissed the sector. Apple has, too. Chief executive Tim Cook has made enterprise a key focus for Apple. And while some consumer enthusiasm for Apple's products has ebbed — Target reported its Apple sales were down 20 percent across the board this quarter — businesses are still buying enough to make Apple’s enterprise play a $25 billion business. In his recent interview with The Washington Post’s Jena McGregor, Cook specifically highlighted Apple’s enterprise market saying: We’re collaborating much better with key partners because it’s important, if you’re making a decision to use our products or anybody’s products in the enterprise, that they work well together. And so we’re working with Cisco because they’re incredible with the network infrastructure. We’re working with IBM, who’s written a number of apps. We’re working with SAP because they own the back of the house, in terms of the processing. They own three-quarters of the world’s transactions, in terms of it running on their products. This is an area, of course, that could fire up old rivalries — in fact, Microsoft has already released a commercial calling Apple’s “computer” claim into question and comparing the iPad Pro unfavorably to its own Surface Pro 4. The commercial raises some good points. The iPad Pro is still functionally a mobile device and lacks features such as multiple ports that traditional “computers” (and, of course the Surface Pro 4) do have. Then again, Apple has a line of laptops that only have one port, so there’s really no hard and fast definition of “computer” — and Apple’s clearly working hard to stretch the definition enough to fit the iPad Pro under the umbrella. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

Slate Sign In Sign Up Smartphone Maker Xiaomi, the “Apple of China,” Is Struggling Smartphone Maker Xiaomi, the “Apple of China,” Is Struggling Slate Sign In Sign Up Slate Business Insider Analyzing the top news stories across the web Aug. 17 2016 2:04 PM Smartphone Maker Xiaomi, the “Apple of China,” Is Struggling By Rob Price   Those phones might just not be enough. Photo by WANG ZHAO/AFP/Getty Images This post originally appeared on Business Insider. The “Apple of China” is in serious trouble. Advertisement Sales in China of smartphones from Xiaomi, a once red-hot Chinese hardware startup touted as the country’s answer to Apple, fell by a whopping 38 percent in the second quarter of 2016 year-on-year, according to new data from the research firm IDC. Xiaomi did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Xiaomi’s phones are not yet available in Western markets, but the company has developed a buzzy reputation in the tech press. The company launched in 2010, and it enjoyed meteoric growth: By the end of 2014 it was the world’s most valuable technology startup, with a private valuation of more than $46 billion. (It has since been dethroned of that title by Uber.) Advertisement Specialising in cheap, high-quality smartphones, it had grown off the back of an unusually passionate fan base, which it was careful to cultivate. It liberally borrowed from Apple’s playbook, including charismatic CEO keynote speeches. There is also a booming market in China for smartphones. The company set an ambitious target for 2015: Sell 100 million smartphones. But by July, as sales began to slow, it started to become clear that it just wouldn’t happen. It ultimately sold “over 70 million,” according to a company representative. Earlier this year, Fortune reported that Xiaomi’s revenue’s barely grew in 2015. It pulled in 78 billion yuan, or $11.9 billion, for the year, up 5 percent on 74.3 billion yuan ($11.3 billion) in 2014 but well short of its 100-billion-yuan target for the year. Advertisement The latest figures from IDC now suggest that Xiaomi isn’t just standing still: It’s actually in free fall. Xiaomi sold an estimated 10.5 million smartphones in China in the second quarter of this year, down from 17.1 million a year prior. That’s a drop of 38.4 percent. At the same time, its rivals Oppo and Vivo have skyrocketed, enjoying year-on-year growth rates of 124.1 percent and 74.7 percent. (Also interesting: Apple is struggling in China as well, with shipments down 31.7 percent year-on-year—selling 8.6 million devices last quarter, compared to 12.6 million in Q2 of 2015.) Advertisement It’s worth noting that Xiaomi sells other products—as varied as water purifiers and hoverboards. But smartphones still make up the lion’s share of the company’s bottom line, with just 5 percent of its revenues in 2015 coming from other products, according to Fortune. So what’s behind Xiaomi's implosion? A slowing in growth, at least, was inevitable. In previous years the company was perfectly positioned to take advantage of the rapid growth in China’s smartphone market. This has now dropped off, though the Chinese market is still growing, 4.6 percent year-on-year in Q2. IDC points to a failure of marketing as the cause. Xiaomi previously spent very little on marketing and was proud of it, relying on word of mouth and user hype to spread word of its products. But this tactic is no longer viable as Vivo and Oppo are spending heavily, including using “brand ambassadors” to promote their smartphones. Without any concrete ways to differentiate its products, Xiaomi has been forced to follow suit. Advertisement “In the past, Xiaomi started the trend of selling its phones online and other vendors soon followed suit and created their own online brand. After vendors witnessed OPPO’s success with its R9, they also started riding on the trend of hiring celebrity endorsers to represent their brand and appeal more to the young crowd,” IDC analyst Xiaohan Tay said. “Hiring celebrity endorsers may help increase numbers in the short term, but this alone may not be sufficient to drive numbers in the long run. As there is very little differentiation across products to warrant significant brand loyalty, vendors must constantly think out of the box to get people hyped up about their products.” Xiaomi was once the head of the pack. Now it's playing catch-up—and losing.

With Mi Pay, Xiaomi is now ready to compete with the likes of Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay. Of course, the Mi Pay isn’t as widespread as the existing services. For now, it will only be available to customers in China, but considering that Xiaomi wants to expand into other markets with its phones, it wouldn’t be surprising to see Mi Pay also expand into other markets. Related: Xiaomi announces the Mi VR Play, a virtual reality headset for your smartphone A number of banks support Mi Pay at launch, including the Bank of Communications, China Construction Bank, China Merchants Bank, Minsheng Bank, Huaxia Bank, Industrial Bank, and Ping An Bank. Mi Pay works pretty much the same as the rest of the mobile payment apps out there. It basically uses the phone’s NFC chip to communicate with payment terminals, and while not too many Xiaomi phones currently have an NFC chip, it’s expected that we’ll see more with the feature as time goes on. Currently the Xiaomi Mi 5 has the chip, and we’ll likely see the upcoming Mi Note 2 include the chip too. It’s certainly an interesting move for the company, and we will have to wait and see if the new service is able to dominate in China against other options currently available. Apple Pay, for example, launched in China earlier this year, with a whopping 3 million cards being added to the service in only two days. Still, Xiaomi has significant reach in China, and could certainly make a dent in the Chinese mobile payments market.

With Apple rumored to remove the jack with the iPhone 7 and devices like the Moto Z already having ditched the port altogether, consumers are justifiably concerned about a standards war they didn't ask for. As it stands, USB-C is only used in a select few phones and laptops like the aforementioned Moto phone and the newer Apple MacBook. Intel, however, thinks the versatile new USB-C standard won't just make for a viable headphone jack replacement, but a superior one as well. At the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco yesterday, Intel architects Brad Saunders and Rahman Ismail explained how improvements to the USB-C standard, slated to arrive later this year, could make it a far better port for the modern-day smartphone, according to CNET. The most obvious advantage, at least to devices manufacturers, is slimmer phones. Without needing to route analog circuitry, a phone maker could switch to digital audio and shave off precious millimeters from the device's body. With digital audio, Saunders added, software and device makers could help cheaper earbuds take advantage of features reserved for more expensive headphones, like noise cancelling and bass boosting. Intel has been one of the biggest proponents of USB-C technology Beyond the need for cumbersome adapters, one of the biggest concerns with the loss of the headphone jack is power use. USB controllers are inherently more power-hungry than a 3.5mm port, and if there's anything that will push consumers to resist change, it's detrimental effects to battery life. Saunders says he and Ismail's revised specifications for USB-C could allow it to detect when users are not using the microphone on headphones and turn it off to save battery. "The difference in battery life is negligible" with USB headphones, Saunders suggested. There's also some video potential with USB-C, the duo explained. While not a viable HDMI replacement, USB-C is capable of high-throughput data transfers. That means you could hook a smartphone or computer up to a display through USB-C to run apps or watch movies. It may not be viable for gaming, but it's certainly a way to work around extra cable needs. Plus, USB-C can handle multiple connections at once, so you'd be able to use a USB hub to transmit video or mirror a display from a single port while at the same time charging the device and connecting a separate cable for peripherals. These changes collectively "will really make USB Type-C the right connector for audio," Saunders concluded. This isn't Intel's first vocal push for USB-C. Back in April, the company detailed a proposal to remove the 3.5mm audio jack at its Shenzhen developer forum. The proposal laid out how the port is antiquated when considering the multi-purpose needs of modern phone users. It's not just video or audio improvements — USB-C opens up the possibility for all sorts of health tracking and other fitness-related functions that can be controlled from a single port. And last year at Computex, Intel became the most high-profile industry name to throw its weight behind USB-C, declaring that its Thunderbolt 3 interface would use the new standard instead of the existing Mini DisplayPort.

Photo: Target Declining sales of Apple products is one of the factors Target has blamed for its disappointing second-quarter earnings. During a conference call today, Target CEO Brian Cornell noted that Apple products fell 20 percent in sales at his company’s stores, resulting in a double-digit percentage sales decline in the retailer’s electronics division. Cornell added that Target is reportedly working with Apple to improve performance, although there was no elaboration on exactly what was meant by this. Conceivably it could mean pushing Apple for exclusive products, which could help drive sales. The fall in Apple business isn’t the only factor that was pointed out during the conference call (sales of grocery items and Target’s new CVS pharmacies inside stores were also discussed), but it’s interesting to hear — particularly since Target has been so bullish about Apple’s products in the past. Early in the Apple Watch’s life cycle, for instance, many people fretted about demand for the item — only for Target to strongly come out in favor of it as “one of the season’s hottest gift items.” Apple has also provided Target with some impressive sales figures around Black Friday in the past. According to one report, the retail giant sold one iPad every second on Thanksgiving Day. When was the last time you bought an Apple product from Target? Leave your comments below.

The Apple Store is 1.3 miles and I can just walk there. Simple. There is also that Apple is still pricey for many consumers. Andy Target sales are declining because the quality and diversity of their selection has gone way down. In the last year there has been numerous times I had to leave Target and go to (ewwwww) Walmart simply because Target didn’t have what I was looking for. stark.barbara I currently earn around 6.000-8.000 dollars a month from freelancing online. If you are ready to complete basic freelance jobs for 2h-5h /a day from your living room and get valuable income for doing it… This is a work for you… FAVE.CO/1Pj8UFH Michael Long Target’s sales are down not because of Apple, but because Target is continually screwing with their customers. For one thing, they keep dropping SKUs. At least once or twice a month I find that they’ve stopped carrying an item or brand I used to buy there, and it’s getting to the point that their selection sucks. In fact, in many areas of the store they’ve even started spacing items further apart in order to hide the fact that they’re carrying less. Are they foolish enough to think their customers don’t notice these things? Also, I’m pretty damn tired of the way they’re continually moving items and even entire sections around in order to make their customers go searching elsewhere for them. Bringing CVS into their stores sucks too. And speaking of Apple products, I tried doing an iPhone pre-order there once…. only to get a call the following FEBRUARY that the device had finally arrived and did I still want it? Hy-Vee may cost just a bit more, but they don’t mess with me the way Target does, and as such Hy-Vee and Costco are getting more and more of my dollars, and all despite the fact I lack practically five houses away from a SuperTarget.

Tallest Skil Roast in hell, kiddo. Trannies are mentally defective and will get their due. DrMuggg And you Sir, are an idiot. Tallest Skil Not an argument, kiddo. Trannies remain mentally defective. DrMuggg And so are you Tallest Skil Great argument, kid. Trannies are mentally ill and nothing you say can ever disprove fact. Tallest Skil If gender is a social construct, then there is no such thing as a “gender binary”. If this is true, how can one “transition” between “genders” or be “genderfluid?” If gender is a social construct and stereotypical gender binary “gender identities” and the gender roles stereotypically assigned thereto are entirely made up by an oppressive society for its own uses, why would “transgenders” want to take on, themselves, made up roles assigned to the nonexistent “gender” to which they are transitioning, and thus reenforce the system’s fake stereotypes of gender roles in the gender binary? By this “logic”, a man can act like a man but claim that he is a woman and feel no need in “transitioning”, and everyone must accept it. Thus is proven the transsexual mental illness. DrMuggg Wow, this must be something that’s on your mind constantly. I simply say, gender is in your brain, and sometimes the body and the brain doesn’t match. Then you have to fix the body. Stop the hating you moron. Tallest Skil You’re mentally defective and need psychiatric help immediately. You have no refutation to anything that was posted and no comprehension of the content. Eat shit. I have the right to hate. I hate things that are false. You believe falsehoods. BJ If you go into any Target store, they have 3 or 4 Samsung displays and one tiny Apple display. Target does not mention they cut a deal with Samsung. Remember Apple owns Beats now, so since Target pushes Samsung products, and has limited Apple products. Why would you buy any Apple product from them. 4 Samsung displays, one tiny Apple display, that answers Targets question. BB-8 ME Target doesn’t even use ApplePay, or Any NFC payments for that matter. Get with the times Target. As for buying Apple products, I only buy from Apple. Returns, Genius Bar, in stock items, cute chubby bearded dudes, etc.. I can go on about the benefits of going to an Apple Store. THEPKSAY Cute chubby beaded dudes LOL digitaldumdum “Target blames Apple for its own decline in sales” Attention Target shoppers: Our sales have been falling since the horrible data breach we subjected millions of you to, which could have been avoided if we’d hadn’t been so busy counting our cash. And since our management is so preoccupied with reorganizing the inside of our stores for no reason—at great cost—we have even less in the bank to pour over. Therefore, we’re looking hard for someone, •anyone• to blame. Oh look, there’s a good scapegoat right over there on aisle nine… the Apple products. Thank you Target shoppers, and now you may get back to buying your usual products… if you can find them. THEPKSAY Yeah how about this. I don’t think my thought process has ever been, Hmmmm I need to buy an iPad, better go to Target. Tallest Skil Or maybe, just maybe, your corporate support for the mental illness that is transsexualism had something to do with it. Posted again because cowards gonna cower. macpurc Another post. You really do seem to have a connection to the subject of transexuals… interesting.

This comes as Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway upped its stake in Apple by 55 percent as of June 30,” Ungarino reports. “And one trader says some upside, perhaps over 14 percent, could be in store.” “”‘Below 100 bucks, you buy this stock, and I think you can trade it up, and you can trade it in a range of $100 to $125,’ said David Seaburg, head of equity sales trading at Cowen & Co. ‘I really believe it’s a buy,'” Ungarino reports. “The high end of that range would be about 14.3 percent higher than Tuesday’s closing price of $109.38.” Read more in the full article here.

 TARGET: People aren't buying Apple products Akin Oyedele Aug. 17, 2016, 1:23 PM 20,611 facebook linkedin twitter email print Jim Young/Reuters Target struggled to sell electronics in the second quarter, especially Apple products. The retailer on Wednesday reported earnings that were stronger than expected. But it lowered its outlook for the rest of the year as it plans for a "challenging environment," according to CEO Brian Cornell. There was "meaningful pressure in electronics" during the second quarter, and a decline erased 70 basis points from overall sales at stores open for at least one year, he said. "Notably, about a third of this pressure was driven by Apple products which were down more than 20% in the quarter," Cornell said. He added that the weakness was not confined to one particular Apple product, and the company is working with Apple and vendor partners to grow sales. But iPhone sales have taken an unusual turn lower everywhere. Earlier this year, Apple acknowledged that iPhone sales fell for the first time in the device's nine-year history. The company is expected to announce a new iPhone in September. According to reports and leaks, it will look very similar to the iPhone 6S. The notable changes will likely be an upgraded camera and the removal of the headphone jack. A more drastic redesign is expected in 2017, a decade after the iPhone first launched. Meanwhile, people may not find convincing reasons to upgrade in the fall. But Target is hoping that the new phones, an overhauled MacBook Pro, and other products will also lift sales. "Our guests come to us looking for those products," Cornell said. "They're looking for the newness and the innovation, and we're putting together plans with Apple and our merchandising teams to make sure we're ready to take advantage of that in the back half of the year."

Related iPhone 7 release date and pre-order date leaked iPhone 7 to be unveiled Sept. 7 ahead of Sept. 16 release date iPhone 7 preview: Everything Apple will announce next week Video 5 Weirdest iOS Keyboards Apple's highly anticipated iPhone 7 may be coming to stores a little bit later than initially anticipated. If you recall, reputed leaker Evan Blass published a tweet last month indicating Apple's next-gen iPhone was slated to hit store shelves on Friday, Sept. 16. This rumor was seemingly bolstered when Bloomberg indicated that Apple was planning a special media event for Wednesday, Sept. 7. But now comes word via 9to5Mac that Apple's iPhone 7 might arrive a bit later in the month. According to a leaked memo purporting to come from an official AT&T retail document, AT&T has two days pinned down for special merchandising resets: Sept. 9 and Sept. 23. While certainly not conclusive and admittedly speculative, this tends to suggest that pre-orders for the iPhone 7 may in fact begin on Sept. 9, with shipments finally arriving two weeks later on Sept. 23. While a two-week lag time between pre-orders and a new iPhone hitting store shelves may seem a bit long, recall that the window between the iPhone 6s opening up for pre-order and going on sale was 13 days. That being the case, a 14-day stretch isn't unheard of. As to why Apple would release the iPhone 7 so late into September is anybody's guess. Indeed, given how iPhone sales have experienced a bit of a lull over the past few months, one would assume Apple would want to get the device out and in as many hands as soon as possible. Release date speculation aside, the iPhone 7 is said to feature a similar design to what we've seen with Apple's iPhone 6 and 6s models. Some notable tweaks we can expect to see on Apple's next-gen iPhone is the complete removal of the traditional 3.5mm headphone jack and a stationary home button that vibrates when pressed, thereby providing the illusion that the home button is mechanical. With Sept. 7 fast approaching, we can expect an influx of more iPhone 7 leaks in the weeks, if not days, ahead.

Follow TechnoBuffalo We’re expecting Apple to introduce several upgrades to the iPhone 7, including faster guts, a larger battery and improved camera optics. But it might be increased internal storage that consumers appreciate most. Anything is better than 16GB. More evidence Apple will offer an iPhone 7 with 256GB of storage has popped up, via DigiTimes, corroborating a number of reports that came out earlier this year. The latest report claims prices for storage has increased following strong demand from vendors. Here’s what they said: NAND flash vendors have increased chip prices citing strong demand for new smartphones particularly the iPhone 7 featuring up to 256GB of storage, according to industry sources. In March, Apple introduced a 9.7-inch iPad Pro with 256GB of storage, and at the time we speculated the iPhone 7 could be the next mobile device to receive the upgrade. As a bonus, in addition to offering a larger storage option, another report from earlier this year claimed Apple would be dropping its infamous 16GB tier in favor of a standard 32GB model. The only thing that remains unclear is whether or not the 256GB option will be exclusive to the iPhone 7 Plus. Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 7 at an event on September 7—about three weeks from now—so we’ll know more soon.

Andrew Cunningham Emoji in iOS 10. Andrew Cunningham Emoji in Android 7. Andrew Cunningham Emoji in the Windows 10 Anniversary update. Emoji have become important. They’ve permeated our conversations and our messaging apps and our popular culture to a degree that no one could have anticipated just a few years ago, and when your phone or computer gets an update, new emoji are often featured prominently in the release notes or even announced in their own press releases. That the “language” is so universal and recognizable is due in large part to the Unicode Consortium, the group of major tech companies in charge of defining and approving new emoji (and dozens of other character sets, besides). Every year, it proposes, discusses, and approves new additions to the language, and that heavyweights like Apple, Google, and Microsoft have become so diligent about supporting new versions is a rare victory for standards in an age where every tech company on Earth is trying to lock you into its own proprietary silo. But the Unicode Consortium can only do so much to influence the way any given emoji looks and is interpreted. Every new version of the Unicode spec includes a description of each character, a sample image, and other broad recommendations for implementation, but companies implementing the spec are free to represent the emoji pretty much however they want. And as the language’s range of expression continues to grow, so do the opportunities for misunderstanding. “Zero-width joiners” and compound emoji The Unicode Consortium has been working hard over the last couple of releases to fix the language’s representation problem—multiple skin tones were proposed in 2014 and began to see widespread use in 2015, and this year’s update ensures that both male and female images exist for all the emoji occupations. And before we continue, let’s pause to acknowledge that representation is important, and it’s great that the Unicode Consortium is prioritizing it, full stop. Traditionally, every emoji character has had an alphanumerical code associated with it, and creating a new emoji meant coming up with a new code to associate with it. For skin tone and gender, the Unicode Consortium has come up with more creative solutions, choosing instead to combine multiple codes together to create a single emoji. The gender-diverse emoji for occupations, for example, combine a standard “man” or “woman” emoji with a second emoji to represent the occupation, and they’re glued together by a special invisible character called a “Zero-width joiner” (ZWJ). Platforms that support the new emoji for occupations, including both the upcoming iOS 10 and Android Nougat releases, see the ZWJ and know to display a single emoji rather than two separate ones. It’s a smart way to continue expanding the number of available emoji while keeping the number of unique codes under control, and different sequences can be used to create emoji that are much more representative and specific than they were a couple of years ago. For example, ZWJ sequences are why the “kissing” and “love” and “family” emoji now have so many possible combinations. In Unicode 6.0, there was one emoji for family; now there are many more. The Unicode Consortium tracks common ZWJ sequences (any “that are supported on at least one commonly available platform”) so that companies building software can easily support them, but here’s where we start running into potential problems. Since emoji cobbled together with ZWJ characters don’t need to be approved by the Unicode Consortium like an all-new emoji character does, it means that companies can build their own unique emoji without waiting for the Unicode Consortium to approve them. And since these ZWJ emoji will simply show up as two or more separate emoji on platforms that don’t support them, adding new ones doesn’t technically break anything or result in an ugly question mark block. This can make developing new emoji faster; without a months- or years-long approval process, Apple or Google could go ahead and add flags or fix representation problems quickly without breaking compatibility with other platforms. On the other hand, it can make it more difficult to communicate between platforms based on which ZWJ sequences are supported and which aren’t. “If this is taken to extremes, it could result in entire sets of incompatible emojis that are indecipherable on other platforms,” Jeremy Burge, founder of Emojipedia, told Ars. “That would be a problem.” We’re already starting to see some fragmentation as platforms add their own specific ZWJ emoji, characters that the enthusiasts at Emojipedia can keep on top of but that the official Unicode list can’t. Twitter has a pirate flag, the Windows 10 Anniversary Update adds a bunch of “ninja cat” emoji as an in-joke for Windows Insiders, and WhatsApp just added an Olympic Rings emoji that shows up as five plain circles on any other platform. Sometimes the broken-down sequences have a relatively clear meaning (the pirate flag), but often the intended meaning is vague (Olympic rings, Ninja Cat). And software makers are being left to police themselves when it comes to creating these emoji and implementing emoji created by others. “I can see a real dilemma for vendors if ZWJ proliferate in unexpected ways,” Burge told Ars. “In particular, sequences such as the Olympic Rings emoji introduced by WhatsApp don’t follow conventions that other vendors use (it’s made of non-emoji characters), and to top it off it’s a copyrighted image which no other platform could introduce!” I would expect Apple, Google, and the rest to be relatively conservative about introducing their own platform-specific emoji even with ZWJ characters, but going forward they could introduce more potential for confusion when communicating across different platforms or services. This is what Unicode was created to avoid, but there have always been inconsistencies even without ZWJ characters. Apple vs. the world Enlarge / One of these things is not like the others. Emojipedia The Unicode Consortium provides names and sample images for all emoji, but, as that page and any Emojipedia article can show you, the pictures you’ll see on actual phones and computers all look slightly different. Different OS and app developers want the emoji to match the rest of their software’s aesthetic rather than using one universal character set. Typically, this isn’t a problem. A smiling or frowning face will look different on iOS and Android, but they both convey the same information. At worst, a handful of characters are mildly ambiguous or just a little weird—the “grinning face with smiling eyes” emoji looks more like a grimace on Apple devices. Samsung devices render the cookie emoji as a pair of snack crackers rather than the usual chocolate chip-style. Android 4.4 inexplicably rendered the yellow heart emoji as a hairy heart instead. But every once in a while the difference is big enough that it could cause problems—case in point, the iOS 10 pistol emoji, which will look like a bright green squirt gun rather than a handgun. All other current platforms render it as a handgun, and the Windows 10 Anniversary update even changed the icon into a handgun rather than the '50s-style sci-fi ray gun that Windows used previously. Apple similarly lobbied (successfully) to have a new rifle emoji removed from Unicode 9.0. Regardless of your position on gun control and whether you think these changes will move the needle at all (for my part I think the changes are well-intentioned but not likely to make much of a difference), making an emoji weapon look so different from the Unicode sample and every other platform creates a real potential for serious misunderstanding. It’s particularly problematic when Apple goes its own way because the company is often seen as the “default” for emoji designs—when you see emoji in the real world, they usually look like Apple’s. Apple didn’t invent emoji by any stretch of the imagination, but by including an easily accessible emoji keyboard in iOS 5, by enabling that keyboard by default in iOS 8, and by adopting new emoji in iOS 9.1 and iOS 10, the company has been instrumental in introducing the character set to new users and helping it spread. Ideally, all parties using Unicode would do their best to stick to the established examples laid out by the Consortium; doing otherwise introduces too much potential for miscommunication. In practice, the major companies using Unicode are mostly maintaining similar character sets by self-policing, looking around at each other and tweaking their emoji to be more in line with what others are doing (often, this means changing them to look more like Apple’s). “The varied appearance of emoji on different platforms I see as a lesser issue in 2016 than it has been in the past,” Burge told Ars, “and an issue that is slowly resolving itself as platforms look to one another for cues on consistency.” In cases like the pistol emoji, it would ultimately be better for Apple to voice its concerns to the Unicode Consortium rather than going off and doing its own thing. But given past behavior, the ecosystem may shift back to a more uniform representation of the pistol emoji by itself without the need for strict oversight or external pressure. As the language grows and becomes more expressive, the potential for misunderstanding and fragmentation increases, but hopefully the desire to maintain a consistent, universal, easy-to-understand character set will outweigh any particular company’s desire to make sweeping changes based on its whims. “I truly believe one of the reasons for the success of emoji has been the cross-platform nature,” Burge told Ars. “We have had graphical emoticons for years, but these tended to be for one app or platform only. The universal nature of emoji is a key part of what people enjoy. You can send an emoji and know the other person will see it, even if some platforms vary exactly how these look. “It’s in the interests of each platform to be responsive to users, so if enough people demand cross-platform emoji support to continue as it does today, vendors should take that into account,” he added.

The company also suggests that Apple is making the wrong move using Lightning for audio. Via CNET, Intel has announced it will be adding digital audio to the USB-C spec later this year. At the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco on Tuesday, Intel architects Brad Saunders and Rahman Ismail sketched out a coming USB audio standard that could help push the 3.5mm jack aside. The new specification, due this quarter, adds features to ensure a USB headphone doesn’t drain too much battery power and defines how buttons for pausing music or lowering volume work. The work “will really make USB Type-C the right connector for audio,” Saunders said. The company is also adding a new video standard to USB-C, to incorporate HDMI. However, this video standard will not provide the frame rate required to play games. More notably, Intel will be adding device authentication to improve security in the latest USB-C spec. While jumping on the USB-C bandwagon on the iPhone could resolve some issues, it’s unlikely that Apple will move away from Lightning. The iPhone maker has already gotten a ton of flack (and still does to this day), for moving from the 30-pin dock connector to Lightning.

Cash Money Records, which is the home of artists like Drake, Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne and Flo Rida, will be at the center of an Apple-funded documentary, according to the report. Speculations about the deal between Cash Money and Apple first emerged earlier this week, when the label’s co-founder Bryan “Birdman” Williams posted a photo on Instagram that showed him with Apple Music executive Larry Jackson. Some industry blogs initially speculated that the photo was in celebration of a deal that would give Apple an exclusive release window for the label’s music, but Bloomberg reported Wednesday that it was instead part of Apple’s video production efforts. Apple has  been ramping up the creation of original content in the past couple of months. The company is doing a show called “Planet of the Apps” that will star Gwyneth Paltrow alongside iOS app developers, and recently secured the rights for a TV show based on James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke segments. Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this week that his company would increase investments in content if it was advantageous to its business objectives, especially with regards to the prospects of Apple TV. “We do view that the future of TV is apps,” he told the Washington Post. “And if there’s a way we can be a catalyst into that happening faster or better, then that would interest us in content.” Filed Under: Apple Cash Money Records Drake Nicky Minaj Want to read more articles like this one?

So, in order to increase the percentage of the population turning out on the big day, the company is giving potential voters all of the information they need to actually make their vote count. Having already made it dead simple to register to vote, Google is now getting into the details. This means that anyone searching for “How to Vote” or something similar will be shown a state-specific guide to voting. This includes all of the various requirements and deadlines. I would much rather vote for Big Bird for president than either Trump or Clinton! — Jennifer Irons (@TeamBobbyEwing) August 7, 2016 Before you panic, Google isn’t telling anyone who to vote for, just informing them how to vote where they live. The ultimate aim being to make it “easier than ever for everyone to participate in the political process”. Which is probably more crucial in this election than any other.

Technology Is Bad For Your Sex Life Millenials are having less sex with less people and waiting longer before losing their virginity. And these trends are being blamed on technology Is Smarter Technology Dumbing Down the Human Race? Is Smarter Technology Dumbing Down the Human Race? As a child, you memorized your friend's phone numbers; now you just add them to your phone. You used to memorize directions; now you just use your GPS. Are humans becoming stupid? Read More . This is all according to recent research in the Archives of Sexual Behavior which saw researchers analyzing data on adult sexual habits from the General Social Survey. The research suggests that Millenials (people born in the 1980s or 1990s) are having their first sexual encounter at an older age, and then having fewer sexual partners than the previous two generations (Baby Boomers and Generation X). Which would seem to go against the notion that youngsters are constantly engaging in horizontal dancing. Most sexperts are blaming technology in one way or another. Some are claiming online dating is putting too much emphasis on looks, while others are claiming online pornography is replacing the need for physical relationships. Whatever the truth, Millenials are, as a group, having less sex than other generations did at their age. Which could lead to a fall in birthrates.

Bruns August 18, 2016 at 4:27 pm I have always felt that the problem with most ads that mock the competition is that they mention the competition. Reply Howard A Pearce @HAPLibertarian August 17, 2016 at 5:43 pm "The choice of candidates (Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton) and the contentious way the two campaigns have been fought thus far has had an effect on the country though. " So even though the least intelligent person knows that there are more than 2 candidates, MakeUseOF seems to want imply to its readers that th only "REAL and TRUE" choices are those from majority parties and not from minority parties. MUO probably wants people to think their vote is only valid when cast for someone considered winnable. Like almost all media, MUO treats minority parties as interesting side-notes but NEVER to be seriously considered ! Reply Dave Parrack August 17, 2016 at 9:48 pm There's no conspiracy theory here, Howard. I'm a Brit, so talking about the U.S. Election isn't exactly my forte. Nothing more, nothing less. BUT, having said that, it is a fact that only the two candidates I named can actually be President. You can vote for one of the others, but it won't impact the result. Just for you though, I have edited the article to make it clear these are Republican and Democratic candidates, and not the only names on the ballot. Happy now?! Reply Howard A Pearce @HAPLibertarian August 18, 2016 at 12:34 am Lol, you are the one who decided to post just the two major party candidates WHEN you didn't have to post any to make your point . Why did you do that ? Reply Howard A Pearce @HAPLibertarian August 18, 2016 at 12:37 am The fact that there are the only two who can win is no reason support Hitler or Stalin in a race where Abraham Lincoln cannot win as a 3rd party canidate Reply Perry F. Bruns August 18, 2016 at 4:28 pm With reasoning like this, it's hard to understand why more people don't take the Libertarian party less seriously. Howard A Pearce @HAPLibertarian August 18, 2016 at 9:27 pm And you would vote for either Hitler or Stalin then, because they are the ones who can win ? How interesting, now that I call "real" logic. And your party doesn't even support freedom of association - preferring state-mandated ones instead :) Perry F. Bruns August 18, 2016 at 9:57 pm Your logic has more glitches than Windows Vista. Your first fallacy, which you have continued, is to associate the two major parties with two of the deadliest dictators of all time. Let's examine the facts. Hitler and his regime killed close to 30 million people during World War II. During his 30-year reign, Stalin killed anywhere from 20 to 60 million people separately from the casualties of World War II, according to http://www.ibtimes.com/how-many-people-did-joseph-stalin-kill-1111789 Trump and Clinton have not been proven to have killed anyone. And that's just capital crime. Never mind the fact that you've invoked Godwin's Law, which basically ruins any political discussion by bringing up Hitler. There's also the fact that neither major U.S. party's policies bear any similarity whatsoever to those of either the Nazi party or Stalinist Communism. In fact, those parties were both single-party: you were either a member or you were most likely in deep trouble. Your second fallacy was to assume I am a member of either the Democratic or Republican parties. You failed to even cite evidence for such a claim. You say, "Your party doesn't even support freedom of association (fallacy three, by the way, since you don't know what party I'm in), but both the Democratic and Republican parties strongly support the First Amendment, which specifically guarantees the right to peaceably assemble--or, in other words, freedom of association. Fallacy four is this ridiculous claim you make that "state-mandated" associations are supported by either party. Again, you've made no citation. As it happens, I am an independent, and strongly support eliminating closed primaries in all 50 states, plus any territories with the right to vote in the present or the future. This would immediately strengthen the smaller parties. I also support debates among candidates of all parties. While I support its right to field candidates, I don't support the Libertarian Party platform, but I wish your party the best of luck. Unfortunately, one of the major problems with all the smaller parties is that none of them seem willing to push for party representation in the House or Senate, or in the state and commonwealth legislatures. To quote Captain Malcolm Reynolds, my days of not taking you seriously are certainly coming to a middle. Perry F. Bruns August 18, 2016 at 9:58 pm Your logic has more glitches than Windows Vista.

Howard A Pearce @HAPLibertarian August 18, 2016 at 10:05 pm This was never an argument about Hillary or Trump .. bu the view that one must vote for a candidate what can win . And about favoring major parties over minor by the media. Do you support state-mandate wages for employment associations ? Like some conservatives support state-mandated opposite-sex for marriage associations? As I told you, I support freedom of ALL associations. I'll bet my life that you don't :) Perry F. Bruns August 18, 2016 at 10:46 pm Fortunately for you, I don't intend to collect, but you lose. Of course I support freedom of association, and equal rights, hence my earlier comment about opening all primaries and strengthening smaller parties. Perhaps if you actually paid attention to my replies, you'd stop claiming incorrect information about where I stand. And I don't even understand your question. What's an employment association? A labor union? An employment agency? What do you hope to accomplish with your screed? Howard A Pearce @HAPLibertarian August 18, 2016 at 11:03 pm You never did say whether you supported state-mandated wages for employment associations? Do you support your right to associate with entities that call themselves states ? Howard A Pearce @HAPLibertarian August 18, 2016 at 11:11 pm An employment association would be primarily one between employer and employee Perry F. Bruns August 18, 2016 at 11:28 pm Where I'm from, we call that a job. And what do "state-mandated wages" have to do with anything we were previously trying to discuss? And what does "Do you support your right to associate with entities that call themselves states ?" even mean? Please restate the questions in a clear, concise fashion. I'll answer them if I feel like it. Howard A Pearce @HAPLibertarian August 18, 2016 at 11:49 pm You are the one who claimed to believe in freedom of association, I was following that up with whether you believed in the state-mandated minimum wage for employment associations or whether you supported freedom of (employments) association. Same witht the 2nd question. Now be honest and try to answer the questions and not change the subject Perry F. Bruns August 18, 2016 at 11:53 pm Not change the subject? That's what you were doing. And you're just making terms up now. If you had simply asked if I supported a minimum wage, I would simply have said yes, but the issue of minimum wage has nothing at all to do with freedom of association without the idiotic verbal gymnastic stumbling you're doing to equate them. I'm done debating the political issues with you, because your personal issues seem to be getting in the way. I'm never going to take you seriously. And if you're what the Libertarian Party is about, then I feel the same way about them. You're an excellent example of why MakeUseOf's comments section should have a block function, though. Howard A Pearce @HAPLibertarian August 19, 2016 at 12:00 am I could have asked that, but then that would be to ingore the fact that the association between you and your employer IS an association COVERED by Freedom of Association Now we know you support state-mandated wages for (employment) associations. I doubt anyone would consider that freedom of association. Perry F. Bruns August 19, 2016 at 12:16 am My, but you're hilarious. Are you an actual human being in need of medical attention or a small shell script? What is your basis for the ridiculous idea that "...the association between you and your employer IS an association COVERED by Freedom of Association"? Just to clear up any further wacky questions, I support the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as adopted by the United Nations in 1948. It's not perfect, but it's compatible with the U.S. Constitution, and it fills in a lot of the blanks of that latter august document, complete with clearer, simpler language. I draw your attention (or your coder's) to Article 23, which states in its entirety: Article 23. (1) Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment. (2) Everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work. (3) Everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social protection. (4) Everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests. Howard A Pearce @HAPLibertarian August 19, 2016 at 12:20 am Yep go for the insults like a typical uniformed person on the rules logic :) I'm sorry you can't admit your obvious contradiction. Weak! Perry F. Bruns August 19, 2016 at 1:20 am Well, since you never made a single point, I got tired of the one-sidedness of the argument, and had to keep myself entertained somehow. I have to admit a grudging admiration for you, though: I've never met a single person whose every sentence seemed like a complete coincidence. And I was once "uniformed." You left out an "n." And a thesis. Howard A Pearce @HAPLibertarian August 19, 2016 at 12:51 pm One sidedness ? first you dare to claim you support freedom of association then come right back stating your support state-mandated wage rates for employment associations - restricting the associations a person may enter into. I'm reminded of the problems gays had forming marriage associations fighting people like you People who support state-mandated association over free and voluntary ones guaranteed by the LIBERAL concept of freedom of association are supporting fascist acts - regardless of from the right or the left.. Perry F. Bruns August 19, 2016 at 12:54 pm Well, now you're just spouting talking points. You are a sad, strange little man. Howard A Pearce @HAPLibertarian August 19, 2016 at 1:28 pm Hmm, well your points are debatable as worth talking about. Colin August 18, 2016 at 2:02 am Do you mean they cannot become President, or their chances are the same as a snowball in hell?

The chip should be fabricated on TSMC’s ten-nanometer process technology and use its backend integrated fan-out (InFO) wafer-level packaging technology. Additionally, TSMC should build Apple-designed circuitry to drive 2017 iPhone’s AMOLED panel. The iPhone’s touch and display driver circuitry is currently supplied by Renesas SP Drivers, now part of Synaptics. AMOLEDs should replace current iPhones’ LCD TFT panels in the 10th Anniversary iPhone. As per DigiTimes, AMOLED panels will be supplied by Korea-based panel vendors, most likely Samsung Display, LG Display and others. As for the main A11 chip, TSMC reportedly taped out its design back in May. For those wondering, in semiconductor talk “taping out” refers to the completion of a chip’s initial design before photomasks for printing the actual silicon dies can be created. Looking beyond 2017, Apple might be able to award some of its lucrative chip business to semiconductor giant Intel. Yesterday, Intel announced an agreement with ARM Holdings to let foundries like TSMC and Samsung produce chips based on ARM’s most advanced Cortex-series CPU cores on Intel’s ten-nanometer process technology. Beginning with the A7, Apple’s S-series chips have utilized 64-bit CPU cores compatible with the ARM instruction set. These cores are 100% custom Apple design rather than optimized versions of ARM’s existing Cortex-series CPU blueprints in the pre-A7 chips.

Black and white wallpapers for macOS and iOS   skip to main content skip to main menu     iTunes carrier billing expands in Japan, Taiwan and Switzerland By Christian Zibreg, Aug 17, 2016 Tweet 1 Comment Following initial launch of iTunes carrier billing in Russia with Telefonica’s O2 and in Germany with VimpelCom’s Beeline unit nearly a year ago, Apple has now brought this alternative option to customers in Japan, Taiwan and Switzerland, according to reports from CNBC and Mashable. Carrier billing lets customers without access to credit or gift cards have their app and media purchases charged directly to their monthly mobile phone bill or deducted from their prepaid amount. As mentioned, carrier billing can be used to pay for media purchases made on the iTunes Store, books purchased from the iBooks Store, apps bought from the App Store and Mac App Store and also to cover Apple Music subscription fees. RELATED: how to set up and use iTunes carrier billing As the iBooks Store is currently unavailable in Taiwan, customers there cannot use carrier billing on the iBooks Store. Additionally, carrier billing in Taiwan is only available to Far Eastone contract holders. In Switzerland, carrier billing is available through Swisscom. “Something previously reserved for Android users is now available to millions of Apple customers via Swisscom,” said the carrier in a media release. “As a result of an extensive collaboration, they can as of now easily pay for digital content in the App Store and on iTunes, Apple Music, iBooks and Apple TV via their mobile phone bills.” Here’s a list of Apple’s current carrier billing deals. In Japan, the option is currently limited to local carrier KDDI, the country’s second-largest mobile phone company. By comparison, Google’s Play Store on Android devices currently supports mobile billing in 45 markets, including deals with Japan’s top three phone companies. According to CNBC’s sources, after seeing positive results from its initial carrier billing deals, Apple has several more countries in the “near-term pipeline.” The full list of carriers that support iTunes carrier billing, along with other useful information, can be found in a support document on Apple’s website.

The decision could strike a major blow to semiconductor company Qualcomm, to which LG is a major customer. Korean phone manufacturer LG will use Intel's 10-nanometer process to develop a new generation of mobile processors, based on ARM's 64-bit technology. These will be built in Intel factories and used within LG's own electronics and mobile devices. It's unclear whether LG's home-grown chips will be limited to certain product ranges or used across all devices. Either way, it's sure to have a knock-on effect for Qualcomm, who has traditionally provided the processors for LG's smartphones. LG has been attempting to cut its dependency on the chipmaker for some time. Earlier this year, the companies became embroiled in a lawsuit over licensing fees for Qualcomm's chipsets. LG is not the first customer Qualcomm has seen depart either: Samsung famously snubbed Qualcomm's Snapdragon 810 for the Galaxy S6 back in 2015, and since then its growing self-reliance has been damaging to Qualcomm. Apple and Huawei, who rank highly in Eastern and Western respectively, also have their own chip designs. Meanwhile, low-cost players like MediaTek and Marvell are gaining market share as they offer a cheaper alternative to Qualcomm'. It's unclear when the first LG-powered devices will hit the market, although it's unlikely to be for some time given that actual production has yet to begin. LG's forthcoming V20 flagship, for example, is widely expected to come packing Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820 chipset.

As we’ve come to find out, both of these city cars – the Honda built in Thailand and the Suzuki built in India – have above-average interior space, meaning both will likely appeal to buyers who want a light car that isn’t light on practicality. There are some differences between what powers these two, and the prices that each of the respective brands is asking for them. Let’s see how each stacks up. Pricing and specifications Let’s start with the price difference between the two cars we have here. The Suzuki Baleno GLX Turbo is the more expensive of the two, priced at $21,990 plus on-road costs. There is a more affordable Baleno available, with a few less features and a less powerful engine (more on the powertrain later). The Honda VTi-S model isn’t quite as expensive at $19,790 plus on-road costs, but you could get the dearer VTi-L model, which has a few extras (including leather, which neither of these two has: it’s priced at $22,490). Now, before we go any further, let’s consider drive-away pricing: at the time of writing, the Baleno GLX was listed on the company’s site at $22,990 drive-away, which isn’t too bad a deal, really. The Jazz VTi-S, by the company’s calculator, was $23,066 on the road – so there’s not much in it if you believe those numbers: we’d suggest you bargain hard, though… To justify that extra (non-promotional price!) buy-in cost over the specs we have here, the Baleno has an alarm system, and it also has push-button start. The Baleno also betters the Jazz in terms of infotainment, with Apple CarPlay connectivity, and it has satellite navigation, which the Jazz misses out on. Both have front fog lights, and the Jazz has LED headlights but they’re automated, and they won’t turn off if you forget. The Baleno has HID headlights that go on and off automatically, and it has LED daytime running lights. Both have six-speaker stereo systems, with the essential Bluetooth phone and audio streaming, and both have USB inputs and auxiliary ports (the Baleno with just the one USB and one auxiliary, while the Jazz has two USB inputs, an aux jack and a HDMI input to play movies). Both have climate control, but neither has rear-seat air vents. The Baleno, however, has tinted rear windows that should help keep its cabin cooler in the warmer months. As for safety, both cars have rear-view cameras displaying on their media screens, and both cars have six airbags, with dual front, front side and full-length curtain coverage. Both have 16-inch alloy wheels with 185/55 rubber (the Baleno with Bridgestone Ecopia and the Jazz with slightly sportier Bridgestone Turanza tyres). And if you like the colour of the Jazz we have here – or if you’re a fan of colours in general – you’ll more likely err towards the Honda, as it has eight colours on offer (black, two blues, grey, red, silver, white and this hue, Attract Yellow). Everything but red attracts a $490 fee. The Suzuki has four colours only: white (the only non-metallic paint), blue, grey and silver. The premium for the, er, premium colours is $500. Interior As we mentioned previously, these two are here for their clever packaging, and in terms of size, there’s almost nothing in it. The Jazz measures just one millimetre longer than the Baleno (3996mm v 3995mm), but the Honda is notably taller (1524mm v 1470mm) and narrower (1694mm v 1745mm). And if we’re talking boot space, there’s a litre difference between the two: the Jazz claims 354L of cargo, where the Baleno boasts best in class boot capacity of 355L. Better leave that last carton of milk at the shops, Jazz buyers! Both have space-saver spare wheels under their boot floors, too. For context, these two have interior space and practicality that betters cars in the class above. For example, the Mazda 3 hatch has just 308L of cargo space, where a Corolla hatch has 360L. The exceptional space isn’t just in the boot, though, with both of these two pint-sized hatches offering interior space that again betters cars in the class above – not just those in the passenger car class, but also in the small – and even medium – SUV segment. The cleverness of the Jazz isn’t just its tall body, but also its large door apertures, and its “Magic Seats” in the rear. Those 60:40 split seats fold completely flat to form a nice even floor area, allowing the Jazz to essentially double as a moving van if required. If the items you have are too tall for that, the rear seat bases can also be flipped up to allow you to store items straight onto the floor of the vehicle. It’s brilliant. The Baleno isn’t as smart: indeed, its boot opening is quite high and quite narrow compared with the Jazz, which has a lower lip and a broader opening, which makes loading in heavy or large items easy. However, the Suzuki does have a shopping bag hook, which the Honda misses out on. The Baleno’s rear seats don’t fold flat when you lower them, nor do they have the abracadabra function of its rival. As for human space, the two are a little closer. The Jazz’s second row offers more than enough legroom for a six-foot-tall occupant to sit behind another, although those in the back may find the seating position to be a little bit ‘knees-up’. Still, there is ample toe room and enough headroom to suffice, too. The Baleno, likewise, offers deceptive levels of interior space, with excellent legroom, good toe room but a little less headroom than the Jazz. Its rear seating is a little more relaxed, with a marginally longer seat squab making it potentially a little more comfortable for longer trips. If you’re not planning to shift big humans often, the child-seat anchor points could be of more use. There are dual ISOFIX rear attachments in the back seat of the Baleno, and it has three top-tether points, too. Disappointingly, the Jazz has no ISOFIX attachment points, and only two (outboard) top-tether points. Neither car has rear-seat air-vents, but storage is well accounted for in the second rows of both cars. The Suzuki has bottle holders in the doors, as well as a single map pocket. There’s no centre arm-rest, but it has a 12-volt outlet (the Honda doesn’t, but there is one in the centre console up front that could do the trick). The Jazz’s second row also has bottle holders in the doors and betters the Baleno with twin map pockets in the seatbacks, and the taller body gives it better outward vision for those in the rear seat. It feels airier back there, too. The Suzuki is generally very well finished and decently put together, but the quality of the head-lining is below average, and our car even had a couple of poor fitment issues (including a crease!), and attention to detail is a little lax: for example, the covers of the rear seats were crookedly finished. When it comes to the front row, the two continue the theme of clever storage and above-average space. The Jazz, for example, has a very clever cabin design including a dash-top bottle holder for the driver, and a bit more storage space in front of the gear-shifter than the Baleno. It also has better shaped central cup-holders than the Suzuki (yeah, the Suzuki’s are square!), and a bigger centre console storage bin. Both have good-sized door pockets for storing bottles and loose items, though the Baleno’s are larger than the Jazz’s, while both have adequate gloveboxes. And while it may not be a deal breaker for some, the sun-visors of the Suzuki are smaller and flimsy, where the Jazz’s are more rigid and they have bigger vanity mirrors. Pictured above: Honda Jazz (top); Suzuki Baleno (bottom) It’s weird that the Baleno has such a high seating position up front – all testers found the height of both the front seats to be a little frustrating (“it’s like driving in a high chair,” said one), and even more so when jumping between the two cars. The Jazz has a much lower seating position, and unlike the Baleno, there’s a pump lever for height adjustment, too. When it comes to media systems, the pair is sorted with 7.0-inch touchscreen units with all the aforementioned connectivity. Of course, we’ve made the point before that Apple CarPlay makes it a car more liveable day-to-day, and that argument is furthered by the infotainment on offer in both of these cars. The Suzuki’s screen is fine, but can be slow to react to inputs, and while the quadrant layout is logical, it isn’t attractive. That said, it’s one of the only screens around that, if you start the car and need to reverse out of a park without wasting time, will display the rear-view camera display before the system and menus load up. And if you’re an Apple user, just plug your phone in and you’ve got a wallpaper. The Honda’s screen is also fine, but not fantastic. The fonts are a bit pixelated and the system can also be hesitant to load, and the controls to jump between menus aren’t as intuitive as the Baleno – despite the fact it looks prettier, and it has an actual wallpaper, if not one that offers you better phone usability. In short, neither car has as good a media interface as the best vehicles in the class: the Mazda 2 with the brand’s MZD Connect rotary dial is our fave despite lacking Apple CarPlay, followed by the touchscreens of the Skoda Fabia and Volkswagen Polo. Both cars have digital information screens, but disappointingly neither has a digital speedometer (the Suzuki’s will display your set speed for its cruise control). The Honda’s monochrome screen is positioned in the instrument cluster as the third dial, where the Baleno’s bright, high-resolution colour screen has not only a better display but also a lot more detail to it, including power and torque meters, and even a G-force meter. Still, that instrument cluster, which has a blue light at night, doesn’t quite gel with the orange backlighting of the buttons.  Under the bonnet These two little luggers have quite different drivetrains – one is downsized and features forced induction, the other has an extra cylinder and lacks a turbo. The Suzuki has a 1.0-litre three-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine, with 82kW of power (at 5500rpm) and 160Nm of torque (from 1500-4000rpm). It’s front-wheel drive, with a six-speed automatic gearbox with paddleshifters. The Honda’s engine isn’t quite as new school – it isn’t as small, and doesn’t have a turbo. Instead, under its bonnet is a bigger 1.5-litre four-cylinder engine with a bit more power, 88kW at 6600rpm, but a little less torque, 145Nm at a much higher 4600rpm. It’s front-drive, too, and has a continuously variable transmission (CVT) auto with paddles as well. In practice, the differences are marked between the grunt grumblers under the bonnets of these two cars, and it’s no surprise given that the Baleno’s tare mass is just 955 kilograms. The Jazz is a relative porker, tipping the scales at 1120kg (tare weight). The Suzuki’s engine has a good amount of urge under light to mid throttle, but can gasp for breath under really heavy acceleration – indeed, the best response for this engine is in that sweet spot between 1500-4000rpm, and thankfully that’s where you spend most of your time when you’re running around town. Just beware, there can be a little bit of lag from a standstill. Still, the gearbox has an eagerness to go for the highest gear possible, meaning you may find yourself suddenly dropping back a couple of cogs for slight inclines, and that can mean that it feels like you’re running short of pulling power, when in fact you’ve got plenty – just in a lower gear. You can override the transmission by driving in manual mode, but the paddles aren’t the most compliant to driver demands. The Baleno exhibits some thrumming through the steering wheel and the seat at idle. All that said, the drivetrain in the Baleno is more effortless in getting the job done than the Jazz in some situations, as it felt somewhat underpowered in comparison. The Jazz’s engine can get bogged down when you really need it to be hitting its straps. For example, if you slow down to take a tight uphill corner it can be a bit sluggish to react, with the CVT auto robbing it of grunt. Indeed, that CVT makes the Jazz sound (and feel) a little unrefined, and that’s saying something in the company of a grumbly little three-cylinder. If you’re just motoring around the suburbs, though, the engine copes a lot more comfortably under light to mid-throttle, and in those situations the transmission keeps up pretty well and responds decently to sudden throttle inputs. As for fuel consumption, the Baleno’s claimed consumption is lower, as you may expect of a smaller turbo engine, at 5.2 litres per 100 kilometres. On test, we used a bit more than that: 6.9L/100km, and take note that it requires 95-octane premium unleaded fuel. The Jazz’s claimed consumption is a little higher, 5.8L/100km. On test it fared a little worse than that, using 7.8L/100km – and it uses regular unleaded, which could appeal to some purchasers. Road manners As well as having very different characteristics to their drivetrains, these two possess differing driving dynamics. The Baleno, for instance, is set up to feel a little softer on the road, whereas the Jazz is firmer, which results in it feeling zippier than its rival. Still, the low kerb weight of the Baleno means it is quicker to get from one corner to the next, and while its wider body gives it a wider footprint on the road – its track is also considerably wider than the Jazz (1520mm v 1476mm front; 1520mm v 1465mm rear) – the Baleno’s tyres let it down. The Bridgestone Ecopia tyres fitted to the Baleno don’t offer quite enough grip to get the best out of the lightweight hatchback’s chassis. I mean, hardly anyone who will buy this sort of car will be thinking of grip at the limit, but the Bridgestone Turanzas on the Jazz do offer a little bit more grip. In fact, the Honda’s better balance and body control meant it felt more at home in corners, and more fun, too. There was some body roll because of its high-topped body, but the steering was considerably more accurate. In fact, the Suzuki’s steering is its biggest downfall. The mismatched weighting and resistance means its really hard to judge what reaction you’ll get from the front of the car in corners, though when you’re pushing it hard, linking one corner to the next, it’s a bit better. But when you’re pottering around on the highway or just around town, the inconsistency of the Suzuki’s steering really gets to a point where it bugs you. It’s a sticky feeling, one that means the steering wheel always feels like it’s trying to return to centre. When you’re trying to park, the Baleno’s steering can be a little bit heavy, and so can the Honda’s, proving a little bit slow to respond and solidly weighted when you start it up. The Honda, though, has a much more trusty feel on centre and better accuracy in all situations. That said, the Jazz is louder than the Baleno, no matter the surface, and its ride is harder, which could be a deal breaker for some. You feel more of the bumps at low speed, but it is better settled after a bump: where the Jazz can jolt a little, the Baleno can bobble and wobble. The Jazz’s balance between composure and comfort appeals to us more than the Baleno, which can be flummoxed by rough sections of road – particularly at high speeds. The Baleno’s body control is a better around town than on the open road, with good bump absorption over speed humps and the like unless the bump is especially sharp, which can make it feel a little clumsy as the front-end can clang on impact. In terms of stopping power, the Jazz again bettered the Baleno, with more consistent braking performance and more linear pedal feel. The Baleno’s brakes were a touch grabbier. It’s not really a dynamic disappointment, but the automated central locking system in the Baleno is annoying: it doesn’t deactivate when you stop and/or put it in park. That means that, say, if you get out after stopping the car and try and grab something from the back seat, the door will be locked. It may have just been an issue with the way our car was set up, and could be reconfigurable – we’d sure hope so. Ownership Both cars come with the bare minimum in terms of warranty cover, with each having a three-year/100,000km cover. So if you’re looking to hang on to your car for a longer period, consider alternatives with longer warranties like the Hyundai Accent (five years/unlimited km) or Kia Rio (seven years/unlimited km). Despite their different drivetrains, the Honda and the Suzuki both require servicing every six months or 10,000km (more regular than many competitors that see servicing as an annual/15,000km requirement), and both have capped-price service programs that span five years or 100,000km. The average cost per visit for the Suzuki is $245, while the Honda is a little dearer, at an average of $278. Verdict These two are both practical, both feature-focused, and both impressive little hatchbacks for buyers who want their cars to offer more space than their dimensions suggest they should. But despite being newer, having a smarter media screen and packing a more powerful and more modern drivetrain, the Suzuki Baleno isn’t as polished as the Jazz. The Baleno is a nice little car, one that will be better suited to buyers who aren’t planning to hit the open road or push it through corners. The Honda Jazz, though, is a better all-rounder. It is little firmer over bumps, sure – but the upside of that is that it handles better, and that gives you more confidence from the driver’s seat. Add to that it’s super practical packaging and sharper list pricing, and the Honda has to win this test. Click the Photos tab above for more images by Sam Venn.

Becoming Infinite With Music Hopeless Duality Of Man Tech Aug 16, 2016 10:15 AM ET iPhone 7: New Leaked Photos and Everything We Know So Far According to one credible source, the iPhone will hit retail shelves on Sept. 16. Before you know it, the iPhone 7 will arrive. But will Apple's new phone offer enough to get you to upgrade? We're getting a clear picture of what to expect from the next iPhone — including when it will arrive. And so far the rumors have left us feeling a little underwhelmed, with the reported features sounding more like modest improvements over Apple's current smartphone lineup and not the overhaul we've come to expect every other year. In fact, many Apple watchers are suggesting that a more substantial update is in the works for 2017. RELATED: Why Do Apple Releases Generate So Much Buzz? Until then, though, here's what appears to be on tap for the iPhone 7. A Mid-September Release A prominent leaker of phone news says the iPhone will hit retail shelves on Sept. 16. That would be about 10 days after Apple is expected to hold an early September press event to unveil the new Phone. No Headphone Jack Leaked photos and videos all but confirm the iPhone 7 will go without the 3.5mm headphone jack, opting for a slimmer design that requires Lightning-compatible headphones. Dual Cameras for the iPhone Plus More leaks have revealed a dual-lens setup for the larger iPhone Plus, while the iPhone 7 is expected to have a larger lens than what you're used to with the iPhone 6s. Potentially Another iPhone At least one leaked photo depicts a third model that will appear alongside the existing iPhone and iPhone Plus this fall. Dubbed the iPhone Pro, this version would offer improved cameras, a massive amount of storage and a Smart Connector for attaching to accessories and charging devices; others suggest that Apple will stick with two iPhones and that the iPhone Pro is really just the iPhone 7 Plus. A Pressure-Sensitive Home Button Just as the screens on the latest iPhone respond to different presses thanks to Apple's 3-D Touch feature, the iPhone 7's home button will reportedly respond to pressure and provide haptic feedback when you press it. 32GB of Storage According to multiple reports, Apple seems to have realized what the rest of the world has long since concluded — that 16GB is too little capacity for today's smartphones. Built Tougher The iPhone's expected to become more durable, matching the waterproof features Samsung added to its flagship phones. Here's a deeper look at the features currently rumored for the iPhone 7 — and everything we want from Apple's new phone. The iPhone Debuts Sept. 7 The Sept. 7 date comes from a Bloomberg report detailing changes expected for an upcoming MacBook Pro update. But that date isn't exactly out of left field: Apple has held iPhone launch events on Sept. 9 for two years running, so Sept. 7 would be keeping with Apple's usual time frame. RELATED: Apple App Could Turn Strangers into Walking ATMs Expect the iPhone 7 to arrive roughly 10 days later. According to Evan Blass, a leaker of phone news with a good track record of getting rumors right, the iPhone will hit retail shelves on Sept. 16. That's a little earlier than when iPhones normally arrive after an Apple event. Last year, the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus arrived in stores on Sept. 25. But with Samsung already having taken the wraps off the Galaxy Note 7 and other phone announcements expected at the IFA trade show in Berlin in early September, Apple could feel the need to get the new iPhones in users' hands sooner rather than later. No More Headphone Jack What once looked like a far-fetched rumor when Japan's Mac Otakara first reported it now seems pretty much a certainty: The iPhone 7 won't have a 3.5mm headphone jack. Instead, users will plug in headphones through the phone's Lightning port, either with the help of an adapter or with headphones built specifically for the new iPhone. The Wall Street Journal cited sources confirming the headphone jack as a goner, and CAD renders allegedly of the new phone posted on French site NowhereElse.fr depict an iPhone without a 3.5mm jack. Need more evidence? This TechnoBuffalo video shows off a dummy iPhone 7 that only features a Lightning port. Weibo/iappsnews A Dual Camera for the iPhone Plus With the Galaxy S7 overtaking the iPhone as the best phone camera, Apple likely wants to re-establish the iPhone as the top camera smartphone. If reports are right, the company is turning to a dual-camera system to pull that off — at least for some of the new phones. Well-known Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo at KGI securities said earlier this year that the iPhone 7 Plus would feature rear cameras with two different lenses to collect more image data. KGI also speculated that the 5.5-inch phone will come with an optical zoom to add 2-3x magnification, as well as optical image stabilization. More leaked photos posted on NowhereElse.fr claim to show the dual-camera setup on the iPhone Plus, as does a leaked photo, allegedly from a presentation by Apple manufacturing partner Foxconn, from the Chinese site MyDrivers. RELATED: Self-aware iPhone Adjusts Based on Locale KGI believes the new camera setup will integrate with LinX camera technology that Apple acquired last year, which would use the data from both cameras to create much higher-quality photos. LinX is an Israeli company that Apple bought last year, which specializes in creating high-definition images out of smaller multi-lens configurations, according to Apple Insider. The two-camera setup is not a new idea for smartphones. The LG G5, for example, uses two cameras that allow you to shoot both regular photos and wide-angle shots with the same phone. The Huawei P9also has two cameras, in this case both backed by Leica, where one camera captures info in monochrome and the other focuses on color. The result is supposed to be an image with the pixel size equivalent of 1.76 microns, which is impressive. The new iPhones are expected to keep the same 12-megapixel sharpness. As for the lens on the iPhone 7, it's likely to be a single lens, but it will be much bigger than the one on the iPhone 6s. Leaked images of the iPhone 7 show a physically larger lens surrounded by a prominent bump. A Third iPhone The working assumption with the iPhone 7 release is that Apple will stick with its current lineup: a 4.7-inch iPhone and a 5.5-inch Plus model. But some leaked photos suggest a third iPhone called the iPhone Pro could be in the works. Photos from NowhereElse.fr support this rumor, where an iPhone appears alongside two models labeled the iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7. The iPhone Pro sports a dual-lens camera on its back and a Smart Connect like the one you'd find on an iPad Pro. An earlier image on on the Chinese social networking site Weibo also showed a Smart Connector port on the back of an alleged iPhone. (The Smart Connector could also be featured on the iPhone 7 Plus, should Apple stick to its two-phone lineup.) RELATED: iPhone 7 Will Have the Screen You Want If it exists, an iPhone Pro figures to have a pro-sized price tag. PocketNow spotted pricing chatter on Weibo that suggests a base model iPhone Pro could cost around $850 once you figure in currency conversion and export fees. That's a hefty premium that will require some standout features to get people interested in buying a pro-level phone. However, it may well be that Apple sticks with two iPhone models and that the features slated for the iPhone Pro really just wind up in the iPhone 7 Plus, as Apple looks to distinguish the Plus model from the 4.7-inch iPhone. Home Button Leads Design Changes Apple added pressure-sensitivity to the iPhone's display with the 3-D Touch feature iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. It could pull off the same trick with the iPhone 7's home button, according to a Bloomberg report. Rather than depress, the revamped home button would be able to detect different levels of pressure and provide haptic feedback. Being able to tell the difference between a tap and a hard press could mean new ways of interacting with your iPhone — think of what 3-D Touch's peak and press features let you do on the current iPhone models. It also lowers the risk that the home button could stop clicking if it's damaged by dust or lint. NowhereElse.fr As for other design changes, look for more of the same from the current iPhone lineup. Leaked photos on the Italian site Macitynet suggest the new models will sport the same colors as the current iPhone lineup — gold, rose gold, space gray and silver. That doesn't necessarily preclude other colors from emerging closer to the iPhone's fall release, though. The latest video from TechnoBuffalo suggests the iPhone 7 will look a lot like the iPhone 6s, from its size and shape to its physical home button. Sketches on NowhereElse.fr show the iPhone 7 will have the same 138.3mm height and 67.12mm width as Apple's latest phone. The sketch makes no mention of depth, however, so it's hard to tell whether or not the iPhone 7 will be significantly thinner than the 6s. From the looks of leaked photos and videos, whether on TechnoBuffalo or NowhereElse.Fr, look for the antenna bands to be subtler on the iPhone 7, curving around the top and bottom edges of the phone. MacRumors had originally reported that the plastic antenna bands seen on the 6 and 6s will not be present, giving the iPhone 7 a sleeker look. More Storage on the Base Model The days of having to cram your photos, music and other files into the iPhone's 16GB capacity — or paying up for a model with more storage space — could come to an end with the iPhone 7. When word of the iPhone Pro leaked, it contained another tidbit of information about Apple's fall iPhone lineup: Apple is reportedly boosting the starting amount of storage on the iPhone to 32GB. The Wall Street Journal confirmed those plans, citing a source familiar with Apple's iPhone roadmap. TechnoBuffalo's iPhone 7 video says higher-end models of the iPhone 7 could offer 256GB of storage. All that squares with earlier reports: As noted by 9to5Mac, IHS Technology analyst Kevin Wang has found supply chain evidence that the next iPhone will come with at least 32GB of storage, meaningApple will finally ditch the 16GB iPhone. That will be a welcome addition as 32GB is pretty much the standard for flagship phones these days. Wireless Charging for iPhone? Apple could introduce a new way to charge a future iPhone. The Verge did some digging and found that Apple has ramped up hiring of employees who specialize in wireless charging, including two recent hires from charging startup uBeam. That would square with a Bloomberg report that Apple is looking for ways to wirelessly charge your iPhone from a distance, without having to use a charging mat. Of course, that Bloomberg report speculated such a feature wouldn't be ready into 2017. However, the leaked photo posted on MyDrivers that depicts a dual-lens camera on the iPhone 7 Plus also lists wireless charging as one of the features on Apple's high-end phone. That photo is allegedly from a presentation at Foxconn, which would build the next iPhone, if that lends any weight to the rumor. A More Durable iPhone Water and iPhones haven't mixed, but that could change with the iPhone 7. TrendForce is expecting the new phones to be waterproof, which would match a similar feature that Samsung currently touts for its Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. Certainly, the removal of a headphone port from the next iPhone would simplify waterproofing the device considerably. The MyDriver photo that mentions wireless charging as an iPhone 7 Plus feature also claims that the phone will be dust- and water-resistant for what it's worth. And TechnoBuffalo's iPhone 7 video shows the phone sitting by trickling water, suggesting some water resistance. As for what you could do with a waterproof iPhone, Patently Apple spotted a patent awarded to Apple for a system that lets you take photos underwater. Other Improvements Some of the iPhone 7's improvements are fairly easy to predict. You can probably expect the new iPhone to feature an A10 processor since Apple routinely upgrades the CPU in its phones with each new release. And Digitimes reports that Intel will supply half of the LTE chips for the iPhone 7. Battery life also figures to improve. According to Slashgear, the iPhone 7 could pack a battery with 7.04 watt-hours of power, which would be a big step up from the iPhone 6s Plus' 7.01 watt-hours. The iPhone 6s has 6.51 watt-hours of juice. Both of the latest iPhones trail the field when it comes to endurance. The iPhone 6s lasted just 6 hours and 46 minutes on the Tom's Guide Battery Test, which involves continuous web surfing over 4G LTE, compared to the 8:43 for the Galaxy S7. The iPhone 6s Plus lasted a longer 8:43, but that's no match for the S7 Edge (10:09). The 2017 iPhone Yes, that's right — the iPhone 7 isn't out yet, and we're already talking about the phone coming after that. Yet another research note from KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo forecasts a major overhaul of the iPhone's case slated for next year. According to 9to5Mac's summary of Kuo's note, Apple plans to switch to an all-glass enclosure for the iPhone in 2017. Analyst Mark Moskowitz of Barclays wrote earlier this year that supply chain checks suggested no "must-have form factor changes," according to a report in Fortune. Likewise, the Wall Street Journal's report on the disappearing headphone jack in the iPhone 7 suggests that Apple is holding off on major changes to the iPhone until next year, which coincidentally marks the device's 10th anniversary." All of this could signal a move away from Apple's traditional approach to releasing a major iPhone update one year, followed by a more modest update the following year. Nikkei Asian Review reports that Apple is planning on extending the iPhone's product cycle, meaning the phone maker would go longer between major iPhone updates, a move the publication says reflects a maturing smartphone market where there are fewer earth-shattering enhancements to make. Looking Forward: What We Want The iPhone 6s is Apple's most impressive smartphone yet, with game-changing 3-D touch functionality, fast performance and fun camera features. Still, there's plenty of room for improvement. We hope that reports of Apple upping the storage on its starting model to 32GB turn out to be true. A measly 16GB of space is no longer acceptable for a smartphone — especially now that the iPhone can shoot 4K video. We'd also hope that TechnoBuffalo is right about a 256GB option added to the lineup, as opposed to the 128GB on the top end right now. It also may be time for Apple to embrace sharper screens. The displays on the iPhone 6s (1344 x 750) and iPhone 6s Plus (1920 x 1080) are impressively vibrant, but are starting to show their limitations now that quad-HD (2560 x 1440) comes standard on many Android flagships. Apple would also do well to up its game in the battery department. The iPhone 6s Plus lasted over 8 hours on our battery test — that's enough to get through a workday, but isn't nearly as impressive as the colossal 12-plus hours of juice we got out of Google's Nexus 6P. Lastly, the iPhone 7 could benefit by taking a few cues from the newly released iPad Pro, even if those features only wind up on the rumored iPhone Pro. The addition of multitasking and stylus support could help Apple's smartphone go head-to-head with devices such as the Galaxy Note 5, and would establish the iPhone 7 as a device for power users and mainstream fans alike.

The latest bit of information touts significantly faster charging capabilities for the device.  ( The Malignant | Twitter ) Advertisement Rumors about the upcoming iPhone 7 are pouring strong as the device is expected to come out at the start of September, and a new element recently surfaced. Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus could sport enhanced charging speeds, according to tipster The Malignant, who published the finding in a tweet. #Apple according to the source (导航i世界) seems #iphone7 will support #fastcharge at least 5V2A pic.twitter.com/Lu0AqnVHud — The Malignant (@the_malignant) August 14, 2016 The tipster speculates that the latest installment in the iPhone family will come with "at least" 5-volt 2-amp charging. In order to back the data on something, the user posted an image comparison of logic boards belonging to an iPhone 6s and an iPhone 7. The existing iPhone handsets come with a 1A/5W charger, but for those who want to see them charging faster, a 2.1A/12W iPad adapter is the go-to solution. If The Malignant's tip holds true, the iPhone 7 could sport an even higher charging speed than the one found in the iPad charging adapter. Most users agree that the main problem present in Apple's iPhone models is that the battery life is lackluster. Comparing iPhones with rival flagships, battery life constantly falls behind, showing that Apple is behind the pack in terms of optimizing power management in its smartphones. This is why rumors about the iPhone 7's improved charging have been around for a while, as fans hope that the OEM will address the "wall-hugging" issue. However, seeing how the tidbit of info does not come from a reliable source, we recommend taking it with a grain of salt until official confirmation arrives. The Malignant does have a history of sharing rumors and information that first leak on Chinese social networking sites, mainly Weibo, with some of them being legitimate. What we know from more trustworthy sources is that the new iPhone will feature small design modifications, such as the relocation of antenna bands at the top and bottom edges of the device instead of running across its back. The headphone jack, or rather its absence, has been making headlines for a while now, as the removal of the 3.5mm classic headphone jack could have dire implications on the types of files users are able to play on their phones. Technical specs-wise, the iPhone 7 is said to carry 2 GB of RAM, while the larger variant, the iPhone 7 Plus, was spotted on Geekbench packing 3 GB of RAM. Additionally, a more powerful CPU is rumored to back the processing power of the devices, but details are scarce. We will find out more as Apple introduces the iPhone 7 at an event that some claim will take place on Sept. 7.

Apple Announces Environmental Progress in China By John Voorhees Apple made two announcements about its environmental initiatives in China today. First, it announced that Lens Technology, which produces glass for Apple, has committed to using 100% renewable energy for all of its Apple operations by the end of 2018. Lens, which is the first Apple supplier to commit to using fully-renewable energy sources, has entered into agreements with local wind energy suppliers to fulfill its commitment. Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, said: We want to show the world that you can manufacture responsibly and we’re working alongside our suppliers to help them lower their environmental impact in China. We congratulate Lens for their bold step, and hope by sharing the lessons we’ve learned in our transition to renewable energy, our suppliers will continue to access clean power projects, moving China closer to its green manufacturing goals. Second, Apple announced that all of its fourteen final assembly sites in China comply with UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill standard, which “certifies all of their manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or, when necessary, converted into energy.” Foxconn met the Zero Waste to Landfill standard earlier this year at two of its assembly sites. Twelve other sites were added more recently.

Taking her four-year-old daughter Marlowe with her, Sienna is hoping that life in the Big Apple will be far more inspiring than being in London. "London feels cliquey and sometimes a little bit like swimming through mud," the 34-year-old explained. "I feel like people come to New York to do something. I kind of dine out on that energy. "Everyone is here because they’re like: 'I have something to say, something to do and I’m going to do it.'" https://www.instagram.com/p/BJI-PnAjMKp/embed Read More Sienna Miller admits to undergoing "terrifying but extraordinary" psychological detox therapy treatment She added to the Daily Mail newspaper: "I find New York, at the moment, a little bit more inspiring." Earlier this week, Sienna's sister, Savannah, posted a picture of her at JFK airport as she retrieved her hoard of luggage. Savannah captioned the shot: “It's official, she's a New Yorker.” The Burnt actress called off her engagement to Marlowe’s father Tom Sturridge in July 2015 - it is unclear whether he will be moving across the pond too. Will Tom be joining Sienna and Marlowe in New York? (Photo: Getty) Her move may have also come after she revealed she underwent a course if therapy to banish the "noise" in her head. Speaking to Porter about the treatment she said: “It’s terrifying but extraordinary. It’s 10 years of therapy in a week. "It’s focused on Freudian analysis, which is basically how behaviour patterns are all learned, how you can trace them all back to either parents or surrogates, then you kind of let go and examine who you would have been if you hadn’t taken on all these negative traits. “There’s an immense amount of space in my head and there is no f****** noise in it for the first time.

Just feel how tight those corners are. But we get it: you accumulated way too many, and now you can’t bring yourself to throw the magnificent containers out. If you’re anything like us, for years you just stacked them in the closet and checked in on them every few months. Then, suddenly, your closet was overflowing with Apple packaging and you had no room to store your coats or hundreds of outdated chargers or cat. But don’t dump them! We scoured the Net and found the best hacks for dealing with your Apple boxes. Follow our suggestions below and, soon enough, those boxes will be worth as much as the product that came inside them. Regive Them Apple boxes can serve as great gift boxes. Imagine the joy on your loved one’s face and her squeals of delight when she opens up that pristine Apple box and finds a gift card to Rite Aid lovingly stowed inside. Repair a Bridge with Them Unlike metal or cement, Apple boxes do not corrode or rust. They can withstand twelve tons of force per square inch. Crowd-source America’s closets and collect enough boxes to repair some of the country’s sixty thousand crumbling bridges! Renovate Your Home with Them Forget Sheetrock—increase the value of your property with a perfectly proportioned Apple room. Apple boxes are made of a NASA-designed material that will keep you warm in temperatures as low as ninety degrees below zero (Celsius!). In fact, Apple boxes have replaced ice blocks in forty per cent of igloos. (The other sixty per cent have melted.) Build a Boat with Them This D.I.Y. watercraft is Silicon Valley’s update to that old milk-carton boat you made in elementary school. Use your marine-grade Apple boxes to create a vessel without having to get your Sperry Topsiders dirty during chores like sanding, fibreglassing, or painting. Simply place the desired number of MacBook boxes side by side and tell Siri to “make a boat.” The edges of the boxes will then merge, creating a waterproof seal that’ll keep you safe and dry from here to Cupertino! Bake a Cake with Them Apple boxes can be used in place of cake and muffin pans and are actually edible when baked at three hundred and fifty degrees. Move over, Betty Crocker—nothing says lovin’ like an Apple-box cake. Stack your Apple boxes for an inexpensive multilayered wedding cake: iMac, MacBook, iPad, iPhone 6, iPhone 4, and iPod Nano as the topper! Construct Your Own Coffin with Them Funerals are expensive. Why not take your boxes and build a custom casket? The box material doesn’t decompose and will keep your body perfectly preserved well past the second-thousandth coming of iOS. If you prefer cremation, three MacBook Pro boxes will hold a standard-size adult.

Apple is rumored to ditch the 16GB storage tier and replace it with 32GB, and some reports even claim that Apple will have 256GB iPhone 7 versions in stores, which should address all your storage needs. A new report indicates that will indeed be the case, suggesting that Apple is putting increased pressure on the NAND memory market, with suppliers raising prices as supply fails to meet demand. DON’T MISS: I can’t wait to see Apple’s silly explanation for the iPhone 7’s camera According to Digitimes, there’s strong demand for memory for new smartphones, “particularly the iPhone 7 featuring up to 256GB of storage.” Assuming Apple’s new iPhones will sell well, NAND flash prices will not drop anytime soon. But if iPhone 7 demand is lower than expected, NAND memory might be cheaper starting in the first quarter of 2017. Samsung and SK Hynix are two major NAND flash suppliers that have raised their prices, citing a pull-in of orders from their system customers, with chip shortages being more severe than expected. This might be good news for iPhone owners looking to upgrade to the iPhone 7 this year, but Android fans expecting to see a similar bump in built-in storage might have to wait since Apple is gobbling up all the supply. Even Samsung launched the Galaxy Note 7 only in a 64GB version, but the phone supports microSD cards of up to 256GB (technically it's up to 2TB, though 256GB is the largest available card right now), which would give users 320GB of storage on the flagship phone. It’s not clear, however, whether Samsung’s choice has anything to do with this NAND flash shortage. The report does say that the NAND price increase might hinder the penetration rate of SSDs in the notebook market, affecting demand before the back-to-school season. Apple’s influence on NAND memory prices is pretty obvious. The company is a critical consumer of NAND chips, having bought 15% of the overall NAND supply in 2015 for its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s lines.

Apple CEO Tim Cook who called China’s Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli said that Apple plans to set up an independent research and development centre in China before the end of 2016, the first in the Asia-Pacific region, though he did not reveal the specific location, state run Xinhua news agency reported. Cook also said that smartphones are growing in importance as they add new functions, and will not be replaced by other products any time soon. “For most people, the smartphone is either the primary or the sole window that they have to the Internet… and there is nothing that eclipses it any time soon or maybe any time in the distant future,” he said. Cook is optimistic about the world smartphone market as penetration in many markets is very low, such as India, where the 4G network is just rolling out this year.

You are gonna be using it all the time. It’s a constant companion,” he said. The company plans to release a new iPhone model in September. Its sales in China in recent quarters have not been that favorable. Figures show the quarterly revenue of Apple in greater China, including Hong Kong and Taiwan, dropped by 33 per cent year on year to USD 8.848 billion from April to June. According to statistics released last month by Counterpoint Research, Apple dropped to the fifth place in China’s mobile market in the first quarter, after Huawei, Vivo, Oppo and Xiaomi, which secured 53 per cent of combined market share. Cook responded that the company saw a significant reduction of channel inventory, particularly in the quarter from March to June, meaning customers are buying more products than the shown revenue. Another factor that has influenced the financial figures is the depreciation of the Chinese yuan, he said. Cook said he is optimistic about the company’s sales prospects in the fall, especially as the iOS 10 operating system will be launched. Apple said that all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL (Underwriters Laboratories) zero waste standards. “It means that all the manufacturing waste from the 14 facilities is either reused, recycled or composted,” said Lisa Jackson, vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives at Apple. It has a total of 18 final assembly plants in the world. The zero waste program began in January last year and has helped divert more than 140,000 metric tons of waste from landfill to more environmentally sound procedures, she said. The UL standards, set by a well-known US safety consulting and certification company, are widely adopted in safety-related testing and validation around the world. “It’s the same standards that Apple uses. All the factories submitted plans to get the verification,” Jackson said. One of Apple’s top suppliers, Foxconn saw its two sites, one in Shenzhen, southern China’s Guangdong Province, and the other in Taiyuan, northern China’s Shanxi Province, become the first to get the zero waste validation, earlier this year. “If you visit our final assembly plants, you will see a lot of materials stacked up to be shipped back to the vendors so that they can be reused,” she said. According to Jackson, packaging that goes back to vendors undergoes a cleaning process to get refreshed and is then inspected to make sure it is still good enough to be used again. In recent years, Apple has made clear efforts to improve the environmental impact of its supply chain, which is responsible for 77 per cent of its total carbon footprint. Apple is also looking at its energy usage and today, the company announced a commitment from its major supplier Lens Technology to run its Apple operations entirely on renewable energy by 2018, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Lens, a company based in central China’s Hunan Province, produces cover glass, home buttons and cameras for Apple, and consumes about 500 million kilowatt hours per year, Lens CEO Zhou Qunfei said, adding that to fulfill the commitment, Lens will continue to build solar panels and purchase wind power from local companies. Lens is the first supplier to make a clean energy commitment for all of its Apple production, which will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by nearly 450,000 metric tons per year, equivalent to the energy use of 380,000 Chinese homes, Jackson said. Apple, which has 346 suppliers in China, has committed to partnering with Chinese suppliers to build more than two gigawatts of solar power projects by 2020, which will help cut 20 million metric tons of greenhouse gas pollution.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Andrea Peterson August 17 Follow @kansasalps (Washington Post illustration by Ben Kirchner) Cybersecurity is now a top national security problem — some officials even call it a bigger threat than terrorism. But both major presidential candidates have hit hurdles on the campaign trail that raised questions about how they would try to keep U.S. computers safe if elected. Just last month, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton escaped criminal prosecution for using a private email server for work as secretary of state — but got a tongue-lashing from the director of the FBI for being "extremely careless" by using it. Then emails from the Democratic National Committee were released by WikiLeaks, exposing politically embarrassing information. As that scandal unfolded, GOP candidate Donald Trump seemed to urge Russian government hackers to hack Clinton. Although he played down his comments as sarcastic, the idea of a presidential candidate inviting a foreign power to hack a U.S. citizen raised flags for some. Trump's remarks also put a microscope on his apparently cozy relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin — whose government many say was behind the Democratic National Committee hack. How seriously should voters take those high-tech hiccups? And what will a Clinton or Trump victory mean for the United States' ability to fend off the rising tide of digital attacks? To answer those questions, The Washington Post reached out to cybersecurity policy experts, including academics, think-tankers and officials from previous Republican and Democratic administrations and asked them evaluate both candidates' cybersecurity policy strategies and whether they were more concerned about Clinton's private email server or Trump's hacking comments. Here's what they said: Gen. Michael Hayden Former CIA and NSA director who worked in high-level posts during the Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama administrations. Now a principal at the Chertoff Group.  Hayden said he found Clinton's "email faux pas" and Trump's comments about Russian hackers "equally off-putting." However, he hadn't seen enough from either campaign to evaluate their overall cybersecurity strategies. One area he wanted to hear more about was how the candidates would act on the encryption debate if elected. During the debate between Apple and the FBI over the San Bernardino, Calif., phone, Clinton largely sidestepped the issue while Trump called for a boycott of Apple. "For the record, I shade toward Apple because I believe the private sector will be the main effort when it comes to cyberdefense," Hayden said. "The Trump answer was vintage … bold, clear and wrong," he said. Stewart Baker Former NSA general council and Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary for policy during the George W. Bush administration. Currently a partner at law firm Steptoe & Johnson.  "Hillary Clinton’s use of a home-brew email server with laughably bad security was appalling and irresponsible," Baker said. "It looks as though she was more afraid of Republicans and prosecutors than of Russian and Chinese intelligence agencies." He thought Trump was joking when he made the Russian hacker comment, "but it was a joke with a sharp point for Clinton because in fact the Russians probably had better access to those emails than the FBI; after all, Clinton’s lawyers had aggressively wiped the servers by the time the FBI got there." The claim that he was asking Russia to commit cyberespionage "is a symptom of the press’s Trump Derangement Syndrome," he said. Baker said the candidate's positions on cybersecurity mirror over campaign strategies: "Clinton’s position is cautious, incremental, sober and boring: a cybersecurity third term for President Obama. She is proposing nothing that President Obama hasn’t already proposed," he said. Trump's position, on the other hand is "impressionistic and focused on American decline," according to Baker. "He doesn’t like our current posture and might do something dramatic to change it. Whether he will, and what that might be, who knows?" On encryption, the two parties' official stances are "indistinguishable," he said — with both party platforms calling for a "balanced" solution. However, "Trump’s actual unfiltered statements are quite different from the massaged language of the GOP platform; on the whole he is more friendly to government and law and order and crime victims than to West Coast billionaires," Baker said. Susan Landau Former senior staff privacy adviser at Google and current professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Landau declined to weigh in on whether she was more concerned about Clinton's use of a private email server or Trump's Russian hackers comment. But she had plenty of thoughts about how to evaluate what we know about the candidates' cybersecurity strategies. "There are three different aspects to consider: the two candidates' views on cybersecurity initiatives, the party platforms and the issue of cryptography policy," she said. "Cyber is a hard problem," involving economic, technical and policy issues, she said, and "on this count, Clinton certainly has the advantage: she understands complex negotiations with many moving parts." But Trump's response to David Sanger in a New York Times interview earlier this year — in which he claimed that the United States was way behind on cybersecurity — seemed to show Trump was unaware of things like the Stuxnet attack, a cyberattack on Iranian nuclear facilities thought to be the work of the United States and Israel, she said. Neither candidate has laid out too much of a cybersecurity plan so far, she said, nor did party platforms weigh in on the encryption debate. But Trump's response to the Apple-FBI legal battle — calling for a boycott of Apple — wasn't a good sign, according to Landau. "By providing a more secure system for online access, Apple's secured phone is an excellent step in the right direction for cybersecurity, something that candidate Trump does not seem to grasp," she said. "I would say that the Clinton/Democratic proposals are a B/B-plus at present, while the Trump/Republican direction is a D/D-minus at best," Landau concluded. Peter Swire Former chief counselor for privacy in Office of Management and Budget during the Bill Clinton administration. Now a law professor at Georgia Tech.  Swire's response focused more on Trump's comments than Clinton's email server situation. “Urging a Russian attack is directly contrary to his party’s platform, which says 'an attack will not be tolerated,'" he said. Although neither Trump nor Clinton are tech experts themselves, Clinton helped greatly expand the State Department's cybersecurity portfolio when she was secretary of state "and that continues today," he said. “There is no magical solution for cybersecurity, no matter who is president," Swire added. "Instead, it takes funding, persistence and building a large team that can defend against a world full of threats. Based on the conventions if nothing else, Clinton builds and leads that sort of team far more than Trump.” Paul Rosenzweig DHS assistant secretary for policy during the George W. Bush administration. Current Principal at Red Branch Consulting.  "Secretary Clinton is really offering us more of the same — it's the Obama policy continued forward and improved," Rosenzweig said. "I would say that I would not expect Secretary Clinton to have any grand new initiatives, although circumstances might drive something new. To some degree that's a little disappointing because I think we've reached a bit of a stasis point: We're playing a lot of defense and we don't have too much offensive strategy," he continued. But when it comes to Trump, Rosenzweig said he has "no real idea what he would do." When it came to the Clinton email scandal vs. Trump's Russian hacker comments, he seemed more focused on the comments. "[Trump] says we have to get more aggressive, but then he perhaps jokingly invites information operations against his own country. I don't know what to make of it," Rosenzweig said. "I suspect his policy would come with a blind spot to Russian adventurism that would be disadvantageous to American interests," he added. "My hope would be that [cybersecurity] would be one of the areas where [Trump] wouldn't be paying too much attention" and instead bring in experts to guide policy, he said. "That would probably be more of the same as well, although there might be some evolution because he'd be willing to let people break more china — the dishes, not actual China," Rosenzweig said. But Rosenzweig also said there wasn't a lot to go on to judge Trump's strategy. "There's no information out there or theory that underlies his foreign policy. If I had a sense of what he was doing in the physical world, I could probably extrapolate to the digital world, but there's really nothing there," he said. Julian Sanchez Senior fellow focused on technology and civil liberties at the Cato Institute. Sanchez said both Clinton's email server situation and Trump's Russian hacker comments were "pretty bad, but probably somewhat overblown." "Even on the charitable premise that Trump was attempting to make a joke, it’s obviously irresponsible for a major party presidential candidate to signal winking approval of foreign cyberattacks on the opposing party, because even the act of joking about it suggests you’re not terribly serious about imposing costs on Russia if it continues its current conduct," he said. On Clinton's email, Sanchez was more concerned about transparency than national security implications. "I don’t think anyone buys the idea that she set up a private server for 'convenience' rather than to retain control over correspondence legally subject to Freedom of Information requests," he said. When it comes to overall cybersecurity strategy, Sanchez says it's hard to judge Trump "because he doesn’t appear to have one, unless welcoming Russian hacks counts. "Clinton, on the other hand, has made it "fairly clear that her approach to cyber would represent a continuation of the Obama administration’s Cybersecurity National Action Plan, with a focus on information sharing with the private sector and an integrated approach across federal networks under the stewardship of a federal chief information security officer," he said. "As far as a comparison of the two goes, I suppose 'having a plan' beats 'not having one,'" Sanchez concluded. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

Since then over a thousand banks and credit unions have signed on and the service has expanded to the UK, Canada, Australia, Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, France, and Switzerland. Apple Pay lets you make purchases in supported stores using your iPhone or Apple Watch. Apple Pay can also be used to make purchases in supported apps on iPhone and iPad. Later this fall, Apple Pay will expand to purchases in apps on Apple Watch and on the web with Safari for iOS and macOS. Here’s how to setup Apple Pay if your bank is supported (full list): On the iPhone, just head to the Wallet app on iOS 9+ and tap the plus (+) icon in the top right corner to begin, then follow the prompts. To add a debit card to the Apple Watch, go to the Apple Watch app on iPhone and look for the Wallet & Apple Pay section, then Add Credit or Debit Card section. iPads with Touch ID can use Apple Pay in apps; go to Settings then Wallet & Apple Pay to add your card there. If you’re looking for places to test out Apple Pay, Exxon Mobile added support for buying gas with Apple Pay through its SpeedPass+ app earlier this year. Stores like the Apple Store, Best Buy, Whole Foods, and Walgreens all accept Apple Pay as payment at checkout, and McDonalds, Subway, and many restaurants through OpenTable accept Apple Pay payments as well. Several Starbucks locations across the country have recently switched to Apple Pay terminals after testing the feature in select locations last year. Apple also has a list of official partners here, and anywhere with the contactless payment logo at checkout should accept Apple Pay. Some stubborn retailers like CVS are still resisting Apple Pay in favor of their own solution despite having upgraded terminals, and Walmart has rolled out its own alternative while avoiding NFC terminal expenses. Apple Pay works with the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, Apple Watch, iPad mini 4, iPad Air 2, and both iPad Pro models. The new iPhone SE also features Apple Pay.

Breaking News Day at a glance Weather Horoscopes Ireland Business World Showbiz #Discover Sport Tech Jobs Property Login Latest News Horoscopes Lotto Has Cash Money signed a deal with Apple Music? PreviousNext 17/08/2016 - 14:32:30Back to Showbiz Home Birdman’s latest “power move” appears to be signing a deal with Apple Music – something that could prove very costly for the streaming service’s competitors. According to Music Business Worldwide the Cash Money co-founder has struck a deal for his entire label, which includes artists Drake, Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, the Young Money roster and Birdman himself, with a source suggesting the agreement will see Apple air an exclusive documentary on Birdman and Cash Money. Things get really interesting when you consider Lil Wayne is supposed to be a shareholder in Tidal – the service which received his album exclusively last year – especially considering the tension between Birdman and his “son” Wayne. Drake meanwhile signed a deal with Apple Music last year, giving the service exclusivity over Views for two weeks, and the deal could mean more of the same for the rest of Cash Money’s artists. The man in the Instagram picture with Birdman is Larry Jackson, Apple Music’s head of original content, who since leaving Interscope has been a key player in Apple’s growing music empire. We won’t know for sure what the deal means until the next big Cash Money release, but Birdman hasn’t amassed his fortune without an astute business mind, so whatever it is will be big.

This unprecedented commitment, combined with zero waste compliance from all final assembly sites, furthers Apple’s efforts to help manufacturers lower their carbon footprint and reduce waste in China, helping to advance China’s transition to a new green economy. Lens Technology has committed to power all of its glass production for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by the end of 2018, as part of Apple’s industry-leading supply chain clean energy program announced last year. Lens is the first supplier to make a clean energy commitment for all of its Apple production, and will meet its goal through an unprecedented power purchase agreement with local wind projects. Apple is working with suppliers to help transform the environmental landscape in China, and is proud to announce all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The UL standard certifies all of their manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or, when necessary, converted into energy. Since the program began in January 2015, the sites have diverted more than 140,000 metric tons of waste from landfills. “We want to show the world that you can manufacture responsibly and we’re working alongside our suppliers to help them lower their environmental impact in China,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, in a statement. “We congratulate Lens for their bold step, and hope by sharing the lessons we’ve learned in our transition to renewable energy, our suppliers will continue to access clean power projects, moving China closer to its green manufacturing goals.” “Our power purchase agreement is the first of its kind in southern China and we hope it will serve as an example for other companies looking to transition to cleaner, more economical sources of power,” said Lens CEO Zhou Qunfei, in a statement. “We’re pleased to be the first supplier to commit to covering all of our Apple production with renewable energy, and proud to source from local Hunan wind farms to power our facilities in Changsha.” Lens’ manufacturing with Apple currently includes two facilities in Changsha, Hunan province. Wind energy will cover 100 percent of the energy consumed producing Apple products at Lens facilities by 2018, avoiding nearly 450,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, equivalent to the energy use in 380,000 Chinese homes. Through its clean energy program, Apple will partner with suppliers in China to install more than 2 gigawatts of new clean energy in the coming years, avoiding over 20 million metric tons of greenhouse gas pollution in the country between now and 2020. Foxconn committed in October to construct 400 megawatts of solar, starting in Henan province, by 2018. The manufacturer is now well on its way to constructing the first 80 megawatts of that commitment. Earlier this year, Foxconn final assembly sites at Guanlan and Taiyuan were the first in China to receive UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill validation. With the recent addition of 12 manufacturing sites, all of Apple’s final assembly production in China is now zero waste compliant. “We applaud innovative companies, like Apple, that are leading by actively reducing the environmental impact of manufacturing operations,” said UL president and CEO Keith Williams, in a statement. “Achieving zero waste is an extensive effort that requires close coordination across all facets of a company’s operations, especially when the commitment is global.” Apple has taken significant steps to protect the environment by transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy. Today, the company is powering 100 percent of its operations in China and the US, and more than 93 percent of its worldwide operations, with renewable energy.

Folks may remember the ozone hole issue years ago, caused by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Everyone was into reduce the amounts of CFCs into atmosphere. Well that’s all fine and dandy but the beauty of that model is that 99% of chlorine compounds put into the atmosphere are done so by human activity. I was quite involved with this at the time and listening to these experts go on and on for quite some time on all the processes to essentially reduce the chlorine in the atmosphere I (on behalf of the group I represented) asked what was going to be done to remove the chlorine already in the atmosphere. The silence of the crowd, not even the crickets were chirping. Giving time for the pause to sink in, indicative as that concept had never ever even entered their minds I continued with an analogy. The guy goes to a doctor cause he’s sick. Turns out he’s getting poisoned by 50 darts a day. The proposal is to reduce the amount of darts to 10 and to do nothing about removing the poison in the system. My boss at the time was so pleased and amazed at how I used to just stump these brilliant minds into silence. Even to this day human beings have no major input whatsoever removing chlorine from the atmosphere. Reducing toxic compounds that’s fine but the big silent issue with pollution, is removing/transforming those toxic compounds. Humans are the only creature I am aware of that produces toxic compounds that are toxic not only to itself but to all other living creatures. Something to think about, maybe. iGads Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - 4:34 pm · Reply And Green Peace is…….silent, go figure.

Just three short months ago, Apple was plunging to the $89 level. The negative media press was talking non-stop about the demise of Apple, slower iPhone sales, problems in China, etc. In fact, Apple was taking a nice percentage off the Dow and signaling to many the beginning of a possible new market downturn. While some were panicking, Warren Buffett was taking a nice position in Apple.” “We all know that he likes to buy and hold forever, not caring about the day-to-day movements in the market,” DiMauro writes. “Investors would be wise to buy Apple on weakness and hold for a nice run to $150 or higher.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Note: Apple’s all-time high was set during intraday trading on February 24, 2015 at $133.60 per share.

But do you think that would have happened if Warren Buffett didn’t want it ti? Xennex1170 Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - 5:38 pm · Reply It could happen if he simply trusted his managers and didn’t have strong feelings one way or the other. Road Warrior Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - 11:39 am · Reply Oh MDN you are making me drool posting that up. I can’t believe that we might see $130 a share say in the next year and one of those “Apple stock hits new high” headline I’m sure you are keeping ready. When Tim Cook took over as CEO I was realistic, looking at being happy if Apple went to 10-50 dollars a share but he’s really kept the price relatively up there, another testimony to his leadership, because believe me there are a lot of other wannabe CEO’s that would have driven the stock to 10-50 dollars a share. iStepchild Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - 11:45 am · Reply With all the years of Buffet being asked about AAPL shares, and his refusal to get into Apple and tech in general, I guarantee Buffet had knowledge of Berkshire Hathaway purchasing any AAPL shares. Apple now fits a great category of still possibly being a growth stock and also a long term dividend stock…a nice problem to have and a nice place to be in where few can live. TheRealHigh Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - 12:51 pm · Reply Erroneous. All-time high was $134.54 at open on 4/27/15. wun1337 Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - 9:30 pm · Reply If Warren Buffet is getting in on Apple then it isn’t because it is a tech stock in the old sense of the term. Apple Inc signalled this when they dropped the Computer moniker from their name. It’s an energy company, a services company, a consumer electronics company, a B&M retailer with one of the highest profit per sq. ft. Yup, it’s no longer only a computer company. Get on its stock while it’s cheap. And enjoy for the long haul. Add Your Feedback Name (required) Email (required) Web cancel reply Notify me of new comments via email.

The time has come for students across the UK to return to, or begin, university. And, not wanting to miss out on the vast amounts of cash that will be spent in the run-up to the start of term, Apple has a decent student discount scheme you should definitely be taking advantage of. In fact, the scheme also applies to lecturers, teachers and even parents, so if you've got a hellish first term full of rowdy freshers to face this autumn, or want to help your kids get kitted out, you can at least take the sting out of it. With discounts across its product range, Apple's Education Offer is well worth keeping in mind when looking for a new device to accompany you on your uni adventures. But how does it work? Read on for a full explanation. Related: Best student laptops Apple Student Discount – What is it and how does it work? Apple has an entire store dedicated to its discounted products for those in education, and it's full of great products. If you're in the market for a new laptop, Apple's range of MacBooks, MacBook Airs, and MacBook Pros are certainly worth checking out. There are also desktop alternatives in the form of iMacs. Or perhaps you're looking for a new tablet? The iPad range is made up of similarly spectacular offerings. We're not sure you could justify a new iPhone, Apple TV or Apple Watch to your parents, though – which is probably why the education offer doesn't apply to those products. However, Apple did just announce that the Apple Upgrade Program is coming to the UK. This could be a great opportunity for student's who want to get the latest iPhone every year. Related: Apple Upgrade Program UK So how do you go about getting that all-important discount? First, you'll need to make sure you're either an employee of an education institution, a post-secondary education student, or the parent of a post-secondary education student. To start taking advantage of Apple's generosity, you'll need a UNiDAYS account or a letter of acceptance from your university. Employees should have some form of ID that proves they're employed by the institution in question. Then head over to the company's education store and log in with your UNiDAYS account. This will allow you to see the discounted prices online. Related: Amazon student discount explained If you don't have a UNiDAYS account, you can register through one of the verification sites Apple uses, such as Student Beans. You'll then get access to the education store via whichever site you use to verify your student status. Alternatively, you can call Apple directly and verify yourself using an acceptance letter or ID. The number is 0800 048 0408. And finally, there is the option to go to a bricks-and-mortar store, taking the relevant ID or letter with you. Apple even lets parents of students access the discount, even if their child isn’t with them, as long as they have the proof. Apple Student Discount – How much can I save? How much will you get off Apple's range of notoriously pricey machines? Discounted prices are applied across the range, but there's no set percentage, so you won't get a flat 15% off all the devices in the store. Instead, products are discounted at different rates, meaning it's worth taking a look around before you decide what to buy. And it seems Apple's generosity knows no bounds, as the company has also decided to give away a free pair of Beats by Dre headphones with all eligible purchases of a Mac, iPad or iPhone from June 15 to September 5. Apple Student Discount – Apple Music Not to be outdone by rivals Spotify, Apple is also offering a discount on its Apple Music streaming service. If you're in full-time education, you can get a whopping 50% off the price of a subscription – plus you get the usual first three months free. Related: Best cheap laptop deals This could be you! Student subscriptions to Apple Music are currently available in Australia, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. In the UK, the half-price discount brings the monthly cost down to £4.99, from £9.99. Again, you'll need a UNiDAYS account to validate your student status, but it's a fairly simple process. Just head over to the Apple Music site's Student page and follow the instructions to take advantage of the offer. If you're using Apple Music on a mobile device, you can also just tap 'Are you a University Student?' to begin the verification process. Watch: Tablets vs laptops – Which should you buy?

What does that mean for the tech giant? Travis Hoium (TMFFlushDraw) Aug 17, 2016 at 8:07AM Image source: Getty Images. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is now officially an energy company. As a result, it can sell energy into the wholesale market, just like any other independent power producer. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) was really the first tech company to be approved as an independent power producer, but Apple may have bigger ambitions than just developing solar for its data centers. It may eventually become an energy hub itself.   The possibilities for HomeKit in energy If you look at how HomeKit is being positioned by Apple, it's going to be the brains behind everything in your house. Lights, heating, cooling, washer, dryer, dishwasher, and even your security system connect to HomeKit. It knows when you're home and what your preferences are on a daily basis. For homes with solar energy and battery energy storage, why wouldn't Apple control those devices as well? As companies like Telsa Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA), SonnenBatterie, and Sunverge start to launch energy storage businesses, they need to figure out how they're going to control batteries and supply energy to the grid when it's profitable. Revenue sources like offsetting demand charges or performing arbitrage between times of high prices and low prices are both possibilities for generating revenue from a battery. But the greater value may be in aggregating thousands of batteries or EVs together to act as one to supply a service utilities are willing to pay for. Aggregating hundreds (or thousands) of battery systems could allow utilities to lower energy production when it's most expensive, or delay investing in new power plants and transmission lines. If Apple can aggregate the batteries and demand devices of thousands of homes across the country, it could provide valuable benefits to the grid as well as HomeKit users.  Could Apple bring rooftop solar energy to the wholesale market? Image source: Getty Images. What if Apple borrowed a business model from the App Store? One thing that's not yet clear in energy storage is how consumers will be compensated for having energy storage in their homes. If you install a Tesla Powerwall...now what?  If customers see reduced bills, the "revenue" could really be in the form of an expense reduction, like it is with solar energy. But if an aggregate of batteries supply a service to the utility that generates real revenue, the aggregator will likely share the revenue with the homeowner somehow. What if Apple instituted the 70/30 split it uses with homeowners in revenue generated from HomeKit? The company already has approval to supply power in the wholesale market to utilities, it has a payment system and millions of consumers' financial data on file, and it has the platform to control assets as well. Apple could become the power company of the future, if it wanted to. What is Apple's vision for the energy future? We don't know if Apple got approval to be a wholesale power producer because it wants to maximize the value of its own energy assets, or if there's a bigger goal in mind. But don't count out the possibility that Apple could be building an energy platform that would bring together consumers, innovative companies, and utilities. Few companies have the reach to make that happen, but Apple can. What we do know is that HomeKit's potential is just starting to show itself to consumers and app developers. And someone will figure out a way to use its capabilities to advance energy to another level. Why not Apple?

However, I caved and spent the $5 and purchased a Happy Meal specifically for the Step-it activity tracker. Unfortunately, the wearable is not worth it, both in terms of time and health. I must preface this that I have two small children, a boy who’s six and a 2-year old girl, who are right in McDonald’s demographics for the coveted Happy Meal. “Physical activity is important to everyone of all ages. We very much support children’s well-being… Step-it is in line with McDonald’s general philosophy for Happy Meal toys, which is to make toys that encourage either physical or imagination-based play,” said McDonald’s Canada senior marketing manager Michelle McIlmoyle in a statement we published in an earlier article about the wearable. I love the idea of Step-it and getting kids moving. It’s a smart marketing idea and gets kids excited, which is progressive for the fast food chain. However, in this case, you really do get what you pay for. Step-it comes in six colour options: pink, yellow, blue, orange, green and red. I ended up with the orange version. The wearable is made from plastic and is square in design and the band has three loop holes for different wrist sizing. On the front of the Step-it is a digital display with a square power button. On both sides of the power button is a person kicking a ball and playing a racquet sport. The device’s power button doesn’t turn on or off the device as it actually has an ‘Always-on’ display. This button resets the Step-it counter, which does a horrible job at counting steps. It’s terribly inaccurate, but again, it’s a toy and you get what you pay for. In addition, I tried to take apart the wearable to see what battery it takes, but couldn’t pry it open. So, at this point, we cannot give a comprehensive battery life test but it does utilize a standard watch battery. As a parent, this is not the activity tracker I would want to introduce to my child. First impressions are important at any age and if a bad experience happens, getting kids to hop back on the activity band trend will be tough. Unorthodox The experience would have been much better should you have chosen their Mustard Sauce. J-Ro This is where I have to disagree with you. Sweet and Sour all the way. Anthony Roberts Yuppers 🙂 Gohy What?!? (Mc)Chicken sauce is the only way to go! Brad Fortin Or no sauce at all, although I could be the outlier on this. Bobylev The Blade The batteries on these units are bruning kids arms. GG McDicks! Jeffrey Michaud Slow news day eh? Bill Patrick Hahaha! ^ Anton Bruckner Must be hard up for news eh Ian? This is a $5 toy and you actually think it’s worth coverage on a serious tech site? Pfft Nikesh Patel Yes. Cell phones are such serious devices for serious business. Now, let me show you how smooth my angry birds fly through the air. hardy83 Pffft! I’m reading an article then criticizing it. I’m important! Unorthodox C’mon man, it’s just a spoof, it’s funny. Unboxing a Happy Meal… TheTechSmith It’s a wearable, and of interest to those who have both wearables and kids. I enjoyed the article. Sally Mae Well they do review Chokeburry… Nikesh Patel I think it’s a good start. It looks like it comes with some sort of game to go along with the watch. Wonder what the evolution of this would be 10 years from now! Schultzter If your son had written this article it would probably have been much more positive (and he would have had the fries, the honey sauce, more ketchup, and used Comic Sans font). The batteries will probably last longer than your kid’s attention span, and the tracker will be lost/forgotten long before they run out. And the kids will probably get a kick out of having a “smart watch” like their parent’s have and don’t really care about the accuracy of the counter or the button’s symbols. You might, but your kids don’t. MobileSyrup.com I think that’s valid. I’ll give it to him and film it as he’s just learning to write full sentences. Knowing him, he’ll take a hammer to it and try to break it 🙂 — Ian KID ANDROID But the important thing is will it get updates lol jk Ill wait for the second generation, hopefully it will be round lol.jk Jackie DeSousa Taking your kids to McDonalds should be considered child abuse. To write about a Toy that comes in a Happy meal is comical. Stimulator What specifically is abusive about it? Jackie DeSousa Unhealthy and addictive Stimulator It’s just food. It’s no more addictive than food I’ve cooked at home. Maybe the appeal of it being quick and easy is addictive to those who don’t feel like spending the time preparing a meal, but the food is not to blame. Also, you can’t make a blanket statement of everything they serve as being unhealthy. Happy Meals specifically have the option of coming with apple slices and milk instead of fries and a soft drink, and they always include yogurt. Somehow apples, milk, and yogurt are unhealthy? Azreik Child abuse? Hahahahaha no your comment is comical. Go outside and play now. Jackie DeSousa I was kidding you pathetic soul. Go outside and play in the traffic. Rev0lver Yeah. I’m sure you were kidding… Azreik My feelings! Jesus McDongswoggle Every parent who thinks this toy or McDonald’s is the most horrible thing ever needs their heads examined. YOU take the kids there and YOU buy the food – or not, it’s your choice. I wish I could blame all my problems on something else too but I know better and accept responsibility for my actions. Society is going to hell in a McNuggets 4-pack container 😉 fruvous I don’t get it… if you couldn’t pry it open to see what kind of battery it takes, how can you say it used a standard watch battery? Waldo Lost “getting kids to hop back on the activity band trend will be tough.” So, avoiding an adult trending gimmick is a bad thing? Nicolas Racine You are aware that it’s a toy given away in a kid’s meal? Besides the fact that it is a little ridiculus to judge it by the same standards as a regular performance device, I think you missed a few points: – It actually is a good thing that you cannot opit to get at the battery. It’s a kid’s toy! You don’t want you kid to open it up and swallow the battery. – Children do not care about device performance. They only care that they are able to do just like mom and dad. Give them the toy, and bring them you you on walks or runs. that will build a habit of good health and exercice. They’ll get the gadget (or adult toys) habit by themselves when they’re old enough.

WiseApp, a domestic consultancy, said Wednesday that the number of Apple Music users last week amounted to about 60,000, or 0.24 percent of the Korean customer base of 24.6 million. Local players dominated the market as MelOn topped the podium with 2.91 million followed by Genie with 960,000 and Naver Music with 660,000. Apple ranked ninth. This compares to its global success on the strength of exclusive content and unique ad campaigns ― following its official June 2015 launch, the on-demand service attracted more than 15 million subscribers across the world in a year. Steve Jobs, the late Apple founder, was known to dislike subscription-based music offerings, but after his death the U.S. company pursued such offerings. That was also the case for some features of the iPhone. Apple came up with a stylus, which Steve Jobs outspokenly hated, and sold large-screen phones like the 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch iPhone, which were repeatedly mocked by the former CEO ― he believed that smartphones should match the ergonomics of people's hands. "Thanks to its global reputation, many expected Apple Music to make a dent in the local market as the iPhone did," said a Seoul-based analyst. "But thus far, the service has failed to make its presence felt probably due to a lack of music content in a market ruled by a handful of homegrown players. Let's see whether Apple Music would be able to harness the late-mover advantage by securing proper content in a battle with established competitors." Apple chalked up a sensational success after it brought the iPhone here in 1999, years after its global debut. But its growth trailed off while its after-sales services generated consumer complaints. In particular, its refurbished phone policy raised the ire of iPhone users, which prompted lawmakers to raise the issue during last year's Assembly session. The late-mover advantage typically takes place when latecomers learn from pioneers' mistakes in deciding the time to enter the market and judging consumer tastes. Unlike the conventional wisdom that only innovation-powered first survivors will take the lion's share, the most successful global brands including Google and Gillette were not first on the scene in their respective businesses. Koreans can enjoy a three-month free trial of Apple Music. After that they will have the option to pay $7.99 a month for an individual plan or $11.99 for a family plan of up to six members.

The South Korean giant is pre-empting arch rival Apple, which is widely expected to launch a new version of the Apple Watch later this year. Invitations went out to selected media for a Samsung event at the IFA trade show in Berlin on Wednesday, August 31. The invitation (pictured above) leaves little to the imagination, thanks to the "Talk about 3" caption and an image of a round clock face. Last year's Samsung Galaxy S2 won plenty of praise thanks to its round clock face and clever navigation system, which lets you navigate menus by rotating the bezel.

Waste products are instead recycled, re-used, composted or burned to generate energy. Typically, paper and cardboard are sent to paper mills for recycling, glass & metal is melted for re-use, plastic is recycled into packaging materials and food is composted … The company has also said that one of its major glass suppliers in China, Lens Technology, has committed to run all its Apple operations on 100% renewable energy, though not immediately – the deadline for compliance is the end of 2018. Wind power will be used, saving almost 450k metric tons of CO2, equivalent to the energy used by 380k Chinese homes. “We want to show the world that you can manufacture responsibly and we’re working alongside our suppliers to help them lower their environmental impact in China,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives. “We congratulate Lens for their bold step, and hope by sharing the lessons we’ve learned in our transition to renewable energy, our suppliers will continue to access clean power projects, moving China closer to its green manufacturing goals.” Apple last year last year announced a number of new programs designed to help its Chinese suppliers to become carbon neutral, recently congratulating chip supplier TSMC on doubling its use of renewable energy this year.

The company is said to be taking over the flagship premises occupied by fashion company Esprit … The store occupies three floors. Esprit is said to have struggled to compete with lower-cost brands, and is currently restructuring the company. As derStandard learned from real estate brokers circles, the US computer and iPhone maker Apple is soon to move in a big way in the Kärntner Straße. There has long been speculation that Apple would open a retail store in the Austrian capital, home to almost a third of the country’s population. derStandard reports that previous rumors of a store in Graben came to nothing, but says that contracts here are ‘largely finalized.’ Vienna has consistently ranked highly in quality of life surveys, known as both the ‘city of dreams’ after the work of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, born in the city, and the ‘city of music’ thanks to having been home to Strauss I, Strauss II, Schubert, Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, von Suppé, Mahler and Brahms. Apple’s most recent retail store opening, just yesterday, was at the World Trade Center.

 The Chinese answer to Apple is falling apart Rob Price Aug. 16, 2016, 5:37 AM 99,245 facebook linkedin twitter email print Lei Jun, the chairman and CEO of Xiaomi Technology and the chairman of Kingsoft Corp., seen before the 2nd plenary session of the National People's Congress on March 9 in Beijing. Etienne Oliveau/Getty Images The "Apple of China" is in serious trouble. Sales in China of smartphones from Xiaomi, a once red-hot Chinese hardware startup touted as the country's answer to Apple, fell by a whopping 38% in the second quarter of 2016 year-on-year, according to new data from the research firm IDC. Xiaomi did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Xiaomi's phones are not yet available in Western markets, but the company has developed a buzzy reputation in the tech press. The company launched in 2010, and it enjoyed meteoric growth: By the end of 2014 it was the world's most valuable technology startup, with a private valuation of more than $46 billion. (It has since been dethroned of that title by Uber.) Specialising in cheap, high-quality smartphones, it had grown off the back of an unusually passionate fan base, which it was careful to cultivate. It liberally borrowed from Apple's playbook, including charismatic CEO keynote speeches. There is also a booming market in China for smartphones. The company set an ambitious target for 2015: Sell 100 million smartphones. But by July, as sales began to slow, it started to become clear that it just wouldn't happen. It ultimately sold "over 70 million," according to a company representative. Some of Xiaomi's phones are very similar to Apple's, and Apple design guru Jony Ive has even accused the company of "theft," a charge it denies. REUTERS/Jason Lee Earlier this year, Fortune reported that Xiaomi's revenue's barely grew in 2015. It pulled in 78 billion yuan, or $11.9 billion, for the year, up 5% on 74.3 billion yuan ($11.3 billion) in 2014 but well short of its 100-billion-yuan target for the year. The latest figures from IDC now suggest that Xiaomi isn't just standing still: It's actually in free fall. Xiaomi sold an estimated 10.5 million smartphones in China in the second quarter of this year, down from 17.1 million a year prior. That's a drop of 38.4%. At the same time, its rivals Oppo and Vivo have skyrocketed, enjoying year-on-year growth rates of 124.1% and 74.7%. IDC (Also interesting: Apple is struggling in China as well, with shipments down 31.7% year-on-year — selling 8.6 million devices last quarter, compared to 12.6 million in Q2 of 2015.) It’s worth noting that Xiaomi sells other products — as varied as water purifiers and hoverboards. But smartphones still make up the lion's share of the company's bottom line, with just 5% of its revenues in 2015 coming from other products, according to Fortune . So what's behind Xiaomi's implosion? A slowing in growth, at least, was inevitable. In previous years the company was perfectly positioned to take advantage of the rapid growth in China's smartphone market. This has now dropped off, though the Chinese market is still growing, 4.6% year-on-year in Q2. IDC points to a failure of marketing as the cause. Xiaomi previously spent very little on marketing and was proud of it, relying on word of mouth and user hype to spread word of its products. But this tactic is no longer viable as Vivo and Oppo are spending heavily, including using "brand ambassadors" to promote their smartphones. Without any concrete ways to differentiate its products, Xiaomi has been forced to follow suit. "In the past, Xiaomi started the trend of selling its phones online and other vendors soon followed suit and created their own online brand. After vendors witnessed OPPO's success with its R9, they also started riding on the trend of hiring celebrity endorsers to represent their brand and appeal more to the young crowd," IDC analyst Xiaohan Tay said. "Hiring celebrity endorsers may help increase numbers in the short term, but this alone may not be sufficient to drive numbers in the long run. As there is very little differentiation across products to warrant significant brand loyalty, vendors must constantly think out of the box to get people hyped up about their products." Xiaomi was once the head of the pack. Now it's playing catch-up — and losing.

Published in Graphics Intel cheers the USB Type-C by Nick Farrell on17 August 2016 Tweet font size decrease font size increase font size Print Email Backing Apple While users and the rest of the world think Apple’s move to kill off the headphone jack is a bad idea, Intel is cheering a general move to a more mobile  USB Type-C. Intel Developer Forum (IDF) heard Intel architects Rahman Ismail and Brad Saunders saying that a general move to USB Type-C for whatever reason is a good thing. Saunders think that consumers will get used to dedicated USB Type-C thanks to the advantages of the updated standard for USB C. He said that it will kill off the need for analogue to digital decoders letting manufacturers make them slimmer. It would also allow for more pristine sound, noise cancelling, and effects like extra base or "concert hall" reverb. He said that the revised spec also supports "granular" power management, letting the system shut off a microphone if you're just using your headphones for music, for instance. This will save on power. Chipzilla also showed off a new type of video standard that will be incorporated into USB Type-C which will not replace HDMI, is good enough to do productivity work or watch movies. Ismail said that it will work if you're using a hub to plug multiple devices into a single USB Type-C port. USB Type-C standard is more secure because it includes device authentication. Like all such standards, however, there will be multiple specifications, so your phone's USB Type-C port might not be as hot as the one on your laptop.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)'s new operating system appears to have replaced the gun emoji with a squirt gun. According to an op-ed by Jonathan Zittrain, which was published in the New York Times, this is a move that is making a lot of people unhappy. Apple's decision to remove the emoji gun could have been due to pressure from the #DisarmTheiPhone campaign which was overseen by a public relations firm working with New Yorkers Against Gun Violence. However, as noted by Zittrain, the campaign did not call on individuals to cease using the gun emoji — it called on Apple to "prevent, in one swoop, anyone from sending or receiving that cartoon image of a handgun." Related Link: Keep An Eye On Gun Stocks As FBI Gun Background Check Data Continues To Break Records There is one problem with Apple's decision to ban its own emoji gun. When an iPhone user sends the new water pistol emoji to an Android device, the water pistol will turn into the handgun emoji when it is received on the Android device. "When it comes to restrictions, technology companies should limit only speech that breaks clearly stated and openly applied rules, not deprive us of entire tools and means of expression," Zittrain, a professor of computer science and international law at Harvard University, wrote. Zittrain may have suggested that Apple is treading on thin ice. He noted that Apple is taking a stance against both the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms, and the First, which "guarantees freedom of speech, including speech about arms [emphasis omitted]." Zittrain added that Apple does have a right to "favor gun control as a matter of corporate policy," but the company does not have the right to be "tinkering with our right to express either that or a contrary view on worldwide platforms." "Apple, Microsoft, Google and other 'big tech' companies should not be placed in a position, which they themselves do not want, of having to decide which words or emojis do and don't represent their brand," he concluded.

Miller, 34, has relocated to the Big Apple – a city that she feels is more inspiring than London. “London feels cliquey and sometimes a little bit like swimming through mud,” she told the Daily Mail. “I feel like people come to New York to do something.

She called off her engagement to Marlowe’s father Tom Sturridge in July 2015. Miller’s sister, Savannah, posted a picture of her at JFK airport as she retrieved her hoard of luggage. Savannah captioned the shot: “It's official, she's a New Yorker.”   It's official, she's a New Yorker.  A photo posted by @savannahmiller on Aug 15, 2016 at 11:56am PDT   Miller recently revealed that she underwent a course of therapy to banish the "noise" in her head.

Solo climber sets new record conquering Yosemite's El Capitan Iran to US: honor nuclear deal, or else Xiaomi, once the undisputed leader in Chinese cell phones, has lost considerable market share and been overtaken by Huawei Technologies. By Lucy Schouten August 16, 2016 Save for later Saved An Xiaomi phone is held aloft by vice president of global operations Hugo Barra after a presentation in San Francisco, Thursday, Feb. 12, 2015. Jeff Chiu/AP View Caption About video ads View Caption of The Chinese company Xiaomi is quickly losing its once-undisputed prowess in China's highly competitive smartphone market.  A successful launch, charismatic style, and passionate fan base gave the smartphone maker a reputation as "the Apple of China," but competitors have now taken several bites from the company's market share. Although its hardware is not available in the United States, the meteoric rise and fall of Xiaomi illustrates the swiftly changing tech potential in China, a competitive market where Apple itself is struggling to keep up.  Recommended: 40 iPhone tips and tricks everyone should know Xiaomi was the world's most valuable tech startup in 2014, valued at $1.1 billion after just four years. The company marketed its app and additional services by selling high-quality smartphones at "rock-bottom prices," The Wall Street Journal reported. 40 iPhone tips and tricks everyone should know Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/22 Analysts saw Xiaomi as China's decisive answer to Apple , which had stumbled upon entry to the Asian country, and the company aimed to sell 100 million phones in 2015, Rob Price reported for Business Insider. But Xiaomi's lack of marketing – the company disdained paid advertising in favor of word-of-mouth sharing, an energetically loyal fan base, and news-making speeches by the top executive – cut into the now-saturated market when Chinese competitors Oppo and Vivo made an aggressive entry, Bloomberg reported. The company shipped 10.5 million phones during its second quarter this year, compared to 17.1 million in 2015, Bloomberg reported, falling 38 percent. “The success of Huawei , OPPO, and vivo in the market can be attributed to their concerted effort to build their brand and aggressive marketing to attract the consumers, along with the focus on product differentiation,” Xiaohan Tay, senior market analyst for the research firm International Data Corporation (IDC) said in a press release announcing the sales fall. The rapid changes in the top three of such a large market suggests smartphone makers must work harder to differentiate and stay ahead in China.  "The Chinese market, the world’s biggest, has grown increasingly competitive as domestic manufacturers have improved their quality, design and marketing, putting pressure on global leaders Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Apple saw shipments in China drop 32 percent in the second quarter and the iPhone maker fell to fifth in the market, according to IDC," Peter Elstrom wrote for Bloomberg.  Chinese state media reported Tuesday that Apple plans to open an “independent” research and development center in China, according to The Wall Street Journal. Although the company has provided no details as yet, it could be a response to Apple's difficulty with both China's market and its regulations, as the company lost two lawsuits, including a trademark infringement case. Some of its services were shut down after the company refused to share its source code with Chinese authorities.  The US company may have additional challenges, but Apple and Xiaomi are competitors up against a similar, challenging market.  “The iPhones lack features such as waterproofing and wireless charging. Apple needs to catch up with the competition if it wants to compete,” Canalys research analyst Jessie Ding wrote, according to Bloomberg.  Next up 40 iPhone tips and tricks everyone should know What Tim Cook says about Apple's future Saving Money How to sell your old phone Print/Reprints About these ads Sponsored Content by LockerDome About these ads Monitor's Best: Top 5 Why Hillary Clinton lost the white women's vote For jihadists, Trump election brings a change in strategy As US pulls back from Pacific trade deal, countries look to China As Trump's AG, how might Sessions crack down on recreational marijuana?

The company is now on top of the Chinese smartphone market, followed by OPPO and Vivo. OPPO shipped 18 million units in the second quarter for a 16.2 percent market share, while Vivo shipped 14.7 million units for a 13.2 percent market share. OPPO posted the best year-over-year growth among the top 5 companies in the Chinese smartphone market at 124.1 percent, with Vivo recording the second-best growth at 74.7 percent. Xiaomi, meanwhile, saw shipment volumes tumble by 38.4 percent to 10.5 million units, dropping its market share to 9.5 percent. In the same quarter of 2015, Xiaomi was the market leader with a 16.1 percent market share and 17.1 million units shipped. Apple likewise struggled with a 31.7 percent drop in sales to 8.6 million units, dragging down its market share to 7.8 percent. In the second quarter last year, Apple held an 11.9 percent market share. Xiaomi, however, has disputed IDC's figures, referring to data released by other research companies. According to IHS, Xiaomi shipped 14.2 million units in the second quarter, while Strategy Analytics pegged the company's sales at 12.8 million units. Nevertheless, with these numbers, Xiaomi would still be at the fourth spot if the other IDC figures were taken into account. According to IDC, OPPO and Vivo were able to post massive shipment volume increases because of the strength of the companies' offline channels. For Tier 3 to Tier 5 cities, the companies were aggressive in their advertisements and shop placements, and for Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, they focused on sponsorships of programs in the entertainment industry to attract customers to their brands. All the Chinese companies registered an increase in their sales compared with the first quarter of the year, but Apple's shipment volumes continued to decline. The iPhone SE did not find success in China, as consumers mostly preferred smartphones with larger displays. The languishing sales in China have prompted Apple to look for other ways to boost revenues and increase its presence in the country. Apple CEO Tim Cook recently visited China and promised that an Asia-Pacific Research and Development Center will be established in the country before the end of 2016. Earlier in the year, Apple also made a $1 billion investment in Didi Chuxing, which recently acquired Uber's China operations.

There are some tangible things you can do to get on the road to having your own app. If you want to turn an app idea into a successful business, this article is for you. By David Gewirtz for DIY-IT | August 17, 2016 -- 11:27 GMT (04:27 PDT) | Topic: SMBs Image: File Congratulations! If you've found this article, you've found the key to all your dreams of success. That's right, by acting before midnight tonight, you, too can become an app billionaire simply by clicking your heels together three times and saying, "There's no place like..." Nope. I'm just kidding with you. Pulling your leg. Yanking your chain. Messing with your head. We're talking about software. You don't even need to be wearing shoes. You could, in fact, wind up a billionaire without ever putting on a tie or wearing lace-up shoes. It's just a matter of having the right idea, and the world is your oyster. DIY-IT Project: Software business crash course David Gewirtz was a director of the Software Entrepreneurs' Forum, an executive at Symantec, had the title of "Godfather" at Apple, and ran an award-winning tech company for 20 years. Now, he's here to help you start your own software business. Buckle up! Read More Can we be serious for a minute? Just having an idea is not enough. There are real opportunities in software development, but there are realities as well. In this article, I'm going to talk about both. It's going to have a tough love feel about it in some places, but I'll point you to great resources as well. About two years ago, I wrote an article called, "So you have an app idea and want to make a bajillion bucks." I thought it was going to be a simple reply to a reader's questions. It turned out to be the homing signal to everyone with an idea, a massive sense of entitlement, and a complete lack of experience. I can't begin to tell you how many letters I get that begin with "I have no money and no programming skills," make the claim to an idea that's "bigger than Facebook," and end with the demand that I either write the app for them, team up (for free, of course) and write the app for them, or hire someone for them so the app can get written. These folks had a fantasy that they could whisper an idea to someone and somehow, magically, become rich. The world doesn't work that way. In this article, I'll show you how get into the app business, but there are no guarantees. It's a very crowded market and there are a lot of other folks with the same dream. If you want to succeed in creating an app, you have to get past the idea that you're the anointed one with the golden special gifted-from-the-gods app idea, and that everything should drop into your lap automatically simply because you want it to. We all have ideas. There are a billion iPhone and another billion or so Android users out there. Do you really think you're the only one who came up with an idea like yours? The odds say, "No." I know, it hurts. The great science fiction writer Robert Heinlein coined an acronym, TANSTAAFL, that perfectly describes this: there ain't no such thing as a free lunch. Just having an idea isn't good enough. You have to do a lot more to succeed. Fortunately, success is possible if you're willing to do the work. With that, I'm now going to reveal the secret that will let you unleash your true potential for success in the app business. The secret: learn to program. If you work for a company with a budget to hire programmers, if you're an investor who has developed business plans and spent years funding software investments, or if you're a business professional with years of experience putting together teams, then you don't need to be a programmer. If you're one of those folks, you know the score and are busy proceeding with developing your plan, doing market testing, assembling a team, considering offshore development, and all the rest. If you're not a tech industry insider with years of experience, you're going to have to learn to program. That's the secret. Don't freak out. Learning to program is actually pretty achievable. The good news is that Apple and Google have gone to extreme lengths to set up systems that make the barrier of entry into their app marketplaces almost absurdly low. They want you to develop your app. They really, really do. After all, your success is their success, because they get a cut of every app they sell. Although neither Apple nor Google will give you a million dollars to turn your idea into reality, they have cleared a path for your success. But you have to meet them halfway there. You have to do some of the work. Apple and Google have created simplified program development environments, made tons of tutorials available, and made access to their customers astonishingly simple. You can join Apple or Google's development program for under a hundred bucks, create an app, and publish it to the world. That's right folks, for less than the cost of some Apple Watch bands (and not even the ludicrously expensive ones), you can set yourself up to build and sell apps. Pitfalls and traps to avoid Before I go into some of the really constructive things you can do to learn to program and build your own apps, some cautions are in order. If you are thinking about hiring developers, don't. Even the best programming managers, with years of experience wrangling teams of programmers, tend not to get projects done on time and on budget. You, with no experience? You're just a victim waiting to be stripped and gutted. Don't go there. Don't think you can save money by hiring someone in a third world country to do your work for you. Even at discounted rates, if you have an app idea and no experience, the surest way you can fail (and do so spectacularly) is to pay someone else to write your code. What's Hot on ZDNet #WeAreNotWaiting: Diabetics are hacking their health, because traditional systems have failed them Microsoft's SQL Server Next: What's under the covers The cloud price war continues: Amazon cuts its cloud storage prices, again VMware turns to sci-fi writers to explain virtualization If you're willing to learn to program, that's great. But avoid those 5-figure programming bootcamps. Some can be as costly as a traditional degree, but without the advantage of earning a universally accepted credential. You also don't need to go to a traditional college to learn programming if all you want is to develop an app. I respect the value of traditional education. But you don't need to go into debt for a decade and earn a college degree to develop an app or two. There are many readily available, comparatively inexpensive (or even free) alternatives. Keep your money and spend some time with YouTube. Learning to program isn't really that hard. Sure, it takes time, energy, dedication, and a willingness to put up with frustration. No one can remove that truth, or do that work for you. If you do the work, you will probably be able to put an app on the app store. Learning to program If you don't know how to program, there is an incredible selection of free resources out there. Watch some YouTube videos. Read some books. Download the development environments. Do some tinkering. Learn. So how long will all this take? That's like asking how long it takes to learn to play the guitar. Being able to make some music is very different than becoming the next Eddie Van Halen. There's a range of skill involved in any creative endeavor. But I'll tell you this. I've taught college-level programming classes on and off for the past two decades. I currently teach programming at the University of California. Nearly all my students become pretty good entry-level programmers in one semester, or about 16 weeks. Almost everyone gets his or her first program written in just a few weeks. You do not have to be in a college class to learn to program. The secret about learning to program is that it involves what education theorists call "constructivism," which is basically learning by doing. The only way anyone, whether in a college course, a programming bootcamp, or just watching YouTube videos, will learn to program is by actually writing programs. So do that. If you work on it intensely and use the tools Apple and Google provide, you could create your first app in just a few weeks. It won't be Facebook, of course. But it will be an app. There's no magic to this. It's hard work, like anything else. Once you're done programming, you'll have to do all the supporting activities, from describing it, to creating graphics, and so on. I've actually written a road map to all of this, from how to sign up to the development programs for iOS and Android to how to submit your first app. Dive in and follow the instructions and you'll be up and running. Anyone can publish an app. That's an amazing statement. Until the iOS and Google app stores existed, that availability and access to a global audience was impossible. But if you have a computer, some time, some discipline and patience, and are willing to work, you can get your app into an app store. Then, it will be up to the users whether or not it's a hit. But you'll have an app. And you might even make a few bucks. So that's the secret: work hard and do your own programming. Whether your dream of billions in easy money will ever come true, well, when you buy your first yacht, let me know. You can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.

The chipmaker has announced that it will be adding digital audio to the USB-C spec later this year, reports CNET, and that this will be ‘the right connector for audio’ … At the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco on Tuesday, Intel architects Brad Saunders and Rahman Ismail sketched out a coming USB audio standard that could help push the 3.5mm jack aside. The new specification, due this quarter, adds features to ensure a USB headphone doesn’t drain too much battery power and defines how buttons for pausing music or lowering volume work. The work “will really make USB Type-C the right connector for audio,” Saunders said. Intel is also adding a new video standard to USB-C, intended to replace HDMI for running standard apps and watching movies, but without offering the frame-rate needed for gaming. Finally, the updated spec will also add device authentication for improved security. Apple is of course no stranger to standing apart from other manufacturers in using its own connectors, having developed the 30-pin dock connector for the first iPod and used it for early iPhones and iPads before switching to the equally proprietary Lightning socket. But with the company seemingly standardizing on the USB-C connector for its MacBook range, it is something of a shame that it isn’t doing the same for iPhones. It seems unlikely that Apple will make the switch from Lightning to USB-C in iOS devices. The company attracted a great many complaints when it abandoned the 30-pin socket, with many having to replace sometimes-expensive accessories like speaker docks, so a second switch soon after pushing Lightning as an audio standard would seem a virtual impossibility from a PR perspective. All the same, Intel’s backing for digital audio is likely to lead to other manufacturers also abandoning the 3.5mm headphone socket, making Apple’s move seem less controversial over time. Motorola/Lenovo has already done so with the Moto Z, offering a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter, while audio companies are already offering USB-C headphones. Lightning headphones have of course already been available for some time.   Guides iPhone View THe Guide USB-C View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

The move completes the set for the company, which already sold Android devices, Blackberries and its own DL range of smartphones. Adding iPhones to its range has been on the cards for Digicel Bermuda for some time. Previously, CellOne was the only wireless carrier authorised to resell Apple devices in Bermuda, but that changed a few weeks ago after Digicel was given the green light from Apple to stock and sell iPhones. We always seek to listen to our customers and deliver what they want, said Julian Burton, commercial director. Clearly they have been keen on iPhones for some while, because we are a large entity across multiple different markets, the process of approvals with Apple to make sure that all of the different places that Digicel would carry its devices were up to speed just took that bit longer. Surveys carried out on behalf of the Regulatory Authority of Bermuda, the islands telecommunications watchdog, have shown a growing shift in customer preference for Android and Apple IOS devices. Its great to now have iPhones, said Mr Burton, who added that the company had worked hard to make sure that when the devices were made available they landed it with a bit of a bang, with plans specifically built to help customers get the most out of their iPhones. He explained: Beyond our permanent price promise to guarantee that customers will never pay more for a phone with us, we also put on a layer of network value which, firstly, means customers pay nothing for iMessaging, which is the custom Apple SMS equivalent and has video and pictures as well as text. The company is also providing 1GB of data per month free specifically for use with Apple Music, so that customers who subscribe to Apple Music can enjoy music streaming and downloads. Mr Burton said adding Apple devices to the companys range of offerings was very important. Bermuda is a very sophisticated market, both on the corporate side and the consumer, he said. And like any developed market, Android devices and IOS Apple devices are the ones that are of primary interest. We do also have a lot of traction with our entry level DL range, our Digicel range of smartphones. But ultimately, for a large chunk of our customers it is about having Android, particularly Samsung, and Apple devices. So to complete the set, as it were, was a good thing for us to do. Digicel Bermuda has its flagship store on the corner of Church Street and Queen Street. Mr Burton said that since launching its range of iPhones, customers had shown appreciation for the increased choice of devices. So far, so good, he added.

The technology giant filed for the patent in July 2015, and the United States Patent and Trademark Office published it on August 9. This appears to be a design for something much further away in the future, rather than for application in the Project Titan car. Apple’s patent makes several changes to existing articulated chassis designs with the aim of making it more reliable and to better protect the articulation hardware. An air intake, radiator and heater sends cool or warm air around the steering housing as required, which is meant to keep components cool in the summer heat, as well as to prevent snow buildup in winter. Current designs often expose the steering components to the elements, leading to accelerated wear and tear, and damage, while a protective housing adds weight and inhibits access to parts for servicing and repairs. With Apple’s patent, at the bottom of the design are “two mutually movable protective elements” which overlap to shield components when the vehicle is traveling in a straight line. When the vehicles turns, sections of the shielding would pivot enough to create an opening for water, gravel or other accumulated debris to fall out. While Apple holds the patent for this technology, the system’s developer is actually military contractor BAE Systems Hägglunds Aktiebolag, which according to the firm’s website, creates “world-leading combat vehicles, armoured engineering vehicles and armoured personnel carriers.” A military contractor’s involvement would give Apple the confidence that battlefield know-how should translate into reliability on the public road.

Rating: 4 out of 5 Written by Karthekayan Iyer | Updated: August 18, 2016 8:55 am Huawei P9 follows on the successful design language of Nexus 6P, which was appreciated by both critics as well as users. Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, is finally stepping up its game in India’s ever growing smartphone market. Huawei is ready to take on the likes of Samsung’s Galaxy S series and Apple’s iPhone in India with its flagship smartphones. Huawei’s online-only Honor brand has been doing well in India but the brand caters only to budget and mid-budget range. With P9, Huawei is bringing its first flagship product to India. At HAS 2016, company executives made it clear their global ambitions in the smartphone business starts with the P9, and it was a matter of time before Huawei brought the phone to India. Huawei P9 This isn’t my first interaction with P9. I first experienced the device back in April during HAS 2016 in China, and a little time spent testing the camera made me believe there is more to it than just the dual rear camera setup. Huawei is betting on bringing some extraordinary camera capabilities to the P Series and the question is whether they succeeded in pulling it off? Specs: 5.2-inch (1080x1920p, ~424 ppi) IPS LCD display | Octa-core HiSilicon Kirin 955 processor | 3GB RAM | 32GB storage | 12MP dual rear camera + 8MP front | Li-Ion 3000 mAh battery | Android Marshmallow OS Huawei P9 Price: Rs 39,999 Genelia Deshmukh On Being A Mother And Bollywood Career Bigg Boss 10 November 22 Review: Bani Lashes Out At Swami Om, Manoj Punjabi Demonetisation: Supreme Court Refuses To Stay Proceedings Why Is Jammu Kashmir’s Machil Sector Seen As A Safe Passage For Infiltrators Amartya Sen No Longer Part Of Nalanda University Board Government Plans To Bring GST Bills As Money Bills: Here’s Why Demonetisation: Relief For Common Man: Find Out More Salman Khan And Family Celebrate Helen’s Birthday At Galaxy Apartments Demonetisation: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley Defends Government’s Move Aamir Khan’s Dangal Pales In Comparison To Surroundings Of Mahavir Singh Phogat’s Village J&K: 3 Soldiers Killed, Body Of One Mutilated In Machhal Sector PM Narendra Modi Asks People To Rate Demonetisation Ex-Gujarat Energy Minister Has Financial Interest In 8 Onshore Oil Blocks: Find Out More US President-Elect Donald Trump Lays Out Agenda For First 100 Days Modi Keynote Prank App Spurns Several Clones Hardware Huawei P9 follows on the successful design language of Nexus 6P, which was appreciated by both critics as well as users. The design puts emphasis on use of metal and plastic in an elegant way. If Huawei had to make a Nexus this year, it would look very much like this. Watch Huawei P9 Video Huawei P9 features a rectangular chassis with corners slightly curved for a gentle appearance. There are plastic antenna bands running through the back, which looks very much like Apple’s iPhone. Instead of that huge camera hump on the Nexus 6P, we are looking at a glass window that is home to a dual rear camera setup (more on that later), dual LED flash and Leica branding. Overall, the Huawei has built an exciting smartphone, that is comfortable to hold and easy to use. Unlike the design, we are looking at midrange specifications here. An octa-core HiSilicon SoC with 3GB RAM and Mali T880 GPU. There is a 5.2-inch 1080p IPS LCD coupled with a front facing stereo speaker, an 8MP front facing camera and a notification light embedded into the earpiece. Huawei P9 rocks a dual image sensors at the back based on Leica’s Summarit H 1:2.2/27 aspherical lens. The rear of the device is not only home to the Leica dual rear camera, but also a square shaped fingerprint scanner. This is one of the fastest fingerprint scanners ever packed into a smartphone. It recognises your print immediately, and works well even with a wet finger. The fingerprint also supports 360-degree recognition like most Honor phones. Rounding up the device is a volume rocker and power button at the right, and Hybrid SIM slot on the left. The bottom houses USB-C port, a headphone jack and speaker. Display The 5.7-inch Quad HD display found on the Nexus 6P is not making its way down to the P9. The smartphone rather has to do with a smaller 5.2-inch and less pixel dense Full HD panel. Don’t get me wrong, less pixels here definitely don’t mean compromise. The Huawei P9’s display produces a pixel density of 424 ppi which in real world translates to crisper text and colourful visuals. The Huawei P9’s display produces a pixel density of 424 ppi which in real world translates to crisper text and colourful visuals. If you are someone spoilt by those deep blacks of AMOLED panels then you might be disappointed. For Huawei, P9 is not just a smartphone but a showcase of its technology prowess and I would have liked to see a QHD panel. Even then Huawei P9’s panel is crisp, sharp and vibrant. The viewing angles are on point, but I doubt if anybody is interested in watching movies on this smaller panel. While the display is good, it doesn’t seem to be scratch resistant. In my two weeks with the device, the screen has already caught a few scratch (part of the blame has to be with my habit of dropping keys with the device). Software Huawei P9 runs the company’s very own Emotion UI based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Huawei has been kind enough to not let some of the core functionalities of Android get compromised. Instead of physical navigation buttons, Huawei has used onscreen ones which is kind of nice. Swiping or long pressing the home button reveals Google Now on Tap. The implementation here is as stock as it can get. Huawei has also done away with the trick of adding duplicate apps for the same action. With P9, you don’t have to deal with a native browser and Chrome. There is just Chrome. There is a Calendar (not Google Calendar), Email (not Gmail), Music (not Play Music), but I am sure the days of these apps are numbered. Huawei’s UI is not as distinctive as Samsung’s and the only redesign comes with the icons and the notification tray. I must admit that I like the drop down notification tray design. It gives quick access to notification (which is the primary purpose of notification window after all) and there is a delete icon to dismiss them all at once. A swipe gesture moves you between notifications and quick shortcuts and it even gives quick access to apps that support headphones when one is connected. Chinese OEMs are playing their cards heavily when it comes to software and in that regard, Huawei’s UI here is the minimal of the lot. Camera It is not that easy to get the dynamic range right when the Sun is setting and Huawei P9 nails that even in the standard mode If you have read through the starting paragraphs then I’m sure, you are here to know about the camera. Huawei P9 is not the first smartphone to feature a dual rear camera setup but it’s the first to carry the Leica brand. Every year at World Photography Awards, there is at least one winning picture out of the Leica lens and Huawei needs to be credited for bringing them onboard. Huawei P9 rocks a dual image sensors at the back based on Leica’s Summarit H 1:2.2/27 aspherical lens. The implementation here is unlike anything else we’ve seen before. The dual rear image sensors on P9 work with two different purpose. One of the sensors capture colour while the other concentrates on black and white (referred to as monochrome). The idea is quite simple: If you are at a zoo watching Zebra and wish to click a picture of its black and white stripes, the normal image sensor still considers it as RGB while the monochrome sensor on P9 distinguishes white and black very distinctively. Huawei P9’s USP lies in its dual camera with one image sensor dedicated for capturing Leica like black and white Leica is always known for its black and white images and Leica BW is still recognised to be the best. With P9, the smartphone world has got the best monochrome shooter yet. Trust me, the results are far better than the ones shot with Noir filter on iPhone. A sample monochrome image shot in auto mode at ISO 125 and shutter speed 1/50 seconds When not in use, the monochrome sensor also doubles as a depth sensor. The implementation here is same as the one we are accustomed to seeing on HTC’s One series. You click a picture and then selectively refocus on any focus point. While Huawei is promising professional Bokeh, the results are quite good. It is a cool party trick but not a feature compelling to have in your smartphone. Talking in pure camera capabilities, the image sensors used here are top notch. They don’t have a small aperture number like competition, but often produce pictures with sufficient details. The Reds, pinks, grays, browns all turn out to be legitimate. The greens do come out well but sometimes end up looking blown out. A bokeh image shot with aperture F/0.95, shutter speed of 1/25 seconds and ISO 320. Flash is disabled Considering the 12MP rear camera comes with f/2.2 aperture, the night shots are not as breathtaking as the one clicked with Galaxy S7/S7 edge. After sometime, I ended up clicking every night shot in monochrome, which actually adds an all new dimension to pictures. Apart from photography, the 12MP Leica branded image sensor also supports timelapse, slow-mo options. The results left me with mixed feelings. There is also a dedicated HDR option which offers excellent dynamic range. The video is another area where the competition leaps ahead of P9. Huawei P9’s camera don’t have a small aperture number like competition, but often produce pictures with sufficient details Huawei P9’s camera is the most capable one ever packed into a smartphone If Galaxy S7 edge’s camera is the best-ever packed into a smartphone then P9’s camera is the most capable one ever packed into a smartphone. Performance and Battery Life Under the hood of P9 is an in-house HiSilicon Kirin 955 SoC, an octa-core chipset with four Cortex A73 cores clocked at up to 2.5GHz and four Cortex A53 cores clocked at up to 1.5GHz. The processor is definitely a mid-range one in terms of raw power but manages to keep things running smoothly. The octa-core chipset coupled with 3GB RAM and 32GB storage manage to keep everything tightly under control. It’s not flagship level specs, but things like multitasking, switching between apps and general things aren’t a problem here. As far as gaming is concerned, Huawei P9 easily held up its ground while playing Asphalt 8. I could easily race for longer time without any issue but readers must note that the device got warm after some point in time. Huawei P9 uses USB-C port for charging which means users need to carry the charger around with them all the time I occasionally found apps crashing and ecosystem stuttering on Huawei P9. I hope Huawei fixes that with a software update soon. I would rate Huawei P9’s battery life as something close to average. It lasted me one full day during the review period but drained rather quickly on 4G. With P9, it becomes mandatory to carry the charge all the time. Wrap-up Huawei P9 is an epitome to the fact that Chinese smartphone makers can innovate. Huawei P9 offers great design, decent performance and battery life and an extremely capable camera. Huawei P9 is definitely not in the league of Samsung’s Galaxy S7 range or Apple’s latest iPhone lineup, but it definitely works like advertised. If you are out in the market for an innovative Chinese smartphone then look no further, Huawei P9 is the best bet yet. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaPakistan says three of its soldiers killed in cross border firing; 'response to ceasefire violations,' says Army BusinessHuge surge in Jan Dhan account deposits, Rs 21,000 crore mobilised IndiaNavjot Kaur Sidhu, Pargat Singh will join Congress on Nov 28: Amarinder Singh IndiaDemonetisation logjam: Govt reaches out to Opposition, PM likely to attend RS tomorrow BusinessFormer Tata Steel honcho rebuts Cyrus Mistry charges on Corus buy EntertainmentAlia Bhatt is like Jennifer Lawrence: a star who’s also terrific actor EntertainmentBefikre's song Khulke-Dhulke: Ranveer Singh, Vaani Kapoor and a Bollywood Punjabi wedding, watch video EntertainmentBaahubali 2 leaked scene may have done more good than harm EntertainmentSalman Khan meets his onscreen son Ali Haji after nine years.

This Could Be the Deep Blue Version of the iPhone 7 GO Photos show a new color version of the next iPhone Aug 17, 2016 09:30 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Apple is expected to take the wraps off a new iPhone model next month, and rumor has it that the device will introduce at least one new color version that could be called “Deep Blue.” While there are sources pointing to even two new colors, including this blue shade and a dark one, it’s hard to tell if all these reports are accurate, so we should take them with a little skepticism for the time being. Today’s leak, for instance, claims to show the Deep Blue version of the next iPhone (whose name is not known yet, but there are big chances that it won’t be called iPhone 7, with Apple planning to save this designation for next year’s 10th anniversary celebration model). Dual-camera system and clear back The gallery at the end of the article includes photos coming from China and depicting the Plus version of the upcoming iPhone painted in Deep Blue, although depending on light conditions, it can easily be mistaken for a darker gray. This might actually make sense, given the aforementioned rumors, and Apple might only introduce a new version that looks different, depending on the amount of light. As you can see, this alleged leak confirms that the Plus model will launch with a dual-camera system while the smaller version will only come with a bigger camera, but just a single lens. Additionally, the antenna lines are now placed at the top and the bottom of the phone, thus providing a clear back. While it’s hard to say if these photos are accurate or not, we do know that iPhone buyers would love new color versions of the device, especially because the existing ones have been around for a while (except for the Rose Gold, which has been introduced with the 6s). More information and the final confirmation of all these reports pointing to various color versions of the iPhone will land next month, when Apple will officially introduce the device and disclose all details.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (17 Images) #Apple#iPhone#iPhone 7#Deep Blue iPhone subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Alleged Deep Blue iPhone 7 (17 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Sorry, Apple: China No Longer Loves the iPhone Apple's Next-Generations iPhone, iPad to Use Flexible OLED Displays Rose Gold iPhone 7 Plus Smiles for the Camera in New Leak Apple iPhone 7 Could Launch on September 7 iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks 17 photos    Alleged Deep Blue iPhone 7 new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Samsung Gear Manager for iOS Leaked, Lets You Use Gear S2/S3 with iPhones more on: Samsung i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

(Reuters/China Daily) Share Written by Josh Horwitz Obsession China's Transition August 16, 2016 When it comes to winning the China market, some businessmen are turning to the camera. CEOs of American tech companies are increasingly publicizing their trips to China, showing off photos of themselves mingling with officials and appreciating Chinese culture. The visits come as internet companies struggle to forge or maintain inroads into the country—though it’s not clear if posing for the camera will help alleviate business woes. Tim Cook is the most recent US tech executive to embark on a camera-ready tour of China. Yesterday the CEO arrived in China to pose with Zhang Gaoli (paywall), vice premier of China and one of the most powerful officials in the country. In addition to announcing an upcoming research and development center in China, Cook posed with Guo Pei, a Chinese fashion designer who uses an iPad Pro, and also with a fitness group in Beijing that uses Apple Watches. Cook has made a total of nine trips to China, according to the China Daily. But whereas publicity surrounding past trips primarily celebrated new openings of Apple stores, his recent visits have featured more camera-ready moments with a distinct Chinese twist. In May, he appeared with JJ Lin, a Singaporean-Chinese musician, as well as Jean Liu, president of Didi Chuxing—the Chinese Uber rival that Apple had just invested in. (YouTube/JJ Lin) The visits come as Apple’s honeymoon period with China nears its end. After years of unimpeded growth, the company reported its lowest quarterly sales results in the country since 2014. The company also appears to be facing more government scrutiny. Authorities blocked domestic access to iBooks and the iTunes movie store, and the company lost two bizarre trademark lawsuits coming from local companies. Cook isn’t the only CEO to go touring China in the face of commercial adversity. Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg has aggressively courted China-ready photo opportunities. In March he shared photos of himself jogging inside Tiananmen Square amidst smog defined as “hazardous” by Beijing’s Air Quality Index. He has also made public appearances speaking rudimentary Chinese, and even showed off a copy of Xi Jinping: The Governance of China when officials visited Facebook’s offices in California. (Facebook) Zuckerberg’s camera-hogging in China appears to be part of a charm offensive to get Facebook into China. The company has an office in Beijing where it helps Chinese advertisers buy space on its site. But Facebook and Instagram remain blocked in China, meaning that the company effectively has no access to China’s consumer market—where the real money is. Other CEOs have taken similar steps as they struggle to secure a spot in China’s market. Earlier this year Google CEO Sundar Pichai shared pics of himself playing Go against Chinese champion Ke Jie and other players, in a nod to Alphabet’s artificial intelligence program AlphaGo. The search giant is trying to re-enter China with an app store. Enjoyed my visit to China​,​​​ tried ​some Go with China's top players, including current world champion Ke Jie pic.twitter.com/1MDoXNkrr4 — sundarpichai (@sundarpichai) April 1, 2016 Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, meanwhile, has made appearances at Chinese universities and government summits, talking about innovation and entrepreneurship. The ride-hailing giant burned through $1 billion a year as it struggled to lead the market in China, before rival Didi Chuxing purchased its China unit this month. Big industry dinner and a cute gift from the city of Guiyang! pic.twitter.com/QAGc298Rae — travis kalanick (@travisk) May 25, 2015 Why the rush for PR-ready snapshots? China is the world’s biggest consumer market, but authorities are keen to keep foreign technology companies at arms length. Over the past several years, various policy guidelines have outlined a plan for the country to wean itself off of its dependence on foreign technology by 2020. Achieving such a goal might be unrealistic. But its mere existence serves as a warning to foreign technology providers that going against the ruling party’s wishes could hinder their efforts in a lucrative, fast-growing market. Publicizing CEOs smiling with politicians and celebrities is one way foreign companies can appease authorities and win over consumers. By visually demonstrating an interest in Chinese culture, as well as a fondness for the nation’s leaders, they symbolically show a willingness to get along with the government—however anti-competitive or politically controversial its policies might be.

Apple has announced that it will boost its investment in China, one of its largest but increasingly challenging markets, and build its first Asia-Pacific research and development center in the country. Chief Executive Tim Cook made the pledge during a trip to China, at least his second in four months, as demand for Apple’s iPhones has plummeted in the world’s second-largest economy and the government remains wary about foreign technology. Research centres are one of the ways that Western outfits get onside with the Chinese government. Cook said  the center will unite Apple’s engineering and operations teams in China and is also intended to deepen the company’s ties to partners and universities. Sales in Greater China, once touted as Apple’s next growth engine, decreased by one-third in its fiscal third quarter, after having more than doubled a year earlier. The results did not include inventory drawdowns as retailers sold phones in stock faster than new supply coming from Apple, meaning that demand was not as weak as it seemed. China’s slowing economy is stocking concerns about Apple’s prospects there. The company’s online stores for iBooks and movies closed in the country after Beijing in March imposed strict curbs on online publishing, particularly for foreign firms. Apple has lost intellectual property battles in China and faces anti-U.S. sentiment from consumers there.

The boost in activity in China from Apple comes after a continual decline in its relevance there, with Android devices far more popular than the iOS equivalent. Apple’s dominance at the premium end of mobile devices  is something worthy of acclaim, but its struggles at attracting interest further down the disposable income ladder mean some of the world’s largest markets appear beyond Cook’s company. Losing share A few weeks ago, figures from India, the third-largest market in the world, showed Apple representing just 2.4pc of smartphone market share. In China earlier this year, an annual drop of 16.3pc in smartphone sales saw Apple’s share drop to 15.3pc, with the likes of Huawei, Oppo and Vivo gaining ground with their lower-end models. The iPhone SE was supposed to help halt this decline, representing a lower price point to the iPhone 7, despite enjoying a similar spec. The effect of those figures won’t be revealed in full for another six or nine months, and Cook’s not resting on his laurels in the meantime. Major facility With plans to build its first Asia-Pacific R&D centre “by the end of the year”, Reuters reports the facility will “unite Apple’s engineering operations teams” in China, and figure as a staging post for greater involvement with partners and universities. Back in April, corporate raider Carl Icahn sold his Apple stock based on concerns about Apple’s relationship with China’s regulators, with various shutdowns of the company’s services eventually forcing his hand. Add to that growing competition and difficult routes to legal resolution – the company is struggling to stop a handbag company calling its product an iPhone – and Apple’s woes appear to be mounting. Under that premise, Cook’s plan to begin a new wave of investment in the country makes a whole lot of sense.

Microsoft Beats Apple in Terms of Employee Innovation, Study Claims GO “Redmond’s employees are significantly more innovative” Aug 17, 2016 09:00 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Microsoft and Apple are fighting against each other in multiple ways, but there are two very important areas where the two try to outclass the competition. First of all, they are struggling to offer better products, be they software or hardware, and second of all, they are always looking to innovate more than rivals in order to improve number one. In terms of innovation, Microsoft is the champion, according to a survey posted by Good&Co, a company that analyzed info from more than 4,300 of its users to “explore ways in which psychometric data can inform our understanding of workplace behavior company culture, and success in the tech industry.” The results put Microsoft in the first place, with the survey results showing that “Microsoft employees are significantly more innovative than many assume, and on par with tech giants such as Apple and Facebook.” “Are you the creative kind? Don’t work for Facebook” And yet, this doesn’t necessarily mean that Apple and Facebook are doing much worse, although the research notes that you should avoid working for the social network company if you’re looking for a place where your creativity is brought in the spotlight. “Employees at Apple and Twitter perceive their company cultures as they actually are, meaning they have an accurate idea of the culture fit in their respective jobs,” the research notes. According to the findings of this study, Microsoft is not at all more conservative than Apple, and the company is actually looking for more “adventurous” employees, and what’s more, there are divisions at the two firms that have the same score for employee adventurousness. Apple, however, keeps leading the market in a number of ways, and Good&Co claims that Cupertino’s employees surpass Microsoft’s in terms of intellect and attention to detail. Of course, there are all findings that some people, especially those working at one of the companies, might not agree with, so let’s just take it all with a bit of skepticism for now. #Microsoft#Apple#innovation#Facebook subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft Will Make Its iPhone Keyboard App So Much Better than on Windows Phone Microsoft Makes Fun of Apple Calling the iPad a Computer - Video Apple Was This Close to Having a Watch Similar to the Microsoft Band Microsoft Updates Office for iPhone with New Features iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks    Microsoft and Apple are going head to head in several businesses, including innovation New Apps Quick Heal Virus Database: Daily signature and virus definitions updates for your Quick Heal products, allowing the manual update of Quick Heal AntiVirus Pro, Internet Security and Total Security Action!: Record your gameplay or desktop and capture screenshots, share them on Facebook or YouTube or export your recordings to popular formats and devices WizNote: Write memos, create sticky notes, manage your contacts and synchronize data between multiple computers, with this handy application TreeSize Professional: A powerful and comprehensive hard disk space manager that visually tracks down disk usage and removes obsolete and temporary files from your system TimeLeft: Creates desktop countdown timers, reminders, stopwatches, stickers, and clocks, also providing auction watches and time synchronization options Mudlet: An easy to use application that stands as a multi-functional graphical MUD client with built-in native Lua scripting capabilities Spencer: An intuitive and user-friendly software solution that allows you to access all the items that were typically accessible within the Start Menu of XP Reader comments Antivirus Firms Unite Against Microsoft Push for Windows Defender in Windows 10 more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed History of Mac malware: 1982 – 2011 03 Oct 2011 59 Apple, Malware Post navigation Previous: Two free Southwest Airlines Tickets? Don’t be scammed on Facebook! Next: iPhone 5 emails infect Windows PCs with malware by Graham Cluley 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit In late 2010, I wrote a short history of Apple Mac malware. Since then there have been some significant developments, so here’s a revised and updated version. Before we begin, it’s worth recognising that malware on the Mac is a subject which raises strong emotions. There are some who believe that the problem is overhyped (or even non-existent!) and others who believe that the malware problem on Macs is underestimated by the Apple-loving community. Hopefully this short history will go some way to present the facts, and encourage sensible debate. From the early 1980s, right up until the present day, here are some of the highlights in the history of Apple Mac malware. Mac malware timeline 1982 – Prehistory: Elk Cloner 1987 – nVIR 1988 – HyperCard 1990 – MDEF 1991 – German folk tunes 1995 – Word macro viruses 1996 – Laroux – viruses for Excel 1996 – AutoStart 9805 and Sevendust 2004 – Renepo and Amphimix 2006 – Leap, the first virus for Mac OS X 2007 – OpenOffice BadBunny and RSPlug financial malware 2008 – Scareware, backdoors and Jahlav 2009 – Malware in pirated software torrents, sex videos and a rudimentary virus protection from Apple 2010 – Backdoors, cross-platform attacks and free anti-virus 2011 – MacDefender scareware and SEO poisoning 1982 The first virus to affect Apple computers wasn’t written for the Macintosh (that iconic computer wasn’t set to appear until 1984) but is of historic interest none the less. In 1982, 15-year-old student Rich Skrenta wrote the Elk Cloner virus, capable of infecting the boot sector of Apple II computers. On every 50th boot the Elk Cloner virus would display a short poem: Elk Cloner: The program with a personality It will get on all your disks It will infiltrate your chips Yes, it's Cloner! It will stick to you like glue It will modify RAM too Send in the Cloner! What may surprise some Apple fans is that the Elk Cloner boot sector virus predates IBM PC viruses by some years. Rich Skrenta, by the way, went on to found the web companies Topix and Blekko. Clearly his early entanglement with malware-writing didn’t make him a completely bad apple. 1987 The nVIR virus began to infect Apple Macintosh computers, spreading mainly by floppy disk. It was a similar story to what was happening in the world of MS-DOS malware, where viruses would typically travel from computer to computer by users sharing floppy disks. Source code for nVIR was later made available, causing a rash of variants for the Mac platform. In response, the first anti-virus products for Mac – some free, some commercial – began to emerge. 1988 It appears that the first HyperCard virus was written in 1988. Running on early versions of Apple’s Mac OS, one HyperCard virus displayed a message about Michael Dukakis’s US presidential bid before self-destructing: "Greetings from the HyperAvenger! I am the first HyperCard virus ever. I was created by a mischievous 14 year old, and am completely harmless. Dukakis for preseident in '88. Peace on earth and have a nice day" 1990 The MDEF virus (aka Garfield) emerged, infecting application and system files on the Mac. 1991 HC (also known as Two Tunes or Three Tunes) was a HyperCard virus discovered in Holland and Belgium in March 1991. On German language versions of the operating system it would play German folk tunes and display messages such as “Hey, what are you doing?” and “Don’t panic”. 1995 Microsoft accidentally shipped the first ever Word macro virus, Concept, on CD ROM. It infected both Macs and PCs running Microsoft Word. Concept was not written with malicious intent (aside from spreading, it just displayed a message box containing the number “1”) but thousands of macro viruses were to follow, many also affecting Microsoft Office for Mac. Word macro viruses turned the world of Mac *and* Windows malware on its head overnight. Macro viruses were written in the easy-to-understand macro language that Microsoft included in its Office programs making it child’s play to create new variants. Furthermore, most people at the time considered documents to be non-dangerous, and were happy to receive them without thinking of the possible security implications. Just opening a Word .DOC file could infect your computer, because the macro virus’s code was embedded within. You could measure how good your anti-virus software was by how quickly and seriously it responded to the macro virus threat. 1996 Laroux, the first Excel macro virus, was released and hit owners of Windows computers. Mac users escaped unaffected at first – at least until the release of Excel 98 for Mac meant they could also become victims. 1998 It was in Hong Kong, in 1998, when the next significant Mac malware outbreak was first spotted. A worm – dubbed AutoStart 9805 – spread rapidly in the desktop publishing community via removable media, using the CD-ROM AutoPlay feature of QuickTime 2.5+ David Harley of Macvirus tells me that he remembers watching with interest as reports of Autostart spread from Asia to the rest of the world. In the same year, Sevendust, also known as 666, infected applications on Apple Mac computers. Big changes to the Mac malware scene were just around the corner, however, with the release of Mac OS X – a whole new version of the operating system which would mean that much of the old malware would no longer be capable of running. In the future, Mac-specific malware would have to be written with a new OS in mind.. 2004 The Renepo script worm (also known as “Opener”) attempted to disable Mac OS X security including the Mac OS X firewall. In addition, the Renepo worm would download and install hacker tools for password-sniffing and cracking, make key system directories world-writeable, and create an admin-level user for hackers to later abuse. The shell script used by the Renepo worm contains a number of comments from its authors, including: In 2004, hackers also wrote a proof-of-concept program called Amphimix which demonstrated how executable code could be disguised as an MP3 music file on an Apple Mac. Amphimix was not likely to be encountered by Mac users, and appeared to have been written as a proof-of-concept highlighting a vulnerability in Apple’s software. 2006 Leap-A, the first ever virus for Mac OS X was discovered. OSX/Leap-A was programmed to use the iChat instant messaging system to spread itself to other users. As such, it was comparable to an email or instant messaging worm on the Windows platform. Therefore, it was correct to call OSX/Leap-A a virus or a worm. It was not correct to call OSX/Leap-A a Trojan horse. Not that that stopped many in the Mac community claiming it wasn’t a real virus. The Inqtana worm and proof-of-concept virus soon followed in the footsteps of the Leap virus. A buggy proof-of-concept virus called Macarena appeared, written in Xcode. Every infected file contained the phrases "MachoMan - roy g biv" and "26/10/06" 2007 Sophos discovered an OpenOffice multi-platform macro worm capable of running on Windows, Linux and Mac computers. The BadBunny worm dropped Ruby script viruses on Mac OS X systems, and displayed an indecent JPEG image of a man wearing a rabbit costume. The first financial malware for Mac was discovered. The gang behind the attacks developed both Windows and Mac versions of their OSX/RSPlug-A Trojan horse. The Trojan posed as a codec to help users view pornographic videos, but in fact changes DNS server entries to direct surfers unwittingly to other websites. 2008 Cybercriminals targeted Mac and PC users in equal measure, by planting poisoned adverts on TV-related websites. If accessed via an Apple Mac, surfers would be attacked by a piece of Macintosh scareware called MacSweeper. Close relatives of MacSweeper followed shortly afterwards, including Imunizator – another example of scareware for the Apple Mac, which claimed to find privacy issues on the user’s precious computer. In June, the OSX/Hovdy-A Trojan horse was discovered that could steal passwords from Mac OS X users, open the firewall to give access to hackers, and disable security settings. Troj/RKOSX-A was discovered – a Mac OS X tool to assist hackers create backdoor Trojans, which can give them access and control over your Apple Mac computer. In November, Sophos warned of the Jahlav Trojan. Similar to other malware campaigns, cybercriminals created a bogus webpage claiming to contain a video. Visiting the site produces a message saying that you don’t have the correct codec installed to watch the video – whereupon the site offers you an EXE if you run Windows, and a DMG (Disk Image) file if you are using an Apple Mac. Controversially, Apple issued a support advisory urging customers to run anti-virus software – but after media interest, rapidly deleted the page from their website. 2009 In January 2009, hackers began to distribute the OSX/iWorkS-A Trojan horse via BitTorrent inside pirated versions of Apple’s iWork ’09 software suite. In the same month, a new variant of the Trojan was distributed in a pirated version of Adobe Photoshop CS4. In March, Sophos reported on how hackers were planting versions of the RSPlug Trojan horse on websites, posing as an HDTV program called MacCinema. In June, SophosLabs discovered a new version of the Tored email worm for Mac OS X, and hackers planted a version of the Jahlav Mac Trojan horse on a website posing as a portal for hardcore porn videos. Shortly afterwards, the Twitter account of celebrity blogger Guy Kawasaki had a malicious link posted onto it, claiming to point to a sex video of Gossip Girl actress Leighton Meester. In reality, however, the link lead unsuspecting users to malware which could infect Mac users. Meanwhile, Apple finally began to introduce some rudimentary anti-malware protection into Mac OS X. Although it wasn’t really equivalent to a true anti-virus product (it only protected against a handful of Mac malware, doesn’t defend you if you try to copy an infected file from a USB stick for instance, and doesn’t offer clean-up facilities), it was still encouraging to see some attempt to offer more protection for Mac users. 2010 The OSX/Pinhead Trojan (also known as HellRTS) emerged. The backdoor Trojan horse can allow hackers to gain remote control over your treasured iMac or MacBook. Once again, the malware was distributed disguised as a legitimate application – in this case, iPhoto, the photo application which ships on modern Macs. More recently, the Boonana cross-platform worm appeared, using a Java applet to target not just Windows computers for infection, but Mac OS X and Linux too. Sophos detects various components of the attack as Troj/Boonana-A, Troj/KoobStrt-A, Troj/KoobInst-A, Troj/KoobCls-A, Troj/Agent-PDY, Troj/DwnLdr-IOX, and Troj/DwnLdr-IOY. In addition, Sophos’s web protection blocks access to the malicious webpages. A piece of Mac spyware called as Spynion (also known as OpinionSpy or PremierOpinion) came to light, attached to screensavers and other add-ons for users’ Macs. Spynion would take advantage of users not properly reading End User License Agreements (EULAs), allowing it to spy on browsing habits and search behaviour. Free anti-virus for Macs In late 2010, Sophos issued a free anti-virus for Mac home users. We have been protecting business customers who have Macs for years, and now there was an opportunity for home Mac users to protect themselves against the threat too, at no charge. Early reports indicated that there are plenty of Mac users with malware on their computers – some of it Windows malware, some Mac OS X, and some cross-platform. There’s no doubt that the Windows malware problem is much larger than the Mac threat – but that doesn’t mean that the danger of malware infection on Mac OS X is non-existent. The events of 2011 would make it clearer to Mac users than ever before that the malware threat was real.. 2011 The BlackHole RAT, a Trojan allowing hackers to gain remote access to your Mac, emerged. Uncompromising text contained inside its code made it clear what the author’s intentions were: "I am a Trojan Horse, so i have infected your Mac Computer. I know, most people think Macs can't be infected, but look, you ARE Infected! "I have full controll over your Computer and i can do everything I want, and you can do nothing to prevent it. "So, Im a very new Virus, under Development, so there will be much more functions when im finished." But there were other attacks for Mac users to worry about. In 2011, a massive search engine poisoning campaign was undertaken by cybercriminals with the intention of infecting Mac users. Apple Mac users were considered a soft target by malicious hackers because of the low adoption rate of anti-virus software. The initial attacks took the name of a legitimate Mac security program, MacDefender, and – as users searched the web for images – popped up bogus alerts claiming to have found malware on their computers. The fake anti-virus attack was very similar to ones we had seen many times before for Windows, but this time targeting Mac users instead. Within days, the attacks began to adopt new disguises such as “Mac Security”. In all of the attacks, the intention was to scare users into believing that their Mac computer had a security problem and fool them into purchasing a solution. In other words, to give your credit card details to the very people who had compromised your computer in the first place! The scammers had no qualms about poisoning popular search terms such as “Mother’s Day” in their attempt to fool Mac users. In some cases, once in place, the malware would deliberately pop up inappropriate websites – in an attempt to convince you that you needed to buy a clean-up solution. Mac users had not seen a malware attack impacting them on anything like this scale since the 1990s, and many struggled to protect their computers. Apple itself seemed also to have been caught napping, and technology writer Ed Bott discovered that calls to the AppleCare support line were “4-5 times higher than normal”, with the overwhelming majority of calls coming from customers who have been hit by a fake anti-virus attack. With the problem flooding Apple’s online support forums also, perhaps the most surprising news was that Apple’s support reps were ordered not to help users remove the malware. Those spreading Mac malware quickly realised that they were not limited to simply poisoning Google’s search results. They also undertook to spread Mac malware via popular social networks, such as Facebook. When serious allegations of a sex attack were laid against the IMF’s Dominique Strauss-Kahn, hackers took advantage spreading malicious scareware links across Facebook which could infect both Windows and Mac users. Scareware attacks continued to cause problems for Mac owners throughout the summer of 2011 with many users coming to realise that perhaps an anti-virus program might be wise after all. Separately, more malicious attacks occurred targeting Mac users. For instance, the OSX/Revir-B Trojan appeared to disguise itself as a PDF file about a controversy between Japan and China about the contested sovereignty of some islands And the Flashback Trojan horse disguised itself as an update for Adobe Flash. Once in place, the Flashback Trojan horse (called OSX/FlshPlyr-A by Sophos products) could allow a remote hacker to gain access to your computer or download further malicious code to your Mac. It’s perhaps no surprise, with a backdrop of increased malware activity for Mac OS X, that a poll conducted by Sophos revealed that 89% of people would tell their Mac-using friends to install anti-virus software.

Fake anti-virus / scareware messages. Reply annoyed says: October 3, 2011 at 4:30 pm does it really matter what OS you are on? when you make comments like what you just posted, it makes you sound like an elitist, with your nose raised high in the air acting like you are better than everyone. whether on a PC or a Mac, imo you have to do something really stupid to get a virus to begin with, so no one is perfect and we all make mistakes. Reply T.Anne says: October 3, 2011 at 7:47 pm Just because there are not as many for MACs than there are for Windows doesn't mean MACs don't have any issues. That's the whole point. They are vulnerable too. If I have a small cut vs a large cut doesn't change the fact that I have a cut. The way I react to it may be different, but in either case I have to try to sanitize it and prevent infection. As for MAC users having to be stupid to get infected – that's not true, all they have to be is human. That's what social engineering is all about. Besides that, not all MAC users are techies. I have owned both Windows computers and MACs – quite frankly, I don't think I got any smarter when I was using the MAC vs the Windows PC. Reply Nigel says: October 3, 2011 at 8:16 pm For the record, "MAC" is an abbreviation for "Media Access Control", as in "MAC address". The Apple Macintosh is typically abbreviated as "Mac". Reply T.Anne says: October 6, 2011 at 2:44 pm fair enough :) though I suppose that does support my point that not all Mac users are techies. I'm hoping most readers can look past my choice of capitalization and still understand the point I was trying to make. Reply Jeremy Visser says: October 3, 2011 at 10:24 pm It's capitalised 'Mac', not 'MAC'. Not that you'll change your ways after reading this, but I thought I'd try. Reply Sam Kinison says: October 3, 2011 at 4:13 pm Ahhh yes… this all reminds me of the early day when I would walk into a Kinko's and load the Sam Kinison scream init (making it invisible in the process) and casually walk away… Reply KLD says: October 3, 2011 at 6:57 pm To be fair, most people will never run into malware, AV or not. In my 10 years on Windows, I have had an AV, and only had one or two of all those thousands of malwares infect my computer. Note that those one or two aside,, I have encountered malware only oPnce more: during the Google search poisoning that started Mac Malware. That’s the first time in four years, even with my recently more risky browsing habits. Now, if you take that statistic to the small number of Mac malwares out there, it’s very unlikely you will ever run into, much less install any malware. Of course, as no AV is foolproof and malware is sneaky, you may never actually know whether you have malware or not. People without AV’s who say they have no malware may have malware and not know it! So the best answer, then, is to at least equip yourself with a free AV. It’s like wearing a jacket to the movie theatre in case you get cold. I’m considering buying myself a shiny new MacBook Pro next summer, and I say, I’ll probably be downloading Sophos for Mac :) Reply Lee Chong Yew says: August 17, 2016 at 3:09 am I’d be careful if I were you, especially if you work with Eastern companies. My mom worked for a huge Japanese consumer electronics manufacturer which shall remain unnamed. Outside from the bunch of Windows PC they have a pair of G3s for designing product manuals and designing the cases of their products. They got infected by the Autostart 9805 worm by means of a ZIP disk sent in by one of their suppliers from Hong Kong. So yes, even if you are careful in the source of your data, your suppliers might not. In the end you cannot rule out secondary infections- the virus may come from a trusted source who got infected just because they didn’t know better. Reply HR, Sweden says: October 3, 2011 at 7:24 pm How can I be sure that downloading this "free AntiVirus for Mac" doesn't put some malware on my computer…?

Reply Darren says: October 26, 2011 at 10:52 am Thats a paradox if I ever saw one. Great article btw. Reply Mike says: December 8, 2011 at 9:17 am Thats good, we need more people to stick with a PC, less chance of our Mac's getting a cold !! Great article. Reply christophe says: October 3, 2011 at 9:45 pm Mac "malware / virus" free ??? :-) Reply Paul R says: October 3, 2011 at 10:25 pm What is "written in Xcode" supposed to mean (in relation to Macarena)? Xcode is just an IDE and it supports developing programs in numerous languages, most commonly Objective C. Saying that something was "written in Xcode" though makes little sense. Reply Matt says: October 4, 2011 at 5:57 am It’s like saying ‘written in notepad’ – perfectly reasonable, just slightly irrelevant… Reply James says: October 3, 2011 at 11:49 pm The point is that Apple Mac owners have a history of smugly thinking their computers are immune to malware. This article shows that they are not. Reply JoshS says: October 4, 2011 at 12:08 am Yes Mac users need to be AV alert, but all I’ve seen so far that could infect a current Mac is Trojans. Of course these require the Mac users permission to install and run. Reply iMikeyMike says: October 4, 2011 at 12:24 am An accurate history – but all (even OSX/Leap-A spread via iChat) required the user to run an app with authentication: all were trojan horses, none would work without the user participating in the installation. I could write an app and send it to a mac using colleague and it would erase his hard drive, or send me his files: but only if he ran the app, and only if he entered the administrator password. I’m sure viruses on the Mac aren’t far away – but they are not here yet. (Plus the free Sophos AV slows my 2007 MacBook down worse than Firefox with a thousand plug ins.) Reply Graham Cluley says: October 4, 2011 at 8:25 am By your definition, lots of the malware we have seen hitting PCs over the last 25 years weren't viruses either. For instance, your definition suggests that the Love Bug (ILOVEYOU) worm wasn't a worm, but a Trojan. The Melissa virus wasn't a virus. Dark Avenger, Hare, Chernobyl, Netsky, MyDoom, Sobig? Everyone got them wrong too – apparently they were Trojans! You see? You can't have it both ways. You can't redefine the word "Trojan" so it helps your argument that Macs haven't been hit by viruses… and then continue to claim that Windows is overwhelmed by viruses. I'm not aware of anybody in the anti-virus industry who says that malware has to require no user interaction to be considered a virus. A Trojan horse is a seemingly legitimate computer program that has been intentionally designed to disrupt and damage computer activity. Importantly, Trojan horses do not replicate or have any mechanism of spreading themselves. They have to be deliberately planted on a website, or accidentally shared with another user, or spammed out to email addresses. There is nothing inside a Trojan's code to distribute themselves further to other victims. Trojan horses do not contain any code to distribute or spread themselves, viruses and worms do. OSX/Leap-A is programmed to use the iChat instant messaging system to spread itself to other users. As such, it is comparable to an email or instant messaging worm on the Windows platform. Worms are a sub category of the group of malware known as viruses. Therefore, it is correct to call OSX/Leap-A a virus or a worm. It is not correct to call OSX/Leap-A a Trojan horse. But you're right – most of the malware we see for Mac is in the form of Trojan horses. But then that's *also* true of most of the malware we see for Windows! Social engineering is what tricks users into running these Trojans. And that works just as well with Mac users as Windows users. Reply opsono says: May 31, 2013 at 3:29 pm “I’m not aware of anybody in the anti-virus industry who says that malware has to require no user interaction to be considered a virus.” Correct. But it _does_ in order to be considered a serious threat. It’s also telling that Microsoft happened to be the vector in so many cases…. Reply Joe Simpson says: October 4, 2011 at 3:21 pm The World Peace Day trojan is not not included. It infected early Macs. It spawned an interesting discussion of the ethics if installing unauthorized softwware on computers for which the individual had neither responsibility nor relationship. Reply Richard says: October 4, 2011 at 4:48 pm I think the line “Before we begin, it’s worth recognising that malware on the Mac is a subject which raises strong emotions.”, pretty much sums up Apple and certain Emu (oops theres my dyslexia kicking in again, sorry I meant Mac) users, over many years. Of course Not all Mac users have their head burried in the sand (in fact most DO NOT) Apple has had some great some great products come out over the years across various platforms ( and no im not just heading toward the old cliche of market share making you worth the hit) but has become a bigger target and is growing. I have Windows Desktop and Macbook BOTH have AV installed Good post Graham Reply tblspn says: April 28, 2012 at 11:00 am I think you mean Ostrich, not Emu. Carry on.. Reply opsono says: May 31, 2013 at 3:35 pm The prime reason to have AV software on a Mac is to eliminate the possibility that you will pass on malware to Windows users. Reply DKennedy says: October 5, 2011 at 9:58 am Sophos is really pushing Mac vulnerabilities hard. I can only assume that, although the current AV product is free, there'll be a paid-for 'premium' version coming down the pike as soon as enough Apple owners are sufficiently scared. Reply Graham Cluley says: October 6, 2011 at 10:11 am We've had a commercial version of our Mac anti-virus for many years (which we sell to businesses) The free version *is* free for home use. If you don't want to use it that's fine, but we've explained numerous times why we've made it free – so it's not as though we're hiding anything. Reply Eric says: October 29, 2011 at 1:39 am The author would have us believe that since anew piece of MAC malware is arriving almost every month, that we should all go and buy MAC antivirus from a certain antitrust company. Bah humbug. This is more reflective of the fact that certain antivirus companies have invested in the development in MAC antivirus, and they would like to selling their new products. Reply Graham Cluley says: October 29, 2011 at 11:38 am Umm.. love the conspiracy theory, but did you see the bit where I reference the *free* anti-virus that we offer home users? Reply jonny says: October 7, 2012 at 7:25 am By definition (as in the literal definition of the English words), "conspiracy theory" includes all rumours of non-disclosure. So all rumours of "proprietary information" are literally conspiracy theories until they are proved, at which point they become fact (of the conspiracy to withhold information). In this, our (Mis)Information Age, any information which cannot be easily accessed by an experienced search engine user is – irrefutably – the direct result of two or more parties conspiring to withhold information, i.e. deceive. I'm not convinced that withholding information of any kind from the human race could ever be in Humanity's best interests. Proprietary companies have (historically) disagreed; but then they were responsible for limited liability corporations which are inevitably going to kill us all (if they are not eradicated from the face of the planet very shortly). So my argument is clearly in favour of Sophos disclosing information Apple would prefer to be kept hidden for the benefit of…? The limited liability corporation that is nothing more than some sheets of paper which assert that Apple exists. But imagining there is such a thing as a profit-driven company giving away "free lunches" is pretty much how Humanity got itself onto the (gameplay guaranteed) fast track for extinction. Reply Alan B. says: May 20, 2013 at 4:07 pm So what you are saying is that your Mac is immune to every threat out there? Reply Brian says: November 27, 2011 at 3:44 am I'm a fan of Sophos Antivirus. Look, I run a Macbook Pro with Parallels installed so that I have a copy of Windows 7. I need that in order to run some software that I cannot run on Mac that enables me to fill out the forms that the Army uses. Now I have plugged in some USB drives into my computer that have Windows stuff on them, and yes, not everything on those drives was purchased. Sophos found and got rid of the potential threats that were in that mess on my drives. So it has kept crap off of my system and even prevented it from getting on other PCs that I have. Look, the anti-virus is free, it does the job, and it's better than going completely unprotected into the world. I like to surf some porn now and then so why not have a virtual "jimmy" in place just in case? For those that think that malware will never happen to them I kind of giggle. That's exactly what pretty much anyone else has said about things before they happened to them. What's it hurt to use a prophylactic? Reply Dom says: January 29, 2012 at 9:32 pm Just want to say many thanks for the free anti virus program!!! Makes me feel secure knowing that I have protection against the nasties out there. Amazes me though that it's free. How come you guys aren't charging for it? Not that I'm grumbling though, LOL. Again, many thanks. Dom Reply Danny says: February 1, 2012 at 5:20 pm I've had a mac for 6 months and also a windows 7 computer, I know a fair bit about computers (windows) but not a mac computer, when I got the mac I was told my a apple salesman that I didn't need any AV on the mac as macs don't get virus so from the day I switch on the mac I never ever done any buying on the internet because I never been 100% sure I was safe, I just used the windows 7 computer for any on line purchase as I was running Nortons and have never had any worries in 20 years about virus, I then purchase parallels desktop 7 for my mac and installed windows 7 and Nortons 2011 so I can run lion on the mac and switch over to windows 7 with Nortons for any on line purchase, I saw the free download for sophos anti-virus in the computer active mag, I thought it's free so why don't I I stall the software and then I would feel a little better ordering on line, when the install finished I let the AV software do a check on the mac and would you believe it I had 1 virus which sophos removed from my mac, and this was after the apple salesman told me not to worry mac don't get virus, listen to me someone that's had a computer for over 30 years!!!! download the sophos anti- virus for the mac then at least you know you safe either way, many thanks Daniel Reply G Dean says: February 2, 2012 at 2:18 pm Ok interesting facts, but really a disgusting article posing as news to try to scare you into buying security software! Sophos tries to invoke the culture of fear to sell products to the so far rather sensible & resistant Mac community. If you are sensible and do not run programs from dubious sources and keep your os updated, then there really is little risk compared to the security nightmare that is microsh**t. I for one will not be retarding the performance of my computer by buying a security product after reading this article. Yes it is possible to write viruses and malware for apple systems, no one who knows about computers has ever seriously thought otherwise despite the claims of salespeople. Reply Graham Cluley says: February 2, 2012 at 1:55 pm Did you miss the bit where we referred to our FREE anti-virus product for Mac? That's the only product we mention isn't it? And, by the way, our free home user Mac anti-virus product is fully-featured – there's no "premium" edition we try to upsell people to. Cheers Graham Reply Kurt says: February 16, 2012 at 12:24 am I think you are beeing very unfair, G. Dean. 1) Macs are exposed to hacks and viruses, just like Windows, maybe even easier to hack. Not a single system is 100% secure. Hackers hack. If a strong hacker really wants to get you, trust me, he will. Nevermind what system or security you are using. 2) Not run programs from dubious sources? And if a friend sends me shit, not knowing it is malware? Or what if some commercial pops up and gives me some crap? This stuff happens often and most ppl don't even notice it. There was a time, when I cleaned inftected PCs for a living. You wouldn't believe how much crap ppl download – thinking it's safe. You can't expect the mainstream user to understand what todownload and what not. If you were on board in the early 90's, when all this stuff started hitting very hard on the mainstream (Windows), you would have learned a lesson or two about how to deal with this stuff and what to make of it. 3) At the time of this writing: There is LESS risk (on OSX), compared to Microsoft, BUT how many Mac systems are there world-wide vs. Windows systems? Ah, yes. IF Macs ever reach a comparable mainstream level like Microsofts Windows, then I am 99% sure, that Mac will get hit as hard as Windows did, if not harder, because hackers could then finally prove something to a lot of naiv users out there: You think you're safe? Think again. 4) Retarding the performance of your computer? Ehm, most Antiviruses nowadays are extremly fast and ressource-friendly. We're not in the 90's anymore. Have you tried the recent Norton IS 2012, Kaspersky 2012, Microsoft Security Essentials etc.? I have tried all of those on a NETbook and they ran just FINE – without a noticable performance impact. What gives?! AND most are either free or cheap ( cheap = 1-2 bucks a month for a complete security software incl. international live support by phone, chat and mail – and other features? Man, that's extremly cheap, considering what you get!) 5) About scaring you in to buying software (Sophos): Have you realised, that Sophos Home Antimaleware on MAC OSX costs: 0$ … = FREE? -,-" Peace. Reply Frodo says: July 6, 2012 at 4:17 am What are you, G Dean, an infant? Can we avoid this "microsh**T vs Crapple nonsense. Reply samantha says: February 16, 2012 at 6:59 am thanks for the great and free antivirus, sophos! instead of posting some conspiracy theory, like a few ppl here, i understand the article. thank you so, so much for the free work you are sharing with us mac home users. sami. Reply nicole says: February 16, 2012 at 9:49 pm My dad installed Sophos AV on his Mac, because he kept complaining about strange behaviour and such things. He called me, I showed him this article, he downloaded Sophos AV and Sophos found two malware-threats on his iMac. Now he is upset about those, that told him, that Macs are more resistant to viruses. Obviously, like this article demonstrates, it's not. Nicole Reply David says: July 20, 2012 at 7:05 pm Hi Nicole, it is indeed more resistent to viruses, but it still can get infected. There are way less malware attacks aimed to Macs than to PCs. Depending on how you use your computer, the pros of a mac vs a pc rest not only on the virus issue, but on the apps, stability and funcionality… it all depends on what you're looking for when buying a computer. Just wanted to point that out, macs tend to get less trouble with malware, but they are not invulnerable. :) Reply paul says: August 22, 2012 at 7:31 am You can find virus and malware on many Macs, but that doesn't necessarily mean it is a Mac virus, malware or trojan. You will find e-mail laced with nasty attachments, that will only infect Windows PCs. Will all respect to the folks at Sophos, their Mac product isn't as good as ClamXav in detecting threats in e-mails. But then again Clam doesn't do active scanning, while Sophos does, so in theory Sophos would do a better job detecting "drive-by" infections that caused the most recent significant scare. Reply KaCe says: October 28, 2012 at 11:20 am Yes, I came here tonight because Sophos found a virus… but it was a PC virus. I'm sure it was in my email. This discussion is worth reading as there are "no free lunches". There's a price to pay for everything, even a free lunch. Macs are loved, almost blindly, by Mac enthusiasts. I am one. But I have no malice toward MS for what it is creating. I do think the Unix kernel makes Macs more stable, reliable and easy to use. I think all of us who had to deep 6 our pre-OSX machines were ticked that Apple would no longer support them, but in the end it has been good for all of us. If Bill deep 6'd the older code in Windows there'd probably be a huge out cry initially, but then things would improve. He's trying to be all things to all people and we know you can't win that game. I will keep my OS updated. Enjoy my dependable, well built machine (which worked after being submerged while asleep in my backpack when a waterbottle lid came loose) It has fallen off the top of may car twice… I put it there to be "safe" because I was loading my car… jeez. It was stepped on once and looks like it has been to Afghanistan. But here I am using it. And updating my Sophos. Thank you for having it. I agree with the idea of belt and suspenders. Sophos can't hurt a product that is already very capable, it can only help it. Reply Steven says: February 19, 2012 at 10:41 pm Very interesting and good to know there are humans out there checking on these threats, especially since I was interested in buying a Mac. Now I'll just stick with my good, old Windows PC. Good article. Please provide the same list for Linux-based Operating Systems or Distributions (like Ubuntu, Suse). There are a number of threats already known for Linux/Ubuntu, if you check Google and look out for User problems with malware. There are a number of users (in the Linux community) thinking there are no threats for mainstream Linux OSs. Canonical even claims to have "Antivirus protection" in their latest Ubuntu version (11.10). Things like: 1) Browser hacks through Mozilla in an Ubuntu System. (look Youtube) 2) Gnomelook dot org malware in Screensaver. (Google, official Ubuntu forums) 3) Ubuntu systems getting hacked. (official Ubuntu forums) And so many more. Please, Mr. Graham Cluley, I'd appreciate it. Thank you for your time and work. IIC – Steven Reply Bill says: February 26, 2012 at 3:38 pm Does Sophos AV for Mac scan, detect, and remove malware associated with kernel extensions (kext files)? Reply Jenny says: July 26, 2012 at 8:42 pm I would like to see more in the way of kext, and plist, checks. I used to subscribe to a Mac forum and the newsletter was sent out regularly. One day, it came to me 'loaded' (spoofed brilliantly, in fact) – one of the links which was particularly interesting didn't go where it should have … Thanks for the free A/V all the same! Every little helps ;) Reply Jon says: February 28, 2012 at 1:07 am Mac may have few viruses now but as Apple becomes more dominant surely they will attract more attention. It seems foolhardy not to have a deterrent in place. On the basis of the evidence can you really communicate to all your users within an organization to use Mac instead of Windows and don't bother installing AV. Brave and waiting for the problems to come. It doesn't take long to understand that Mac's are not invincible: Read Mac Hackers Handbook by Charlie Miller etc. or OS Exploits and Defense or Hacking and Securing iOS Applications. Thanks to Sophos at least some people will have some infastructure in place if a major issue is out there in the wild. And the rest what will they be thinking … 'you told me i didn't need an AV – i trusted you'…. you can profit from this perceived security for so long and then the brand will take a hammering. Just an opinion :-) Reply Jimmy says: March 12, 2012 at 3:29 am Sure Macs are great computers, but I think that Apple should have never pushed the "Macs can't get viruses". Its impossible for an operating system, as of now, to be completely immune from malware or trojans, but it is possible for an os to be extremely complicated to infect. Reply Jon Fukumoto says: April 9, 2012 at 10:12 pm Macs can be infected. All it takes is a social engineering trick to get you to install something and your Mac is infected. There’s no such thing as 100% secure. Even though there’s not as much viruses and Trojan horses compared to PCs running Windows, it’s still a good idea to use an anti-virus product like Sophos Anti-Virus for Mac. So don’t get lulled into a false sense of security that Macs can’t get infected. As Macs gain more market share, they’ll become more of a target, so protect yourself. Reply Dan Fuzz says: April 7, 2012 at 4:00 pm It' staggering how many people don't grasp the FREE bit of this. I skim read a lot of the time, but if I do comment, I always go back and read the article properly – just in case I missed something. Reply Jon Fukumoto says: April 9, 2012 at 10:04 pm One thing to note here: THERE’S NO SUCH THING AS A 100% SYSTEM. Even Macs are likely to get infected through these attacks. The attacks are getting more sophisticated, and are using social engineering techniques which also have gotten more sophisticated. Be very wary of the websites you go to. It’s a good idea to install Sophos Anti-virus for Mac. It’s free of charge and won’t impact your system. I’ve been using it to protect my system. Anyone who owns a Mac and thinks that they can’t be infected, it’s time to wake up to reality. The threat is real, and I highly recommend anyone who owns a Mac to download and install Sophos Anti-Virus. Reply Ted the Nervous says: July 5, 2012 at 8:47 am As I explained to a friend who's computer I was scanning for malware, it's like looking for a needle in a haystack… and you don't know how big the haystack is… or how many needles there are… or if there are any needles at all. You might search and search and find nothing, but that doesn't mean there aren't any needles (viruses). You might find one needle, or two, but you don't know if you've got them all. And what if someone got clever and hid a needle INSIDE a piece of straw. Yeah, we are all vulnerable, not just to the malware we know about but to the malware we don't know about. A/V is just one part of the defences. Reply Bree says: March 18, 2013 at 12:48 am i am buying a mac next week and the first thing on it will be the free sophos anti virus.Thankyou. Reply Dave says: April 10, 2013 at 9:12 pm Most viruses and malware are downloaded from peer to peer sites, windows or mac so if you want to be safe buy your software from a legitimate sources. any file can be injected with additional code to control your pc or mac – pictures / music / movies so if you don't increase your risk don't illegal download. Reply yuhong says: May 4, 2013 at 2:11 am Actually, the first Excel macro viruses was designed for Excel 5.0/95 and thus Macs was not immune.

By Alistair Charlton August 17, 2016 09:47 BST Close Embed Feed Tesla Motors: Five facts you didn't know IBTimes UK <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/19658" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> Despite the glowing reviews and widespread consumer satisfaction, Tesla has struggled for much of its short life with reliability, especially when it comes to newly-launched cars. The recent launch of the Model X highlighted the difficulties Tesla faces in getting a new car onto customers' driveways in perfect condition from day one. Several buyers found multiple fit-and-finish problems with their Model Xs, including ill-fitting panels, rust and poorly-made interiors. These problems pose a genuine threat to the success of the upcoming Model 3, the £30,000 Tesla which is due on sale in late 2017 and has already racked up over 300,000 pre-orders. To help prevent the Model 3 suffering from the same problems as the X, Tesla has reportedly hired David Erhart, Apple's former director of reliability engineering, as its new senior director of the Reliability and Test division. Erhart has over 20 years of experience in reliability engineering and holds a PhD in chemical engineering; he previously worked at Motorola and medical technology company Medtronic before joining Apple in 2013. Over 300,000 pre-orders has put huge pressure on Tesla to get the Model 3 right from day one.Tesla According to Electrek, which first broke the news, Erhart began working at Tesla in mid August and is part of the US company's efforts to increase product reliability. This move is reflected in changes made to his LinkedIn profile. The number of engineers tasked with this area of vehicle production has grown recently from "a few," says Electrek, to over 40. Reliability is becoming increasingly important for Tesla, not only because of its growing public profile but also while it attempts to ramp up production from 2,000 to 10,000 vehicles per week within the next two years. Tesla is making a habit of hiring former Apple employees, including director and vice presidents. The car maker recently hired Chester Chipperfield, a former Burberry vice president who later worked in Apple's 'Secret Projects' division; at Tesla has has taken up the role of global creative director.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search iPhone 7 dates leaked, and they’re running late JC Torres - Aug 17, 2016 2 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit September is a big month for many companies in the tech industry, mostly because of IFA, which opens the month every single. But while Apple doesn’t give the event much thought, it still times a new product announcement in September. This year, however, Cupertino might be running later than usual, in contrast to Samsung who was far too ahead. Based on leaked information, coming particularly from AT&T’s retail schedule, the iPhone 7 won’t be shipping until much later in September. So here are the estimated dates so far. Apple is expected to hold a press event on the 7th of September, just after IFA 2016, of course. Pre-orders, however, won’t open until the 9th. While that has pretty much been expected, it was also expected that the smartphone would hit stores just a week later. Based on AT&T’s retail guidance, however, that won’t be the case. Instead, the iPhone 7 will actually hit its shelves on 23rd September. That’s a good full two weeks after pre-order has started. Historically, Apple only waited a week to get things rolling. There’s always a first time for everything. Of course, nothing’s set in stone, and that leak can’t exactly be confirmed. Apple could, indeed, opt to do everything, including the press event, much later, to avoid the traffic of IFA and other companies making lots of noises. Then again, Apple always shouts the loudest, so that isn’t exactly an issue for them. As for the iPhone 7 itself, much of it has already been leaked, though the devil is always in the details. All iPhone fans will most likely be watching for the redesigned antenna lines, the absence of a headphone jack, a larger camera sensor, and, of course, a new cool blue hue.

The promise was made during a visit to senior Chinese official Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli, according to Reuters. He told him that a R&D center would be built by the end of the year. According to the report, the center will bring together Apple's engineering and operations teams in China and the company will use it to build on relationships with partners and universities. Apple has been struggling to get the sales it wants in China and it’s likely that it believes a local R&D center will help it create more relevant products for customers, as well as build trust in a government that is cautious of foreign business and technology. Tim Cook has said previously that its investment into Chinese taxi app startup Didi was so that it could learn more about the Chinese market. In Apple’s latest financials, it posted another disappointing quarter in China. Revenue in China dropped 33 per cent in Q3 2016, helping to drive a 14.6 per cent drop in revenues globally. It follows in the footsteps of Google, which announced that it would be investing more heavily in development talent in APAC, opening its first engineering hub in Singapore this year. Google also admitted that it hadn’t been optimising for its ‘next billion’ customers which would most likely come from growing markets in APAC such as Indonesia, India and China.

Sales in Greater China, once touted as Apple's next growth engine, decreased by one-third in its fiscal third quarter, after having more than doubled a year earlier.

The company's online stores for iBooks and movies closed in the country after Beijing in March imposed strict curbs on online publishing, particularly for foreign firms.

Before Cook's charm offensive in Beijing in May, Apple announced a $1bn deal with ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing, a move many experts saw as an attempt to curry favour with Beijing. Other technology firms, including Microsoft and Qualcomm, have pledged investments in China, often with mixed results.

Microsoft Makes Fun of Apple Calling the iPad a Computer GO Apple says the iPad is now a PC, thanks to the keyboard Aug 17, 2016 06:09 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  There was a time when Apple thought that putting a keyboard on a tablet was like “converging a toaster and a refrigerator,” with CEO Tim Cook himself making fun of Microsoft’s Surface, but now Cupertino seems to be really interested in this business and is even looking into ways to expand its lineup. The iPad Pro, which was launched last year in September, is Apple’s first mix of a toaster and refrigerator and comes with a detachable keyboard that makes it work more like a computer. And Apple hasn’t missed the occasion to call the iPad Pro “a computer,” but now it’s payback time for Microsoft, which mocks its rival’s marketing efforts to show what a real computer is all about. “We’ll show you what’s a PC” In a new ad released today, Microsoft pokes fun at the iPad Pro and imagines a conversation between the iPad Pro and the Surface Pro 4 that turns to be a little embarrassing for Apple. “Just because you call something a computer doesn’t mean it fits the description. Cortana knows that the Surface Pro 4, with its powerful Intel Core processor, detachable keyboard with real keys and a trackpad, pen, touchscreen, full Office and external ports fits the description. Everything else is just late to the party,” the video description reads. Brian Hall, who is the General manager of Surface at Microsoft, also took to Twitter to make fun of Apple’s efforts to turn the iPad Pro into a computer. “iPad Pro says it’s computer. Huh. We thought we'd show a little about what a real Pro and a real computer does…” he tweeted, along with a link to the video that you can watch below. Microsoft is expected to unveil new Surface models this year in October, including the second-generation Surface Book laptop, as well as the Surface Pro 5, which should come with improved features, new hardware, overhauled keyboards and pens, but also with some design refinements.

The site will bring together engineers from some of Apple’s existing centres, the company said during Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook’s visit to Beijing. Apple didn’t specify the office’s location or planned number of employees. Apple has more than doubled its number of corporate sites in China to 45 since 2011, so the move may help it consolidate some of those facilities. Its spending on research and development has quadrupled in the same time frame as investors are eager to see results from other projects Apple is exploring amid slowing iPhone sales. The Cupertino, California-based company has hired thousands of engineers to work on a self-driving car, while it’s also exploring virtual and augmented reality as potential new sources of revenue. “The centre will open later this year, bringing together our engineering and operations teams in China as we develop advanced technologies and services for our products,” Apple said. China has become an increasingly attractive location to develop new products. The total spent on manufacturing research and development in China jumped from US$92 billion (RM369 billion) in 2008 to US$243 billion in 2013, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. In the US, it increased from US$204 billion to US$221 billion in the same period. Apple has also faced mounting regulatory pressure in China. The company was forced to shut down its iTunes Movies and iBooks services there in April, six months after they were permitted to operate. It also lost a patent case against a little-known Chinese rival relating to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, along with a trademark dispute over the use of the word IPHONE on leather goods.

It humanizes the magic that can happen when engineering truths are dismissed as irrelevant. Mr. Messerschmidt went to work at Apple in 2010 after Apple bought his then-startup. He wound up on the Apple Watch team, where he spent three years before leaving to do a new startup called Cor. Fast Company interviewed Mr. Messerschmidt about his time at Apple. Engineering for Users Bob Messerschmidt’s job was to architect a heart-rate sensor, so he thought like an engineer. His solution was to put the sensors in the watch strap to position them under your wrist. That’s the easiest way to get the best, most accurate reading because skin density and the proximity of major blood vessels. At most companies, so sayeth the engineer, and so resulteth the approach. But the people in Apple’s design labs didn’t care about his engineering-based solution. According to him, he was told, “That’s not the design trend; that’s not the fashion trend. We want to have interchangeable bands so we don’t want to have any sensors in the band.” So he goes back to the drawing board for a new idea, and he tells the design group he can put it under the watch, but the strap is going to have to be a tight fit to get a reliable reading. Again, at most companies, that’s it. If you have to have a tight strap to get a good reading, better tell marketing to figure out how to sell tight straps as a feature. But no. According to Mr. Messerschmidt, the design studio said, “No, that’s not how people wear watches; they wear them like really floppy on their wrist.”   Apple Watch Back Apple Gonna Apple This strikes at the heart of what makes Apple Apple, at least in my mind. It also shows why Apple Watch has interchangeable straps and a focus on fashion. If you look at the rest of the smartwatch/wearables “industry” before Apple Watch, it was being driven by engineers—and no one was using any of it. I’ve gone on record numerous times to say I like my Apple Watch, but I don’t love it. I do use it, however, and Apple is the largest wearable computing company on the planet because of it. This is a direct result of Apple approaching this issue from the standpoint of users, rather than engineering or even design. Mr. Messerschmidt’s story cuts to the heart of this issue. When forced to think differently, rather than accepting what you thought you knew, some people can do amazing things. Or, as Mr. Messerschmidt put it, “That creates a set of requirements that drives you toward new engineering solutions.” He added, “I’m so proud of my contribution to the heart rate sensor because it’s generally discussed as the most accurate sensor that Apple has ever put in a product. It had to be, because you look at the trials and tribulations of a company like Fitbit. Fitbit is great, don’t get me wrong, but they are wading through lawsuits right now about the accuracy of the heart rate sensor. They didn’t put enough thought into the use cases.” Other Stuff There is a lot more in Fast Company‘s interview, but the story I cited above really resonated. Other highlights include insight on how some people in Apple misconstrue the lessons from Steve Jobs; the value of saying “no;” Mr. Messerschmidt’s belief that secrecy-for-secrecy’s sake misses the point; Apple’s startup structure and how it’s different from what business schools teach; and Mr. Messerschmidt’s belief that trying to “bottle” Steve Jobs (i.e. Apple University) is a mistake. It’s a good read, whether or not you agree with any of his points. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit Tags: Apple, Apple Watch Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

It seemed that Steve Jobs had brought forth the successor to the Mac. However, things have not gone as planned with the iPad, and Apple is scrambling to construct a clearer branding and imperative for the iPad. Even Microsoft senses the difficulty and has poked fun at Apple’s newfound toaster-fridge mentality. From Apple’s “iPad Pro — What’s a Computer?” Ad. A good question. At 30 seconds into this video from 1994 Steve Jobs says that the Macintosh is on the verge of becoming obsolete. To be sure, that was in the context of the old, vastly inferior Mac OS 7. Switching to a BSD Unix breathed new life into the Mac for many years, indeed decades to come. Still, tech time marches on. In early 2010, when [Mac] OS X was ten years old, Apple introduced the iPad. The thinking at the time was that this was the next step in the evolution of personal computing. It was surmised by most that the iPad would quickly surpass the PC market in sales, and its wide spread adoption would be the Next Big Thing. We reveled in the purity of the iPad. There was no need for a stylus, a point made strongly by Mr. Jobs himself referring to the design of tablets. “If you see a stylus, they blew it.” Just as the iPhone, with its virtual keyboard, made the BlackBerrys look and feel ridiculous, the iPad required no keyboard. Apple refused to sell third party keyboards in the retail stores. Even so, some companies made good money serving the modest percentage of customers who wanted a real keyboard. In a distillation of the iPad notion, Tim Cook has said: “The iPad is the clearest expression of our vision of the future of personal computing.” A Funny Thing Happened What happened next was unexpected. In 2014, iPad sales peaked and then the rate of sales growth became negative. All kinds of explanations have been offered to this complex issue. I won’t rehash them except to note that, perhaps, the iPad was able to replace the Mac and PC for a smaller fraction of customers than had been estimated. iPad Sales to date, millions, Fiscal Qtr The Mac has unexpectedly endured. Flourished. In order to revitalize the iPad, Apple has explored many ideas. Much faster A[X] SoCs have helped, but that hasn’t translated into pervasive iPad cravings. iOS 9 and 10 have been revised to confer more power on the user to get things done. Features such as Slide Over, Split View and Picture in Picture have been introduced. Apple has introduced a rather capable stylus called the Apple Pencil and has legitimized the keyboard. The sum of this effort so far, however, has served to both create a new iPad narrative and also muddy the branding waters. On one hand, it seems to make sense that if the iPad were to appeal to a broader audience, sales could be resuscitated. On the other, Apple may have backed itself into a corner. The result is the following ad. Upon seeing this ad, our own Bryan Chaffin felt that it was basically a Surface Pro ad featuring an iPad Pro. In other words, Microsoft may have had the crisper vision all along in that portable computing devices still need a stylus and a keyboard for serious work, must have an Intel processor to run X86 binaries and need the full power of a productivity OS like Windows 10. Oh, how times have changed. Next page: Microsoft keeps the faith and has some fun with Apple’s ad.

The iPad Pro is a visual creative device that finally realized the potential of the original iPad as a digital art/illustration platform. It’s a creative professional’s tool that is a companion to their desktop, not a laptop replacement. The fact that the Pencil exists proves that point in my opinion. But someone got scared by the Surface and tried to promote it as a do-all machine and all that succeeded in doing is muddy what the Pro was for and make it compete with the MacBook Air for no reason. BTW, the auto-login feature on MacObserver still doesn’t work. August 17, 2016 at 9:27 EST AM andrewj050790 August 17, 2016 Re-posting. Hey guys! I don’t comment much, but read you guys frequently and enjoy the podcasts quite a bit. 🙂 Now that that’s out of the way. Could John please point out to me when Apple started shipping OSX on the iPad? This, IMO, is the point of the “what is a computer” commercial. Apple is not selling a toaster/fridge until they sell a Surface like device aka a tablet that runs an OS designed for a mouse. I am the market that Apple was aiming that commercial at, except I replaced my MacBook Air with an iPad Pro as soon as I could get my hands on one. I use it as my “computer”. But, for teaching, its better than a MacBook because of the pencil, in conjunction with presenting things in class. I think Microsoft, and John and Bryan, unfortunately missed the point of the Apple ad. That’s still apples fault, though, for not making the point clearly enough. I don’t see flailing for a correct vision for the iPad, but an evolution of the ipads capabilities that made it suitable for me to replace my Mac (and Apple highlighted this reality in an ad). August 17, 2016 at 12:32 EST PM Paul Goodwin August 17, 2016 I don’t think Microsoft had the right idea all along at all. The 9.7″ iPad is as nearly a perfect computing device for what it was designed to do as anything designed before or since. A Surface or iPad Pro are a different animal, a hybrid of the tablet and laptop. They’re both a compromise for either function. When I do “real work”, I have the 9.7″ iPad right next to the laptop. It takes no reconfiguring. I have the right tools for whatever it is I need to do. Why compromise? August 17, 2016 at 11:41 EST PM FlipFriddle August 18, 2016 It’s still relative though. “Real work” on an iPad Pro to me REQUIRES the large one. For painting and illustration there is never enough screen real estate, so for me the 9.7″ is a compromise. August 18, 2016 at 1:34 EST PM wab95 August 19, 2016 John (& Bryan): Without doubt, something is fuzzy and out of focus, although in my view (no pun intended) it is not Apple’s strategy for the iPad. That the normally incisive voices at TMO, which peal clarion-like against the background of the bemused white noise of muddled analysis and click-bait artistry, should wax ambivalent about the messaging and marketing strategy of the iPad, and to some extent, embrace MS’s marketing message that Apple is a Johnny-come-lately with their version of MS’s toaster-fridge, suggests fumbled messaging by Apple. I see this very differently. While I concede that many very knowledgeable and intelligent analysts believe that the post-PC era was/is about a PC replacement device, and that since the iPad, including the Pro models, do not replace the PC in use case and functional capacity, the iPad has therefore failed as a PC replacement, I see this as fundamental misconception. One consequence of this fogginess is that it creates a climate in which equivalence can be drawn between two quite distinct devices (the iPad and the Surface Pro) that can compete in the same niche in which many formerly PC-exclusive capabilities can now be done by touchscreen capable devices. For some analysts, this appears to be an attempt to move beyond the PC, and because both have a touch screen and both can use a keyboard, and since MS had their dedicated keyboard first, Apple is merely following after MS. And that both are trying to create post-PC toaster fridge. Where even to begin? I suggest that we begin with context, namely the long game of building a comprehensive platform that Apple appear to be doing (and which TC appears to be arguing, however unsuccessfully https://www.macobserver.com/columns-opinions/the-back-page/tim-cooks-apple-ambitions-include-health-care-everything-part-life/). This platform includes an integrated and functionally complementary system of devices and services that free the user from conforming their work and play to the limitations of a single device (the PC) to working and playing in a wide arena that enhances not only productivity, but creativity and the joy in doing so. In my view, this is what the post-PC era is, and nothing that I have seen from Apple or heard in any address appears, again in my layman’s view, to contradict this. In that endeavour, the iPad is born. And because that platform includes many capable options, Apple can take their time to develop and extend the capability of this device and evolve its role in that platform. Will this device appeal to everyone and even address the same needs for each individual? Of course not, but bear in mind, we are in an arc that will be measured not in fiscal quarters, but likely in generations, and a generation has already been born that is being reared on the touch screen. Make no mistake, Apple know this, and hence the investment in iOS. It is the future, which conceptually is not synonymous with, ‘the Mac and OS X are not the future’. This is not a zero sum enterprise. As to the specific advert in which Apple demonstrate a specific use case in which the Surface competes, to me it is clear that Apple are saying, ‘Ours is a robust and versatile device. If what drives you to want the Surface is this feature set, then behold. We give you, the iPad. It does that, too. And then some’. The ‘and then some’ includes that fact that it is a fully functional device without any add-ons, something that cannot be said for the Surface. All this is to simply say that, as this platform continues to expand, and the iPad itself becomes more capable, its use case amongst a nascent clientele will co-evolve into something this present (and passing) generation can only dimly suspect, but cannot replicate because we’re simply not there yet. It’s not about ‘keeping the faith’, but like Magellan, reading the currents and knowing where you’re going, to that pass in the South, even if no one else can quite see it as you do. That’s not faith, but the knowledge-based execution of a plan. August 19, 2016 at 2:36 EST PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Bloomberg reported that Intel has licensed the right to make ARM processors, which is an interesting development for both Apple and Intel. Intel Intel benefits from taking an ARM license in many different ways. The first is that ARM is eating Intel’s lunch in the mobile space. Sure, Intel would prefer that Intel processors were driving the move to mobile, but having failed to make that happen, making ARM processors for others is substantially better than not being involved at all. Related, an ARM license will allow Intel to optimize its best-in-class fabrication facilities. Chip fabrication facilities can cost billions, and an idle fab is a fab not making money. To this end, Intel announced this week a deal with LG to make some of the Korean company’s processors. Apple The case for Apple is very different, but it starts with Samsung. Apple and Samsung are bitter rivals and close manufacturing partners, too. Samsung has long made most of Apple’s Ax processors, and Samsung built a fab in Manor, TX (outside Austin) for this very purpose. Samsung earned that business by being one of the best at making ARM processors, but who among us thinks Apple wouldn’t be pleased as punch to send that business to someone else? Apple has given some foundry business to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC), but Samsung is still a major partner in Apple’s chip business. Another aspect is the price Apple pays for its chips. One of the company’s specialties is pitting component makers against each other to get the best quality at the lowest price. While TSMC has only been able to earn some of Apple’s foundry business, Intel could conceivably earn it all. Intel has the resources, engineering brilliance, facilities, and skill to become a heavy weight in ARM fabrication. A major new competitor in the foundry space means Apple can extract that much more value out of its contracts. All in all, it’s a good move for Intel and good news for Apple.

Their first foray was in the early 2000s with the Intel® PXA26x Processor Family. It was cool at the time, but Intel sold that part off. I guess they thought their Atom processor was better. August 17, 2016 at 2:08 EST AM JustCause August 17, 2016 If you can’t beat the market right now, join the market until you find a way to beat it. Bridging the economic gap until a solution is found is a smart approach. And for Apple it’s huge, leveraging three vendors against each other is always better, if they could only find a fourth and fifth (maybe Foxconn will jump in ) August 17, 2016 at 3:32 EST AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Like this story, share it with millions of investors on M3 Apple to increase investment in increasingly tough China Demand for Apple's phones has plummeted in China, and the government maintains a wary attitude towards foreign technology. This is at least the CEO's second trip to the country in four months. Post Your Comments Share Cancel Apple Inc will boost its investment in China, one of its most important but increasingly difficult markets, and build its first Asia-Pacific research and development centre in the country, Chief Executive Tim Cook said on Tuesday. Demand for Apple's phones has plummeted in China, and the government maintains a wary attitude towards foreign technology. This is at least the CEO's second trip to the country in four months. Apple's new research and development centre will be built by the end of the year, Cook told Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli, one of China's most senior officials, according to the official Chinese state broadcaster. The pledge comes after the head of China's industry and technology regulator in May told Cook he hoped Apple could deepen its cooperation with the country in research and development and stressed information security. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sales in Greater China, once touted as Apple's next growth engine, decreased by a third in its most recent quarterly results, after having more than doubled a year earlier. Not only is a slowdown of the world's second-largest economy stoking concerns, but the company's stores for books and movies also went dark in China earlier this year. Apple has also lost intellectual property battles and faced anti-US sentiment from consumers. Before Cook's charm offensive in Beijing in May, Apple announced a $1 billion deal with ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing, a move many experts saw as an attempt to curry favour with Beijing. Other tech firms have in the past pledged investment in China while facing difficulties in the country, including Microsoft Corp and Qualcomm Inc, but often with mixed results.

Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Aug 16, 2016 at 7:38PM Image source: Getty Images. Wearable technology, like fitness trackers and smartwatches, is a quickly growing tech segment. By 2020, nearly 213 million wearable devices will be shipped worldwide, and its market size is expected to reach nearly $29 billion this year.  All of this growth is causing most technology companies to build out their wearable tech business segments, including InvenSense (NYSE:INVN), Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). While these companies have different approaches to the wearable market, all of them have one thing in common: Their price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) are well below the industry average. That makes their stock shares cheaper, relative to their peers -- but it doesn't necessarily mean they're a good buy.  Let's take a look at each of the companies listed above and whether their cheap price is worth a look from investors.  Apple's smartwatch dominance Apple is trading at just below 13 times its earnings right now, far below the tech sector average of about 25. The company isn't a wearable tech pure play, of course (not many companies are), but it does have a dominant smartwatch position and its stock price still has plenty of room to grow.   Despite Apple's drop in smartwatch sales in the most recent quarter, the company is still the No. 1 smartwatch vendor by far. Apple shipped 1.6 million smartwatches in Q2 2016 and Samsung, the No. 2 vendor, shipped just 600,000, according to IDC.  Tractica predicts the Apple Watch will remain the dominant smartwatch until at least 2020. And Apple is doing everything it can to make sure that happens. KGI Securities analyst Ming-chi Kuo thinks Apple will debut not just one but two new updated Apple Watches this year.  Those devices, along with an expected price cut, will likely help Apple retain its lead in the market it essentially created.  Apple's low P/E, strong wearables position, and upcoming Apple Watch refresh should continue to make this tech stalwart a smart play for wearable tech investors. InvenSense's wearable tech angle Technically speaking, InvenSense's P/E ratio is currently negative. That means that the company's earnings are negative (i.e., it's losing money) and therefore doesn't have a positive P/E ratio. InvenSense makes motion sensors for mobile devices, but it's started focusing more on Internet of Things solutions recently, like sensors for wrist-worn wearable devices and GPS for smartwatches and fitness trackers. The company is a prime example of an unwise investment, despite its stock price being technically cheap and the fact that it's making products in a market with lots of potential. InvenSense's problems stem from its history of making motion sensors for Apple's and Samsung's smartphones. The company allows both tech giants to put too much pricing pressure on its sensors, which drove down the average selling price (ASP) of its products and, by association, its margins and profits.  On top of that, Apple and Samsung have made up the vast majority of InvenSense's revenues. Samsung's percentage has dropped recently, but Apple's business accounted for 40% of InvenSense's total revenue in fiscal 2016.  InvenSense says the ASP of some of its wearable technology is three to four times the price of its mobile sensors. That's a good thing as the company moves forward in the space, but InvenSense is still far too reliant on Apple, and that probably won't change any time soon.  InvenSense is pivoting to more to the Internet of Things (which includes wearables), but investors are getting burned waiting for the company to diversify its revenue sources.  Moral of the story: Cheap stocks don't always equal a bargain.  Skyworks Solutions has a similar dilemma  Skyworks makes analog and mixed signal semiconductors for Apple, Samsung, and a long list of other companies. The company's stock currently trades at just over 13 times its earnings, similar to Apple's. While Skyworks' technology has focused a lot on mobile devices in the past, you can now find its tech, like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), in fitness trackers and smartwatches. Just like InvenSense, Skyworks has relied too much on Samsung and Apple and is in the process of diversifying its customers and revenue streams. But up to 40% has come from Apple as recently as last year. Even with its low P/E, relying too much on Apple for the majority of its revenue leaves Skyworks too vulnerable to be a solid wearable tech play.  Of course, these aren't all the cheap wearable tech plays available, and investors looking for solid Internet of Things stocks certainly have their pick right now. But of the three listed above I'd choose the boring, but extremely stable and profitable, Apple.  Chris Neiger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

This unprecedented commitment, combined with zero waste compliance from all final assembly sites, furthers Apple’s efforts to help manufacturers lower their carbon footprint and reduce waste in China, helping to advance China’s transition to a new green economy. Lens Technology has committed to power all of its glass production for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by the end of 2018, as part of Apple’s industry-leading supply chain clean energy program announced last year. Lens is the first supplier to make a clean energy commitment for all of its Apple production, and will meet its goal through an unprecedented power purchase agreement with local wind projects. Apple is working with suppliers to help transform the environmental landscape in China, and is proud to announce all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The UL standard certifies all of their manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or, when necessary, converted into energy. Since the program began in January 2015, the sites have diverted more than 140,000 metric tons of waste from landfills. “We want to show the world that you can manufacture responsibly and we’re working alongside our suppliers to help them lower their environmental impact in China,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives. “We congratulate Lens for their bold step, and hope by sharing the lessons we’ve learned in our transition to renewable energy, our suppliers will continue to access clean power projects, moving China closer to its green manufacturing goals.” “Our power purchase agreement is the first of its kind in southern China and we hope it will serve as an example for other companies looking to transition to cleaner, more economical sources of power,” said Lens CEO Zhou Qunfei. “We’re pleased to be the first supplier to commit to covering all of our Apple production with renewable energy, and proud to source from local Hunan wind farms to power our facilities in Changsha.” Lens’ manufacturing with Apple currently includes two facilities in Changsha, Hunan province. Wind energy will cover 100 percent of the energy consumed producing Apple products at Lens facilities by 2018, avoiding nearly 450,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, equivalent to the energy use in 380,000 Chinese homes. Through its clean energy program, Apple will partner with suppliers in China to install more than 2 gigawatts of new clean energy in the coming years, avoiding over 20 million metric tons of greenhouse gas pollution in the country between now and 2020. Foxconn committed in October to construct 400 megawatts of solar, starting in Henan province, by 2018. The manufacturer is now well on its way to constructing the first 80 megawatts of that commitment. Earlier this year, Foxconn final assembly sites at Guanlan and Taiyuan were the first in China to receive UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill validation. With the recent addition of 12 manufacturing sites, all of Apple’s final assembly production in China is now zero waste compliant. “We applaud innovative companies, like Apple, that are leading by actively reducing the environmental impact of manufacturing operations,” said UL president and CEO Keith Williams. “Achieving zero waste is an extensive effort that requires close coordination across all facets of a company’s operations, especially when the commitment is global.” Apple has taken significant steps to protect the environment by transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy. Today, the company is powering 100 percent of its operations in China and the US, and more than 93 percent of its worldwide operations, with renewable energy.

Sara Snyder, USA TODAY The S Pen has been improved for the Note 7. (Photo: Edward C. Baig) NEW YORK — Expect Apple, as has widely been speculated, to unveil a brand new iPhone next month. And expect the yardstick by which many folks will measure it against to be the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 that becomes available Aug. 19. I’ve gotten to test Samsung’s latest pen-based phablet in advance and it’s a winner, a handsome slab of metal and glass that is slightly bigger and modeled after the South Korean company’s other flagship smartphone. That would be the Galaxy S7, or, to be more precise, the Galaxy S7 edge, since the Note 7 can convert a narrow portion along either edge of its dual curved 5.7-inch screen into a secondary display. With a gentle swipe, you can surface shortcuts along the edge to apps or people, Yahoo news snippets, even a ruler or compass. Both curvy Galaxy's have a substantial feel to them, with narrow bezels and smooth, almost slippery, backs. Both have fast-to-fire cameras that can produce splendid pictures and video. REVIEWED.COM SMARTPHONES Samsung's Note 7 is the best smartphone camera yet If I’m nitpicking, I still think that Samsung's hardware outshines its software, which I find a bit less friendly than Apple's. That said, Note 7 is a powerhouse, with features and capabilities that Apple has failed to deliver on the iPhone so far, including fast wireless charging, expandable storage and water resistance. It becomes the leading Android alternative to whatever Apple cooks up in a new iPhone, especially for those of us who appreciate phablet-size devices, the category of large phone/small tablet hybrids that Samsung pioneered five years ago. The Note 7 also makes the use of a digital stylus Samsung calls the S Pen, improved for this version. Galaxy Note 7 S Pen options  (Photo: Edward C Baig) Of course, at $850 on up (from all the major U.S. carriers), Note 7 doesn’t come cheap. Let me call out one feature right off the bat: Note 7 has a conventional headphone jack, something I wouldn’t normally go out of my way to mention. But Apple is rumored to be leaving out the jack on the new iPhone, giving way, apparently, to increasingly popular wireless Bluetooth headphones, or headphones that connect via Apple’s proprietary Lightning port. We’ll see. Note 7 also includes the emerging USB Type-C connector. There’s an adapter in the box for those of you who still need to connect a USB cable. Here’s a look at what else in Note 7 is noteworthy: S Pen. The latest digital stylus has a ballpoint-pen type tip that feels more natural to write with than prior versions. While I reckon most of you will use the S Pen to jot notes or draw, its bag of tricks has been expanded. For one thing, you can hover over a word with the pen to translate it into a foreign language. For another, you can hover to magnify text. And you can capture and crop video content that you can turn into an animated shareable GIF. Nice. You can write on the Note 7 screen when it is underwater.  (Photo: Edward C Baig) Moreover, when you’re on the lock screen and pull the S Pen out of the compartment where you stash it, you can immediately write a memo on the “always-on” screen, and pin it there, a handy reminder, say, to pick up milk or the laundry. Since the pen, like the phone, is water resistant, you can even write on the screen when your mischievous kid takes it into the pool, not that I’m condoning such behavior. Eye-pleasing security? The idea that you can stare into the phone to unlock the screen, get past Web logins, or pay for stuff sounds really cool and it is. And it doesn’t take long for the phone to train the phone to recognize your iris. Once my eyeballs were scan-able this form of hands-free authentication worked way more often than it did not. The truth though is that at least when it comes to unlocking the phone I found it easier and even faster to employ other methods: drawing a pattern on the screen (with your finger) or using the fingerprint scanner. Still, Samsung has grand plans for iris recognition. The company is working with at least six major global banks, including Citi, U.S. Bank and Bank of America, on implementing the technology in lieu of passwords. The Note 7 already can be used with the Samsung Pay mobile payments system, a rival to Apple Pay and Android Pay. Samsung has also added a Secure Folder where you can keep sensitive apps and data isolated on the phone away from prying eyes, perhaps a list of passwords or your passport info. You can keep two versions of the same app on the phone, but use different account credentials for the app you keep in the Secure Folder as opposed to the app you keep outside. The phone also relies on what Samsung claims as a defense-grade mobile security system called Knox, primarily targeted at enterprise customers. Also notable. I didn’t conduct formal battery tests, but Note 7 does have a bigger battery than prior models. In mixed use I didn’t fret that the phone would poop out prematurely. If you do run out of juice, you can charge up the phone in a hurry, either via the supplied cable adaptor or via an optional wireless charging pad accessory. The phone comes with 64GB of storage, but which is generous. You can expand capacity (up to 256GB) via microSD. Samsung also claims the Note 7 display is the first to take advantage of High Dynamic Range or HDR mobile video streaming on a smartphone, similar to video used on 4K TVs, and not to confused with the HDR photography feature on many phones. Without getting bogged down in the details, what I can report is that the display looks terrific. In fact, terrific applies to the Note as a whole. The focus now shifts to Apple. THE BOTTOM LINE Samsung Galaxy Note 7 www.samsung.com $850 on up. Pro. Powerful phone has excellent camera and display, souped-up S Pen, water resistant, expandable storage, iris recognition, fast wireless charging option Con. Expensive. Software can be bit confusing.

Apple also announced today that major Chinese touchscreen glass supplier Lens Technology has committed to running its Apple-focused operations entirely with renewable energy by the end of 2018. "We're pleased to be the first supplier to commit to covering all of our Apple production with renewable energy, and proud to source from local Hunan wind farms to power our facilities in Changsha," says Lens CEO Zhou Qunfei in a statement. A further effort by Apple to get in Beijing's good books It's not clear exactly where, how big, or how expensive the Chinese R&D center will be, but the move represents a further effort by Apple to get in Beijing's good books. Earlier this year the company announced a $1 billion investment in ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing, which Cook said was being made "for a number of strategic reasons, including a chance to learn more about certain segments of the China market." That market has proven challenging for Apple of late, despite being a primary source of growth over the past couple of years. The iTunes movies and iBookstore were recently shut down by authorities, reportedly prompting Cook's first visit to the country this year, and sales have slowed for the past two quarters. "We remain very optimistic about the long-term opportunities in Greater China and we continue to invest there," Cook said on Apple's most recent earnings call.

This job posting was spotted by Music Business Worldwide in which it reveals what Apple might have in mind for their music streaming service. According to the job listing, “We’re looking for a manager to lead a team of lyrics curators with excellent writing skills, music knowledge, and attention to detail. Passion for technology and a will to question the current workflows with the mindset to improve tools and processes. General understanding, love, and ideally, experience in writing lyrics.” It should be noted that Apple is planning on bringing support for lyrics in Apple Music come iOS 10, but right now it is unclear as to how Apple is getting those lyrics, whether it be that they are aggregating them from other websites, or if they are being provided by the labels themselves, or if they are transcribing them in-house. It is also unclear as to what the exact role a lyrics curation manager will fulfil at Apple Music, but if anything it does sound like they’re definitely trying to beef up the platform’s features.

Because of this, it’s really no longer a surprise to hear about a new partnership the company makes with a musical talent. So when Apple Music announced its agreement with Cash Money Records, it came as a big shock to those who have been keeping a close eye on the music label. This means that Apple Music has moved on from signing exclusive deals with artists individually and has decided to work with a big label. Taking to his Instagram account to announce the news, Cash Money co-founder and record artist Birdman posted a photo with a caption: “It’s official… Cash Money makes a power move with Apple Music.” The power move referred to by the artist likely means that Apple Music now has access to exclusive content from the artists under the label, which include Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne, and Young Money. Drake is another artist under the label who already signed a $19 million deal with Apple Music just a year ago. After signing the contract with Drake, Apple Music was able to make the most from a two-week exclusive deal with the artist’s album, Views; which was released in April and shortly became a record breaker. The deal also included funding for Drake’s One Dance video, which is still officially unavailable on YouTube. With the deal between Cash Money and Apple, it is likely that artists under the label can get free promotion on both Apple Music and iTunes. This is the same deal that was seen during Taylor Swift’s tour documentary. As of this writing, nothing has been made official yet. But if there’s anything that can be expected from this partnership, it would be the fact that this spells bad news for Apple Music’s competition; particularly Spotify.

Cash Money is home to Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj and Drake, with whom Apple already has an exclusive deal. Co-founder Bryan Williams, who performs under the stage name Birdman, posted a picture to his Instagram account yesterday alongside Larry Jackson, the head of Apple’s original music content, with both executives holding their chins pensively. The photo celebrated Apple agreeing to fund a documentary for the label, according to people familiar with the deal. It is not, as many had speculated after the photo, an agreement to secure all of Cash Money’s new albums exclusively, the people said.   http://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/apple-music-signs-game-changing-label-deal-cash-money-records/ @thelarryjackson @applemusic #Biggathenlife #lifestyle A photo posted by Birdman5star (@birdman5star) on Aug 16, 2016 at 2:46pm PDT The documentary marks another step in Apple’s effort to develop television programming. It has signed up Gwyneth Paltrow, Gary Vaynerchuk and will.i.am as judges for its Planet of the Apps reality show, which will see app developers fight it out to win venture capital investment, and in July it secured Carpool Karaoke, a spinoff of the popular segment in CBS’s Late Late Show with James Corden where global popstars sing along to their hits as they drive through Los Angeles. It is also funding a six-part miniseries starring Dr Dre called Vital Signs, The Hollywood Reporter reported in February. Apple has been tentatively investigating ways to expand its television content as it seeks to build on its streaming music service, which was introduced in 2015. Views, Drake’s fourth studio album, debuted at the top of the charts in May after a one-week exclusive on Apple Music. Views has remained near the top of the charts ever since, and ranks at No. 11 as of yesterday, according to Billboard. Apple also used a Drake song in an advertisement featuring Taylor Swift. Minaj is a co-owner of Tidal, a rival music service. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week How Apple lost China to two unknown local smartphone makers Facebook reportedly built a censorship tool for China (VIDEO) Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Facebook in crosshairs as fake news battle heats up Twitter boss briefly suspended from his own network Facebook in crosshairs as fake news battle heats up Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Three Star Wars drones to land before Christmas (VIDEO) Facebook fake news writer on how he possibly influenced the US election Zuckerberg says he’ll take steps to solve Facebook fake news Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: China goes global as Trump puts America first Reuters Video: Facebook crafts censorship tool to re-enter China, says NYT Kids and parents react to 'Beauty and the Beast' MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants MMOTV: A Red Shirts supporter hurls abuse at Bersih supporters Related Articles So, is it worth asking Santa for an iPhone 7 (or 7 Plus)?

Rather than adopt a mobile payment solution like Apple or Android Pay, CVS wants to streamline the experience of picking up a prescription and paying. In its app (cleverly called CVS Pay), the retail pharmacy chain will cobble together rewards and payment options, including flexible or health spending accounts. TNW Answers Your questions answered by founders, experts and thought leaders in business, design and tech. Join a chat Brian Tilzer, CVS Health’s Chief Digital Officer, tells TechCrunch it’s about simplicity: What we’re trying to do is provide real utility and solve real problems for customers using digital. With one scan, we’re taking away three or four extra steps that customers have lived with for a long time. It has to be more than just payments. The value is in combining a couple of these things, and the examples in the market where that has happened have worked really well. It makes a good bit of sense, but also feels like overkill. CVS’ largest competitor, Walgreens, makes its Balance Rewards card available via the Wallet app for iOS, and uses Apple Pay for payment processing. In my experience, it’s as simple as the cashier scanning the pass and me using Apple Pay to complete the transaction. CVS thinks its own solution is a winner, though. It’s definitely a bit more streamlined, but I’m doubtful customers will want yet another app or service with their credit card information. The company isn’t swearing off Apple Pay altogether — it’s just putting all of its eggs into its own basket.

But the smartwatch category is in steep decline as more of these “useless fruity devices fill the sock drawer”. International Data Corporation (IDC)has said that the world's smartwatch market declined 32% YoY in Q2, down substantially to 3.5 million units from 5.1 million shipped in the corresponding quarter in 2015. It defines a smartwatch as a wearable that can run third-party apps – the Apple Watch, Moto 360, and Gear S2. It excludes fitness trackers. As usual, Apple held the top position, but it was the only vendor to experience a cataclysmic drop – it lost 55% YoY growth to 1.6 million units while Samsung, at number two spot, picked up 51% growth to .6 million units. Lenovo was a surprise entrant at number three picking up 75% growth, admittedly from a lower base. LG also sold .3 million units, up 26%. Garmin was number five with .1 million units, up 25%. IDC is not hesitant to criticise Apple for popularising the category and then attempting to exploit it via an expensive, aspirational, device with very limited function. It hopes the new Watch OS and Watch 2 will breathe life back into this product line. iCharts  Buoyed by its success over Apple, Samsung’s new Gear S3 looks even better as it moves to decouple the smartwatch from the smartphone. This has opened up distribution via the telco channel. The Gear S2 is all we can comment on (iTWire review here), and it is a great extension to the smartphone, offering good crossover fitness features and smart notifications.  There are rumours of three editions – a Classic (Sports), Explorer (IP rated), and a luxury version with a very Rolex-like rotating bezel. There are rumours of a version for bicycle use (cadence) and of course these will integrate with Samsung’s Bluetooth IconX wireless buds. It is likely these will have the universal embedded SIM for 3/4G use, but so far people have baulked at paying fees to two carriers. Sensors will likely include an altimeter (altitude), a barometer (atmospheric pressure), speedometer (velocity), pedometer (steps), heart rate (Continuous), and GPS (location tracking and mapping). It may also have V02 estimation. If that is the case, it will be only marginally behind Microsoft’s amazing 11 sensors in the Band 2.  Whether this will work with iOS is still unclear – Samsung announced it was working on iOS for the S2 in January.

Apple Watch: A wrist too far? September 10, 2014 by Scott Rosenberg 6 Comments Watching the Apple show yesterday, as Tim Cook and company unveiled the new Apple Watch, you couldn’t help noticing how carefully, ritualistically they landed on the words “personal” and “intimate.” Steven Levy noticed this, and wrote: Apple is one of the world’s biggest, most profitable and most powerful companies. It is a corporate Leviathan. Yet it has staked its claim on intimacy, tapping the private impulses of hundreds of millions of users. Two ways in which the Watch gets personal: It’s backed with four sensors that both track your vital signs and can nudge and tap you. (Levy: “When it ‘pokes’ you, it’s not virtual. You feel it.”) And you can take the data from your heartbeat and share it with others — who’ll see an animated heart on their watches, throbbing in time to your actual pulse. So what is this all about? On one level, Apple is taking a shot at Facebook. It’s saying, forget your faux friending. We are going deeper here. We are going to return the idea of digital relationships to something real. We will touch and connect hearts. (On Tuesday, Apple chose to share its own heart with Twitter by posting live tweets beneath the video stream of its product unveiling, and apparently the technical fallout from that choice led to the disastrous failure of the broadcast.) Levy recounts the “thrilling and disturbing” implications of this ultrapersonal datasharing. The idea of “biorhythm hacking” is certainly hackle-raising. But it’s also an essentially abstract fear — creepy but not imperilling (yet). My nightmare scenario is different: It lies in the dangers of putting the marketplace on our wrists, giving merchants a line on our pulses and access to our sensitive skin. We’ve already witnessed how quickly smartphone notifications moved from convenience to annoyance. The Apple Watch represents the next loop of this cycle: We will invite its alerts onto our arms for their utility, and then hve to deal with a tangle of permissions and restrictions — or soon face tap overload. It’s easy to imagine useful and convenient applications of the Apple Watch’s private wrist-tap. You’re in line at a restaurant, and instead of having to carry one of those buzzing-flashing hunks of plastic, you just await a gentle watch nudge. “Your table is ready” sounds pretty great. But then you’re walking past a display in a store — one enhanced by an Apple iBeacon, perhaps — and your watch throbs. Its message: “Buy this toaster! It’s on sale!” Maybe not so great. When your watch knows that your heartbeat has quickened as you stand in front of a product display (or, for that matter, as you scan a review), it knows that you are what the ad people call a “qualified prospect.” Will the companies involved be able to resist using that data? Here, history is not on the individual’s side. Every opportunity that large public companies have had to use our data to sell us things has been grabbed. We have mumbled the occasional objection but mostly gone along with these passive transactions, in which bits and pieces of our behavioral data become imperfect but irritating marketing profiles. The Apple Watch could be an alarmingly efficient interface between the corporate and the corporeal, messaging our nervous systems and monetizing our gestures. We don’t have to let this happen, of course. Sometimes we jealously guard the realm of the “personal” and “intimate”; other times, we casually open it to strangers. We make these choices based on whims and hunches more often than on forethought and reason. Apple is betting that we will fall so goofily in love with its tiny gleaming bundle of silicon and sapphire that we will overlook these qualms. Based on recent experience, I would not rush to bet against the company. We might be so mesmerized by Apple’s interface magic and gadget smarts that we don’t care that it is invading our bodies. Or we might look down at our own wrists and say, “This has gone too far.” Post Revisions: September 10, 2014 @ 08:50:35 [Current Revision] by Scott Rosenberg September 10, 2014 @ 08:50:35 by Scott Rosenberg September 10, 2014 @ 08:37:18 by Scott Rosenberg Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Email Print Filed Under: Features, Project REPORT AN ERROR Get Scott’s weekly Wordyard email Notes from me and the week's collection of links and quotes.

Much respeck. ✊🏾 A photo posted by Larry Jackson (@thelarryjackson) on Aug 14, 2016 at 10:23am PDT Over the last year, Apple Music has signed exclusive streaming deals with Future, Drake, and Chance The Rapper, among others. Now, it seems that the ubiquitous tech company has inked a deal with one of rap music's first moguls, Birdman. Apple Music's head of content, Larry Jackson, announced the deal with Birdman in an Instagram post over the weekend. According to Billboard, an anonymous source confirmed the deal on Tuesday. "Welcome to the fam @birdman5star," Jackson wrote on Instagram. "Tough negotiator. Much respeck." Birdman posted the same photo on Instagram on Tuesday night, linking to an article about the deal published by Music Business Worldwide. If Apple Music's reported contract with Birdman includes his Cash Money Records label, the deal would mark the company's first with a full label. Birdman has previously announced plans for two upcoming releases: his solo album, Ms. Gladys and a Rich Gang compilation entitled The Lifestyle 2. Representatives for Birdman and Apple Music were not immediately available for comment.

Photo / Getty Images Google nailed email with the 2004 introduction of Gmail. Now it's the No. 1 form of electronic correspondence in the US. But as traditional email falls out of favour with a growing sliver of the population, Google has struggled to make its messaging tools relevant or introduce new ones that resonate with younger users. Now Google is trying again with a new video chat application called Duo. The app works with mobile devices running Google's Android operating system and Apple's iOS. It runs on Wi-Fi and cellular networks, automatically switching between different types and speeds of connection and adjusting video quality. Duo also uses phone numbers, rather than a Google account or Gmail address, making it easier to call friends, family and other people already stored on smartphone contact lists. The company's existing video calling and messaging app, Hangouts, requires a Google account which limited adoption, especially in emerging markets. Facebook's WhatsApp and Messenger, Skype -- now owned by Microsoft -- and Apple's FaceTime used phone numbers to grow faster. A confusing array of communication options has held Google back. It has two e-mail services -- Gmail, which is the top e-mail service in the US based on unique visitors, according to ComScore, and Inbox; three text offerings, Hangouts, Messenger and the upcoming Allo; and now two video chat services, Duo and Hangouts (which offers texting and video calls). This scattershot approach, and Google's late start, is becoming more costly for the Alphabet division as messaging evolves from a simple way to communicate quickly into one of the next big technology platforms supporting digital commerce, advertising and new services powered by artificial-intelligence. Continued below. Related Content Spark pays full-time workers $40k minimum What it's really like to work at Microsoft John Drinnan: From enemies to best of friends "Google missed it because of the requirement that you needed a Google ID to communicate with others," said Ankit Jain, a former Googler and executive at SimilarWeb, which measures website and mobile app usage. Hangouts ranked 84th among Android apps in the US in July, based on installs and usage, according to SimilarWeb. That lagged Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Snapchat. Nick Fox, a 13-year Google veteran, was tasked by Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai 18 months ago with fixing the sprawl. Soon after, his new team formulated a strategy and started building Duo and Allo. "Google sees communication as this essential human need, whether that's through text, a picture, calling someone or doing a video call." Fox said in a recent interview. Google sees communication as this essential human need, whether that's through text, a picture, calling someone or doing a video call. This insight is a decade old and has guided Facebook's strategy since its creation in 2004. Asian companies, like Tencent Holdings's WeChat and Line, have grown into tech powerhouses by connecting people through communication apps and offering related services on top of their networks. Skype, founded in 2003, became a leading video chat app on a similar foundation. So how is Fox going to catch up? Job number one is clearing up the bloated smorgasbord of Google communications services. Hangouts will be a workplace service, offering group video conferencing mostly via desktop computers and office laptops, Fox said. It will be integrated more with Google's work software, such as Docs, Sheets and Slides, which will be easier to share. Duo is a mobile app and only allows one-to-one video calling, limiting it as a consumer offering. Allo, a messaging service coming out later this year, will also target consumers, Fox said. Google's Messenger is a basic text system, part of a group of services provided to wireless carriers that work closely with Android. The second tactic: Bringing what Fox says is better technology to the new services to catch up with rivals. Duo constantly performs "bandwidth estimation" to understand how much video can be delivered. If Wi-Fi weakens, it switches to a phone's cellular network. If a cellular signal drops as low as 2G, Duo will automatically cut video and maintain audio. Once you get people to love it, they will share it with friends and co-workers and it grows. Allo will use Google's expertise in AI to automatically understand texts and provide useful suggestions. Google will also let third-party developers create chatbots that will interact with Allo users through messages. That's already being tried by other companies such as Facebook and Microsoft, but Google has been working hard on AI for about a decade, so it may be more advanced. "First build a great product," Fox said, repeating a common Google mantra. "Once you get people to love it, they will share it with friends and co-workers and it grows." Google was late in other technology and caught up, Fox noted. Gmail started in 2004, more than six years after Yahoo Mail, but Google's offer of mountains of free storage won over hundreds of millions of users. Google's Chrome emerged in 2008 -- over a decade after Microsoft's Internet Explorer -- and is now the most popular web browser partly because of speed and frequent updates. Better technology may not be enough to catch up, Jain said. WhatsApp and Snapchat offered something useful enough to persuade many people to switch away from their existing communication service where all their friends already were. Duo's promise of video calling for everyone on Android and iOS is something that Hangouts already offers, but that didn't move the needle enough, he noted. "It's worth another shot, but having better tech can't be the only thing," Jain said.

Now with this perfect DRM removal solution for Apple Music, users who subscribed Apple Music service could take full control over their Apple Music songs by completely cracking DRM lock from the offline Apple Music M4P tracks so that they can enjoy those music streams on non-Apple media players and devices as they wish. As a top-leading music-streaming service in the world, Apple Music has already exceeded 15 million subscribers so far and the number is fast growing every single day. New subscribers will get a 3-month free trial and pay $9.9 subscription fee per month when the free trial ends. During the subscription, users are allowed to download and stream any music track from Apple Music to their iOS and Apple-related devices. However, due to the DRM copyright protection, they are prohibited from streaming the downloaded Apple Music songs to non-Apple media players for playback. In this case, TunesKit DRM Apple Music Converter is launched to help Apple Music subscribers get away from DRM restriction by unlocking DRM protection from the offline M4P songs they download with Apple Music so that they can keep those audio tracks forever even if they unsubscribe Apple Music.

Now with this perfect DRM removal solution for Apple Music, users who subscribed Apple Music service could take full control over their Apple Music songs by completely cracking DRM lock from the offline Apple Music M4P tracks so that they can enjoy those music streams on non-Apple media players and devices as they wish. As a top-leading music-streaming service in the world, Apple Music has already exceeded 15 million subscribers so far and the number is fast growing every single day. New subscribers will get a 3-month free trial and pay $9.9 subscription fee per month when the free trial ends. During the subscription, users are allowed to download and stream any music track from Apple Music to their iOS and Apple-related devices. However, due to the DRM copyright protection, they are prohibited from streaming the downloaded Apple Music songs to non-Apple media players for playback. In this case, TunesKit DRM Apple Music Converter is launched to help Apple Music subscribers get away from DRM restriction by unlocking DRM protection from the offline M4P songs they download with Apple Music so that they can keep those audio tracks forever even if they unsubscribe Apple Music. Besides, this smart Apple Music DRM removal tool also works with the DRM-encrypted M4P songs downloaded from iTunes store a few years ago.

Share on Twitter Click me! Copy Link Credit: Flickr/Paul Inkles If one new calculator is to be taken seriously (which it isn’t), parents might be kicking themselves for having kids instead of investing in Apple in the 1980s and early ‘90s. Released on Monday, the website What If I Bought Apple Instead helps parents and curious individuals calculate how much money they would have made had they invested their kid’s college fund and living expenses in Apple stock instead. The calculator works by estimating how much money upper, middle, and lower income families would have spent on children born between January of 1981 and July of 2016. Apple went public in December of 1980 and had a closing price of $109.48 this Monday, so children born during 1981 have the best chance of making their parents the most money—had they not been born, of course. Source: What If I Bought Apple Instead To give you an example, an upper-income family making a gross income of more than $111,000 a year (in 2016 dollars) and spending $100,000 on a four-year college education would have made a whopping $41 million had they invested that money in Apple instead. Even lower-income families making less than $64,000 a year and spending $40,000 on four years at a public institution would have made nearly $26 million by fostering a relationship with Apple shares instead of a plaid-wearing, Pearl Jam obsessed teenager.   Source: What If I Bought Apple Instead Clearly, Apple was the most promising child you could buy in the ‘80s. Fast-forward 30 years, and that’s no longer the case. Let’s say you decided to buy Apple stock in 2012 instead of giving in to biological impulses and social expectations. While it’s still the financially prudent choice, no doubt, as a middle-income family you’d only turn a profit of about $16,000 after investing the approximate $60,000 you would have thrown away on daycare, diapers, iPads, and whatever else babies need these days. So next time your little angel won’t respond to your texts, tweets, or Facebook messages, mail them a link to this calculator and a bill for $20,000,000 dollars. That should get some sort of message across. Recently on GOOD The Pacifist’s Guide to a Productive Thanksgiving You’re about to share a table with Trump supporters.

language:English Thursday, October 24, 2013 Language Language www english german italy portuguese french russian espanol malay vietnamese laos cambodian thai indonesian filipino myanmar japanese korean mongol nepal hindi bengali turkish persian arabic Open search News Video Travel Photos Learn Chinese City Guide Free Mail Apple mulls R&#38;D center Updated 2016-08-17 07:34:24 China Daily Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc, talks with Chinese fashion designer Guo Pei on August 15, 2016 in Beijing. TIM COOK'S WEIBO Move part of effort to regain market share lost to local rivals Apple Inc will set up a research and development center in China by the end of this year－its first independently-operated one in the Asia-Pacific region－as part of its efforts to regain market share it is losing to local rivals. Apple CEO Tim Cook said on Tuesday that the US tech giant would step up its investments in China and be an active part in promoting the country's smart manufacturing and Internet Plus strategy, which are designed to advance the use of the internet in traditional industries. Cook revealed the company's plan during a meeting with Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli. Cook's second visit to Beijing within three months highlighted the importance of the Chinese market where the tech giant is wrestling with declining iPhone sales. The company did not disclose the investment size for the new R& D center. In a separate app developer event on Tuesday, Cook said his company would add more China-specific features to its mobile operating system, in a move to further differentiate its products. The move comes as smartphones increasingly look and work the same, and services and software become increasingly important to help companies differentiate their products and win brand loyalty. Currently, Apple's intelligent personal assistant Siri is learning ancient Chinese poems and when Chinese consumers speak some of their words, Siri will be able to recognize which poems they are from and tell users the names of the poets. During his latest visits to China, Cook had extensive meetings with local developers, highlighting his emphasis on offering better services. James Yan, research director at Counterpoint Technology Market Research, said: "Smartphone hardware is no longer Apple's edge, because local vendors such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd are catching up quickly, and even outdoing Apple in hardware components, such as having dual cameras on one smartphone," Yan said. In May, Cook said his company would speed up its efforts to let Chinese-developed mobile applications go global, as local developers raked in earnings exceeding billion from the company's App Store. Cook's visit also came ahead of the company's new iPhone launch, which will take place in the fall and is widely seen as the key to helping Apple regain its crown in China. Jin Di, research manager at International Data Corp China, said during the visit Cook would probably discuss cooperation deals with retail partners, including telecom carriers. "While local vendors all saw year-on-year growth in China in the second quarter, Apple continued to decline in its shipment volumes," Jin said.

On Tuesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook committed to a future groundbreaking during his second visit to the country in the past four months. Work could begin in the next few weeks. Cook told Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli, one of China’s most senior officials, that construction on the Asia-Pacific research center would start in earnest this fall, and that new center “would be built by the end of the year.” Cook’s announcement appears to be spurred in part by recent comments by the head of China’s industry and technology regulator. In May, he told Cook that he “hoped Apple could deepen its cooperation with the country in research and development” and “stressed information security,” Reuters reported. Related: Apple refused to hand over its source code to China It’s the most recent in a series of strategic investments Apple has made in Chinese businesses. In May, the Cupertino, California-based company announced a $1 billion stock buy in ridesharing app Didi Chuxing — an investment that analysts intimate was politically motivated. The move strengthened Didi, a Beijing, China-based company, against encroaching U.S. competitors. In early August, Uber said it would cease operations of its Chinese subsidiary, UberChina, in return for a one-fifth stake in the ridesharing app. Apple’s dealings with the Chinese government have been fraught with turmoil, to put it lightly. In 2013, China’s state-controlled media slammed the company’s warranty policy, claiming that Apple provided secondhand phones and recycled components to customers in the country. In 2014, following revelations that the U.S. National Security Agency surveilled Chinese leaders, China Central TV described the iPhone as a “national security concern.” Earlier this year, Chinese government regulators blocked access to Apple’s iBooks and iMovies within the country — reportedly out of concern of “security threats.” And in June, China’s Beijing-based Intellectual Property Office found that Apple’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus infringed on an exterior design patent by Chinese company Shenzhen Baili. Related: Does this phone look like the iPhone 6? Chinese authorities say yes But the company’s relationship with the government may be on the mend. Cook apologized following the allegations of warranty fraud, publishing an open letter that promised to implement an “improved level of repair service” and a “clearer and more concise” policy. And a series of meetings in May between Cook and “senior government and Communist Party leaders” was described as “productive” by a Reuters source. It’s a balancing act for both parties. Apple’s Chinese manufacturing operations are “directly or indirectly responsible for tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs,” according to eWeek. Apple, meanwhile, is desperate to turn sales around in a market ripe with revenue potential. While sales of the iPhone in China decreased by a third during the company’s past fiscal quarter, market research firm IDC reports that homegrown vendors Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo saw a collective gain of 47 percent. That said, the Chinese smartphone market is experiencing what Cook called “economic softness” in a recent earnings call. The Greater China region, which includes China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, last year experienced the slowest growth in a quarter century. If the trend continues, Apple’s push in the country may well prove to be a race against time.

This is one of the reasons why high-end smartphones have taken a beating in China. According to the second quarter smartphone shipment data released by International Data Corporation (IDC) on Monday, Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo dominate the top three positions in China. All three brands together have a 47 percent share of the Chinese market. The latest figures show that Huawei has passed Oppo and Xiaomi to take top spot. Xiaomi's second quarter shipment took a 38.4 percent dip year-on-year, shipping 10.5 million smartphones in the quarter (giving it a market share of 9.5 percent), down from 17.1 million in the same period last year (when it had a 11.9 percent share). This fall has pushed Xiaomi to the fourth position behind Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo.According to the research, the success of Huawei and Oppo can be credited to focus marketing messages on key attributes like the Leica lens for Huawei and fast-charging technology for Oppo. Huawei shipped 19.1 million smartphones in China in Q2 2016, giving it a market share of 17.2 percent - a 15.2 percent rise year-on-year. Oppo on the other hand shipped 18 million units, giving it a 16.2 percent share - a growth of 124.1 percent year-on-year. Finally, Vivo shipped 14.7 million units, with a 13.2 percent market share - a growth of 74.7 percent year on year. Xiaomi and Apple round off the top five, with the remaining vendors occupying 36.1 percent of the market, and shipping 40.2 million smartphones in Q2 this year. Apple shipped 8.6 million smartphones in the period according to IDC's data, giving it a 7.8 percent market share. The IDC report notes the Chinese smartphone market is tending towards consolidation, with the top three vendors occupying 45 percent of the market in Q1 2016, and 43 percent in 2015. The quality, design, marketing and pricing of these local smartphones have managed to pull down heavyweights like Apple and Samsung as well. Apple saw a decline in shipments in China by 32 percent in the second quarter, dropping the brand to fifth position. This only spells bad news for the Cupertino-based giant as its global shipments are set to take a fall in 2016, according to a report by Canalys. "The launch of the iPhone 6 saw Apple's shipments in Greater China skyrocket, but the company has struggled to maintain this momentum. The iPhone 6s had a lacklustre reception in comparison and the iPhone SE is unlikely to make a big difference to Apple's fortunes in the region this year. Local players have improved product quality and offer much better value for money. Huawei, Oppo and Vivo offer products with better specifications at significantly lower price points. The iPhones lack features such as waterproofing and wireless charging. Apple needs to catch up with the competition if it wants to compete," Canalys Research Analyst Jessie Ding said on Monday. The most recent example for Huawei's success is seen in the P9, which has been receiving a lot of favourable reviews. The Huawei P9 (which is expected to launch in India on August 17) is the company's high-end smartphone, the highlight of the device being the dual-lens camera made in partnership with Leica.Seeing as how volatile the smartphone market is in China, it remains to see how long Huawei can maintain its position at the top with Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi close at its heels.

Yesterday it was the darling of the new fashion-conscious, social media aware, young Technorati of China, with its Apple-inspired smartphones, laptops, tablets, and, well, practically every other Apple product. Today it is losing favour and, more importantly, domestic market share. Industry research firm IDC provides the facts in its latest report, which shows that the top three smartphone vendors collectively accounted for 47 per cent of the China smartphone market in the second quarter of 2016. In 2015 and Q1 this year, the top three smartphone vendors for that period had a market share of 43 per cent and 45 per cent respectively, showing that the market continues to consolidate further as the share of the top three vendors continue to increase. Unfortunately for Xiaomi, the top three vendors are Huawei, OPPO and vivo. Xiaomi has to make do with fourth place and a 9.5 per cent market share – after suffering a huge 38.4 per cent decrease in share year-on-year. That’s right, in Q2 2015, Xiaomi was top of the pile in first place with a commanding 16.1 per cent market share shipping 17.1 million smartphones. Fast forward a year and sales were down to just 10.5 million. Ouch; that’s almost (but not quite) as bad as Apple’s declining share. “The success of Huawei, OPPO, and vivo in the market can be attributed to their concerted effort to build their brand and aggressive marketing to attract the consumers, along with the focus on product differentiation,” said Xiaohan Tay, Senior Market Analyst, Client Devices Research, IDC Asia/Pacific. “In the past, Xiaomi started the trend of selling its phones online and other vendors soon followed suit and created their own online brand. After vendors witnessed OPPO’s success with its R9, they also started riding on the trend of hiring celebrity endorsers to represent their brand and appeal more to the young crowd.” Indeed, the shift of sales is down, in no small part, to the role of advertising. Xiaomi won big in the past with its focus on offline channels and manufactured demand, and this approach has been copied by OPPO and vivo. But celebrity endorsements are now the flavour of the month, with even the more conservative and technology-focused Huawei getting in on the act. This also signals a shift away from extremely low-cost social marketing to much more expensive paid advertising and sponsorship. “Hiring celebrity endorsers may help increase numbers in the short-term, but this alone may not be sufficient to drive numbers in the long run,” added Tay. “As there is very little differentiation across products to warrant significant brand loyalty, vendors must constantly think out of the box to get people hyped up about their products.” Xiaomi certainly has crawl out of that box of theirs and experience some blue sky thinking (as the marketing people love to say). It faces huge and perhaps unsurmountable problems in selling its current generation of smartphones in Europe and the US, so is heavily reliant upon its domestic market to support its operations. Remember though, for all its Apple love and Steve Jobs tribute keynotes, this is a young company (it only launched in 2010) that still has much to learn. The question is whether or not it can build on its phenomenal early success, when it was worth in excess of $46 billion, and become a long-term leading player in this market. Discovering its own identity would be a big help – being the poor man’s Apple was only ever going to take it so far. For now though, it needs to seriously lower its growth sights and remove the Jobs-inspired reality distortion field. It wanted to sell 100 million smartphones last year – it ended up reaching just 70 million. Consequently, its revenue for the year flat-lined, according to reports, at an estimated $11.9 billion. Those pundits looking for the next mega-brand from Asia may need to take a closer look at OPPO (with its 124 per cent annual China market growth) and vivo (with a healthy 75 per cent growth, and not under-estimate the sizeable backing enjoyed by this year’s market leader Huawei – which is already enjoying considerable success in overseas markets. When Xiaomi decided to mimic Apple and its iPhones, it most likely never thought it would also copy its fall in market share… that really is true love.

ROGERS iHome Smart Control Plug. Graham Keith Rogers - + With the soon-to-be-released iOS 10, Apple will include a HomeKit app. This will allow a single app to control devices in the home. There are a few devices on the market, with more on the way. These all have their own apps to allow control. I have been trying one such device that demonstrates much potential in this area. I am not a lover of the term, "The Internet Of Things" (or "of Everything"): devices connected using wireless technology that can be controlled or monitored remotely. The growing number of independently-developed devices prompted Apple to develop HomeKit as a way of bring some sense to the various implementations. Apple lists 46 devices that are compliant (updated Aug 11). I have not found any in Bangkok. While in the UK in July, I went to the Apple Store in Milton Keynes where I found several HomeKit devices. I bought the Elgato Eve outdoor weather sensor for £39.95 (1,800 baht). VAT in the UK is a stiff 20%. Nearby, John Lewis also had HomeKit devices displayed, including the Philips Hue system. This controls lighting in the home remotely and has been out a couple of years. Of all the items that Apple lists on its HomeKit page, the Eve Weather sensors (indoor and outdoor versions) are the only devices that Amazon will ship to me. Screenshot - Elgato iOS app: setting up. Graham Keith Rogers I downloaded the Elgato iOS app and turned on the Eve Weather Sensor (batteries included). Each device has a unique pairing number. When I was asked for this, the camera opened and I held the iPhone close to the number. This is on the base and in a notes booklet with this device. Pairing was almost immediate. All I had to do was allocate a room and enter some unique names. The location was also entered in iPhone settings for HomeKit (iOS 9). When the HomeKit app arrives in iOS 10, full details of devices will be entered there; or I could use the Apple app for all my connected devices. Since the device has been installed, I have been able to monitor temperature, humidity and air pressure constantly. Information is displayed numerically and in easy to read graphs. Although only a few hours can be displayed at one time, I can scroll back and forward to see the patterns. Leaving the Wi-Fi on at home, I am able to access the data when I want, even connecting with 3G/4G networks. The point here is not that I can see the temperature in my bedroom when I am in the cool of a shopping mall: I know it is hot. What this demonstrates is the potential for remote monitoring and (on devices that allow it) for control. Some of the devices listed by Apple are smart plugs, which will enable users to turn devices on or off, such as water heaters or coffee pots, ready for when you come home. None of the smart plugs listed can handle 220v, there is room for improvement here. Some other HomeKit devices include thermostats and remotely-activated locks. Although HomeKit devices are not available here -- and that must change -- iStudio and .Life in Siam Paragon sell a weather monitoring device (6,590 baht), with a selection of accessories from the French company Netatmo. These work with iOS or Android apps. There are also indoor and outdoor cameras which use a separate app. This also offers an Apple Watch app. A Netatmo Thermostat is HomeKit-ready, but I have not seen it here and doubt there is much call for this. I also found an HD camera with an air-monitoring system from Withings (7,990 baht), which has iOS and Android apps, but is also not HomeKit-compliant. As more devices are developed, the potential increases. Only last weekend, for example, I found 7 Sensors, who are developing Grow Box: a sunlight emulator, irrigation system and climate controller all in one. This will allow remote monitoring and automatic watering. I could have done with this recently as I came back from vacation to find several dead plants: the maid forgot. The 7 Sensors units are up to 175cm high and have been used to grow bell peppers and marijuana (legal in the US now in certain circumstances). Such monitoring and control could also be applied to remote crop areas. Some of my students created a rose garden last year with water levels, temperature and other input monitored by sensors. It is only a short step from use of sensors to monitoring and control. This area of controllable devices has considerable potential for developers. The lack of HomeKit devices here, however, needs to be improved. Also needing attention is the lack of the Broadcom WICED (Wireless Internet Connectivity for Embedded Devices) tools needed. I have contacted Mouser, the local importers, but have so far had no substantial reply concerning these. Graham K.

Given the landmark size and location of the store, Apple’s retail head Angela Ahrendts was in the house for the opening. Ahrendts shared an image on Twitter of herself with some of the store’s staff, noting that she’s “humbled” to have Apple represented in such an important and historical building. “Humbled to have Apple at the World Trade Center. We look forward to serving everyone in this remarkable community,” the Apple executive said. Apple’s World Trade Center retail location was first reported on 2 years ago, while actual evidence of Apple’s existence at the location didn’t emerge until 6 months ago. The store is spread over two floors and is located in the shopping section of the Oculus Transportation Hub. Like a plethora of Apple Stores, the World Trade Center location was designed by Bohlin Cywinski Jackson. You can view a variety of images and videos of the store in our coverage yesterday of the preview event. If you visit the new store, which is located at 185 Greenwich Street, feel free to send us any images and video you take! Humbled to have Apple at the World Trade Center.

Cook made the pledge during a trip to China, at least his second in four months, as demand for Apple's iPhones has plummeted in the world's second-largest economy and the government remains wary about foreign technology. Apple's new research and development center will be built by the end of the year, Cook told Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli, one of China's most senior officials, according to CCTV, the official Chinese state broadcaster. The center will unite Apple's engineering and operations teams in China and is also intended to deepen the company's ties to partners and universities, it said in a statement. Apple's announcement came after the head of China's industry and technology regulator in May told Cook he hoped Apple could deepen its cooperation with the country in research and development and stressed information security. show chapters Tim Cook in China    Tuesday, 16 Aug 2016 | 5:13 AM ET | 01:54 Sales in Greater China, once touted as Apple's next growth engine, decreased by one-third in its fiscal third quarter, after having more than doubled a year earlier. The results did not include inventory drawdowns as retailers sold phones in stock faster than new supply coming from Apple, meaning that demand was not as weak as it seemed. China's slowing economy is stocking concerns about Apple's prospects there. The company's online stores for iBooks and movies closed in the country after Beijing in March imposed strict curbs on online publishing, particularly for foreign firms. Apple has lost intellectual property battles in China and faces anti-U.S. sentiment from consumers there. Before Cook's charm offensive in Beijing in May, Apple announced a $1 billion deal with ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing, a move many experts saw as an attempt to curry favour with Beijing. Other technology firms, including Microsoft and Qualcomm, have pledged investments in China, often with mixed results. Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

Apple’s presence at the conference was a nice change of pace, as the firm typically skips the event. Krstic covered a wide range of topics, including the technologies his team uses in services like HomeKit and iCloud Keychain that handle exceptionally sensitive user data. With over a billion active devices and in-depth security protections spanning every layer from silicon to software, Apple works to advance the state of the art in mobile security with every release of iOS. We will discuss three iOS security mechanisms in unprecedented technical detail, offering the first public discussion of one of them new to iOS 10. HomeKit, Auto Unlock and iCloud Keychain are three Apple technologies that handle exceptionally sensitive user data – controlling devices (including locks) in the user’s home, the ability to unlock a user’s Mac from an Apple Watch, and the user’s passwords and credit card information, respectively. We will discuss the cryptographic design and implementation of our novel secure synchronization fabric which moves confidential data between devices without exposing it to Apple, while affording the user the ability to recover data in case of device loss. Data Protection is the cryptographic system protecting user data on all iOS devices. We will discuss the Secure Enclave Processor present in iPhone 5S and later devices and explain how it enabled a new approach to Data Protection key derivation and brute force rate limiting within a small TCB, making no intermediate or derived keys available to the normal Application Processor. Traditional browser-based vulnerabilities are becoming harder to exploit due to increasingly sophisticated mitigation techniques. We will discuss a unique JIT hardening mechanism in iOS 10 that makes the iOS Safari JIT a more difficult target. In addition to its presentation, Apple also made headlines at Black Hat by announcing a new bug bounty program. The program will initially be invitation-only, and pay out between $25k and $200K for demonstrable exploits, depending on their severity and location.

Platforms like Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal are constantly in competition with each other to see who can get the most exclusive releases, and find the best way to entice listeners to choose their services. Now, Apple Music is introducing a new feature that appears to be a not-so-subtle jab in Spotify’s direction. Recently, Spotify announced a partnership with the lyrics-annotation website Genius, which allows fans to learn not only the words of their favorite songs, but also the specific meanings behind some of the more cryptic lyrics. Now, Apple Music appears to be responding to this by announcing that they are hiring people to be part of their “lyrics curation” team. Apple recently announced job listings for positions such as Lyrics Curator and Lyrics Curation Manager. For these positions, they are looking for people with extensive knowledge of music history who could handle the task of contextualizing individual lyrics. These employees will likely be hired to work on a feature in the iOS 10 version of Apple Music, which allows users to view the lyrics of the songs they are listening to as it plays. This move appears to be a direct response to Spotify’s Genius collaboration, and is potential proof that in the Streaming Wars, if one platform has a unique feature, everyone else will likely look to emulate it as soon as they can.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Wolverton: Google’s new video chat app aims for Apple simplicity By Troy Wolverton / August 16, 2016 at 4:07 PM Six years after Apple launched its video calling service, Google finally has an answer for FaceTime. On Tuesday, the search giant released Duo, its new video calling app. Google designed Duo to be like FaceTime — easy to use. As with Apple’s app, users can simply tap on a friend’s name from their address book and connect. “Video calling is the next best thing to being with someone in person, but too often it can be a frustrating or complicated experience,” Justin Uberti, a principal software engineer, wrote on Google’s company blog site. “Duo takes the complexity out of video calling, so that you can be together in the moment wherever you are.” Duo has one big advantage over FaceTime — it allow Android users to place video calls to iPhone owners and vice versa. FaceTime only works on Apple devices. Google also added a cool feature not present in FaceTime to Duo. Dubbed Knock Knock, it offers a kind of preview of the video call. Knock Knock allows the recipient of a call to see a live view of the person placing the call to get a sense not only of who is calling but why. And Duo has a simpler initial view than FaceTime. Where FaceTime’s home screen offers a list of contacts users have recently called, Duo show users a view of themselves and a big “video call” button. If users tap on that button, they’ll see a list of friends who they can call on the app. If they’ve placed calls recently, they’ll also see thumbnail pictures of the friends they’ve contacted on the homescreen. Those pictures act as buttons that allow them to make a quick follow-up video call. But in general, the app works much like FaceTime. Like Apple’s app, it’s only used for calling; users can’t send text messages through it. As with FaceTime interactions, Duo encrypts calls made through it, so users don’t have to worry about someone spying on their conversations. And as with FaceTime, Duo automatically identifies people in users’ address books who can be reached through the app. On Tuesday, I did a quick test of Duo, which Google announced in May at its annual developer conference. It worked mostly as advertised. My wife was able to easily place a call from her iPhone to mine using the app. I was able to return her call quickly by simply tapping on a thumbnail picture button on the Duo home screen. The video was generally smooth, although there was a hiccup in it. The app is supposed to be able to keep a video call going even if your phone switches from a WiFi to a cellular network. But while talking with my daughter, the video of me cut out when I turned off my WiFi radio. I was able to see her, but she could only hear me. My video resumed when I turned my WiFi radio back on. Google is no stranger to video calling. Users of Google Talk could place video calls on their PCs eight years ago. Google Hangouts, which the company launched three years ago, allows users to connect on PCs and mobile devices and can be used for video conferences involving multiple people. And users of Google’s Android operating system have numerous choices for video calling apps, including Skype, Facebook Messenger, and WeChat. Cell providers Verizon and T-Mobile also offer video calling features for Android phones. But until now, Android users haven’t had something as easy and ubiquitous to use for video chats as FaceTime. While Hangouts comes pre-installed on most devices, it’s a much more complicated app that can be difficult to use. With Skype, Facebook and other apps, users can typically only place video calls to people who are using the same app. And in some cases users have to know a person’s often idiosyncratic log-on name to connect. And the cell phone video services generally allow users to place video calls only to other users who have certain phones that are connected to the same cellular network. While Duo may be aimed at FaceTime, I’m not convinced it’s going to convince iPhone users to switch to Android. But if it gets enough of a following, it could make it easier for iPhone users to at least consider making the move. Still, FaceTime, which debuted with Apple’s iPhone 4 back in 2010, retains some advantages over Duo. Apple offers it for Mac computers, while Duo isn’t available for the Mac or Windows PC’s. FaceTime allows users to place audio-only calls, while Duo is focused on video ones. And FaceTime users can connect to people even if they don’t know their phone number; FaceTime also recognizes their email address. Photo: Google Duo.

Apple today has inked a new deal with one of the most popular music labels, Cash Money Records. The co-founder of the label, Birdman, posted on Instagram confirming the deal, sharing a picture of himself with Apple Music executive Larry Jackson. “It’s official…Cash Money makes a power move with Apple Music,” Birdman’s Instagram post said. Cash Money Records, for those unfamiliar, houses some of the top artists in rap and all of music right now, including Drake, Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, Tyga, Birdman, and others. Former Cash Money artists include Busta Rhymes, DJ Khaled, Bow Wow, and others. Since Apple Music’s launch, Apple has had a strong relationship with Drake, who was on-stage during the Apple Music unveil keynote and reportedly inked his own $19 million deal with Apple earlier this year. As part of that deal, Drake’s recent “Views” album was an Apple Music exclusive for two weeks. Additionally, Drake has hosted a show on Apple’s always-on Beats 1 radio service. Cash Money Records, however, has had a rocky few years. Lil Wayne has accused the company and Birdman of not paying artists promptly and mismanaging talent. Wayne has also accused Birdman of stifling creativity and not allowing artists to release music on time. Nevertheless, the deal with Apple could help Cash Money solve some of its problems. Young Money Entertainment – the imprint of Cash Money that houses Tyga, Drake, Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, and others – has put out eleven number 1 albums in the United States and should Apple be able to get exclusive rights to future offerings, it would have a strong advantage over services like Spotify. Interestingly, however, Lil Wayne is believed to be a part-owner of Tidal (via MBW). Part of the deal likely hinges upon Apple offering Cash Money artists free promotion both in iTunes and on Apple Music, something it has done in the past for various exclusive offerings, including Taylor Swift’s tour documentary. Beyond exclusive streaming rights, the partnership could see Apple and Cash Money working together to co-produce video content. It’s been reported in the past that Apple has worked directly with artists on music videos, while Eddy Cue himself has explained that the company is looking for exclusive content opportunities when they complement existing products. Over recent weeks, Apple has gained exclusive rights to a pair of big upcoming releases: Britney Spears’ “Glory” and Frank Ocean’s “Boys Don’t Cry.” Even if Cash Money’s reputation has become slightly tainted over the past two years, this deal is big for Apple. Apple is likely hoping that its money and talent will breathe new life into Cash Money and its artists. http://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/apple-music-signs-game-changing-label-deal-cash-money-records/ @thelarryjackson @applemusic #Biggathenlife #lifestyle A photo posted by Birdman5star (@birdman5star) on Aug 16, 2016 at 2:46pm PDT Guides Apple Music: Apple's streaming music service View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Birdman and his label have signed a deal with Apple Music, joining a roster of artists who are already in exclusive deals with the tech titan, according to Billboard. Birdman teased the news on Instagram over the weekend, posing for a photo next to Apple Music’s Larry Jackson. “It’s official,” he wrote in a since-deleted caption. “Cash Money makes a power move with Apple Music.” That “power move” will likely include an exclusivity guarantee, marking the first time a label has entered an exclusive deal with Apple as opposed to individual artists. Jackson posted the same picture on his account, jokingly saying he signed a deal with Cash Money as an R&B singer. “Check one off of the bucket list,” he wrote. “Signed as an R&B crooner to Ca$h Money yesterday. My life is oh so complete now…Welcome to the fam @birdman5star. Tough negotiator. Much respeck.” Check one off of the bucket list ✔️.. Signed as an R&B crooner to Ca$h Money yesterday.

It’s also unclear how this will affect Cash Money’s star-studded roster. Lil Wayne is still at odds with his longtime label and mentor Baby. Meanwhile, he and Nicki Minaj both have ties to Jay Z’s TIDAL. Elsewhere, Drake has his own deal with Apple Music that’s been quite lucrative for the 6 God. Besides Drake, Chance the Rapper, DJ Khaled, Travis Scott, and Future are among the artists who’ve signed exclusive deals with Apple Music.

Cook made the pledge during a trip to China, at least his second in four months, as demand for Apple's iPhones has plummeted in the world's second-largest economy and the government remains wary about foreign technology. Apple's new research and development centre will be built by the end of the year, Cook told Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli, one of China's most senior officials, according to CCTV, the official Chinese state broadcaster. The center will unite Apple's engineering and operations teams in China and is also intended to deepen the company's ties to partners and universities, it said in a statement. Apple's announcement came after the head of China's industry and technology regulator in May told Cook he hoped Apple could deepen its cooperation with the country in research and development and stressed information security. Sales in Greater China, once touted as Apple's next growth engine, decreased by one-third in its fiscal third quarter, after having more than doubled a year earlier. The results did not include inventory drawdowns as retailers sold phones in stock faster than new supply coming from Apple, meaning that demand was not as weak as it seemed. China's slowing economy is stocking concerns about Apple's prospects there. The company's online stores for iBooks and movies closed in the country after Beijing in March imposed strict curbs on online publishing, particularly for foreign firms. Apple has lost intellectual property battles in China and faces anti-U.S. sentiment from consumers there. Before Cook's charm offensive in Beijing in May, Apple announced a $1 billion deal with ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing, a move many experts saw as an attempt to curry favour with Beijing. Other technology firms, including Microsoft Corp and Qualcomm Inc, have pledged investments in China, often with mixed results.

In fact, he’s remained pretty involved in tech, and his latest product, the Obi Worldphone MV1, has just launched in the U.K. after first being announced six months ago at Mobile World Congress. The new phone is powered by Android, has a 5-inch display, and is designed to compete with other low-cost smartphones out there, especially considering its 99 pound price tag (about $129). In other words, the Worldphone MV1 is not an iPhone-killer designed to go up against Sculley’s old employer. Related: Former Apple CEO John Sculley launches two low-cost Android smartphones Apart from the display, the phone features a 1.3 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 212 processor, 16GB of storage with a MicroSD card slot to expand upon that storage, 2GB of RAM, an 8MP rear-facing camera, and a 2MP front-facing camera. It also offers a 2,500mAh battery. The best thing about this phone, however, isn’t the specs — it’s the price. At a tiny 99 pounds, this is one of the better deals out there. It boasts specs comparable to the super low-cost Moto E, even beating out the Moto E in some areas, such as in the processor — the Moto E’s processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 200, and is coupled with 1GB of RAM, compared to the Worldphone’s 2GB. Of course, it’s important to note that the phone has been available in Asia, the Middle East, and South America for some time now, and it will likely be available in other parts of Europe in the near future. There’s no word yet on the phone’s availability in the U.S. though. If you’re interested in getting the super low-cost Obi Worldphone MV1 for yourself and you live in an area where the device is available, you can buy it from the company’s website.
