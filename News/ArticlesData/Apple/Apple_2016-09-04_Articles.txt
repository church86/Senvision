Jump to navigation You are here Home iPad Air 2 supply dries up ahead of iPhone 7 event Submitted by Marshall Walker on Mon, 09/05/2016 - 16:08 9to5Mac reported this weekend that the iPad Air 2 has sold out at most major distributors. This is normally a sign that Apple is planning some kind of refresh, but as we have pointed out all year long, there have been zero rumors or leaks indicating we will see a new iPad model this year. Even the well trusted analyst KGI Ming-Chi Kuo from KGI Securities has noted Apple will not release a new model iPad until 2017. Kou believes Apple will launch three new iPad models, including a second-generation iPad Pro, an entry-level 9.7-inch iPad and a new unnamed 10.5-inch model. It is also still unknown if Apple plans to continue its 7-inch iPad mini lineup, or discontinue it entirely. All tablet sales, including the iPad, have been in a steady decline for a few years. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he still believes there is a future for the iPad, but Apple may be temporarily putting on the breaks for its tablet lineup. There have been no reports of a new 9.7-inch iPad being in the works since the release of the iPad Pro earlier this year, and there has even been speculation that the iPad Air 2 will be the final "Air" model. The question isn't if Apple will release a new 12- or 9-inch tablet, it is when, and all signs point to 2017 due to the low interest in tablets at the current time. As of right now Apple is focused on releasing its next-generation iPhone on September 7th, and analysts are already planning for a lackluster response from consumers. The iPhone 7 isn't expected to include any new features that will wow customers, and Apple may be looking at another decline in new iPhone sales. All mobile devices have hit seemed to hit their peak with bells and whistles and even Apple may be forced to spread out the time between its product cycles to keep people interested.

The model would see Apple’s cut of app developers’ per-user profits drop from 30 percent to 15 percent if a user went out on a limb to continuously give them money for 12 consecutive months. It’s not just for access to features within the app, but for access to the app itself. Such a model could give a new mission to publishing houses and maybe we’re going to see that effect starting from this point. Apple has officially raised the curtain on subscriptions, free trials and variable pricing depending on country. Any company can apply these features to their app. Subscriptions can be renewed automatically and last for various lengths of time. If pricing changes are set to occur, the company can keep current users at current price levels while offering new customers the new price. Developers cannot have an introductory pricing scheme wherein the cost goes up after the first month. Also, if a user cancels their subscription after a year, they have up to 60 days to resubscribe to the app in order for the developer to keep the 85/15 share. Let the subscriptions begin.

Anick Jesdanun, Associated Press 7:09 p.m. EDT September 5, 2016 These photos were taken in New York's Carl Schurz Park with the Huawei P9 smartphone with dual camera lenses. The dual lenses offer one neat trick: They sense depth, so you can blur out the background, above, to highlight something in the foreground. (Photo: AP) Apple isn’t saying much about its next iPhones, but there’s been plenty of speculation that the giant Plus model will have two camera lenses side by side on the back. Why? A second lens could make photos sharper or give amateur shutterbugs blurring techniques more common in full-bodied SLR cameras. Apple isn’t revealing anything until its product event in San Francisco on Wednesday. For now, though, people can look at how a few other smartphone makers are using two lenses. ►Related:Soon your car may be updateable like your iPhone MOTOROLA MOTO Z The left image was taken with the Moto Z’s regular lens from afar and enlarged. The right image was taken with a second lens in the form of an optional attachment.  (Photo: AP) The three Moto Z phones get amazing zoom with a second lens that comes in the form of an optional attachment. Motorola unveiled its third Moto Z model and the attachment, called Hasselblad True Zoom Mod, at the IFA tech show in Berlin last week. An accessory normally wouldn’t count, but in this case, it’s an integral part of the phone once you attach it with powerful magnets. The Moto Z has a mix-and-match design that makes it possible to remove its back and replace it with a speaker, a projector or a zoom lens that offers 10-fold magnification — better than what many point-and-shoot cameras offer. You’d be wrong to think smartphones already offer zoom capabilities by pinching out on the screen. That’s just a software trick that leaves images fuzzy. The camera lens itself is fixed; you need an attachment for true zoom. With it, a statue of Alexander Hamilton in New York’s Central Park looks as sharp from afar as it would closer up. By contrast, the same statue taken with the regular lens from afar looks dull. It’s possible to make out a New York University logo on a bean-bag toss game board shot with the second lens from across the lawn; with the regular lens, it’s just a blob of purple. This functionality will cost you, though. The module alone will start at $250 when it comes out in mid-September, or at the high end of what point-and-shoots cost. That’s on top of $400 for the cheapest Moto Z. Motorola says the attachment will appeal mostly to photography aficionados, but the company believes that’s a sizable market. The results are indeed remarkable, but not flawless. It takes a second or so to focus and shoot, enough to miss a moving subject. Faces can look distorted near the edges of the image, and the second lens doesn’t do extreme close-ups, known as macros. That’s one thing stand-alone cameras still do better. And the attachment is about as heavy and bulky as a point and shoot. But the module gives you amazing zoom shots that you can easily share via the phone. That’s not a simple task with most cameras. ►Related:MSU professor helps police crack smartphone fingerprint lock LG G5 The LG G5 dual-lens smartphone.  (Photo: AP) The G5’s second lens offers an impressive 135-degree wide angle, compared with 78 degrees on the normal one. That’s the difference between getting the entire Colosseum in Rome into a single shot, as opposed to just some of it. At St. Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican City, the wide angle gets you not just Michelangelo’s dome but also the ornate columns holding it up. With most cameras, you’re shooting as though you lack peripheral vision. With a wide angle, the photo frame expands to almost match your real-life field of view. Wide angles aren’t always desirable. If you’re shooting an elephant in front of you, you want more of the elephant and less of its surroundings. But wide angles are great when you’re shooting a large landmark or a large group of people from close up. As with other wide-angle lenses, though, LG’s produces distortion around the edges of the image. Think of how warped fish-eye shots look. Columns inside St. Peter’s Basilica look curved rather than straight. Distant objects look even farther away. The regular lens is what you’ll want most of the time. Of course, you can get something close to a wide-angle shot by installing apps or using built-in panorama features, but it takes time to pan across the landscape, rather than snap once. That software approach also doesn’t work for video. HUAWEI P9 Huawei's P9 smartphone features dual lenses.  (Photo: AP) One lens captures images in color, the other in black and white, or monochrome. The dedicated lens produces sharper monochrome shots than you can get by letting software bleach out the color from an ordinary image. Huawei says it also lets in more light. In practice, though, the differences are subtle. Images of colorful street art in New York often look cleaner, with better contrast, using the monochrome lens than by running comparable color shots through a black-and-white software filter. While this will matter to artists, it probably won’t to most users, especially since people rarely take black-and-white shots anyway. But that monochrome lens promises to help color shots as well. By using sensors for the two lenses in conjunction, the phone can restore some of the detail and light lost to filters in the color sensor. The result is a camera that’s among the top in the class — though recent iPhones and Samsung Galaxy phones do just as well or better with just the color lens. And despite promises of better lighting, the Galaxy S7 often produced better night shots than the P9. The dual lenses offer one neat trick: They sense depth, so you can blur out the background to highlight something in the foreground, mimicking an SLR technique done by adjusting the lens aperture. The P9 isn’t available in the U.S. yet, but Huawei is taking a similar dual-lens approach with the just-announced Honor 8. 10 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The writer says that his experience with the iPhone 7 is similar to previous reports. However, there are no photos or videos to back up the claim. Aside from information that’s already been known, the report claims that the iPhone 7 can record 4K video at 60 frames per second. This is up from the iPhone 6s’ 4K at 30fps, and is an important detail as no phone on the market can shoot 4K at 60fps. It also claims that this is available on the 4.7-inch iPhone 7, so it’s not even exclusive to the iPhone 7 Plus and its dual camera system. It may be the reason why Apple has decided to go with 128GB and 256GB storage configurations. 4K on its own already takes ups a substantial amount of space on the iPhone, and adding 60FPS on top of that makes the file size even larger. The report also ‘confirms’ the existence of a dark iPhone color with the matte finish replacing the current Space Gray. Surprisingly, the writer says that the Apple logo matches the matte finish of the device, but the Silver (as with previous iPhones), has a shiny one. It also mentions that the volume buttons are no longer flush with the body and are now placed on the outer body. The SIM card tray also has a new rubber seal, presumably to be more water resistant. Previous rumors have stated that the new iPhone will be rated at IPX7 – the same as the Apple Watch. It also claims that the new touch-sensisitve Home button will have the same tactile feel to it, still requiring a substantial amount of force to press the capacitive sensor. Apple is using Force Touch technology to force users to press firmly on the Home button, rather than going the Android route with light presses on software-based keys. As per usual, there is a slight haptic feedback to give the illusion of a physical home button. Of course, there are no moving parts. Take this report with a grain of salt, however, as there is no evidence beyond writing. Though, the amount of small tidbits and detail does make it sound believable. Aside from that, we’ll have to wait for Apple’s official unveiling of the iPhone 7 on Wednesday, which is now under two days away.

If true it could herald an end to the misery that results from dropping your iPhone down the toilet, plonking it into your pint glass, or forgetting to take it out of your pocket before diving into the swimming pool. It would also bring the mobile phone handset in line with competitors like the Samsung Galaxy S7 - which can be fully submerged underwater for 30 minutes at a time.

Read More iPhone 7 and Apple Watch 2 launch LIVE: Dual-lens camera and NO headphone jack expected at Apple event 2016 However, well-connected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities issued a detailed research note over the weekend, in which he stated that the new iPhone will indeed be water resistant. According to Kuo, the iPhone 7 It will be waterproof to a depth of one metre for up to 30 minutes - a rating known as IPX7, which is the same as the Apple Watch . Read More Apple Watch 2: Release date, price, specs and all the latest rumours about Apple's next smartwatch This will bring it almost into line with Samsung Galaxy S7, which has a rating of IP68, meaning the device is completely protected against dust, and it is water-resistant in up to 1.5 metres of water for up to 30 minutes. This is not the first leak to suggest the iPhone 7 will be resistant against water. The invitation to Apple's event on September 7 contains images blurry coloured circles, which some believe to be water droplets - leading to speculation of a water-based announcement. Meanwhile, a report in the China-based Commercial Times earlier this year claims the manufacturer had been working on a new "compound material" that repels water. It will also reportedly remove the need for the two strips of plastic that run across the back of the current generation of iPhones to allow mobile signals to reach the antennas. This suggests that the body of the next iPhone may not be made from metal at all, but some other kind of material that allows radio waves to pass through it. Industrial designer Herman Haidin has taken a stab at predicting the next version of Apple's handset and reckons the American tech giant could use a material known as 'liquidmetal'. Amazing 'liquidmetal' iPhone 7 concept shows what Apple's next-generation smartphone could be (Photo: Herman Haidin) Apple acquired a patent for liquidmetal back in 2010 and uses it to make the small SIM ejector tool that comes in each iPhone box. The material itself is a type of alloy that's tougher and more water-resistant than typical aluminium. In the concept, Haidin envisions the iPhone 7 as a mere 3mm thick with a body formed of glass and liquidmetal. While the theory would explain the changes to the antenna lines on the back of the device, liquidmetal seems like too drastic a change for this update, but it may be one to look out for in 2017. Could the back of the iPhone 7 also look different from its predecessors? Read More Why does your iPhone have those lines across the back? A tech mystery explained The Californian tech giant usually updates its smartphone lineup in early September so it can see out the end of the year on a high. This year it will almost certainly be the iPhone 7 that's revealed, and the online rumour mill is going into overdrive ahead of the announcement.

These are the top stories of the week, and you can receive this post in your inbox, if that makes your life easier. 1. SpaceX experienced a devastating explosion while completing a routine static test-fire that destroyed Facebook’s $200 million Internet.org satellite. SpaceX confirmed there were no personnel injuries in the blast, but the rocket and payload were destroyed. There are three stages of questioning to go through when a rocket explosion occurs, and here’s what we know so far. In a Facebook post, Mark Zuckerberg wrote that he was “deeply disappointed” by the loss, but here’s how the conversation probably went down. 2. Tick tock, tick tock. Is it September 7 yet? Apple sent out invites for its press conference on Wednesday, September 7, where it will most likely unveil the next iPhone. Leaks show that the iPhone 7 could feature streamlined antennas and a more prominent camera, as well as a dual-lens camera system in the larger model. It looks like the audio port is going away, too. There have been many rumors about a new MacBook Pro with a Touch ID sensor and an OLED mini screen above the keyboard. The Apple Watch should also receive an update. As always, we’ll be at the event, live-blogging and tweeting to bring you all the updates. 3. To the frustration of English-browsing users, Facebook removed the descriptions under Trending Topics in favor of increasing the scalability of the product, as well as fired the human editors who curate the Trending section. It didn’t take long for the algorithm to screw up. At least we got some haikus out of it. 4. Both Dropbox and Last.fm revealed the full extent of password breaches from four years ago. Remember the Dropbox password breach? The company initially said that user emails were the only data stolen, but the number may have been much higher than we originally thought. It turns out that passwords were also acquired, leading to the theft of more than 60 million user credentials. PSA: please enable two-factor authentication. 5. Apple was ordered to pay up to $14.5 billion for illegal tax benefits in Ireland. The European Commission is saying that Apple benefited from illegal tax benefits for its European operations, and that Ireland must recover the so-called “illegal aid.” Apple CEO Tim Cook responded in a letter to customers calling the move “unprecedented” and “harmful” with “no basis in fact or in law.” Stay tuned. 6. Watch out, Uber. Google is now running its own ridesharing service in San Francisco. The new service uses the Waze app to connect commuters for shared carpooling, and is said to be much, much cheaper than Uber. 7. At first, Amazon was giving business to FedEx. But as the company pieces together its delivery business (including growing shipping operations, centralized hubs, air transport and last-mile delivery) the e-commerce giant might actually just kill FedEx. 8. Facebook cloned Snapchat once again with a new “instant video” feature for Messenger. Messenger already lets you make video calls, but the new service lets you and a friend instantly share real-time video with each other. 9. Does your iPhone 6 or 6 Plus suddenly become unresponsive with a flickering grey bar appearing at the top of the screen? Well, an iFixit report asserted that the problem is the result of a design flaw and a “Touch Disease” lawsuit hopes to elevate the case to class action status. 10. Bad news for those who are lazy/rich enough to outsource their laundry to Washio, as the service announced it will be shutting down effective immediately. The startup had raised a total of $16.8 million in funding. 11. A slew of new gadgets were introduced at IFA in Berlin. Some highlights include the strangely fascinating Lenovo Yoga Book, the Fitbit Charge 2 and Samsung’s latest smartwatch, the Gear S3. We also got to take Sphero’s BB-8 Force Band for a spin. 12. Blue Apron’s Farm Egg — the single egg packaged in its own little crate — prompts some important questions. Blue Apron, valued north of $2 billion and potentially gunning for an IPO, is as much a shipping company as it is a food startup; therefore, questions about carbon emissions, food transportation and packaging waste must be taken into consideration. But is the company part of the problem or the solution? TBD. 13. DraftKings, the fantasy sports startup entrenched in legal battles, closed $150 million in new funding led by DC-based Revolution Capital.  0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Happy New Year from Crunch Report!

That is one of the eye-catching figures European Union competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager led with last week while declaring the findings of a three-year inquiry into Apple’s tax arrangements in Ireland. Here’s another: the European Commission (EC) has charged Ireland with recovering $14.5 billion from the tech giant. Together, they sum up the problems with the ruling—a blinkered view of a situation fraught with ambiguities and an approach that could prove counterproductive in tackling a legitimate problem. The Irish corporate tax rate of 12.5% is the lowest in Europe and far friendlier to business than the 35% rate in the US. Little wonder a host of corporate entities—Apple, Google, Facebook, eBay and Twitter among them—funnel significant portions of their revenue through subsidiaries registered in Ireland. Irish law also allows for a company registered in Ireland to be tax resident elsewhere, usually a tax haven like the Bahamas or Cayman Islands—the ‘double Irish’ tactic. That makes for very low effective tax rates indeed once the bean-counters on company payrolls are done with their accounting gymnastics. Apple’s strategy was a variant of this with two Ireland-based subsidiaries allocating a large chunk of the company’s non-US profits to a dummy head office. This office exploited differences between US and Irish definitions of residence to avoid being tax resident anywhere. The EC ruling pointed out that the head office existed only on paper and had no activities other than the occasional board meeting—and that the entire set-up had been enabled by two deals struck between the Irish government and Apple in 1991 and 2007 that amounted to “illegal state aid”. But tax avoidance is not tax evasion. It may exist in an ethical grey zone, but it is also mandatory for corporations obliged to maximize profit. For all the sturm und drang, Apple has done nothing that other companies don’t do. The real issue is that there is something rotten in the state of corporate tax regulations in developed economies. Take the US, for instance. Its excessively high corporate tax rate and thicket of mitigatory provisions such as deferral (US firms don’t have to pay tax on foreign income until it is brought back home) and check-the-box (US multinationals can designate foreign subsidiaries as being disregarded for tax purposes) incentivize companies to funnel revenues elsewhere. And countries like Ireland and Luxembourg welcome them with tax regimes that are the equivalent of a wink and a nudge. The changing nature of multinational giants further complicates the picture. The transfer pricing that tech and pharmaceutical corporations rely upon to shift revenue between subsidiaries is based upon trading intangibles like intellectual property. These are difficult to price, undercutting measures meant to keep them honest such as the arm’s length principle. This revenue and taxation distortion can fray the link between corporate growth and broader economic growth. US corporates have around $2 trillion in offshore earnings that hasn’t been repatriated; that’s a lot of potential reinvestment lost. And, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, developing countries lose up to $100 billion in tax revenue annually. The broad nature of the problem demands a broad-based response. Unilateral action such as the EC’s current crusade runs several risks. The US is fulminating over the EC’s poaching on revenues that it sees as its rightful preserve, and has hinted at retaliatory measures in a treasury white paper. This discord reduces the chances of coordinated tax reform. That in turn could create more loopholes through which revenue could vanish into the deep blue—what Harvard University tax professor Stephen Shay has called “ocean income”. The EC is also meddling with issues of sovereignty—a particularly bad time for it in the wake of Brexit. The uncertainty resulting from all of this is not conducive to investment and corporate expansion. A more temperate regulatory reform approach has shown signs of bearing fruit. Last year, Ireland closed the loopholes that allow for the double Irish; it will be phased out entirely by 2020. And international initiatives such as the G-20/OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project are a step in the right direction. Corporations will take every inch the law grants them, and they will lobby to have favourable regulations. That is the nature of the beast. Effective tax governance consists of minimizing the space for them to do so—not of expecting them to change their stripes. Is the European Commission’s ruling justified?

Email | 05 Sep 2016 | Print  ExtraBITS for 5 September 2016 by TidBITS Staff In ExtraBITS this week, we now know the full scale of the 2012 Dropbox hack, the BitTorrent client Transmission has been infected with malware again, and Walt Mossberg evaluates Tim Cook’s run as Apple’s CEO. Full Scale of Dropbox Hack Revealed -- File sharing service Dropbox is warning users who created accounts before 2012 to change their passwords, due to a breach that occurred that year. (If you’ve already changed your password, there’s no need to do so again willy-nilly.) Dropbox previously disclosed the attack, but the full scope of the breach has only recently become known: 5 GB of documents containing email addresses and hashed passwords for over 68 million users. If you used a high-quality password and didn’t reuse it on other sites, there is little cause for alarm, thanks to Dropbox’s strong password hashing, but you should change your password if prompted. Read/post comments Transmission Infected with Malware… Again -- Back in March 2016, we reported that version 2.90 of the Transmission BitTorrent client had been hacked to include the KeRanger ransomware. Though Transmission’s developers acted quickly to solve that problem, it has happened again. For less than 24 hours between August 28th and 29th, the distribution copy of Transmission 2.92 was infected with the OSX/Keydnap malware, so if you downloaded Transmission during that time, your Mac might be infected. Transmission’s developers once again resolved the problem quickly and posted instructions for eliminating OSX/Keydnap from an infected Mac, but anyone contemplating using Transmission should keep this risk in mind. Note too that several studies have identified a significant percentage of BitTorrent downloads as containing malware — stick to the well-lit parts of the Internet if you’re concerned about safety. Read/post comments Walt Mossberg Evaluates Tim Cook’s Apple -- Veteran tech journalist Walt Mossberg has taken a look at Apple under CEO Tim Cook, five years after Cook took the position. Overall, Mossberg praised Cook for guiding the company to new financial heights, refining its product lines, and retaining most of its senior talent. However, Mossberg deducts points for the fact that Apple under Cook has yet to introduce a game-changing product, though he admits that the Apple Watch might be that game-changer, saying that it took 3–4 years before the iPod took off. We’d also note that some of Apple’s biggest wins were actually low-hanging fruit — the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and MacBook Air all entered markets with radically inferior competition (the iPad didn’t have much to compete with in terms of tablets, but Steve Jobs set it against the entire netbook category). But there isn’t much easily reached fruit left in the consumer electronics world. Read/post comments   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

It has cultivated a power that adapts the message of the bribing agent with that of the bully, tempting government hosts with promises of plenty, and withdrawing pledges on being pushed into moves it would rather not make for the sake of customers and shareholders.  Permit tax breaks, and low tax bills, and your State prospers. The European Commission, which occasionally comes across as a pushy regulatory bugbear, decided to make Apple accountable as a decent tax paying corporate citizen.  Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager did to Apple what she had done to the Netherlands and Luxembourg in 2014 when she ordered the recovery of back tax revenue from Starbucks (20-30 million euros) and Fiat Chrysler (20-30 million euros) respectively. Apple was ordered to pay tax arrears totalling $14.5 billion into Irish treasury coffers, a decision that sent a hyper chill through the European corporate sector.  Capital’s power remains moveability, and corporate capital, when spooked, finds other sources. That is their magic wand, but on this score, the EU was refusing any bewitching on Apple’s part. Apple’s response went by the book.  The first was a promise that it would seek to overturn the ruling, suggesting it was not only flawed but a case of “total political crap,” to use the words of CEO Tim Cook. Apple General Counsel Bruce Sewell rejected the EU Commission’s claim that Apple’s Ireland base has paid a mere 0.005 percent of taxes to the country in 2014.  “We paid tax at the statutory rate of 12.5 percent tax on profits relating to our activities in Ireland.” Sewell’s rebuttal list seemed impressive, but hardly addressed the more direct nature of the company’s operations.  The company, he insisted, has provided $400 million in corporate income tax in Ireland in the 2014 year, while also providing a further $400 million in current US corporate taxes on profits.  Several billion dollars in US corporate tax has also been accrued “on a deferred basis.” A closer examination of the Irish operation gets shadier with greater digging, revealing an empire of tactical spread and heft.  For one, Cook’s explanation was that the activities were in line with that of a non-resident company, as permitted by Irish law. The actual activities on research and development, including intellectual property came out of the Californian base in Cupertino, with the Irish office tasked with management.  But Apple did not, as Cook further explained, have an “office or employees in Ireland because it was not an operational business and its business was not specific to Ireland.” A “small resident company” in Ireland could hardly be expected to cover value created in other bases (say, back in Cupertino).  A perfect ruse, in other words.  Thus, we have a view into the world of global non-taxation, with Cook carefully avoiding the obvious point that US companies such as Apple prefer to hold cash overseas to avoid paying the US tax rate of 35 percent on profit. When confronted by the Frankurter Allgemeinze Zeitung about the obvious point that Apple’s subsidiary Irish operations were run purely to avoid paying taxes, Cook issued an emphatic denial. The Irish operation, which commenced in 1980, had nothing to do with tax minimisation, or even avoidance, but everything about expansion and seeking “an extremely talented and well-trained workforce.” The Irish cabinet, happy with that olive branch, has agreed, and wants nothing of the arrears.  The picture of a sovereign state nuzzling with a super company is never a pretty one, a matter normally concealed and obscured. Not in this case, where both entities intend dancing arm and arm in appeal against the ruling. Taoiseach Enda Kenny decided to turn the sovereignty argument on its head: if Ireland wanted to make domestic policies favourable to companies, it was up to the Republic, rather than bureaucrats in Brussels.  Odd sort of sovereignty, to be so hostile to the collection of tax while favouring the enormous scope of action on the part of a multinational. “This is about Ireland, it is about our people, it’s about us as a sovereign nation, actually setting out what we consider our appropriate policies.” Finance Minister Michael Noonan swirled with suggestions of offensive strategy on the part of Brussels. “I do think they are establishing a bridgehead.” A “proxy attack” had been mounted on the 12.5 percent corporate tax rate in small Ireland, using Apple as the wicked irresponsible multinational colluding with Dublin. “Envy,” claimed Noonan, was driving the grubby campaign, one indicated by periodic efforts on the part of European leaders to make Ireland lift the corporate rate. Not all Irish political figures favour the view that inviting back taxes should not be accepted. Their endorsement of an appeal about the decision is based as much on clarity as anything else.  Who holds the strings on the issue of multinationals in Europe when it comes to tax? Children’s Minister Katharine Zappone, for instance, felt that the Commission’s decision had been “in the public interest.” What the episode starkly reveals is a global system of regulation that some governments, and regimes, simply refuse to accept. The continuing illusion is that having the grand Apple in one’s backyard is a boon to jobs and a catalyst for other multinationals to join the tax free (or lower tax) playground.

James Henderson (New Zealand Reseller News) 06 September, 2016 05:57 - - - - print email Comments As Apple grapples with the Irish Government over its €13 billion tax bill, pressure is now being placed on the tech giant to also pay up in New Zealand following 12 months of tax avoidance. In 2015, the Kiwi division of the one of the world’s most valuable companies - entitled Apple Sales New Zealand - raked in over $730 million in sales. Yet unsurprisingly, the company shelled out under $9 million in income tax to Inland Revenue, a rate of just over one per cent. “When there is so much inequality and poverty, it is utterly unacceptable that large corporations like Apple don’t pay their fair share of taxes,” Oxfam New Zealand executive director, Rachael Le Mesurier, said. “The company is making hundreds of millions of dollars here in New Zealand, but appears to be paying a tax rate of just over one per cent. That can’t be right, and must be fixed.” For Le Mesurier,, the schemes and deals that allow multinationals to minimise tax, whilst legal, can no longer be tolerated in New Zealand. “If people are to have trust in the tax system, all governments, including New Zealand, must act immediately to end tax dodging,” Le Mesurier added. “Companies must be forced to disclose where they generate their profits and where they pay their taxes. "This would give governments and civil society the ability to hold these companies to account."

Rumormongers Say It Won’t [The New York Times] “When the latest iPhone is unveiled here on Wednesday in a 7,000-seat auditorium, it probably will instead be more like Christmas for a sneaky 10-year-old who long ago peeked at his present. Thanks. That’s it? Anyone who cares enough about the iPhone to know that a new model is being released this month already knows what it is supposed to be like: a little thinner, a little faster and equipped with superior cameras on the Plus model. By far the most controversial feature, however, is the one that will be missing: a headphone jack. A standard element of technology that can be traced back to 1878 and the invention of the manual telephone exchange, the jack is apparently going the way of the floppy disk and the folding map. The future will be wireless.” - Does Apple really think we're ready to ditch the headphone jack? [The Guardian] “The sad thing is, the headphone jack – that 3.5mm analogue three or four pole plug – is a very good connector. It’s a universal connector: it can plug into your smartphone, your tablet and computer, your TV, hi-fi, radio, Game Boy or console. And it has been used widely for decades, more or less replacing the larger 1/4-inch jacks (which dated from the 1870s) since the 1960s for all but specialist applications, such as electric guitars and some more powerful amps. As smartphones have become the primary music device for a whole generation and more, most headphones spend the majority of their time plugged into these pocket computers. But now the jack’s dominance is being contested.” - Steve Wozniak Warns Apple Against Removing iPhone 7’s Headphone Jack [Fortune] Still, that’s not enough for Woz. In his interview, the Apple co-founder said that transmitting audio over Bluetooth isn’t good enough for those, like him, who want better fidelity. “I would not use Bluetooth … I don’t like wireless,” he said. “I have cars where you can plug in the music, or go through Bluetooth, and Bluetooth just sounds so flat for the same music.” - Noted Apple Analyst Drops Yet More iPhone 7 Details [The Verge] • No headphone jack, as you may or may not have come to terms with by now. Kuo says Apple will put EarPod headphones with a Lightning connector in the box alongside a Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter. As for what Apple will do with the space formerly occupied by the jack? It'll be taken up by a new sensor to improve the iPhone's 3D Touch experience. • Five color options. The current rose gold, gold, and silver models will remain, but space gray will be replaced by a "dark black" option and a separate "piano black" model with a glossy finish. Kuo says that supply may be limited on the piano black iPhone, with Apple possibly restricting it to higher storage tiers at first. • Apple's new A10 processor could be clocked at up to 2.4 or 2.45GHz, a major jump over the A9's 1.85GHz, though power concerns could drive the final clock down a little. It will be manufactured by TSMC. posted by Fizz (399 comments total) 14 users marked this as a favorite   Don't bluetooth headphones have to be charged?

Unfortunately every car I've ever driven has had painfully awkward bluetooth interfaces that never want to sync up to my phone when I get in and lose their connection during the momentary lapse of starting the engine. So, unless Apple comes up with something that makes no headphones worth it I'll stick with my iPhone 6, or switch to Android. posted by Mr.Encyclopedia at 1:33 PM on September 5, 2016 [4 favorites] The other thing for me is that you can get really cheap wired headphones if you don't care that much about sound quality, which means that I can keep a pair in my gym locker, a pair in my purse, and a pair in my messenger bag.

In my case, everything from my $20 whatever-whenever headphones to my $150-$300 studio headphones. In addition to trying to shrink the size of their device by offloading the D/A and amplifiers, I suspect this is also about closing the analog hole.

Nobody actually believes that people are pirating music by capturing the output of the headphone jack, and in any case, this won't close the analog hole anyway, because you'll be able to get a little dingus that connects a headphone plug to the lightning port. Maybe it'll even come with the phone. People will yell and scream about this; there will be the rehashing of now thirty-year-old Apple arguments that are even now happening in this very thread as yea they have happened in every thread about Apple before, and in the end none of it will matter; people who were going to get the next iPhone anyway will get the next iPhone, and people who weren't, won't.

The reason there's so much fragmentation with regards to the various Android updates (and why so many people are on older versions such as KitKat, Lollipop, etc.) has more to do with the various cellular carriers and manufacturers and their wanting to put their own imprint on Android with each subsequent update.

I get the $5 Monoprice earbuds in bulk because they have decent sound and my kids are constantly losing or breaking them (I sometimes lose them too). My older son bought more expensive Audio Technica over-the-ears with his saved up allowance, and I bought some over-the-ears for blocking out sound at the gym. All these would become obsolete or require an even easier-to-lose and more expensive adaptor without the 3/8" jack. Phones already do waterproofing and are just as thin with the jack. I'm guessing this has more to do with them owning Beats than anything else. posted by eye of newt at 3:17 PM on September 5, 2016 I have executive function issues, and remembering stuff is a challenge for me. There's an app for that. In fact, there are about a zillion apps for that, and some of them come with the phone. I don't know what it is about Apple that makes people so crazy, but damn. IKR? Every time Apple even hints at getting rid of an old standard, or introduce a new one, people just lose their shit.

I tell you what, folks, I've seen a shitload more Bluetooth headsets than I've seen people with $300 cans and some sort of allergy to adapters.

I see no reason why I wouldn't do the same for the iPhone. I've had three or four iPhones at this point, but if Apple really removes the headphone jack I guess it's time to go to Android.

So you can make things like an inline headset with a DAC and advanced noise cancellation for both the headset and the mic. I expect this to be rapidly commoditized over the next decade. You can also bring true multi-channel surround sound to market as well. posted by Talez at 4:00 PM on September 5, 2016 [3 favorites] The biggest thing with moving to Lightning/USB-C is that you have power and you're working with data instead of channels.

If you forget to charge them, just plug them into the phone and use them like standard headphones, and they'll charge while you're listening. If you're on an airplane, just plug them in and you can put your phone in airplane mode. You can completely forget about the wireless functionality if you want to, and just use them like wired headphones. But when you want to go wireless, just unplug them, and they'll switch automatically -- no manual pairing process or anything. Spare headphones will be $50 now, but in a year there will be $10 clones. Yeah, it seems pretty goofy right now.

About $20 or so for the cheapo model (because I'm cheap) and it works fantastically well. Not perfect; of course it needs to be charged every few days, and with my recent switch to Android, support for the headphones is a bit more finicky. But overall wireless headphones beat the wired version by a country mile. In short, no more fucking TANGLES to deal with, and that's worth any downside times a thousand. I cannot even imagine going back to wired headphones (TANGLES!), no way.

If they start actually denying me the right to take media that I have purchased and own in physical form and create a digital form for me to use with it (or if they take material from non-label artists that I buy that comes either in digital form or in physical + digital form) and tell me I can't listen to it for some reason, I will call the ACLU and contact a zillion lawyers until someone will take the case and chase it all the way up to the SCOTUS.

A standard element of technology that can be traced back to 1878 and the invention of the manual telephone exchange …" "The sad thing is, the headphone jack – that 3.5mm analogue three or four pole plug – is a very good connector … [that] … has been used widely for decades, more or less replacing the larger 1/4-inch jacks (which dated from the 1870s)" The amusing thing, to anyone with experience of the different historical types, is that the current "headphone" plug/jack is the shitty bastard child of the bastard child of the very good original. The original BPO plug / jack (later formalised & patented as BPO 316) was an amazing piece of careful engineering, designed so that it had a large contact area (for high current capacity), good wiping (for low resistance & low noise at low currents), and was inherently difficult (though not impossible) to short when plugging in. Unfortunately, back in the mid-late 19th C there was one thing America hated more than the British - and that was British IP law (c.f. Gilbert & Sullivan). So, when it came to telephone connectors, American manufacturers decided came up with a variety of 'one-way compatible' versions (US plugs would work in BPO sockets, but not visa-versa) rather than using or licencing the BPO design. The end result, once all the differences settled down and manufacturers standardised on a single type, was the 1/4" 'phone' plug. The forefather of the modern 3.5mm (& 2.5mm) headphone plug, it neatly sidesteps all the BPO patents by making the very mistakes that the engineers at Her Majesty's Post Office designed out of the BPO original… (In practice there's later US milspec equivalents - MIL-P-642/* - which copy the patented BPO design, and at least one size - MIL-P-642/2 - is more or less compatible with BPO 316 equipment. There's also an Ericsson-standard plug - which I can't find a picture of - that's like a cross between the BPO & MIL-P-642/* designs, incorporates the best features of each, and is frankly impressive for its ability to come in a TRRRRRRRS variant…) posted by Pinback at 6:05 PM on September 5, 2016 [31 favorites] This'll be fine.

Bluetooth headphones are a total revelation. If you've been using wired headphones on the go, you've been moving a certain cautious way perhaps even without realizing it, and making the switch will give you a surprising sense of freedom. You'll dart your head from side to side with confidence, you won't be constantly plugging the headphones back into the phone when they inevitably detach, you won't need to adjust the fit in your ears because there's nothing pulling them loose, and you most certainly won't be accidentally pulling your phone out of your pocket when you lift your head, and swinging it on a precarious headphone cable pendulum until it clatters onto the escalator. With wireless headphones you have way more flexibility in where you keep your phone, you can more easily perform physical activities, you have more situational awareness, and you won't be hearing the wind and the rustling of your own movement through the cable -- so you can actually hear your music. In terms of audio quality, most people can't tell the difference. The entire history of electronics is a story of "good enough" beating superior quality. And batteries are getting better all the time at a ridiculous rate. Kill the headphone jack, it's time. posted by hyperbolic at 6:11 PM on September 5, 2016 [7 favorites] Why does the audio quality even need to be worse?

You have the rumored minor iPhone 7 upgrade where the flagship feature (better cameras) is likely limited to the Plus model. At the same time, more and more people are on plans where they will save serious money by not upgrading their iPhone 6 until next year. Removing the headphone jack is just additional friction. posted by smackfu at 6:26 PM on September 5, 2016 [1 favorite] Various people have tried to do away with the headphone jack at various times - a pal at Motorola spent about half an hour explaining that it was too darn big and you could never make a properly thin phone with it. Hasn't worked. The thought of not being able to use headphones because I've mislaid an adaptor is just not bearable. I have a pretty bad time with various sorts of noise, especially in public spaces and transport, and my phone/earbuds are a major link to sanity. I lose headphones all the time, so I have spares stashed hither and thither, and I know where to buy them in a hurry at the stations I go to a lot. If I had a phone with no earphone jack, I'd have to carry a second phone that did. Plus, my 3.5mm ecosystem is enormous. I have microphones, synthesisers, radios, computers, all of which can and frequently are hooked together, all with 3.5mm, and outside my collection of vintage wirelesses I don't think I have a single device that creates or consumes audio without one. I can and doadd a 3.5mm jack to equipment (ghetto engineering involves melting a hole through a plastic case with just the right size of soldering iron bit), and wire up stuff to a 3.5mm plug, quickly and without specialist tools or any mucking about. Bluetooth audio just isn't very nice. It's OK in an environment where you don't or can't listen to the music too closely, but that's not mondo headpho. I have some reasonably good Sony over-the-ear closed headphones that I bought precisely because I wanted a good Bluetooth experience. They revewed well, had great battery life, reasonable controls and yes, great audio - when you used them with a wired connection (via the headphones' 3.5mm jack.). They just sound worse on Bluetooth - significantly worse, not can-I-hear-it-or-not worse. I no longer use them as Bluetooth devices. Oh, and they came with a 3.5mm-3.5mm plug-to-plug lead, which I lost in no time. Doesn't matter, I have plenty of others. My last phone was fully waterproof. It had a 3.5mm jack. What advantage does losing an earphone jack get me? None What disadvantages does it get me? Potentially, lots. Why would I want to abandon a standard that I use multiple times a day, have used for 40+ years, which does its job perfectly and without fus? Beats me.

But design that parsimoniously accommodates function persists because it's good design. A capsule is good design. I'm no luddite, but good, functional, reliable design is good, functional, reliable design.

While supposedly the headphone adapter dongle will be included, that doesn't help when, as mentioned upthread, I want to play Pokemon, but I need a battery pack because it drains battery power. I play with one earphone in, so I can walk without staring at my phone. The one earphone alerts me to events in the game. The open ear is so I can hear the world around me. No headphones while charging means staring at my phone. One of the reasons I need to get a new phone? My lightning port is dying. If you bump my phone while it's connected to a charger, it will stop, then start, then stop, then start charging ad nauseum. If it's on a desk, it means an annoying repeated buzzing (if it's particularly aggressive, I'll get the note that maybe my device, an actual by god Apple lighting cable, is not compatible with my phone.

I'm not interested in dealing with that while trying to listen to music a year or so down the line when the lightning port starts to fall apart. I'm not looking forward to learning a new OS, navigating a new app store, or repurchasing all of my apps.

What's the superior alternative that the Told-You-Soers would suggest? Android, with its vast unpatched security holes and minimal OS support beyond release (when it's often already multiple major versions out of date) unless you buy the smartphone equivalent of a Linux desktop? Windows Phone 7, named for the number of developers who supported it? BlackBerry, already a dead platform? A flip phone, the 2010s version of I Don't Even Own a TV? Wouldn't it be more appropriate to apply the marketing-sheep stereotype to Samsung's customers, given that the company outspends its competitors literally ten-to-one on advertising (with the remarkably un-self-aware message of "don't be a sheep so easily swayed by marketing!" chief among their vast marketing)? Is it really entirely unthinkable that maybe, just maybe, what is now the world's largest company (by some measures) succeeded on the merits of their products when compared to the alternatives? I mean, if Apple didn't make products that were at least pretty good, why would multiple industries be filled with companies slavishly mimicking their designs? It's not like it was somehow inevitable that every laptop would have an aluminum case and a black "chicklet" keyboard. Android began life as a copy of BlackBerry OS. Windows began life as a copy of the Macintosh (which was itself based on Jobs' misremembered experiences at Xerox PARC, except that he remembered PARC being far more advanced than it actually was). The Innovative New Icon-Based Taskbar in Windows 7 was just the Mac OS/NextStep dock. I'm certainly not suggesting that Apple is the only company innovating in its industries, but they certainly do seem to be a good indicator of what everyone else will be doing in two or three years, and the only ones ever bothering to try to do something other than big beige rectangles on your desk and cheap black plastic laptops. And of course, this is leaving aside stuff like recycling efforts; how many of the alternatives that you'd have people purchase are made by companies that have even considered stuff like that, much less built an entire facility dedicated to reclaiming nearly all of the materials used to build their older products? I mean, it's clear enough that it's an industry where, for whatever reason, most of the players don't get held to any standards. Maybe it's the "serves you right for trying to pretend you're better than us" principle (also known as the "so you're saying my boy's too GOOD to work in the mines? principle") at work here, the one that led the Prius recalls making the nightly news even when they were based on something that wasn't even real, and yet GM/Ford/Chrysler recalls rarely even even register a blip. It's like how Donald Trump gets a free pass for having five kids by three different partners, yet Hillary Clinton is haunted by the ghosts of accusations past that weren't even sort of real.

Thunderbolt is also gaining traction on PCs. Bluetooth audio quality can be as good as you care for it to be. iOS can already send AAC audio directly to Bluetooth devices which support them (avoiding any sort of transcode operation), and there are lossless Bluetooth standards that Apple is sure to support, and require support for on Bluetooth devices that get MFi licensing. posted by ArmandoAkimbo at 8:33 PM on September 5, 2016 [9 favorites] Apple could smack some glass on poop and profitably sell it Huh? Apple has distinguished itself by having an an obsessively-expressed design ethos and sweating the details to a pathological extent, even doing massively controversial and unpopular things like removing critical ports for reason that boil down to aesthetics so regardless of how you feel about their particular choices, that's the precise opposite of "smacking some glass on on poop" & also unless you take the "massive consumer waste" angle with literally the rest of industrial society too, it's kind of disingenuous to lay that at Apple's feet specifically; at worst they're doing what every other enormous corporation does but in the service of a coherent aesthetic that's mean to be aesthetically and functionally pleasing to the people who buy the resulting products. I agree the choice between "enormous polluting amoral corporation that cares about aesthetics" and "enormous polluting amoral corporation that happily sells ugly crap" is not an enormously inspiring choice, but all other things being equal I'll take the beautiful, thoughtful result instead of the ugly one. also, you will still be able to use your current headphones. additionally: nobody is going to come to your home and take your current phone away from you. posted by Sokka shot first at 8:45 PM on September 5, 2016 [12 favorites] using direct digital connection gives Apple (and their media industry partners) full control over what can be listened to on an iPhone This has come up a couple of times.

It's connected with an Apple Lightning-to-HDMI adapter. The adapter itself introduces compression artifacts all over the screen---impossible not to notice when standing right next to a 60" TV. At first I thought I was going nuts---how could this little cable be causing compression artifacts??---but a quick search confirmed that there's a little fucking chip in there that manages to wreck everything with lossy compression. So.. Apple is now moving towards a wireless digital solution as their only option? Can't say I really trust them with that. posted by qxntpqbbbqxl at 9:14 PM on September 5, 2016 Where would the adapter plug in, on the charging port? So I couldn't listen to music in my car and charge my phone at the same time? Those will be some fun road trips: hours of music followed by dead silence while we wait for the phone to recharge. Im not super pro-this-change, but my dads 90s Subaru with an early 2000s(like, pre iPods having a color screen even I think) "iPod ready!" stereo is capable of charging my iPhone 6S while playing audio over USB. That stereo cost maybe $100 in like 2004. I haven't rented, driven, or rode in a car made in the past ten years that didn't support audio over usb from Apple stuff. Even like, the crappiest stripper model US cars or hyundais. A 3 door Yaris will have it. Like, my 15 year old beater doesn't... But it's basically a universal feature now.

If I may add another nail, plugging the analogue hole for audio simply is not possible. Human ears are analogue devices. Speakers are analogue devices. The information must be converted to the analogue domain at some point. So far that is similar to the human visual system, except that while humans generally have two ears, we demand more than two pixels. Even if there were an encrypted pathway from the storage device to the speakers, any kid with rock could smash the earbuds open and wire them to a pair of analogue‐to‐digital converters. For video, the equivalent would involve digitising several million channels in parallel. Have fun wiring that up.

And there's a fair bit of that in this thread… Supporting relatively open technologies over closed technologies, especially when in most respects they are equal (price, capability, performance, etc.) isn't othering. And if people vote with their wallets to support closed technologies, that's their own deal. Those of us with a preference for open tech aren't in it to feel superior, but we can't help but feel justified and also sad if we are proven right about a technology that fails the users. Wondering why people buy products presumably against their own interest (a flexible open system) is a lot like wondering why people vote Republican against their own interest. Either we are misjudging people, or we are misjudging what they perceive to be their interest, in comparison to what we perceive it to be. As an non-Apple fan (I don't love or hate them, have owned their products, don't miss them, nothing special) I would expect people's own interest to be in open systems, flexibility, competition. Just like I would expect people not to vote for a party who is out to take advantage of them. But I may not be perceiving other users' interests correctly. I'm always happy to learn. But honestly, I've used both types of devices and I really don't see where the love for Apple products comes from, unless it is just a "style" thing. From a technical standpoint they just rally aren't anything special.

Make all the comparisons you like to people being resistant to change in the past - "oh yeah and people made a huge deal about USB" - but I get the sense that most of the people complaining about this are current Apple customers. I'm writing this on my first smartphone, an iPhone SE. For me this is not just about getting new headphones, it's about having a totally new standard introduced without an indication that there will be any way to use the stuff I already own. And I own more than one audio I/O device that plugs into the existing jack. I would like to get more than a couple years of use out of that stuff. I mean, make all the comparisons you want with USB and people who insisted on only using the keyboard - but every computer I've owned has been at least somewhat operable without the mouse. The first computer I had with USB ports still had serial ports in the back. You didn't have to replace all your peripherals right away. If Apple releases an adapter that lets you plug your old stuff into the new phone, then at least I can keep using the stuff I own. It may be a hassle to charge the phone, or it may not. An adapter may cost a lot, or it may not. But until I have any sense of what my options are going to be, I'm going to be concerned about what my options are when it comes time to upgrade my phone. Painting people like me as behind-the-times whiners is kind of an unfair characterization, and it doesn't address my concerns now to say "ah, when the time comes you'll buy the next iPhone and you know it." posted by teponaztli at 11:53 PM on September 5, 2016 [3 favorites] Shrug. "Open" is one of those meaningless buzzwords nowadays. A "flexible open system" is only in one's own interest if one considers the time spent securing their system and compiling your software from source or whatever else to be of effectively zero value. For instance, I strongly prefer the "closed, inflexible" PS4 for playing video games over doing so on a computer, because the developers get significant optimization advantages for having a single set of hardware specs to work with, and I get the significant advantages of everything just working out of the box without having to troubleshoot drivers or what have you. A "flexible open system" is in people's own interest in much the same way that a manual transmission pickup truck might be, from the perspective of farmers or construction workers. It turns out, though, that a lot of people prefer a small, efficient sedan for relatively low-impact tasks like commuting to work, even if they'd never be able to pop open the hood and diagnose the engine noises at a glance. What is "open"? Apple's Swift programming language is open-source and their WebKit is at the heart of virtually every modern web browser. Google, the champion of the "open web," keep anything that gives them a competitive advantage close to their chest. Mac OS is a closed-source operating system built on the Mach kernel, running UNIX behind the curtains, which means it's more closely related to Linux than not. Etc. etc. etc. It's complicated. On the other hand, Apple is hardly the only company to have "a technology that fails the users." Leaving aside the way that Apple's released products tend to get put up for comparison with other companies' prototypes and pipe dreams that never seem to come to fruition, what do we make of the ecosystem-crushing decisions Google alone has made by shuttering their RSS feeder? Or the failures of Google Wave or Google Glass or that modular smartphone project or pretty much any World-Changing Product Google makes a big fuss about? It's complicated. posted by DoctorFedora at 11:56 PM on September 5, 2016 [3 favorites] Incidentally, it'd be cool if people waited until Apple actually announced the product that is presumably dropping the headphone jack before deciding that everything is going to be the worst-case scenario, forever. Maybe, just maybe, someone at Apple has noticed that some people use wired headphones, and would like to continue doing so. They might even have taken those folks into consideration in some way whatsoever. Worst-case scenario is basically that you just have to put an adapter on the plug, like those old ¼" jack headphones. The way some people are talking about all of this, you'd think that Obama is coming around to forcibly collect everyone's headphones, forever. It's a very silly thing to get really upset about!

And, really, I don't think they're perfect, I know they're just as profit-driven as any other corp, and I know that they truly don't care about me, the end-user. That's pretty much my opinion of any corporation, large or small, public or private. But I prefer using their stuff because I got sick of pissfarting around with Windows & Linux on a daily basis, and am happy to pay the minimal (if any) premium over equivalent-quality hardware from elsewhere. FWIW, I'm no luddite or refugee from technology - I have a couple of SBCs running Linux & OpenBSD for various things, in my spare time I repair vintage radios & design some pretty complicated RF / microcontroller / general electronics gear (one of the few times I do use Windows, in VirtualBox - some of the programming, FPGA, & DSP tools simply aren't available otherwise), etc. But in general I use Apple stuff because, as the old slogan went, It Just Works.

This isn’t “the analogue hole” at all, but technologically, there’s nothing stopping them from trying that. There would be a game of cat‐and‐mouse between Apple and outsiders attempting to reverse engineer Apple’s chips (or get the required specifications directly via corporate espionage), but assuming Apple maintains the upper hand (and doesn’t let their licensees be a weak point), the best a non‐licensing manufacturer could do would be to cannibalise the real chips and hack their product onto the analogue end of that. Presumably Apple would include a pair of iBuds with every iDevice, which would put a ceiling on the price of the security components. The expense of procuring used iBuds and the labour costs of handling them would give Apple and their licensees control of the the low end of the market, while the high end would be hampered by the limitations imposed on their designs by their hacked‐together architecture. That’s just the technical side of this hypothetical, though. The legal and social hurdles Apple would face are likely more significant, but let’s open that can of worms when we come to it, if we come to it. posted by Fongotskilernie at 12:56 AM on September 6, 2016 [1 favorite] it occurs to me at times that the idea of Apple as this trendy company that it's Cool to Love still feels really incongruous to me, because I grew up in the '90s, when Windows 95 was a legitimately better operating system in most ways and when Apple was basically floundering and just generally not doing super well.

Microsoft gets a bad rap (not completely undeserved though...Windows ME *shudder*) but since Windows 7, every PC I have owned has been able to run for literally months between reboots (unless I chose to load updates) with total stability. This on a machine that does all my web stuff, graphics stuff, work stuff, gaming, etc. The caveat of course being that every one of those machines I built, instead of buying a brand-name system, based on race-to-the-bottom-of-price components. What many people bitch about when they say "Microsoft" is really "shitty PC vendor who built a sub-standard machine running Microsoft Windows" It's great if Apple stuff "just works" but as an IT person, I can unequivocally state that it isn't always, or even usually, the case anymore. Except maybe for the home user that surfs the web, listens to some tunes, and dabbles in photo editing and document creation. In a business environment, Apple doesn't "just work" a LOT of the time. So it's all fine and dandy if people buy what they like, but let's just say I won't be shocked when Apple does something the users very much DON'T LIKE, but become victims of a type to lock-in based on their chosen ecosystem and walled-garden approach. It just annoys me when Apple does that to their users and the same users then turn around and talk about how great it is, because Apple always does the very best stuff!

If alongside the iPhone release, Apple/Beats also release a pair of BT in-ear headphones that deliver on the software experience Apple is known for and also includes fast-charging from the phone directly (like the Pencil where a 15s charge will keep you going for an hour) then that might finally get me to migrate from my current, loved, Shure monitors. With Handoff, it'd be cool if I were listening to a playlist on my phone, that as I sat down at my computer, iTunes would already show that, and I'd just start getting the computer sounds via the earbuds. Perhaps if there were a tiny light sensor in the earphones, taking them off would signal the computer to start using it's own speakers/headphones, sort of like when you pull up in your car to a open-air place that's listening to the same radio station— seamless like that. posted by Static Vagabond at 6:02 AM on September 6, 2016 [1 favorite] What stops Apple from breaking the dongles, so now you have to buy "iPhone Licensed" headphones?

I've tried probably fifteen to twenty brands over the years, from cheap to expensive. They always fail at the same spot: the connection between the plug and the cord. The headphone jack is garbage technology and I say good riddance. I've long wanted decent cordless earbuds, but they're all too bulky and uncomfortable to sleep in. If this prompts manufacturers to actually make earbuds that meet my needs, I'm all for it. posted by painquale at 7:19 AM on September 6, 2016 [5 favorites] One of the reasons I need to get a new phone?

I'm pretty pragmatic about these things and want to keep my phone for a while (the only reason I'm even upgrading is that my 5S has a 2-hour battery life and replacing the battery didn't do a lick). Honestly, I don't care at all about the missing headphone jack. The way I see it, apple products are dominant enough that initially I may need to deal with a dongle or two (call it part of the purchase price) but soon enough everything will migrate to the new standard and the cheap skullcandy headphones I favor will be easy to buy in lightning form as well. I was a longtime nexus android user before I was an iPhone user, and one of the most frustrating things about that was seeing how fast manufacturers adapted to iPhone changes compared to those on other phone models (look at how few cool Qi charger options there are). After a year we'll forget we even worried about it. I understand how much more frustrating it would be if I were an audiophile with $$$ headphones that I didn't regularly lose or break - but at that price point, I fail to see why buying an appropriate adapter is so bad really. Especially for a change that does provide other benefits to the phone's form factor, waterproofing, etc. posted by R a c h e l at 8:13 AM on September 6, 2016 How are we supposed to plug the new iPhones into our car audio systems? Lightning to HDMI cable, I would think. I don't have an iPhone, but when I bought my new Honda they mentioned many times that I could plug one into an HDMI port in the console to control music, gps, and telephone functions through the car's console video screen and steering wheel controls. posted by aught at 8:27 AM on September 6, 2016 But what stops Apple from forcing the D/A conversion into the headphones themselves? What stops Apple from breaking the dongles, so now you have to buy "iPhone Licensed" headphones? What stops them from disapproving certain audio sources from playback? Or demanding exorbitant licensing fees for compatible headphones? I am not a huge fan of unfettered capitalism, but one thing is it usually pretty good at is keeping companies from making too many choices that will annoy and inconvenience consumers when there are eight other similar companies making similar products. What keeps Apple from doing this stuff (assuming they even want to) is Samsung, Google, LG, Windows, etc, all ready to throw big advertising dollars into reminding you that they also have nice phones that don't do that annoying crap. posted by Pater Aletheias at 8:30 AM on September 6, 2016 While everyone is agonizing over the possibility of ditching the headphone jack, maybe give Piano Black a listen.

Reinvent bluetooth to make it actually work and easy to configure and program or make an ab initio wireless usb/thunderbolt to replace it. Pick a wireless charging standard and make it stick. Do a deal with starbucks to put some in every store. Make wireless thunderbolt and wireless charging common between the new ear bud, the phone and the iWatch 2. That solves many of the problems with Macbooks having no ports either. Refresh them to wireless thunderbolt (or whatever) too in a couple of months. And make it 10-m waterproof (and then advertise it as an underwater camera for christ's sakes), not just immersion proof like the Samsung. Push the phone where it needs to be in other words. That's the design and engineering I'd expect from Apple. posted by bonehead at 10:02 AM on September 6, 2016 [2 favorites] What happens when/if Apple decides they won't playback podcasts not available on iTunes?

Using an adapter is kind of meh, but acceptable. If you can't play music while charging, then it's all over. Say goodbye to podcasts on road trips in my bluetoothless Civic. And voice navigation. I'd never get a headphoneless phone for that reason alone. Like most others, I really don't understand the motivation behind this decision. The headphone jack is a perfectly good interface with decades of ubiquity. It's probably the most successful plug format in history. It's everywhere, compatible with everything, and could easily stay the same format for 100 more years. It just works. Why Apple? Why? posted by dis_integration at 10:54 AM on September 6, 2016 How about fixing the goddamned strain relief on these lightning cables before you make everything single thing dependent on them? This is a cat declawing level fight, by the way. Either you've had like ten inexplicably fall apart, or you're a stupid rube who can't treat anything with care and destroys everything by being a slob because i haven't seen a single one fail. I've seen threads about this on other sites get locked. I can pinpoint the exact time when those cables became garbage. It was right around the first multicolored ipod nano, when they went from having thick corrugated strain relief(see here) to the thin modern design(example). Somewhere in my house, i have some of the old style cables i got in i want to say 2003 with my first ipod. I used them with my second ipod in high school, and with probably four generations of iphones and they're still fine. These went traveling all over the place, were jammed in pockets, stepped on, run over with chairs, stuffed in filthy bags and crushed, etc. One of them the freaking plastic housing shattered off but the cord was perfectly fine and the plug still worked(it just looks like robocop). I haven't had one of the new style ones last more than 6 months unless it just sat in a drawer unused. The one that just sits on my desk at work and never goes anywhere is splitting in like 3 places. And yes, i unplug the things with the plug and not the cord. I've worked in IT for like a decade. Leave me alone.

That's the half-assing problem. People above have been illustrating why removing the plug makes a bunch of stuff a little worse. But where's the benefit for what they're giving up? It's a neither fish-nor-fowl "solution" that pisses off people without offering a compelling benefit. What great new head-turning feature is Cook going to offer in it's place? Jobs had the sense to know that if you take away one feature, you make the replacement better. Wireless, wireless that works great, is better. A new plug for the earphones that mean you can't charge at the same time? That's the opposite of better. When you make a change like this, it has to be better than what's gone before. You can't do it half-way. This is half-way. posted by bonehead at 1:04 PM on September 6, 2016 [3 favorites] Apple is not in the business of selling well-engineered devices. They are in the business of selling expensive, breakable devices that require you to buy proprietary, exclusive, expensive accessories in order to make everything work as well as a similar device of another brand that costs half as much money. I mean, look at how people are spinning Apple's decision as "where technology is going", when the fact of the matter is that you will now have to spend hundreds of dollars on new accessories to get the same capability as the stuff you can do today. That's not an improvement. It's not even an advancement. It's a step back. Just like getting rid of multiple ports was a step back, just Iike being the only phone without Gorilla glass was a step back, just like getting rid of the optical drive was a step back. Every single iteration, Apple charges you more money to do less with your device. And if you've already sunk your electronics investment into the Apple ecosystem, then pretty soon you won't HAVE a choice but to upgrade to Apple's latest piece of shit because you won't be able to find cables anymore, or get the battery replaced, or some other easily rectified item that Apple refuses to do because they'd rather you be forced to spend more money on their devices and accessories. They know you're not going to go out and replace your Apple TV and MacBook and iPad because that would cost you a couple grand that you probably don't have, and you've probably bought into the Apple image long ago and don't want to admit that it was all a marketing ploy that you fell for. But it is. That's exactly what it is. Apple makes overpriced crap. Stop buying it. Vote with your dollars. They will change to meet the demands of the market, just like they made an iPad mini and a bigger iPhone to meet the demands of the market. Apple's sales are noticeably depressed, and if the iPhone 7 flops due to a lack of a headphone jack (and just think of how Apple is closing itself out of the market for accessories! That's a huge profit margin that will be almost completely gone) then they will change, or fail as a company. There are better phones out there that will do everything an iPhone does for far less money, and with much better compatibility with third-party accessories. posted by Autumnheart at 1:20 PM on September 6, 2016 [1 favorite] Apple is not in the business of selling well-engineered devices.

I guess you're entitled to that opinion but it really clashes with my experience. I have a brand new 12" retina macbook. it's a beautiful, well-engineered device. It's the nicest laptop I've ever owned. It has price parity with comparable windows laptops. Using a USB-C dock works fine. My previous macbook pro lasted 6 years and I only replaced it because I dropped with headphones in from a good height and now the headphone jack is bent and doesn't work. Apple makes quality gear, laptops and all-in-one's as nice as any competitor, and usually nicer in the details, and at least for their PCs, it's not overpriced. You can find some exceptions, like the Mac Pro, but they are pretty few and far between. Are the iDevices overpriced? It's hard to say: they certainly sell well at their price point. Whatever is going on with the headphone jack in the iPhone it doesn't take away from Apple's long history of producing best in class consumer computing devices. posted by dis_integration at 1:34 PM on September 6, 2016 [3 favorites] I'm typing this on a 4 year old Macbook Air that hasn't even had a single minor issue, let alone a problem that would justify my upgrading to a better laptop.

Stop buying it. Vote with your dollars. I think the market is voting with their dollars. So far, the dollars are saying that people ("iSheep" in some people's parlance, maybe?) are willing to pay more for things that are well thought out and pleasant to use, because apparently their time and mental effort have significant value to them. Or maybe it's like jewelry, or buying a show-off BMW when a beater Civic would get you there just as fast, given the speed limits. I owned a Civic, and I'd never buy a BMW, but I don't go around being offended by people who choose to buy them. And the iPhone or the Macbook laptops are the single best-selling products in their categories - the Civic in volume, while being pitched at the BMW price point. They must be doing something right, no? If Apple's sales collapse over the transition to wireless headphones, the market will have spoken in a way that Apple won't be able to ignore. Just like they wouldn't have ignored market signals that told them removing floppy drives was a bad idea. Or removing VGA ports. Or removing Ethernet from laptops. Or removing optical drives. I'm not sure why you think your value judgements ("overpriced crap") are right for everyone else too ("it was all a marketing ploy that you fell for").

Mehhhh. Firstly, i fix devices. Not as much as i used to, but i've been repairing everything i could open with a screwdriver since i was a preteen. Every single iphone has gotten easier to repair. The first 3 generations were HORRIBLE. The 4 and 4s were really hard to replace the screen on. All the ones since the 5 come apart like a lego set, and can be repaired in less than ten minutes for all the basic issues(broken screen, battery, even a motherboard swap or bad camera). Most other phones are really terrible to take apart. Notably, basically everything by HTC and samsung are just gluefests. The reason most repair shops predominantly advertise iphone repairs isn't because people buy more iphones, it's because they're the easiest to do quickly and turn a profit on therein. The parts aren't even really more expensive(go look at how much a galaxy s7 display costs vs an iphone 6s...) Second, i've priced and checked out my fair share of replacements from all the big OEMs every time i've needed a new laptop. Once you pick out similar specs of the nicer macs(the air is an abject ripoff, i'll admit) it becomes a tossup within $100 or so. The competitors also almost universally have sealed in batteries, stupid screws, glued together bits, etc. Go look at something like a dell XPS compared to the macbook pro, or the similar lenovo models, or the HPs, or... And the actual casing, trackpad, and general chassis always feels a little bit more solid on the macs. Others have caught up, but not completely. The whole industry is at about the same place right now, honestly. Basically everything you buy you'll have to unscrew something to get the battery out. Are there sort of "legacy" designs like the chunkier thinkpads that give you optical drives and pop out batteries and expansion bays and such? Yes, but you basically always sacrifice specs and start paying well... Apple or worse prices to get it. You can spend $2000 on a thinkpad with a slightly lower res screen, and crappier CPU and GPU than the basic 15in macbook pro that costs the same. Will some people want this? Yea, but it's a niche model... and it has limitations. I will make utterly no defense of imacs or apple desktops in general though, fuck that shit. A $1500 computer shouldn't have a spinning hard drive in 2016. Hell, a $500 one shouldn't. And they downgraded the mac mini in the latest generation(over a model introduced in 2012, 2012!!!), and the mac pro is at least partially stupid as hell, etc. But i will absolutely defend iphones, ipads, and the macbooks bar the air as being a different color of processed cheese product everyone else is selling for about the same prices. And in some ways, especially with the phones, they do better. Shit, basically every brand that had a removable battery phone in their main lineup has dumped it over the past two years.

As in, it will ride on either bluetooth or wifi direct(like airplay), and not be its own standard entirely. Normal bluetooth audio and wifi direct/wifi streaming will work normally. This will just be another silly codec standard... but probably the one that suddenly every manufacturer is adding. (I'm still bitter, btw, i own i think 3 bluetooth audio devices with apt-x i've never gotten to use it on because not all android devices support it, and no apple devices do. it really does work great, i've tried it on other stuff!... it's just totally proprietary). Also as an anecdata item: i bought super duper awesome mega good H/K bluetooth headphones, mostly on the premise that they worked wired or wireless. But they take a stupid USB>headphone jack charging cable like the ipod shuffle... which H/K wont sell me now that i lost it. I've been trying to figure out the pinout to make one... but god dammit. I also had another pair of wireless headphones where the charging port imploded.

Despite having such a set, I still use wired earbuds. And despite my phone having a gaping hole for the 3.5mm jack, it will still operate normally when dunked in a bathtub (conformal nanocoatig and short circuit protection on the exposed connectors for the win, I guess?) The proble with any wireless audio (or video) is that uncompressed audio and video are simply too large to send over Bluetooth or even wifi or any other standard that uses a reasonable amount of spectrum. It has to be compressed. That means recompressing audio that was decoded from a compressed source. There is always some loss inherent in that process. Original BT stereo (A2DP) used a compression algorithm called SBS. It kinda sucked. aptX is the new one, but it kinda sucks too, just less. Plus, there is an unavoidable battery life hit from doing the work of compression and decompression. Sadly, it's more energy intensive than the amplifier for the wired headphones is, so you get worse battery life also. Sometimes the trade-off is worth it, but sometimes it isn't. Having a choice is nice, especially when it doesn't involve proprietary shit that is almost always overpriced. You can get decent (branded, not generic) wired earbuds for $13 that have a microphone and call control buttons. There is no way in hell you could sell a set with a lightning cable for that.

Bluetooth 3.0 and up fudge it a bit by using the Bluetooth bit ("Classic") to set up an ad-hoc low-power point-to-point WiFi connection ("AMP") for the "High-speed" part, but even ignoring that there's still more than enough bandwidth for 2 channel uncompressed audio (~1.5Mbps) + framing/packet/bursting/etc overheads. "Original BT stereo (A2DP) used a compression algorithm called SBS. It kinda sucked. aptX is the new one, but it kinda sucks too, just less." Not quite. Those are just the mandatory audio codecs in the Bluetooth specs; part of what needs to be implemented to call yourself "Bluetooth". Vendor-specific stuff - like compressed audio (e.g. MP3/AAC/HE-AAC/FLAC/ALC), or even uncompressed audio - has always been allowed. That said, if they do go all Bluetooth headsetty they'll most likely use that high speed AMP connection I glossed over above - which gives them 25-55Mbps to play with.

C'mon!"), while the LE & HS bits are quite nice… posted by Pinback at 8:20 PM on September 6, 2016 [2 favorites] Nonstandard "foo over Bluetooth" is useless to me and anyone else who gives a shit about interoperability.

The adapter shown only converts a standard headphone plug to lightning port. I also have serious concerns about the charging/listening to music stuff. When I was working I often charged my phone while using headphones. I really hope there's a way to charge and listen that isn't wireless. I also hate the idea of yet another thing that needs charging or can get lost easily. Plus I'm a person with tiny ears so many earbuds aren't comfortable or don't want to stay in - the Apple buds are fine. And I wear glasses so anything that hooks behind the ear may also be uncomfortable. Uhhhg. Plus, at night I have sleep headphones and having to do some wireless option that might get lost in my bed seems super annoying - does anyone have any recommendations for comfortable wireless sleep headphones? I love Apple, and I'll be honest when I say that I'll probably get the 7. I was possibly going for the SE since it's the same size as my 5s and I have super tiny baby hands - but there's just too much more that the 7 can do compared to the SE. In addition the camera specs are better - especially for the front facing camera. But it's super frustrating. I'm Apple stuff all the way. I've grown up with it. I hate using my husband's Android phone because it feels all.. weird and not intuitive. Plus I love how easily all my stuff is synced up. But there better be a solution for charing+listening that isn't wireless. And I totally agree - wireless just isn't there yet. Not to mention the drain on battery life for the device AND the headphones. It's like trying to include hologram technology or something. In the future I could see it as the "norm" but at this exact moment it time it seems like more hassle and has huge downfalls to tried to be rolled out as the baseline.

Schiller said that the three reasons were firstly that the company had shown it could adapt Lightning to other uses beyond charging and data transfer So? Just because you can doesn't mean you should. Oh wait, it's another opportunity to push your proprietary standard (for easily broken cables that frequently need to be replaced, from what I read). secondly that there were other technologies competing for space and "maintaining an ancient connector doesn't make sense" Other technologies are always competing for space. Too bad the iPhone is so absurdly large that you had no alternative but to remove a longtime standard component that you made no money from. And why aren't you addressing that boring old two-slot connector for alternating current in North America? "Ancient" doesn't always mean "bad." and thirdly that the company wanted to explore wireless delivery. Which already exists, thanks. Bluetooth is fine for connecting to my car. Although recompressing the data reduces the sound quality ... which is why I want the headphone jack for music. Go ahead and add your fancy Airpod capability, but leave my headphone jack alone. Got my first iPhone last year. As nice as it is, I'll eventually go back to Android over this rather than buy a 7. I'm serious.

Every now and then you'll want to charge your phone while you listen to music, and you'll sigh and charge in silence. Or you'll forget your headphones and borrow some off a co-worker, but you don't have your adapter, like that time someone gave you a USB drive to get some files off but you didn't have the adapter for your macbook. So mostly it will be okay and every now and then it will be a little bit shit. Then a year from now everyone will be like "See, apple was right, it was great" and you'll be like, "um, I guess?

But here I was coming around to the idea that maybe the iPhone really is better and worth the extra cost -- and now Apple has made this obviously terrible decision, and bragged about how smart it is and their courage in doing so. Nuts. While some individuals may not consider it a big deal -- which I get, not everyone uses their phone the same way -- does anybody think that this is an affirmatively good idea? (Besides David Pogue.) Was any user saying, "This iPhone could be really great if it wasn't for this headphone jack"? Was its presence bothering anyone who didn't use it?

June 10, 2016: The Moto Z has no headphone jack The first major new flagship to launch in the US without one ...Most likely, Lenovo's motivation for ditching the headphone jack is the same as that of Chinese rival LeEco, which already made the change with its 2016 lineup. LeEco's president of R&D Liang Jun explained to The Verge that his company was driven by the desire to promote the greater clarity and quality of digital audio via the USB-C port. Why did LeEco ditch the headphone jack? ...What prompted you to remove the standard headphone jack? What's the benefit? Liang Jun: We chose to discontinue the 3.5mm audio jack in our second-gen phones to create a better quality audio experience for everyone to enjoy. With the 3.5mm audio jack, the stereo sound was compromised due to poor sound channel separation and the sound quality was compromised due to a mismatch between phone and headphones. By replacing the 3.5 mm jack with a Type-C port, it introduces a new approach to mobile audio transcoding and transmission and delivers what we believe is a much better overall audio experience for consumers. posted by ActingTheGoat at 4:58 PM on September 7, 2016 [2 favorites] What a shock.

It's pretty much essential for use in the car, especially given the way that lithium batteries work (Running them down too much degrades their capacity far more quickly than if you keep them topped off. My SO's battery turned to shit inside of a year because she couldn't be arsed to charge it) posted by wierdo at 5:46 PM on September 7, 2016 Actually you're supposed to keep lithium batteries at 40% I know no one does it, but there you go. posted by Yowser at 6:05 PM on September 7, 2016 [1 favorite] For long-term (> a week or 2) storage, yeah. For general* day-to-day use, repeatedly charging them to 100% before using them normally until they hit their nominal end-point (e.g. 0% on the battery-meter) is one of the best ways to maximise life. Basically they don't like floating, they don't like self-discharging from full, and they don't like sitting flat. (* i.e. not high-discharge rates as used in some applications like R/C gear, which are frankly nutjob-bordering-on-insane) posted by Pinback at 6:49 PM on September 7, 2016 [1 favorite] No, NiMH and NiCd batteries like to be fully discharged from time to time, but for lithium, it's the deep discharges that kill them (it messes up the anode much the same way as lead acid plates get sulfated, but to a lesser degree). Not topping them off is slightly better (which is why a nornal charge on a Tesla pack is to 90 or 95% and they discourage discharge below 20% or so), but the difference on that end is minimal. What you shouldn't do with lithium chemistries is keep them at 100% for long periods of time, but charging it to full nightly or even twice a day and taking it off the charger and using only the first 60-70% of the charge is good enough for longevity on a device that will likely be replaced in 5 years or less. Any deep discharge is bad for the cell. Not as bad as it is for a lead acid, but it's still best to avoid it if possible. And especially don't leave it at/near zero for any length of time, as that is when the most damage is done. Heat is the other big enemy of lithium cells, so fast charging is worse than normal speed charging, although the algorithms in the Quick Charge chips that slow down the charge rate once the cell hits 80% mitigate that enough that you'll still get a good 3 years of reasonable battery life even if you only use quick charge. It is bad if you're planning to keep the device for 5 years or longer, though. Auto manufacturers are more conservative because their packs have to last 8-10 years. The easiest way to think of it is in terms of cycles, where a cycle is 100% to 0% and back and 100% to 80% and back counts as a fifth of a cycle. There is much confusion about this, even in some owner's manuals, because there is a lot of outdated advice out there that was good for other chemistries but is not good for lithium cells. The only reason to discharge a lithium cell to zero is if your device's battery meter gets confused and is telling you there is charge when there really isn't or its estimate of time remaining is way off. (You're not actually going to zero when you do that, but it's as close as you can get without pulling the cell out of the device, disabling the protection circuit and discharging it without the protection circuit in the battery itself in line, which you should never do if you don't like venting with flame) posted by wierdo at 8:38 PM on September 7, 2016 [5 favorites] Point is that on any competently designed phone, it will charge the battery to 100%ish and then run the phone from the charger, not the battery, while it remains plugged in, which is precisely what you want if you're in the car for an hour or two a day listening to music or podcasts from it. It's leaving it plugged in and at 100% for days or weeks on end that outweighs the benefit of reducing the cycle count on the battery. And yes, for long term storage, 40-60% and in the freezer is the way to go, at least for a bare pack. I'm not sure how much a phone's display would care to be held at 0F for long periods of time, but the battery loves it. ;) posted by wierdo at 8:45 PM on September 7, 2016 Not to pick on this comment or anything - I agree that everyone has different needs and expectations, and no one should buy something they are deeply unhappy with - but: > Was any user saying, "This iPhone could be really great if it wasn't for this headphone jack"? Was its presence bothering anyone who didn't use it? ... We're well beyond the point of diminishing returns when it comes to reducing thickness and weight, I'd argue. - people made this exact comment about the floppy drive and the optical drive and the VGA port and the ethernet port for Mac laptops. And while I would happily trade an extra mm or two of thickness on my phone for an extra half hour of battery, I can't argue that I do like the thinner laptop form factor, and my back thanks me every day for the weight reduction. Yes, I have to carry two annoying dongles in my travel kit, just in case I need Ethernet or VGA/DVI projection. And a USB stick. But that seems like a fair trade in retrospect. Again, I'm not saying that removing the audio jack was overdue, or that it was bothering me. But based on Apple's track record, I'm not ready to write this off as a huge blunder. posted by RedOrGreen at 8:57 PM on September 7, 2016 [2 favorites] Also, not sure about veracity, but this sounds plausible: Removal of iPhone 7 Headphone Jack Was Essential for Water Resistance, New Camera System In a nutshell, the "driver ledge" for the display and backlight, traditionally placed near the camera, was interfering with the new camera systems in the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, leading Apple to explore other placement options. It was moved near the audio jack, but it also caused interference with various components, including the audio jack itself, so Apple engineers toyed with the elimination of the jack altogether. When the headphone jack was removed, Apple realized it was easier to install the new Taptic Engine for the pressure-sensitive Home button, implement a bigger battery, and reach an IP7 water resistance rating, so the elimination of the headphone jack became essential for all of the other features in the iPhone 7. posted by RedOrGreen at 9:21 PM on September 7, 2016 [6 favorites]  Watch Series 2 is a whopping 0.9 mm thicker & 4.2 g heavier than Series 1, this is an unmitigated outrage.

But hey, if you can't, whatevs. Seriously, most of the women overwhelmingly use smaller phones. The reason I bought the phone I did was because of its small form factor. It actually fits in my hand and I can (just barely) squeeze it into the so-called phone pockets in most purses. As much as I would have loved better specs, usability was the driving force in my purchasing decision, and if I can't comfortably handle or carry a so-called mobile device, it fails on the usability front. posted by sardonyx at 7:50 AM on September 8, 2016 I'm also Apple all the way down and I have a 2-year-old iPhone 6, but there's no fucking way I'm buying ANY phone without a headphone jack I can use while it's charging. Bluetooth is pants for audio. The 6 still works fine, so I'll let it ride for a while, but I suspect I'll get a 6S just out of "obsolescence defense" at some point in the new year. I hope Apple does the right thing and backtracks on this, sorta like how they did with the SE, but if they don't I know know what the fuck I'll do.

Boy, was THAT a mistake! It doesn't fit in any pockets of any pants I wear, I find it to be more of a burden to carry than I expected, and while I mostly use my phone as a device to make calls and send texts (even now that it's a smartphone with supposedly infinite possibilities), I basically just leave it in the glove compartment of my car when I actually go anywhere because the form factor is too large.

I understand the underlying reason, but it's still frustrating, yaknow? It's a gender thing but it's also more than that - to my knowledge, Asian women in particular were early phablet adopters because drawing characters with a stylus was far easier than typing for various forms of Kanji. Some women do seem to prefer taking the big screen and keeping it in their purse (and using a stylus, maybe) - large phones do have their benefits after all.

So we're both dealing with personal bias based conclusions and not "numbers." I can understand why phablets would be popular if you needed to write Kanji. I can also see why they're better as an e-reader than my crappy, poor quality (seriously you can feel the plastic case coming away from the body of the device, and the phone has never been dropped or abused--not to mention the fact that halfway through phone calls it tends to drop the ability to carry my voice to the person on the other end) 5c, but that doesn't mean I haven't read hundreds of thousands of words on the tiny screen (likely to the detriment of my eyesight). I'm able to read that much precisely because I'm able to carry it with me, whereas I would find it much more difficult to carry a larger device. Count me in as another person who wouldn't buy a phone without a headphone jack. I don't use headphones to listen to music, but I have a device which I need to plug into my phone's headphone jack as part of my working life.

If you're the shirt-tucked-in type, cases with swiveling belt-clips or holsters are pretty common. If you're not, belt clip at the corner of a front pocket is likewise popular.

The original watch is already too freaking thick and has crappy battery life despite that. It's thick compared to my chunky 70s diving watch. They didn't mention the battery life at all, so i'd bet it's still not great. I was really hoping for some kind of big improvement on thickness, or a BIG improvement on battery life. It seems like we got neither. If i leave mine unplugged and don't even wake it up it's dead in less than two days. If i wear it, it basically makes it barely more than one day of use and is nearly depleted. And it's so thick some of my sleeves wont smoothly slide over it. The original pebble was a lump too, but everyone else seems to have figured this out. It looks like a total chunker compared to say, a pebble time. Wtf apple? pretty sure the numbers show phablets are more popular with women than men but whatevs I've had several discussions with a bunch of nerdy men and women i know about this and i have a theory. I have HUGE Michael Jordan hands. Like, i've met one person in my entire life with bigger hands than me. Most laptops are smaller front to back than my hand-span. All older iphones were hilarious hand-cramping small for me, and other guys i know with large hands. When the 6 came out, i bought the normal size. I tried out the 6+, and decided to go for it... But it was slightly too big to really use with one hand, but silly-feeling to use with one. It was an awkward tweener size. I ended up switching back to the smaller 6 because i couldn't get used to it. I tried the Nexus 6 to see if even bigger would work... and just found it silly. Meanwhile, the women i talked to would need to two-hand either device. So if they're going there anyways, why not go all the way and get the bigger battery/extra space/nicer camera/etc? Almost everyone i see using a 6+ is a woman, or someone will small hands. I mean, this is totally anecdotal, but i think it's a thing.

Yeah, I need to charge it every night, without fail. If I forget, 30+ minutes on the charger gets to the point that I can maybe scrape through the day. I've only ever gone into low power mode twice or maybe three times, and I've worn it daily - without a single break - since April 2015. The notifications are very useful - no more dings or beeps anywhere, just taps on the wrist. Podcast controls while walking outdoors in winter are a plus - don't have to fish around for the phone. Wrist taps for turns while navigating is a nice touch. I've used the camera remote viewfinder for group photos (exactly twice). I ping my phone from my watch so that I can find where I put it down (the phone makes a piercing sound, even if it is silent mode) a few times a week. And I couldn't live without Due buzzing me repeatedly and persistently about to-do items that I've put off. But it's those fitness circles that I find addictive, and the more history I have, the more useful it seems. Apparently I'm not alone in this usage pattern - the presentation pretty much went all in on fitness. Sorry, that got into testimonial territory. But I really love this first gen thing.

Sorry, I should have been perfectly clear that I was referring to properly managed LiIon (& "LiPo") cells/batteries which include a decent charge controller / battery gauge (i.e. most laptop / quality consumer goods these days). Hence "until they hit their nominal end-point (e.g. 0% on the battery-meter)". At that point they're not deeply discharged; there's still just under ~20% or so of the cell/battery's electrochemical capacity left unused, and there's no/minimal loss of capacity or lifespan due to excessive discharge. Likewise at the top end; no sane charge controller / fuel gauge made in the last ~15 years or so keeps them charged at the cell/battery maximum (like LA/SLA chargers do) - the usual method is to taper down the charging current once cell/battery's peak charge V until the terminal V drops to nominal O/C V, then go into a no-charge monitoring mode. At that point, the cell/battery holds about 95% of its potential electrochemical capacity, and again there's no/minimal loss of capacity or lifespan due to overcharging. All that's a pretty simplified explanation, but it conveys the gist of what happens at either extreme of a properly implemented fuel gauge / charge controller's loop. I think the difference in our opinions / understanding is mostly down to what constitutes "fully charged" & empty - the electrochemical capacity & endpoint voltages, or the battery gauge reading. My earlier comment referenced the latter. FWIW, for a few years I was involved in research & evaluation of LiIon cells & controllers as potential replacement for LA & SLA in standby & cyclic discharge uses.

Running a Galaxy Swhatever flat repeatedly murders it's longevity. They will let you run the cell down below 3v (IIRC, most protection circuits kick in at 2.7 or 2.8, no?), which I consider somewhat insane and they cut off at 4.2-4.22 V, which is pretty freaking close to as full as full can be, as I understand it. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on that. I haven't specifically tested other phones since I don't have the problem on mine and God knows I'd never use as Samsung Android phone myself. ;) (My SO has no choice, as she has to choose from a very limited list of employer approved devices, but it's been that way on four she's had so far) Laptops, on the other hand, I have seen with much more conservative implementations, at least at the bottom of the discharge curve. Regardless, I can't think of any good reason to discharge one's lithium cell to even a software reported zero rather than topping it off as convenient since they don't have memory issues. posted by wierdo at 10:54 PM on September 8, 2016 [2 favorites] DoctorFedora:Well, here's one to start, and another, if you're interested in the non-story that was Bendghazi, or if you're more of an Antennagate sort, there's always this collection of excerpts from other smartphones' manuals suggesting that a diminished signal caused by covering the antenna with your hand might be something caused by the science of radio transmissions, You posted one review from a business magazine (surely no conflicts of interest with investment darling Apple) that cites Samsung as a comparison point. I wouldn't necessarily use it to defend my case though since the last Samsung I owned was a Galaxy S2 and I haven't owned another since, because they use WAY too much plastic in their phones. I don't appreciate phones that don't feel solid. Your next citation is from Consumer Reports, who is fairly reputable, and their test was better. But it failed to address videos from users shown bending their phones by hand, so I guess the assumption is what? They all lied or used video trickery? So we are into conspiracy territory here? RE the antenna issue, your link failed to show any serious scientific investigation of the issue. Your link simply pointed out that some phone makers recommend not blocking the antenna. What isn't addressed at all was the effective change to the antenna's electrical properties by bridging two antenna sections using a conductive material (such as a sweaty hand). Not a single phone I've owned since the days of the black and white Blackberry has had this issue. Yet there is demonstrable evidence (including Apples free case giveaway for iPhone 4 users) that this was a unique problem. Your effort to defend Apple comes across as a little desperate. You don't see Samsung or LG zealots running around throwing up links from random websites about how this or that issue about their preferred phone isn't really all that big of a deal. Why is that? Is it that nobody cares about those brands the way some people almost religiously follow and care about Apple? Is it that those brands have fewer problems? Or is it your sub-textual assertion that people just hate on poor, oppressed Apple SO MUCH that they just make up mean things to say about them for....what reason exactly?

While not terribly technically demanding, it required installing and learning to use Aegisub, a video converter or two, and an online translation memory platform. About a third of the people I employed did their work on Apple machines. I kept logs, and they required the vast majority of the tech support, and turned in most of the work I needed to send back for redos. We're talking fundamental grammar issues. Sixth-grade reading level stuff. Not using spellcheck, then complaining because I didn't make it clear that...spelling...was a job requirement. The Windows and [Other] people were, by comparison, pretty much issue-free. I used to be live-and-let-live about Apple. Now? I'm so happy to hear they're taking away the headphone jack. Serves their customers right. You wanted it to "just work", didn't you? You were sick of taming your tech, weren't you? You thought it would be all magic and ponies and brushed aluminum, right? THIS IS WHAT YOU GET. ...No, I don't really mean that, but I'm in the middle of mopping up one of the messes an Apple person made. I guess what i'm saying is that if you're used to having to bend computers and smartphones to your will anyway, you're more likely to have the skillset to handle other kinds of problems too, and probably more likely to look askance at claims of "it just works", and probably the type of person who appreciates the real "it just works" of a headphone jack.

Commodity hardware with some interesting bits attached. And every year, the week they do it is like World Cup or Super Bowl fever...what will they change this time!?! And every year, it's a phone. Nothing life changing or earth shattering. Meanwhile, they'll charge a price premium for this phone, and everyone who buys one (a HUGE share of phone users) will happily pay this price premium for this magical phone that is 5% more magical than every other phone. And when they lock people into weird accessory upgrades, everyone praises Apple for how wise they are to anticipate that the users NEED this change, and Apple is amazing for figuring this out so far ahead of everyone else. And at the end of the day, the user has a phone. Pretty similar to the other phones, even the good ones. Sure, they might be out $100-300 more for the phone, accessories, etc. But man, what a phone. The selfies are 10% sharper! But at the end of the day, it's still just a phone. But when you stop to think about all the good that might have been done in the world with that extra $100-300 besides lining Apple's shareholders' pockets, what a thing that would be. If everyone took that money that goes to ONE company, or them and a handful of partners, and instead used it for other things, given to other companies, or hell, even given it to someone needy, what a different world we would live in.

Apple had a pretty good idea to get the antenna in a better position for reception but fucked it up a bit by making it easy for users to bridge the antenna with other metal parts of the phone, making it not so great of an antenna while that was happening. Other manufacturers (andd apple previously) have generally used fully internal antennas that could be blocked by the bag of water that is the human body. That also has an effect on reception, but to a much lesser degree, and is a literally unavoidable side effect of not having an external antenna like phones had in the olden days. So yeah, they fucked up, but it was one damn model out of how many? It's sort of ridiculous to still be talking about it in any context other than the few people who tried to say it literally wasn't a problem at the time. In the pre-smartphone era Samsung and LG couldn't make an antenna that got decent reception to save their life on literally any of their flip phones, but nobody was denying that Nokia and Motorola did a better job in that respect and nobody is talking about it today. Thankfully, there is a lot less of that blind adulation these days, so get the fuck over it, maybe? It was what, 4 or 5 years ago now? Unless you're using it as evidence that Gruber may as well be Mr. Magoo when it comes to Apple, there seems to be little point any more.

I think the word they're looking for is hubris, or perhaps chutzpah. That sums up Apple's behavior from the get-go, really. They get away with it because their products are generally pretty solid, and reality-distortion field salesmanship. You can make a good product and still sell it in a disingenuous way. Steve Jobs was a master of that kind of huckstering, and Tim Cook and Jonathon Ive et al are just carrying on that tradition, albeit with lesser skill, and none of Jobs's charisma. Apple has always made a point of suggesting that, if you buy their products, you are just plain better than other people who don't. It's a common selling point marketers use, but boy, have they made it work for them. I will never, ever forget something Tim Cook said in an interview, in response to why Apple doesn't make items that those with more modest means could afford. He said there are 'customers that Apple chooses not to serve', which has always struck me as corporate newspeak for 'fuck poor people and their pathetic little money'. I appreciated that honesty, however veiled it was. It's always good to know where you stand with someone. posted by KHAAAN! at 7:30 AM on September 9, 2016 [1 favorite] gizzmo, you have very strong feelings about what phones people buy.

There's nothing to stop manufactures from implement DRM in the DAC if they so choose. I don't think you understand what the analog loophole means. It goes like this: DRM is removed -> digital signal is converted to an analog one -> analog signal is recorded and digitized without DRM The fact that the DRM is removed at the DAC rather than earlier in the process has no effect on the loophole. Once the signal is analog, the game is over. Even if the DRM removal were pushed all the way to the speakers, in theory one could use high quality speakers and microphones in a good acoustic environment to recapture the audio without DRM. posted by jedicus at 11:58 AM on September 9, 2016 At some point, for audio anyways, you have to send a wave to a electromagnetic driver. Regardless of how one locks down the chain with DRM I can unsolder the driver and install a transformer feeding an audio in. posted by Mitheral at 12:13 PM on September 9, 2016 [1 favorite] Mossberg: Apple, the king of tech taste and daring, takes a breather I think this is it.

What are you looking for? It's a hunk of glass and metal that runs software. The exterior is largely irrelevant. No one cares that the current Porsche 911 looks like the one from 50 years ago. Or, actually, that's part of the appeal — each is instantly recognizable as a 911. The improvements have largely been under the hood. And I'm sure they don't feel the same to use despite having the "same design." If you have a distinctive external design that works well, there's no reason to change it for the sake of change. I'd be happy if Apple hadn't changed the "design" since the iPhone 4, if they had made the same improvements inside (screen enlargements aside). posted by stopgap at 4:46 PM on September 9, 2016 [1 favorite] > I'd be happy if Apple hadn't changed the "design" since the iPhone 4, if they had made the same improvements inside (screen enlargements aside) Change 4 to 5, and I'm with you on this.

They are limited by physics - and the stupid quest to make the phone ever thinner - but what they are packing into the camera unit (hardware + software) is really something. I bet the dual lens setup with optical image stabilization and multi-plane focus shows up on every flagship smartphone in a couple of years.

I understand. I was responding to gizzmo's assertion that removing the headphone jack removes the analog loophole. I'm saying that music being in digital form gives the manufactures the ability to arbitrarily block the conversion to analog output, via the DAC, before it reaches the headphone jack, if they so wanted. So the headphone jack is only a tool in analog loophole if the phone and/or DAC manufacturer lets it be one. posted by LoveHam at 5:56 PM on September 9, 2016 Hey remember when iOS 6 on the iPhone 5 was fast? Not even the newest iPhones are as fast as that.

($50/month legit unlimited. Grandfathered in forever!) It. Was. So. Fast. It's like suddenly discovering you could fly. The first Nexus, a Samsung Galaxy Nexus, replaced my old school Motorola Droid, that I am sure I could fire up right now, put Cyanogen on it, and keep on trucking. The Galaxy Nexus died after a year and a half. The Nexus 4 with the glass front and back lasted about as long. We're coming up on two and more than a half years. The 6 Plus is still that fast... but my work-related iPhone SE is faster. I really like a lot of features Android phones have, I like jailbreaking and side-loading, and their usability is keen.

You can't actually push a button that depresses, just a spot on the phone that feels like a button depressing. Next iteration will show a virtual button on a bezeless, edge-to-edge screen when it senses your fingertip is near, and will use the haptics to mimic your finger finding a button for no-look operation. Pretty spiffy. posted by Slap*Happy at 9:18 AM on September 13, 2016 Daring Fireball posted his review (spoiler: he likes it!). There's a really nice section on the new Home button technology, the one thing he doesn't quite like The home button on both iPhones 7 no longer physically clicks. Instead, it’s a force touch sensor, and it uses the improved Taptic Engine to provide simulated click feedback.While I'm here, Gruber goes on to a condescending thing about how Asian folks have a "superstition" about not using the home button, because it might wear out. But as he explains himself that concern is well founded: home buttons regularly wear out. I had to replace an iPad myself because the stupid button broke. Supposedly Apple has fixed this in more recent designs. posted by Nelson at 9:22 AM on September 13, 2016 i have owned the iPhone 3G, the iPhone 4, the iPhone 5, and now the iPhone 6 and I have literally never had a problem with my home button. posted by entropicamericana at 9:31 AM on September 13, 2016 [1 favorite] I've had home buttons go a little soft after two years or so, and a screen replacement (by a third party) on my 5something completely killed the fingerprint sensor. posted by Etrigan at 9:35 AM on September 13, 2016 From Ars Technica's review of the 7 and 7+: Wired headphones are there for people who want a low-cost option or for people concerned about audio fidelity, but Apple’s intent is clearly to push more people toward wireless headphones. Another important piece of that puzzle is the W1 chip, an Apple-developed piece of hardware that will show up first in Apple’s AirPods and in a few pairs of Beats headphones. To clarify, the W1 is not intended as a competitor or a replacement for Bluetooth—according to Apple, it is in fact a Bluetooth controller chip with some other Apple-developed proprietary additions. It’s designed to speed up and simplify pairing (it does) and stabilize Bluetooth’s sometimes inconsistent and shaky audio streams (it does). But it’s not meant to replace standard Bluetooth, and AirPods and any other W1 headphones will work just fine with anything that supports Bluetooth, including Android phones. [...] As much as I like the W1, it’s still not a slam-dunk wireless replacement for the 3.5mm jack. Apple has total control over the chip, and unlike Lightning, Apple tells us that it will not be licensing the chip out to third-party headphone makers. That could always change, of course, but for the foreseeable future it means that getting the best possible wireless audio experience on iOS means buying headphones from Apple. It puts Apple in exclusive control of the kinds of headphones you can buy and how much those headphones cost to buy, and so far they cost a lot more than most normal people are going to want to pay for headphones. Anyone who wants something different has plenty of Bluetooth options to choose from, but you also have to put up with the same old Bluetooth pairing wonkiness and audio skipping issues. Likewise, you’ll have those problems if you pair AirPods with any non-Apple Bluetooth device. So yeah, looks like an Apple play to make you buy more of their expensive accessories. posted by indubitable at 11:14 AM on September 13, 2016 [2 favorites] "So yeah, looks like an Apple play to make you buy more of their expensive accessories." I hate the loss of the jack, but I think that's an oversimplification. They ditched the jack for ivory-tower design reasons, and with little regard to folks who need it. In a completely separate decision tree, they created this W1 thing that they are now declining to license for reasons that I can understand. But as long as regular Bluetooth works with the iPhone, then there's no lock-in here. They're offering to sell you fancier headphones with proprietary extensions to Bluetooth, but that sounds like a bog standard "make it better" competitive innovation situation, not a play for lockin per se. posted by uberchet at 11:31 AM on September 13, 2016 [1 favorite] And should the rest of the industry see fit to make their own equipment work as slick as the new W1 enabled cans, Apple will rush to adopt it alongside their own. In Japan, these small-market oddballs are known as "Galapagos tech" - tech that, isolated from the rest of the field, evolves in its own weird and cool way. Apple does Galapagos tech, it can chose to adopt, adapt or reject prevailing tech in common use, industry consensus be damned. It's always driven a certain segment of the tech-buying public right up a wall, but it's a prime selling point for me. posted by Slap*Happy at 11:54 AM on September 13, 2016 "Apple does Galapagos tech, it can chose to adopt, adapt or reject prevailing tech in common use, industry consensus be damned." I don't think that's true, either. I mean, people SAY Apple is super hostile to standards and prevailing norms, but what they really mean is that they chose a proprietary connector for the iPod and initial iPhone, and then replaced that proprietary connector with a newer, better proprietary connector instead of just using mini- or micro-USB. Nothing else about the Apple ecosystem that *could* be broadly compatible isn't, but obviously both OSX and iOS are replete with features and functions that may not work with, or be available in, other operating environments. That's not "Galapagos tech." That's "building features." posted by uberchet at 12:40 PM on September 13, 2016 So yeah, looks like an Apple play to make you buy more of their expensive accessories. This is sarcasm, right? posted by entropicamericana at 12:49 PM on September 13, 2016 I mean, I only ask because the text you yourself pasted pointed out that 1) wired headphones come with the phone, 2) any old Bluetooth headphones will work with the iPhone (the only caveat being that they are just as wonky as they would be on any other non-Apple phone). posted by entropicamericana at 12:51 PM on September 13, 2016 [1 favorite] No, I'm serious. Here were the options on the 6S: You could plug into the 3.5mm port directly with any standard set of headphones or other audio sink (such as a car stereo) without having to get Apple's permission; you could use Lightning headphones but why bother when you have a 3.5mm port; you could use a Bluetooth sink that may work well or totally suck independent of whether it sounds good when the connection's working. So in terms of good experience, I would rank that: 3.5mm/BT/specialized Lightning peripheral, maybe giving BT a little more weight if you really don't like wires. Here are the options on the 7: You could use your 3.5mm gear, but now you have to carry an extra piece of equipment around (dongle) to make it work; you could do away with the dongle but pay the Apple tax to get headphones that plug directly into the Lightning port; you could use general BT gear that sucks as much as it always has; you could upgrade your Bluetooth but pay the Apple tax to get Apple's special headphones. I would rank experience as: Apple BT/BT/Lightning/3.5mm+dongle (ignoring the obnoxious issue of having to keep your headphones charged). So to me, it looks like Apple has reconfigured its design to ensure that whether you prefer a wired or a wireless solution, you need to pay them more to get the best implementation available. They did this on the Bluetooth end by inventing better but proprietary extensions (not hard to do when Bluetooth is a messy, complex standard that was designed by committee); they did this on the wired end by kneecapping support for the open standard. posted by indubitable at 1:43 PM on September 13, 2016 [2 favorites] "it looks like Apple has reconfigured its design to ensure that whether you prefer a wired or a wireless solution, you need to pay them more to get the best implementation available." That's still not clear. By all means, you can keep plugging your Grados in via the adapter. That's gonna sound better, I'll wager, than any Lightning headphone, because the set of companies that make truly great headphones is probably not going to overlap much with the set of companies that are willing to make headphones that work natively with the newest version of a minority player in the portable audio market. Bluetooth is trouble, for sure, but there are genuinely decent BT 'phones out there, and they'll still work just fine. Apple finding a proprietary way to make Bluetooth work better isn't lock-in behavior. It's just innovation. You'll still get better sound with real headphones and a 3.5mm adapter. posted by uberchet at 1:59 PM on September 13, 2016 So to me, it looks like Apple has reconfigured its design to ensure that whether you prefer a wired or a wireless solution, you need to pay them more to get the best implementation available.

This whole situation is being re-visited now with stricter EU rules coming in 2017, but it may be Apple can work around it all by including an adapter in the box. I had a frustrating experience with Apple's insistence on their own weirdo technology while trying to watch the most recent infomercial live. Their stream did not work on Chrome, because Apple has its own streaming video protocol that's not widely supported. I love the passive-aggressive phrasing "Your browser doesn't support live streaming of the event". It's Apple's servers that don't support the standards or the most common browser in usage. Happily my browser supports live streaming of pretty much every other video service on the Internet. posted by Nelson at 7:16 AM on September 14, 2016 Your own link to the Wikipedia article about HLS shows that it's pretty widely supported; it's just that Chrome itself -- Google's browser -- doesn't fully support it.

Among the big desktop browsers, HLS only works in Safari and Microsoft Edge. It does not work in Chrome or Firefox. A big problem here is the lack of a proper standards doc. I haven't followed this process, but Wikipedia says Apple has only submitted a draft and isn't doing the work to make it a proper IETF standard. Video streams over plain HTTP work everywhere and are standard. DASH is a standard that solves the same transport problem that HLS does and works in every desktop browser. (It helps that you can shim it in with just some Javascript.) DASH doesn't work in iOS though; why this might be is left as an exercise to the reader. posted by Nelson at 9:00 AM on September 14, 2016 This whole situation is being re-visited now with stricter EU rules coming in 2017, but it may be Apple can work around it all by including an adapter in the box.

I guess the iPhone still depends too on iTunes tethers for some high security upgrades and recovery, so there's at least one additional reason a cord is still necessary.

JK Scheinberg, who spent 21 years working for the tech giants, applied to work in an Apple store after he retired but was rejected. chris murphy 1 JK Scheiberg was turned down for a job at the Apple store despite working for the company for 21 years The 54-year-old was the famous engineer who persuaded Steve Jobs to move the Mac from PowerPC to Intel in 2005. But when he got restless after retiring, he decided to work for an Apple store on their Genius bar despite being twice as old as anyone else at the group interview. The interviewing panel apparently never got back to Schienberg and now there are suggestions it was because of his age. Wonder if Apple will finally give me callback on that genius bar interview https://t.co/9fXt5fBFTU #ageism — JK Scheinberg (@tiltdad) September 5, 2016 Apple Stores are notorious for recruiting young staff to their front-of-house roles. The New York Times has now used the incident as an example of age discrimination in the workplace. Ashton Applewhite wrote: “I’m lucky enough to get my tech support from JK Scheinberg, the engineer at Apple who led the effort that moved the Mac to Intel processors. “A little restless after retiring in 2008, at 54, he figured he’d be a great fit for a position at an Apple store Genius Bar, despite being twice as old as anyone else at the group interview.” related stories YOU WON'T BELIEVE YOUR EARS Apple iPhone 7 'airpods' to replace traditional headphones, rumours suggest RIPE FOR THE PICKING Legendary Apple guru 'Ming the Merciless' reveals EVERYTHING about the iPhone 7 BRUSSELS MAKING A STAND After Apple slapped with £11bn tax bill EU is probing six more American companies SEVENTH HEAVEN Here's a MAJOR clue about what Apple's iPhone 7 is going to look like when it launches next week APPLE COR! These nine iPhone tricks will change the way you use your Apple smartphone Schienberg told him: “On the way out, all three of the interviewers singled me out and said: ‘We’ll be in touch.’ “I never heard back.” After the piece was published, the software engineer tweeted: “Wonder if Apple will finally give me callback on that genius bar interview.” Business Inside has suggested it is pretty unlikely anyone is more qualified to work at Apple than Scheinberg, who invented an Intel version of Mac OSX that ran on PCs.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Retired Apple Engineer Apparently Considered Too Old For Genius Bar Job By Adnan Farooqui on 09/05/2016 13:12 PST A story about a retired Apple engineer who was not considered for a Genius Bar job is gaining traction today. This ex-Apple engineer was involved in the migration of OS X to Intel but never got a call back after a retail Genius interview. An op-ed in the NYT has raised the issue of age discrimination in Silicon Valley as it’s believed that the engineer was not hired because of his age. In an op-ed about workplace biases the author sheds light on age discrimination by giving the example of former Apple engineer J.K. Scheinberg who tried getting a customer support representative Genius Bar job at an Apple retail store. Scheinberg was at Apple proper for a considerably long period of time – from 1997 until his retirement in 2008 – and was directly involved with the first builds of OS X for Intel processors. He said that three interviewers told him that they will be in touch about the Genius Bar job but he never heard back from them. This isn’t the first time that Apple has been accused of preferring to hire younger people. 60 year old Michael Katz sued Apple back in 2010 after less senior employees at an Apple Store in Orlando were promoted above him. He held that they were less qualified individuals for the post and that he was only passed over for promotion multiple times on account of his age. Apple has not yet commented on this op-ed.

The writer shares his experience handling Apple’s iPhone 7 (not the Plus model) and most of what he says mirrors previous reports. Apply some skepticism here though: there are no photos for evidence. There are few new alleged tidbits amongst the usual discussion of an iPhone 6s-esque design. One standout claim is that the iPhone 7 can record 4K video at 60 frames per second. This is up from 4k @ 30 fps on the current iPhone 6s and is a significant upgrade as no phone on the market today can do this … This report is regarding the 4.7 inch iPhone 7 so it’s not even a case of the 60 FPS 4K feature being part of the dual camera system. It will apparently be available to all iPhone 7 owners and may explain why Apple decided to double the storage to 128 GB and 256 GB on the higher-capacity iPhone 7 models. 4K video on the iPhone uses a lot of space already and 60 FPS doubles the number of frames the system needs to save, ballooning file sizes even more. The report ‘confirms’ the existence of a new dark iPhone color: the matte replacement for Space Grey. The writer says the Apple logo on the back of the phone is also matte for this finish, but the Silver iPhone 7 will still have a shiny logo. The site also says the volume buttons have changed design and are no longer contained in a concave inset, they are just placed on the outer body directly. For waterproofness, the tipster says the machine features a SIM tray with a new rubber seal. The obvious answer to the inclusion of this element is to attain the waterproofing standard: we have previously heard that the iPhone 7 will be rated IPX7 — the same as the Apple Watch. Note we have seen supposed iPhone 7 SIM trays before (pictured above) which was the first source to cite two new case colours in the wings. They also claim to have hands-on time with the new touch-sensitive Home Button, claiming that  although it is capacitive the force required to activate the button is still substantial. Rather than how Android phones respond to light presses on their software keys, Apple is using Force Touch technology to force users to press firmly in order to activate the new Home Button. Just like other Force Touch devices Apple ships, there are no moving parts. There is slight haptic feedback to give the illusion that the user is actually touching a physical thing, just like the Force Touch trackpad. Due to the lack of images, it’s hard to say whether to trust this source but most of the piece does corroborate what we’ve been hearing elsewhere. The new tidbits are very specific and detailed too, which it gives it some believability. There isn’t much incentive for a site to randomly make up the existence of a rubber seal on the Home Button for instance. Still, treat it with some skepticism ahead of Apple’s official unveiling of the new iPhone 7 on Wednesday.

But when a company decides to develop a laptop that runs OS X without first getting Apple’s approval, which we all know they’d never give… well, don’t expect that company to be around for very long. The creators of the HacBook Elite must know what’s going to happen, but they either know something we don’t or they simply don’t care. Whatever the case, you can now pre-order a HacBook Elite, which promises to run OS X out the box, and for as little as $329. That’s $570 cheaper than a MacBook Air, and nearly a $1,000 cheaper than the entry level MacBook or MacBook Pro. Each HacBook Elite is actually a like-new refurbished HP EliteBook that is guaranteed to run any Mac program. The people behind it have been building custom Hacintoshes (PCs that run OS X) for years and have decided to take their business commercial. In so doing, they’ll receive Apple’s full attention and likely face legal action before this week is over. Inside the HacBook you’ll find an Intel Sandy Bridge Core i5 processor, up to 8GB of RAM, up to 1TB of storage either in HDD or SSD form, and 802.11a/b/g/n wireless. The display is 14-inches with a resolution of 1600 x 900. It’s perfect for a range of Mac-specific uses including being used as a development laptop for compiling and shipping iOS and OS X applications. There’s no detail on how much upgrading the HacBook Elite costs beyond the base $329 spec. All you can do right now is submit your email address on the HacBook website and ordering details will be sent to your immediately along with the options you have for upgrading. It seems likely Apple will halt orders as quickly as it can, but if you get in early you may be lucky enough to have one shipped.

Apple might be bringing it to the masses in 2016, but follow us as we walk you through smartphones dual lens camera systems of the past and present. LG Optimus 3D and HTC Evo 3D: Another dimension In 2011, 3D was a thing. The world's TV manufacturers were lining up 3D TV sets, there were 3D films being produced and we were being told that 3D was the next big thing, again. Pocket-lint For smartphones, it was the opportunity for innovation. The LG Optimus 3D was announced in February 2011 and the HTC Evo 3D launched on Sprint in March 2011.  Both these smartphones (and there were some others) used dual lenses to allow them to take 3D video and 3D photos. They use the same technique used by regular 3D cameras, using those dual lenses to create a sense of depth in images. This was boosted with a 3D display to view those images, without the glasses.  But 3D was just a passing phase, and although we could capture 3D, ultimately, that was only the start of the story for dual lens cameras. LG Optimus 3D vs HTC Evo 3D: Which has the better 3D camera? LG Optimus 3D review: Seeing double HTC Evo 3D review: Three's a crowd HTC One M8: Making sense It was the HTC One M8 that really introduced dual lens cameras to the world and saw HTC trying to do something different. The HTC One M8 was launched in April 2014. Pocket-lint With a 4-megapixel UltraPixel main image sensor and a secondary 2-megapixel sensor capturing extra data, the dual lens camera was used, like 3D, to create a sense of depth in photos. The idea was that the second lens could capture this depth information to create a depth map and feed it into the final image. That meant you could create bokeh/background blur effects, you could refocus the image with a tap and you could easily manipulate photos, keeping the subject sharp and changing the backgrounds. The One M8 was clever, but the camera wasn't that impressive. The effects were rather gimmicky and the benefits of having a dual camera didn't really make an impact - even if the full metal body did. HTC Duo Camera explained: What is it and what will it do? HTC One M8 review: Full metal masterclass LG G5: Going wide Suddenly we arrive in 2016 and LG announces the LG G5 in February. There are two things that are interesting about it. Firstly, it attempts to integrate modular accessories. Secondly, LG has equipped it with dual cameras. Pocket-lint In the case of this LG smartphone, there's a main 16-megapixel sensor and a second 8-megapixel sensor.  Rather than combining information to create effects, LG's dual camera approach is straight shooting. The 16-megapixel camera offers regular photos, but the second lens is wide-angle.  With 135-degree lens on the rear for that 8MP camera, the LG G5 can shoot wide-angle photos to great effect. You simply switch from one camera to the other by tapping the button in the app and you can get more in. Perfect for tight spots or landscapes, with that slight fish-eye effect that's on trend. It's a lovely addition that actually adds something to the feature set. While panorama is common, there's no shortage of after-market wide-angle lenses you can clip on, but the G5's pairing is more useful as it's so simple to use. LG G5 review: Modular misfire? Huawei P9: Leica's monochrome mark With LG making its mark, Huawei launched the P9, in partnership with Leica, in April 2016. With two cameras sitting on the back, Huawei's big selling point wasn't about depth sensing or wide-angle, it was about monochrome. Pocket-lint Leveraging Leica's classic monochrome cameras, the Huawei P9 presented two cameras on the rear, claiming one lens captured RGB colour and the second lens captured monochrome detail. Both cameras are 12-megapixels.  This results in some great black and white photos, but working together, the P9 attempts to combine information from both sensors to make all your photos better. The results are very good, it's a very capable partnership.  There's also a P9 Plus with the same offering, but slightly larger. Huawei P9 Leica camera explored: Double the camera, double the fun? Huawei P9 review: The flagship and the folly Honor 8: Slightly less Leica, but very much the same With the Huawei P9 launched, it was only a matter of time before sub-brand Honor produced an equivalent model. Called the Honor 8, again, there was a dual camera on the back.  Pocket-lint With the Leica tie-in being for the Huawei phone, the Honor 8 doesn't make much of the monochrome side of things, but again offers twin 12-megapixel cameras, one with an RGB sensor, the other with a monochrome sensor.  The message is the same: data is combined to result in sharper images, with better grip on colour and monochrome detail. Again, the result is a camera that's very capable, especially on a phone that's purportedly mid-range. Honor 8 review: A different take on the premium mid-range market Apple iPhone 7 Plus: A play to zoom, with bokeh to come The Apple iPhone 7 Plus features two cameras on the rear. Both are 12-megapixels, both offer optical image stabilisation, but they offer a different focal length. The first camera offers 23mm zoom, which is sort of wide - not super wide like LG, but wider than the old iPhone camera. Pocket-lint The second camera is zoomed at 56mm. This means that everything appears closer through this lens. It's like LG's pairing, but reversed. The idea, according to Apple, is to let you zoom without losing so much quality. To get closer to the subject you can switch to the 56mm camera and any digital zooming you then do is starting from a closer position, so the loss in quality will be slightly lessened compared to a regular smartphone camera. Apple is also looking to play HTC's game by offering a portrait bokeh effect. This will aim to get you that blurred background effect that is created by shallow depth of field on DLSR cameras. Using information from both sensors it will create a depth map, keeping the subject sharp and blurring the background. This latter feature will arrive as a software update later in 2016.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Samsung embarrassingly admits to dropping their Affiliate SDI Battery Component for the Note 7 | Main | Apple Wins Patent for a Mobile Phone encased in a Glass Embodiment » September 05, 2016 Apple Patent Reveals Noise Cancellation System for Headphones & Possibly AirPods   In late 2012 Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Invents New Headset with Unique Wireless Option." Apple's patent figure from that invention noted above clearly indicates that the "wireless" was only optional and temporary in nature – as in using the wireless EarPods option while working out at the gym for a set time. Of course consumers want wireless EarPods or AirPods that will last all day. According to rumor last week, AirPods landed in Russia, as noted in official certificate documentation. On September 1, an Apple patent application came to light covering new "in-ear speakers" that could be wired or wireless, according to their filing. Apple's patent focuses on a new balanced armature based valve that could provide "noise cancellation" quality. In a couple of days we'll be able to see if this invention was used in part or in whole should Apple's AirPods materialize.   According to Apple's patent filing, some users of in-ear speakers, such as the in-ear speaker shown in #106 below in FIG.1, may find the amplified or echo-like sounds created by the occlusion effect #100 to be annoying and distracting when they are listening to sound delivered by such in-ear speakers. Apple's invention provides several ways to mitigate or eliminate the occurrence of an occlusion effect. One way to reduce or eliminate the occurrence of the occlusion effect includes combining the in-ear speaker #106 in FIGS. 1A-1B below with an active noise control or Acoustic Noise Cancellation ("ANC") processor and its associated, error microphone, both of which are not shown in FIGS. 1A-1B.   The error microphone can pick up the unwanted, amplified sounds #110 created by the occlusion effect, which are then converted to digital audio signals and processed by the ANC processor to create an anti-phase estimate of the unwanted, amplified sounds; the anti-phase estimate is then converted into a sound field by an acoustic driver of the in-ear speaker, in hopes of destructively interfering with and therefore reducing the unwanted sounds created by the occlusion effect.   Apple notes that "An in-ear speaker may be wired or wireless (for purposes of receiving a user content audio signal from an external device). In-ear speakers include, but are not limited to, earphones, earbuds, hearing aids, hearing instruments, in-ear headphones, in-ear monitors, canalphones, personal sound amplifiers (PSAPs), and headsets."   Apple's patent FIG. 5A presented below is a cross-sectional side view illustration of one embodiment of a Balanced Armature (BA) based valve #500.   Apple further notes that "an in-ear speaker that includes the BA based valve #500 can enable manipulation of a listener's perceived audio transparency based on the opening or closing of the valve flap #508. When the valve flap is in the open position #508A, a listener can be made aware of auditory stimuli in his surroundings because sound waves from the ambient environment can travel through the housing #502 generally along a sound transmission path #520 that connects the two spouts 504A-B.   For this embodiment, the listener is still receiving ambient sounds, and as a result, his perception of audio transparency is enhanced. For one embodiment of an in-ear speaker that includes the BA based valve, when the valve flap is in the closed position 508B, the BA based valve acts as an ambient noise blocker, for a listener that does not want to perceive auditory stimuli from his surroundings.   For this embodiment, the listener will receive only the sounds that are being actively generated or produced by an acoustic driver of the in-ear speaker, which can be beneficial in certain situations. In this way, the BA based valve can enable a listener to reduce an occlusion effect when desired, become aware of sounds in the ambient environment when desired, or prevent sounds from the ambient environment from reaching the listener's ear canal when desired.   In another example, the listener is listening to audio from the external electronic device (e.g., a smartphone, a computer, a wearable computer system, etc.) using an acoustic driver that is in the in-ear speaker. When the sound sensor detects the listener's voice for a threshold amount of time, the logic determines that the listener (with the in-ear speaker in his/her ear) may be engaged in a phone/video call or a conversation with another human.   In this example, the logic provides the one or more control signals that cause the valve flap 508 to be opened, in response to the determination that the listener is on a phone/video call or in a conversation with another human. In this way, the sound sensor, the logic, and the BA based valve 500 assist with a reduction of an occlusion effect that can occur when the listener (with the in-ear speaker in his/her ear) is engaged in a phone/video call or a conversation with another physical human.   As shown at the bottom of patent FIG. 17 above, the pathway #1701 can be the pathway used by the active vent system #1700. For one embodiment, the geometry of the pathway #1701 determines an overall effectiveness of the ability of the system to assist with reduction or elimination of amplified or echo-like sounds created by an occlusion effect, as well as, manipulation of perceived audio transparency.   For example, the pathway #1701 can have a predetermined geometry that assists with reducing an occlusion effect and also with reducing any unwanted energy that builds up in the ear canal due to activity (e.g. running, footfalls, chewing, etc.) Each volume can be designed with a constant cross section and can resemble a structure of various cross section shapes (#1703, 1705 and 1707).   Apple's patent application 20160255433 is richly detailed. To review it in its entirety, check it out here. Apple's acoustic design engineer Scott Grinker is noted as the sole inventor. Considering this is a patent application, it's unknown at this time when this invention will come to market.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

First, unbelievable anticipation. Then, great surprise. At the end, immense satisfaction. When the latest iPhone is unveiled here on Wednesday in a 7,000-seat auditorium, it probably will instead be more like Christmas for a sneaky 10-year-old who long ago peeked at his present. Thanks.

It has more than 100 million subscribers with 30 million of them paying for its premium service. Apple Music seeks to replace Spotify and take its position. One of the ways it can do that is by offering the service to users at a lower rate and that’s preciously what Apple is now doing, however, there is a caveat. Apple has started selling 12-month Apple Music gift cards in the United States which cost $99. Those who are willing to pay $99 upfront can get a year’s worth of Apple Music for this price. That’s the only caveat here. Divide this amount by 12 and you get $8.25 as the effective per month subscription rate. Spotify currently charges $9.99 and so does Apple Music for its monthly subscription. You need to buy the $99 gift card if you want the lower rate. The new Apple Music gift card is now available for purchase from the company’s retail stores across the country as well as through retailers including Walmart, Best Buy, and PayPal’s eBay store. The company isn’t selling the 12 month subscription online, through iTunes, iOS or the web. Spotify does sell gift cards for a 12 month subscription as well but they are priced at $120, the same amount you would pay if you subscribed to the service on the monthly $9.99 plan. Filed in Apple.

Chris Griffith The Australian 12:00AM September 6, 2016 Save Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on email Share more... Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Whatsapp Print this articleX Chris Griffith Technology reporter Sydney https://plus.google.com/116849779175391500455 @chris_griffith There’s an ingredient at this week’s iPhone launch I’m particularly looking for. It’s inspiration. Apple, I want you to inspire me with iPhone 7. Because if the Cupertino company doesn’t inspire the public with new must-have features, they won’t be countering the increasing allure of the sophisticated competition. Everything is a rumour ahead of an iPhone 7, even the phone’s name and the number of models. Most say two versions, some say three with a dual camera an optional extra. We can again expect models with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch display and some change to the overall design. Hit the road jack The most talked about rumour is that Apple will dump the 3.5mm headphone jack. That leaves at least three alternatives. You use a Bluetooth earbuds (aka AirPod), new lightning port connected earbuds (aka lightning earbuds), or an adaptor for 3.5mm headphones. Appe might bundle one of these options. It will certainly be out to popularise using a Bluetooth headset with your phone and watch. Expect third party vendors to bring adaptors to market so you can use your existing headsets. And expect manufacturers to come out with Bluetooth and lightning connected models. It’s sounds a cash bonanza for the headset industry. For those that use a phone case, “techno-rexia”, the culture of technology thinness and space saving at all costs, is getting out of hand especially where it means sacrificing functionality or convenience. But it’s likely that iPhone 7 will be even thinner than its predecessors. Presumably the internal changes will leave room for some other component. The lead rumour is a second speaker for stereo sound. There’s a rumour about a force touch home button with taptic feedback. And that Apple might address the protruding camera lens on the back. The issue is the phone can wobble when you poke the screen near the top when it’s lying flat on a table. Features that matter Sadly none of this really excites me, but there are some rumoured features that might. One is that Apple will offer phones with 256GB of storage. That will match Android support for 256GB microSD card storage. It’s important given you can’t augment Apple storage. We could also see the end of 16GB models. There’s money on a dual rear 12 megapixel camera for better low light photography. Improving the camera will be vital to Apple as the prime competition here, Samsung, has excellent smartphone cameras. Another rumour is more colour options with black as well as grey, silver, gold and rose gold. The most inspiring feature may be water-resistance. Samsung, Sony and Motorola have phones in the market that offer it; it’s not rocket science. But for the world’s iPhone users, less concern about taking your iPhone to the beach, dropping it into the bath or getting it wet in the rain will be welcomed. As for improved battery life, the rumour is marginal improvement. Then there’s brand loyalty. According to Australian technology research firm Telsyte, 84pc of those with iPhones intend to buy another. Apple Watch 2 The iPhone is not the only device facing an upgrade. We’re hoping to see Apple Watch mark 2. Watch may be market leader, but it has serious competition in terms of capabilities. Samsung last week announced a Gear S3 line-up that offers 4 days battery life, has in-built GPS, Wi-Fi and is waterproof. Can Apple Watch match these capabilities? The suggestion is that Watch will have a faster processor, in-built GPS, some water resistance and a barometer. What could sell watches for Apple is more independent operation away from a paired iPhone. Automatically unlocking other Apple devices with Watch is a selling point; that’s already coming to Mac. So is listening to music stored on the watch with a headset. Watch is not an easy sell. In the world of smartwatches, the market has been going backwards. In Q2 it dropped 32 per cent year-on-year, said analyst firm IDC. Apple in Q2 shipped 3.5 million watches compared to 5.1 million a year ago. While it still holds top spot, IDC said it was the only vendor among the top 5 to experience an annual decline in shipments. There are riders to this. First, sales can drop after the novelty of a brand new device in market wears off. Second, consumers could be holding out on buying Watch knowing an updated version is likely. There’s another factor. From day one, people have told me they’re holding out on buying Apple Watch until version 2 arrives, with “all the bugs ironed out”. I heard this line over and over again. Their time is coming now. MacBooks and more? We could see other upgrades, such as a refreshed line of MacBook Pros. They might adopt the USB Type-C port and Force Touch trackpad found on the 12-inch MacBook. What about a brand new never-seen-before shiny device? That seems unlikely. Apple has been slow in taking up new technologies being explored by its competitors. The much talked about TV set (not just Apple TV) that Steve Jobs wanted to work just before his death has never manifested. In the car space, the competition is already well down the road in implementing autonomous car solutions. They already have years of experience. Is Apple’s interest here too late? Apple however is finally getting into machine learning through its acquisition of Turi, a Seattle-based machine learning platform that it bought a month ago. It is hiring data scientists and turning Turi into a machine learning division, reports 9to5Mac. Turi’s YouTube account hosts some freaky futuristic discussions, such as machines simulating the functions of the brain with artificial neurons. In the hands of Apple, intelligent devices and services with machine learning capabilities could offer an exciting new direction. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on email Share more...

The actor got fans buzzing with a tweet Tuesday when he dropped a hint about the possible fate of his beloved character Luke Skywalker. Luke’s fate has been a source of concern for months, with many fans worrying that the Jedi Master could be the next iconic character to meet his tragic end. The actor himself has played into the rumors at times, but most recently, he offered hope for Luke’s survival. In his tweet Tuesday, he hinted that he’d still be around for Star Wars: Episode IX. Related: Take a peek at the Imperial droid joining the Star Wars universe in Rogue One Hamill shared a video of his beard being shaved, and as he bid the facial hair farewell, he dropped his big hint: “#ByeByeBeard (at least til #EpisodeIX),” he wrote. Hamill’s message does seem promising, but we wouldn’t take it as confirmation that Luke will appear in Episode IX. Earlier this summer, the actor had to clarify a comment he had made about being “out of work” after Episode VIII. Naturally, his remark had sparked cries that Luke was going to die. Whether or not Hamill makes it all the way to Episode IX as he seems to be saying he will (here’s hoping!), his role in Episode VIII should at least top the whopping one scene he had in Episode VII — The Force Awakens. Hamill (and his beard) only appeared at the end, disappointing many viewers. It would be great to see him take on a bigger role moving forward, but with so many conflicting rumors and reports, it is hard to say what the future holds for Luke. Episode VIII is slated to open on December 15, 2017. In the meantime, fans have Rogue One: A Star Wars Story to look forward to on December 16.   This article was originally posted on Digital Trends Content provided by INFORMATIONAL DISCLAIMER The information contained on or provided through this site is intended for general consumer understanding and education only and is not intended to be and is not a substitute for professional financial or accounting advice.

Leaked Specs Show iPhone 7 Outpacing Galaxy Note 7 Mobile 21 0 0 September 5, 2016 Apple’s Beastly iPhone 7 Benchmarked? Leaked Specs Show iPhone 7 Outpacing Galaxy Note 7 Kevin Bostic Apple loves to keep a tight lid on the specs, features, and secrets of its iPhones, iPads, and other devices, but even mighty Cupertino can’t keep everything under wraps. As the world preps for the presumed unveiling of the iPhone 7 this Wednesday, it looks like the House that Steve Jobs Built has sprung a leak or two, as supposed specs for the iPhone 7 appear to have hit the internet just days before Apple shows off the device. The good news for Apple: Those specs, if correct, mean that the iPhone 7 is going to leave all of the competition in its dust, even Samsung’s vaunted Galaxy Note 7. The newly leaked specs come courtesy of Redditor rev93, and they appear to show the performance of the iPhone 7 on the standard Geekbench single-core and multi-core benchmark tests. Apple’s forthcoming iPhone 7 appears to score 3379 on Geekbench’s single-core performance test, and 5495 on the Geekbench multi-core test. iPhone 7 could provide at least 33 percent faster CPU performance than iPhone 6s https://t.co/cufTXV0Uii pic.twitter.com/Ktf4wc1MZ8 — iDownloadBlog (@iDownloadBlog) September 5, 2016 How does the new iPhone 7 compare to devices from Apple’s biggest competitor, Samsung? This year’s Galaxy S7 edge, according to BGR, managed a score of 2141 on Geekbench’s single-core test and 5232 on the multi-core test. Geekbench had the Galaxy Note 7 Exynos version pulling respective scores of 2081 and 6500 on the same tests, while the Snapdragon 820 version of the Note 7 managed scores of 1900 and over 5500. To try to put that more in perspective, if these scores are accurate, it looks like Apple’s iPhone 7 will be able to outpace even the 12-inch iPad Pro, which Apple released last year. Once it’s released, the iPhone 7 will be the fastest mobile device Apple has on the market, except maybe for the iPhone 7 Plus. When it comes to the iPhone, iPhone Plus, and its iPads, Apple never really dwells too much on the sort of specs we see in this leaked Geekbench report. When the iPhone 7 is unveiled, Apple will probably simply say it is “[x-amount] faster than the iPhone 6s” and talk up how well it handles “console level” games or some such. Still, tech sites have been getting apparent glimpses into the internals of the iPhone 7, and those glimpses seem to back up the notion that these leaked iPhone benchmarks could be the real deal. Apple rumor site 9to5Mac reported last week on details from well-connected KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who said that the A10 processor in Apple’s iPhone 7 will be a major upgrade over the A9 processor Apple put in the iPhone 6s. Reportedly, Apple’s A10 processor will have a maximum clock speed of 2.4GHz, which is blazing fast. According to iDownloadBlog, those scores mean the iPhone 7 could be up to a third faster than the already blazing iPhone 6s. Apple’s iPhone from last year, if you’re wondering, can still hold its own against this year’s competition, and the iPhone 7 is set to blow the iPhone 6s away. The iPhone 7 Plus may wind up even faster than the iPhone 7, as it will have an extra 1GB of RAM in order to process what insiders are pretty sure will be a drastically upgraded camera setup. The iPhone 7 Plus’ dual cameras could work like this https://t.co/RS4BETbt7i pic.twitter.com/S73aPzvzE4 — Engadget (@engadget) September 4, 2016 Of course, the internals of a new iPhone from Apple are only part of the reason the hype kicks into overdrive around this time every year. The other part is the looks of the device. It looks like this year, Apple is sticking with only small updates to the external for the iPhone 7. The device will look a lot like the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s, but Apple will apparently move those unsightly antenna lines on the back of the device, making the rear of the iPhone 7 pretty clean looking by comparison. The other development in the iPhone looks department involves colors. As the Inquisitr previously noted, insiders expect that Apple will boost the number of colors available for the iPhone 7. Apple is expected to offer the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in silver, rose gold, gold, space grey, and glossy black. iPhone 7 to Include Five Colors, IPX7 Water Resistance, Dual 12MP Cameras on Plus Model https://t.co/7fDRQaAFNq by @eslivka — MacRumors.com (@MacRumors) September 3, 2016 So what do you think of the rumors surrounding Apple’s upcoming iPhone 7? Do you think the next iPhone is going to blow away Apple’s competition? Does Apple’s apparent speed advantage with the iPhone 7 over the Galaxy Note 7 make you more likely to tune in for Wednesday’s event when Apple unveils the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus?

Cougar Dates Online App Scores Top Ranking In iTunes For Five Countries 2016-09-05 Print Tweet   Leading cougar dating app inside Apple's App Store reveals formula for great success connecting with other countries. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE (Atlanta, Georgia) - Now with more than 2 million apps inside Apple's App Store the demand to rank on top charts is in dead heat competition. Cougar Dates Online App announced today that their app available in iTunes is now ranked in five countries on top charts. Uply Media, Inc is the publisher of Cougar Dates Online App which launched on January 9th, 2014 in the App Store. The purpose of the app is to connect individuals interested in relationships where older women date younger men. Often considered to be a cougar dating relationship or romance. According to Kyle Ransom, CEO of Uply Media, Inc users who download this particular app are more interested in developing a romantic lifestyle experience. Which he points out is much different than the niche dating hookup apps. Ransom relates that for Cougar Dates Online App it's more of a social network lifestyle environment where people are directly interested in dating and falling in love. A vast contrast to hookup experiences. He stresses that young guys who prefer to date older women on this app are looking for relationships and often even marriage. Cougar Dates Online App ranks in the top 150 on the charts in lifestyle category for iPhone "Top Free" in five countries: Barbados Ireland Jamaica Lebanon Zimbabwe On June 11th, 2014 was when Cougar Dates Online App was featured in Vietnam inside iTunes. Ransom says this was the game changer that put this app on the map for global recognition and dominance. What's changed with this app since launching is that the majority of app users are connecting from mobile devices and not tablets. Younger men between the ages of 18-24 and 25-34 now represent the majority of male users on the app. Cougar Dates Online App is now free to download available inside Apple's App Store on iTunes. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cougar-dates-online-app-1/id763894877?mt=8 To contact Uply Media, Inc please visit UplyMedia.com or call (404) 806-0548 for more information.   Contact Info Uply Media, Inc / Kyle Ransom 2472 Jett Ferry Rd.

Resend activation e-mail Infinite Loop / The Apple Ecosystem What to expect from Apple’s September 7th event Everything we know to expect, and a few things we know not to expect. by Andrew Cunningham - Sep 5, 2016 5:00 pm UTC Login to bookmark 115 The Apple logo onstage at WWDC 2016. Andrew Cunningham Apple’s big September product presentation is happening on Wednesday—WWDC in June is when we find out about software, but when it comes to the hardware that the company makes most of its money from, September is Apple’s biggest event of the year. Last year’s event was especially huge and wide-ranging. Apple launched its new tvOS platform, tweaked the hardware and software of the still-new Apple Watch, introduced the iPad Pro and the iPhone 6S series, and provided software updates for everything across all of its product lines. Wednesday will still be a busy day, but relatively speaking it ought to be quieter. The iPhone Enlarge / The new iPhones will reportedly look a lot like the current ones, but with less-obvious antenna lines. Andrew Cunningham Most rumors still call the next iPhone the “iPhone 7,” but unlike past years it doesn’t sound like the latest model will get a big external redesign. Expect this to look a lot like the current 6 and 6S design, but with tweaked or removed antenna cutouts to give the back of the phone a cleaner look. The new phone will still come in two sizes, one 4.7-inch version and one 5.5-inch version. Otherwise we can expect changes on par with what we usually see in “S” model, which usually means a newer, faster processor, a better camera, and a handful of other hardware-driven improvements. Reports from earlier this year also suggested that the 16GB base model could be going away, something we’ve been requesting for a while now. The camera could be particularly interesting. The larger of the two phones (let’s call it the “iPhone 7 Plus” for brevity’s sake) is said to include two rear camera lenses, which are said to be set to different focal lengths to simulate true optical zoom and are also said to boast improved low-light performance. The Plus phones have always had slightly better cameras than their smaller non-Plus counterparts, but previously the difference was just that the Pluses featured optical image stabilization (OIS) hardware. A second camera lens would be a more significant way to differentiate the two (and, possibly, to drive more sales of the more expensive Plus models). Also rumored is a new pressure-sensitive Home button, which like the Force Touch trackpads on newer MacBooks simulates clicks using vibrations instead of actually clicking. This could cut down on repairs since there would be fewer moving parts, and it could also get Apple a few precious millimeters inside the body of the iPhone that could be used for more battery, other components, or just to make the phone thinner (an eternal ambition of Apple’s). And then there’s the elephant in the room: the headphone jack. Or, rather, the potential lack of one. Apple is said to be abandoning the port in favor of a second speaker or microphone at the bottom of the phone. The duties of the standard 3.5mm headphone jack will be handled by either the Lightning port, Bluetooth, or both. None of the rumors can agree on what Apple will ship with the iPhone instead of those 3.5mm earbuds, but it will be one of those two options. Apple enthusiasts have preemptively declared that getting rid of the headphone jack is the same as getting rid of the floppy drive or optical drive—a momentarily painful transition that will work out for the best in the long run. I suspect it will be more complicated than that, and while I’m willing to withhold final judgment until I’ve actually tried whatever Apple’s solution is, it’s on Apple to communicate why the removal of the headphone jack is progress and not just change-for-the-sake-of-change. A new Apple Watch Enlarge / Two current-gen Apple Watch Sport models. Andrew Cunningham The most reliable rumors say that Apple will introduce a second-generation Apple Watch at this event, its first true refresh since the original was introduced last spring. What we know about the new version can be summed up in a handful of words: faster with a GPS. We’re at the point in the Apple Watch’s life where speed improvements are reason enough to upgrade all by themselves, but a built-in GPS will be useful for those who use their watches as jogging or biking companions and don’t want to take their iPhones along with them every time they want to exercise. The current model uses the GPS in your iPhone when it can, but switches to less accurate readings based on its internal sensors when untethered. Though Apple is said to be planning a future version of the watch with LTE support, battery concerns are still keeping it out of the next-generation version of the watch. For internet connectivity, plan on keeping your phone around. And while I haven't read anything specifically about band compatibility, I think it's a sure bet that existing Apple Watch bands (and any new bands Apple introduces with the next model) will remain compatible with the latest one. Macs? Possible, not likely The good news is that we’ve been seeing plenty of rumors about new Macs for a while now, including a redesigned MacBook Pro with an OLED touchscreen bar across the top of the keyboard instead of traditional function keys. The CPUs, GPUs, SSDs, and other components that Apple would need to update nearly every single Mac in the lineup are all available, including new Kaby Lake processors for the MacBook that was updated back in April. Aside from the MacBook Pro, the hardware in the most dire need of an update is the MacBook Air, the Mac Mini, and the Mac Pro. I’ve suspected that the MacBook Air, which was last redesigned in 2010, would be retired, replaced by the Retina MacBook at the low-end and a thinner, lighter 13-inch MacBook Pro at the high-end. But the Air reportedly has at least one more refresh left in it, and Bloomberg says that said refresh could include USB Type-C. But rumors say not to expect Macs next Wednesday, since Apple will be focusing mostly on its other, newer products. We may get a quick Sierra recap if there's time, but hardware is expected in October at the earliest. If true, it would mean that Apple has gone a full year-and-a-half without updating Mac hardware on stage at a product event. The major refreshes that have happened since the original MacBook was announced in March of 2015 (new iMacs In October of that year, the aforementioned MacBook refresh in April 2016) have happened quietly with press releases and review embargoes. That behavior would seem odd for a full redesign rather than a straightforward internal refresh, but it's the most likely outcome if we don't see new hardware this week. iPads? Possible, but less likely for the Pros The iPad Pro is the future of the lineup, and it’s in an awkward spot right now. The 12.9-inch model is a year old and thus ripe for new hardware, but the similar 9.7-inch model is only about six months old. No rumors point to an imminent refresh for the iPad Pro line. A Bloomberg report that says Apple is working on an iPad-focused update for iOS next year (whether as an update to iOS 10 or a part of iOS 11 isn’t made clear) also cites an analyst note that claims a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro will be introduced next year. That doesn’t mean we won’t see anything new, though. The iPad Mini 4 is also nearly a year old and the iPad Air 2 is nearing its second birthday, and stock of the latter tablet is drying up at major retailers. We could still get some price changes or minor refreshes at the low end to shore up the tablet’s sales while we wait for Apple to make bigger changes on the Pro side of the lineup. Software updates Enlarge / macOS Sierra's first beta. The software is nearing the end of its beta cycle. Andrew Cunningham This much is certain: We will get release dates for iOS 10, macOS Sierra, watchOS 3, and tvOS 10 at this event, and some of the updates may actually be released on September 7. Of those four releases, tvOS 10 is the least noteworthy. It introduces a Night Mode version of the UI, makes signing into various apps much easier, and adds a few new toys for developers, but it’s not drastically different from what you’re using now. WatchOS 3 is more impressive. It changes some things about how the basic UI interactions work, makes messaging faster and more versatile, and automatically loads up to 10 apps you choose into memory to make them all faster to access. New hardware will be great if it comes, but this update should also treat current-generation hardware pretty well. Sierra, now called macOS instead of OS X, is a relatively small update for Apple’s most mature platform. Siri is its biggest addition, but it also features some iCloud additions to help save you some disk space, security enhancements, and Apple Watch unlocking for those of you with newer (read: post-2013) hardware. Just make sure you’ve got a new enough Mac to run it, since Sierra drops some older hardware for the first time in several years. And finally, iOS 10 is a wide-ranging update with a lot of new changes. Notifications have been revamped, as has the lock screen and the Today View. New APIs like SiriKit and CallKit will give app developers hooks into the operating system that they’ve never had before. And apps all over the OS have been tweaked with changes large and small. It doesn’t have as much for iPad users as iOS 9 did, but it’s still shaping up to be a solid update. We’ll be reviewing each of these operating systems individually as they are released. Last year, they were all out by the end of September, and I’d expect that to happen again this year as well. Expand full story Reader comments 115 You must login or create an account to comment.

The new earbuds are called simply ‘The Headphone’, a name just as awkward as the company’s previous wireless earbuds known as ‘The Dash’. The Headphone[s] in most ways look similar to the current Dash product, but come in around half the price by losing the built-in fitness sensors and storage. The Headphones also replace the old touch sensors for controlling media and phone calls with physical buttons on the side of the right earbud. Bragi promises around 6 hour of battery life for playback (up from 3 on The Dash), and 250 hours standby time.  I tested the company’s Dash earbuds earlier this year and concluded the fitness sensors and touch controls were too half-baked to justify the $299 price point despite being an otherwise well-designed set of earbuds. Removing the fitness sensors, built-in storage and touch controls for those that don’t want those features and offering just a solid set of cord-free earbuds is a smart move ahead of iPhone 7, the first iPhone expected to ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack.  At $149 retail ($119 special launch price), they could be one of the best options available for those that want cord-free wireless headphones for the new device. Bragi plans to ship them in November.  The Headphone comes with a charging case with lanyard similar to The Dash (it doesn’t have a built-in battery for charging on the go like The Dash, however): The company is also releasing Bragi OS 2.1, an update for The Dash that brings support for syncing with Apple’s HealthKit and Google Fit. In addition, the update adds on-demand heart rate tracking, shuffle mode for internal music, a ‘Touch Lock’  feature to turn off touch controls, and support for voice feedback in Chinese, French, German and Spanish. While it’s still unknown what headphone options Apple itself plans to offer with iPhone 7, accessory makers have increasingly started announcing new wireless and Lightning-based headphones and adapters ahead of its event this month. We reported earlier this year that Apple is working on its own cord-free wireless earbuds, but it’s unclear if Apple will have them ready to launch alongside the new iPhones. Other options for the company would be to include a Lightning to 3.5mm adapter with or without its current EarPods, or to bundle new Lightning EarPods that have been rumored in several reports. You can check out Ben’s review of The Dash from earlier this year.

Crews have put up window decorations and flags with Apple logos, plus other black-with-colored-dots themed banners and signage. At the event, Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, second-generation Apple Watch, and refreshed Beats products. Apple should also provide final release dates for iOS 10, macOS Sierra, tvOS 10, and watchOS 3, and it may have other product and service updates to announce. Apple will provide a live stream of the September 7 keynote on the Apple TV and on iOS and Mac devices through its website.

And as is clear by the invite's text, the event will be held at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, which seems to have become Apple's favourite venue for all its big product launches. Apple enthusiasts in India can watch the livestream of the event starting at 10:30PM on Wednesday, September 7. The livestream can be watched on iOS-based devices running version 7.0 or above and Mac computers with OS X v10.8.5 or above and Safari version 6.0.6 or more. Windows users can watch the event on their Windows 10 PCs, via Microsoft Edge browser. It's worth mentioning that only a while ago, it was possible to watch Apple's launch events on devices running the company's own operating systems only. However, Apple opened up the ability to view to livestream on Windows 10 PCs in September 2015. Lastly, those who are interested in viewing the launch event but don't have a compatible device can stick to our live blog page, as we'll be covering the event as it happens. The full coverage can also be seen on our dedicated Apple iPhone 7 page The highlight of the upcoming iPhone 7 models is that they might come with a Lightning connector to connect the earpods. Until now, iPhone models have come with 3.5mm audio jack. The company might also introduce Bluetooth-enabled earpods. The company is also said to unveil new Beats by Dre products at its keynote event. It is still unclear what kinds of Beats products will be unveiled, but the brand is known for a variety of headphones and portable Bluetooth speakers. Apple acquired Beats for $3 billion in 2014. Another highlight feature that the iPhone 7 Plus is expected to come with is a dual rear-camera setup. The dual camera setup is expected to bring more post-shooting features and greater flexibility in adjusting the depth of field of images after they have been shot. 10 BEST SMARTPHONES OF 2016 REWIND 2016 10 BEST CAMERA SMARTPHONES OF 2016 7 'BIG BATTERY' SMARTPHONES OF 2016 RELATED From around the web From GADGETSNOW Recommended By Colombia From Around the Web From GADGETSNOW Recommended By Colombia Comments Sort By:Up VotedNewestOldestDiscussedDown Voted Characters Remaining: 3000 OR PROCEED WITHOUT REGISTRATION Share on FacebookShare on Twitter SIGN IN WITHFacebookGoogleEmail Refrain from posting comments that are obscene, defamatory or inflammatory, and do not indulge in personal attacks, name calling or inciting hatred against any community.

However, the Watch divided opinion, with many claiming they just didn't need another "smart" device on their wrist. Fast forward two years, and an updated version of Apple's wearable is no doubt in the pipeline. But how will the new model win over its critics? While there has been a never-ending conveyor belt of iPhone 7 rumours, things have remained relatively quiet on the Apple Watch 2 rumour front. Read More Follow the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch 2 launch LIVE with MirrorTech However an investor note leaked from KGI Securities analyst, Ming-chi Kuo has given us an indication of what Apple's plans might be for the smartwatch. We'll keep this article updated, so remember to check back for the latest news on the supposed Apple Watch 2. Release Date (Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) In his investor note Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that the Apple Watch 2 would most likely be launched in the second half of 2016. It's logical to conclude that the next-generation smartwatch will be released alongside the hotly-anticipated iPhone 7 at its 2016 Apple event on today, especially as Apple likes to push sales of the iPhone and Apple Watch together. Read More When does the iPhone 7 come out and what time is the Apple 2016 launch event? Everything you need to know If this is the case, you can expect to see the Watch 2 hit the shelves the following week - with the latest rumours pointing towards September 16. Read More Follow the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch 2 launch LIVE with MirrorTech Specs (Photo: REUTERS) The main features you can expect to see in the Apple Watch 2 are a faster 16nm processor from TSMC, a barometer that will measure atmospheric pressure, inbuilt GPS, superior waterproofing, and a higher capacity battery. These features suggest that the Apple Watch 2 could be trying to market itself more as a sporting wearable - the functionalities cater more closely to those who would want to use it while swimming, climbing and exploring independent of an iPhone. Read More Follow the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch 2 launch LIVE with MirrorTech While the Apple Watch 2 was once rumoured to include 4G connectivity, Kuo noted that he does not expect to see this until at least 2017. This means the Apple Watch will still very much be dependent your iPhone. Front-facing camera Other online rumours have suggested that the new watch will also come with a FaceTime camera for taking selfies, and expanded Wi-Fi capabilities. Apple has been granted a patent for a front-facing Watch camera embedded into the upper bezel, in addition to image sensor and picture storage software, according to Patently Apple. The filing reads: "the camera can be disposed on the front surface of Apple Watch face to capture images of the user". Display Makeover New screen technology will reportedly help prolong the Apple Watch 2's battery life. As the video at the top of the article from electronics repair firm Byte shows, the new device is expected to come in the same 38mm and 42mm screen size options as the previous version. Apple watch 2 components compared to 1st Generation (Photo: Youtube/Bytesuperstore) A report from tech site DigiTimes states that Apple is switching out an OLED screen for a Micro-LED one on the next version of its wearable. While OLED screens are generally thought to produce a better picture, LED is crucial for saving the battery. Sony pursued a similar switch on its PS Vita handheld game console. LCD screens are also thinner than OLED displays, meaning the next version of the Apple Watch could be slimmer. Apple Watch 2 - or Apple Watch S? Rumours abound that Apple could apply its 'tick tock' iPhone approach of a major model upgrade one year, followed by a less radical 'S" update the next year. Though the company disrupted this slightly with the launch of the iPhone SE in March, it's probable a Watch S could hit our shelves soon. Design (Photo: Apple) It sounds as though the Apple Watch 2 won't be getting a design overhaul. Kuo notes that it will have "the same general design" as the original Apple Watch, including screen size, thickness and a similar form overall. One of the reasons the watch can't get smaller is that the new functionalities and improved processor require more battery power. New buttons A patent application details how two new buttons may be built into the Watch's left hand side, which could be linked to launching the camera, or allow the owner to make shortcuts to their most-used tasks, like opening the music player, weather or workout apps. Smart straps Another patent filing suggests "modular functional band links for wearable devices" are in the pipeline, meaning straps with inbuilt batteries. Regardless, new rubber, fabric and metal straps are likely to be announced alongside the next Watch. Apple watch for sale in an Apple shop (Photo: Getty) Price In keeping with Apple's previous pricing strategy, Kuo expects an Apple Watch price cut once the new models are launched. This means the Apple Watch 2 models will come in at the same price point the watches are currently being sold at - £299 for the 38mm sport model, and £339 for the larger 42mm one. That goes up to £479 for the 38mm for the standard model and £479 for the 42mm variant. The analyst also predicted that the first-generation Apple Watch models will get the same processor and waterproofing upgrades as the Apple Watch 2. Therefore if you're a first time buyer of Apple's smartwatch, it may be worth opting for the older model - especially as it will look almost identical. (Photo: Reuters) Expect bigger changes further down the line... While the Apple Watch 2 may currently not have that many noteworthy upgrades, 2018 is the year to expect a more substantial overhaul. This will include 4G support, a new look, 5G network commercialisation and better medical and health applications.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Local memorial ceremonies to commemorate 15th anniversary of 9/11 attacks Monday Sep 5, 2016 at 9:29 AM Sep 5, 2016 at 4:31 PM Jose Quintero Staff Writer @dd_jquintero APPLE VALLEY — Sunday marks the 15th anniversary of the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington and communities across the country will hold various memorial events to honor the 2,996 people killed Sept. 11, 2001. The Kiwanis Club of Apple Valley will hold their memorial service at Civic Center Park at 9 a.m. on Saturday. The club announced the commemoration will include one of the remaining fire engine from Ground Zero and the 9/11 Memorial and Foundation of Fort Irwin will conduct a presentation. Keynote speakers expected to attend the ceremony include San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon, San Bernardino County First District Supervisor Robert Lovingood and other local dignitaries from the Victor Valley. The club announced that local youths will also perform and participate in the ceremony. There will also be informational booths from local first responders and military. A free hot dog lunch will precede the ceremony. "The public is invited to attend this free event and encouraged to participate in the Memorial to share with our community and country that we stand together and united as we did that day. Let us not forget," the club said in a statement. Victor Valley College staff and students will host a ceremony Sunday morning adjacent to the college’s official “United We Stand” monument, which was erected in 2006 beside the campus library and has since won awards for its design by VVC student and local artist Joan Sowinski. The annual memorial ceremony will start at 6:30 a.m. as volunteers will place 3,000 miniature American flags on the hillside next to the library to visually represent the victims of the four terrorist attacks of 9/11. Attached to each flag is a placard reading the name of each of the deceased, hand-written by student volunteers. The public is welcome to attend the ceremony on the college campus, located at 18422 Bear Valley Road in Victorville. Lovingood and McMahon will square off against each other in a "Duel of the Desert" in Adelanto Sunday afternoon, prior to the start of the High Desert Mavericks playoff game at Heritage Field. The Mavericks are hosting a charity softball game that pits the two county officials against each other at 4 p.m. The charity game will honor the military and first responders who have served since the tragic day. There will be a special tribute for first responders who worked "tirelessly in emergency crisis" around the High Desert to contain and extinguish the Pilot and Bluecut fires. Tickets to the game are $6 and $3 of every ticket sold will benefit High Desert Police Activities League Youth Programs. "This is Minor League Baseball at its best," Mavericks General Manager Ben Hemmen said. "Once the Mavericks won the first half of the Cal League South Division and our Sept. 11 playoff game date was set, I knew our organization had an opportunity to give back to the community. All of our lives changed on 9/11 fifteen years ago. We are proud to honor those that served that day along with those that continue to serve. Our goal is to bring the High Desert together to benefit our youth so they will know how important this day is in our country's history." Gates open at 3:30 p.m. The Mavericks game is scheduled to start at 5:05 p.m. For more information or to purchase tickets you can call the Mavericks front office at 76-246-6287 or you can visit www.HDMavs.com. However, some local schools will hold memorial events Friday morning. Academy for Academic Excellence, located at 17500 Mana Road in Apple Valley, will also hold their event Friday morning at 7:40 a.m. by the school's flag pole for middle school and high school students. The memorial around the school's flagpole will run until 8:15 a.m. and then the school will hold a ceremony in the gym from 8:30 to 9 a.m. for elementary students. Each ceremony will have different keynote speakers, according to the school's Executive Assistant Rene Payne. "We have invited police officers, firefighters, emergency service and military personnel from our AAE family and the community to join us," Payne said. Adelanto Elementary School, located at 179331 Jonathan Street, will hold their memorial event at 9:30 a.m. According to the school's Library Media Coordinator Angela Espino, students will show their appreciation for firefighters and police officers during the third annual event. Parents are also invited to attend the school-wide event.

Revenue grew 5.7 percent from the previous month’s NT$4.56 billion, but fell 9 percent from last year’s NT$5.3 billion, the firm said in a filing with the Taiwan Stock Exchange. By shipment breakdown, the company’s lenses with 10 megapixels or more accounted for between 60 and 70 percent of its total shipments last month, while the 8-megapixel products contributed between 20 and 30 percent, the firm said. Citing order visibility, Largan said it foresees this month’s revenue continuing to expand from last month. CASINGS Catcher revenue drops 2.6% Catcher Technology Co (可成科技), a metal casing supplier for Apple Inc’s iPhones, yesterday reported revenue of NT$7 billion for last month, dropping 2.6 percent from last year’s NT$7.18 billion. The result expanded as much as 16.8 percent from the previous month’s NT$5.99 billion, the company said in a filing with the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Last month’s revenue marked the company’s highest monthly performance in the past nine months, according to the firm’s data. Catcher attributed robust growth to scheduled shipments of products for clients’ new projects. In the first eight months of this year, Catcher’s revenue contracted 7 percent to NT$47.36 billion. The casing supplier said that it expects its annual revenue to remain flat or grow mildly from last year’s NT$82.41 billion. ELECTRONICS Citizenship report ‘untrue’ Hon Hai Precision Industry Co (鴻海精密) chairman Terry Gou (郭台銘) yesterday released a statement through his lawyers saying that he did not apply to become a citizen of Singapore, nor did he have Singaporean citizenship. The statement was in response to a report published by the Chinese-language online media group Credere Media (信傳媒), which said Gou applied to become a Singaporean citizen after the firm’s annual general meeting in June in a bid to evade paying tax in Taiwan. Gou’s statement said the report is groundless and untrue. FOREIGN EXCHANGE Reserves rise US$1.78bn The nation’s foreign exchange reserves totaled US$435.86 billion as of the end of last month, increasing US$1.78 billion from the end of the previous month, the central bank said yesterday. The central bank attributed the increase to a successful management strategy and the appreciation of the euro and other reserve currencies against the US dollar. The market value of securities investments and local currency deposits held by foreign portfolio managers reached US$308.7 billion, or 71 percent of foreign exchange reserves, the central bank said. ELECTRONICS LCD patent deal inked E Ink Holdings Co (元太科技), which supplies e-paper displays for Amazon.com Inc’s Kindle series, yesterday said its South Korean subsidiary Hydis Technologies Co has penned an agreement with Chinese flat-panel maker Tianma Micro-electronics Co (天馬微電子) to license patents linked to LCD manufacturing. The agreement will have a positive impact on E Ink’s finances and business, the company said in a filing with the Taiwan Stock Exchange. E Ink charges royalty fees by licensing Hydis Technologies’ high-resolution fringe-field-switching LCD technology. This story has been viewed 1842 times. Comments will be moderated.

Noonan said: "I believe that there are some very important principles at stake in this case and that a robust legal challenge before the courts is essential to defend Ireland's interests. The full amount of tax was paid in this case and no state aid was provided. Ireland did not give favorable tax treatment to Apple. Ireland does not do deals with taxpayers." Immediately following the announcement of the Commission's decision on August 30, the Irish Finance Department said that Noonan would seek Cabinet approval to appeal the ruling. In a statement, it argued that "it is not appropriate that EU state aid competition rules are being used in this new and unprecedented way in the area of taxation, which is a member state competence and a fundamental matter of sovereignty. Following an in-depth state aid investigation launched in June 2014, the Commission concluded that two tax rulings issued by Ireland to Apple have substantially and artificially lowered the tax paid by Apple in Ireland since 1991. "This selective tax treatment of Apple in Ireland is illegal under EU state aid rules, because it gives Apple a significant advantage over other businesses that are subject to the same national taxation rules," it contended. The Commission has ordered Ireland to recover "unpaid taxes" from Apple for the years 2003 to 2014 of up to EUR13bn (USD14.5bn), plus interest. Ireland has until November 12 to lodge an appeal. The Government will hold the recovery amount in escrow until the case has been concluded, as it may ultimately be returned to the company in the event of a successful appeal. In an open letter to customers, Apple stated that the Commission is "effectively proposing to replace Irish tax laws with a view of what the Commission thinks the law should have been." It added that the company "never asked for, nor did we receive, any special deals." Noonan also announced that the Government will propose a parliamentary motion in support of its appeal. The motion will affirm the Government's commitment to the 12.5 percent corporation tax rate, the research and development tax credit, and the knowledge development box. In addition, the Government will commission an independent review of the corporation tax code, which will however exclude any possibility of a change to the 12.5 percent corporation tax rate. He said: "It is good practice to undertake periodic reviews of key areas of government policy. The last review of corporation tax policy took place in 2014. Since then a wide range of new international developments have emerged in international taxation, such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development base erosion and profit shifting project. We need to ensure that Ireland's corporation tax code meets these new standards while remaining competitive as the economy continues to grow."

X Apple ruling mixed for Irish economic outlook, says Fitch If upheld, ruling could deliver one-off boost on debt position but that could be overshadowed by uncertainty Mon, Sep 5, 2016, 17:12 Fitch says the Apple ruling could add to uncertainty created by the Brexit vote         The European Commission’s ruling on Apple has mixed implications for the Republic, according to rating agency Fitch, though it has played down the risks to inward investment. “It could result in a substantial one-off improvement to Ireland’s fiscal position,” the agency said in a statement, “but may also add to medium-term economic uncertainty and increase political risks.” Last week the commission ruled that Ireland should seek the repayment of €13 billion in back taxes from Apple. Both Ireland and Apple have said they will appeal. “If upheld, the commission’s ruling would represent a substantial one-off fiscal windfall for Ireland,” according to Fitch. Excluding interest, it said the payment could amount to around 5.1 per cent of 2015 GDP. “If used to pay down debt and/or reduce borrowing rather than spent, this would accelerate the improvement in public debt dynamics that has been driven by fiscal consolidation and robust nominal growth.” Government debt Fitch’s current forecasts are for gross general government debt falling to 63.7 per cent of GDP in 2020, down from 78.7 per cent at the end of 2015. These do not factor in any impact from the Apple ruling but do incorporate the large upward revision to 2015 growth announced in July, according to Fitch . However, Fitch warns that it is possible any such Apple benefit would be partly offset by increased uncertainty over Ireland’s attraction to global businesses, potentially damaging FDI and employment. However Fitch said it believed this risk was “limited”. Corporate tax rate Ireland’s 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate, and its high human development and governance indicators “should keep the business environment attractive to multinationals, and the costs of relocating would be large”, it says. “But the Apple ruling could add to uncertainty created by the UK’s Brexit referendum, which we think will slow export and investment growth.” Fitch also notes the political debate about whether to appeal the Apple ruling and divisions within the Cabinet. ADVERTISEMENT “This shows the challenge that the Fine Gael-led minority government faces in formulating and enacting policy.

You may also be looking in the wrong place. By Steve Ranger | September 5, 2016 -- 16:16 GMT (09:16 PDT) | Topic: CXO Is it time to look beyond the smartphone for innovation? James Martin/CNET The Apple rumour mill has already offered a pretty credible list of the new features in the iPhone 7, which is expected to be unveiled later this week. more iphone news iPhone 7 Plus hands-on: A weekend full of adjustments iPhone 7: Best LCD display ever tested CR: iPhone 7 camera does not outperform iPhone 6s Scratch test raises serious durability concerns Apple's supply pinch: Smart marketing or forecasting? iPhone 7 sales may reach 100m in 2016 due to Note 7 recal l Some sort of dual camera setup may debut, while the 3.5mm headphone jack is likely to vanish to make room for a new sensor and a second speaker. Storage is finally being revamped to do away with the diminutive 16GB option, as we predicted a year ago, and we may see some new colours and improved waterproofing too. There as some interesting features in the list, but -- assuming this is all that's announced -- these are modest incremental changes at best. They're unlikely to generate huge excitement, although the demise of the headphone jack will irritate plenty of people. There are some obvious reasons for this lack of innovation -- the main one being that the iPhone is now a tried-and-tested, nine-year-old product. Apple isn't going to mess too much with the device that brings in the majority of its revenue, so if you were holding out for a clamshell model to debut on Wednesday, prepare to be disappointed. What else could Apple stuff into the iPhone anyway? There may be a few elements that could be added (my colleague Adrian Kingsley Hughes nominates wireless charging), but little that's likely to make a huge difference to businesses or consumers. That's not to say we've reached the end of smartphone innovation -- just that it might take a while to happen: the PC didn't change much for years and then rapidly evolved with the rise of two-in-one and hybrids like Microsoft's Surface and Lenovo's Yoga ranges. But smartphones have certainly reached an innovation plateau: although it's possible that curved screens or modular phones will shake things up at some point, it won't happen this year or next. Watch out for services For now, it's necessary to look beyond smartphone hardware innovations to understand where Apple is going next. The company will be looking over its shoulder more because, as the smartphone becomes more of a commodity, the gap between the bottom and top of the market will narrow. Even affordable smartphones can be remarkably good, so Apple has to come up with ways to keep consumers and businesses aboard that aren't just about the hardware. This means the focus will be on services: the iPhone became a success because it harnessed a multitude of developers to build apps for it. The iPhone will continue to be a success if Apple can persuade users to adopt more of its services like Apple Pay and Apple Music, or to use their smartphones to control their home appliances. Before the Apple Watch: A history of smartwatches,... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 21 NEXT PREV Apple has a strong position here: it has sold more that one billion iPhones and, as analyst Forrester points out, has very limited software fragmentation compared to its rival Android, which makes it "the premium consumer platform for brands and developers." If any smartphone company can make services work, it's Apple. As for cutting-edge tech, the Apple Watch is where a lot of innovation will happen (visible innovation, anyway, as big chunks of Apple's increasing R&D spend is presumably also going on VR/AR and car technology). Rumours suggest we're unlikely to see the Apple Watch with built-in cellular connectivity appearing this year, but it's surely on the way -- perhaps next year. Once the Apple Watch becomes a standalone device it will begin the journey from expensive curiosity to a potential smartphone replacement, as innovation -- at least for now -- moves to wearables. The absence of a significant tech breakthrough in the next iPhone doesn't mean doom and gloom for Apple, which remains in a hugely powerful position. But it does suggest that the market is shifting once again, and that the challenge for Apple is how to respond.

Apple reportedly has revised upward orders by 10% for parts and components needed for production of the new iPhone devices scheduled to be released on September 7, according to sources from the iPhone supply chain in Taiwan. Sources say that the hike in order volumes indicates that Apple is being positive about replacement demand for the new iPhones. Originally, the company predicted that shipments would only reach about 60% of those in the year prior. Shipments of the iPhone 6s reached 30 million a month on average in the second half of 2015. Despite the increase, some suppliers are still worried that orders will drift down in the fourth quarter due to seasonality. Apple is set to unveil the iPhone 7 on September 7th.

This is down from the typical $120 a year ($9.99/month), making Apple Music effectively $8.25 per month for a full year. This equates to an 18% savings overall. The new gift cards are available at Apple retail locations, but you’ll have to find another retailer if you’re looking to buy online. It’s interesting because the gift card isn’t available in all Apple retail locations just yet, and it’s not available online. This leads us to believe that Apple wants to drive more traffic to its retail locations. It’s also worth noting that the new 12-month option isn’t available via the subscription settings on iOS or on iTunes on Mac. With that said, you can purchase it online via PayPal’s official store on eBay or on Walmart’s online store.

Although Digitimes has a mixed bag in terms of their track record, it has been pretty reliable in terms of supply chain reporting. It says Apple has boosted production of both iPhone 7 models by 10%. The spike in production could mean Apple is more confident that it will sell more iPhone 7’s initially, or because of the more recent recall from its largest Android competitor, Samsung, on its Galaxy Note 7 line. While the iPhone 7 will look similar to its iPhone 6s counterpart, there are tons of internal and exciting changes to look forward to, especially in the iPhone 7 Plus mode. Don’t forget to tune in to Today’s iPhone for full coverage of Apple’s fall media event on Wednesday. The event begins at 10AM PST.

The 3.5mm socket has been used as the default audio connector on the vast majority of electronic devices - from computers to game consoles - since the 1960s. Now Apple supposedly wants to shake things up by forcing customers to either use headphones that plug into the Lightning port, which is currently used for charging, or wireless headphones, which connect to the iPhone via Bluetooth. Read More When does the iPhone 7 come out? Launch date CONFIRMED for Apple's new smartphone Given that millions of iPhone owners around the world currently use wired headphones, it's a potentially risky move, but one that Apple evidently has confidence in. Leaked iPhone 7 v the iPhone 6 showing removal of the headphone jack (Photo: YouTube/9to5Mac) Read More iPhone 7: Release date, price, leaked pictures, and all the latest news and rumours about Apple's new iPhone Some rumours suggest that Apple is planning to bundle the iPhone 7 with new wired EarPods that use a Lightning connector, while others claim the phone will launch with wireless headphones, or "AirPods" . There has also been some suggestion that the new iPhone will come with a Lightning-to-audio adaptor, so you will still be able to use your regular wired headphones - though these things are easy to lose. While the move may seem like a travesty to anyone who has forked out for expensive headphones in the past, there may be method to Apple's madness. Read More iPhone 7 and Apple Watch 2 launch LIVE: Dual-lens camera and NO headphone jack expected at Apple event 2016 Recent tests by MacRumours found that headphones connected via the Lightning port provided better sound quality than those via the standard headphone jack. iPhone 7 space black rendering (Photo: Martin Hajek) This is down to the limited size of the 3.5mm headphone jack, meaning sound quality suffers as a result of a smaller, less expensive amp and inbuilt digital-to-analogue music converter (DAC). Lightning connector headphones contain their own amp and DAC, putting the manufacturer in charge of the audio quality. Read More When does the iPhone 7 come out? Launch date CONFIRMED for Apple's new smartphone However, there's little doubt that headphones that plug into the Lightning port would offer significantly better audio quality than wireless ones. The 8-pin Lightning connector can handle more data than Bluetooth, which is what counts when your headphones decode audio signals digitally, according to TechRadar .

The Lightning port, he says, can transmit information at a rate of 480Mbps - or around 60 megabytes per second - for far superior audio quality.

You may even find they're better than your old ones with a traditional audio jack.

With just a few days to go before Apple's next-generation iPhones go from rumor to reality, one last wave of rumors is washing over the web. Earlier today we told you about a hugely important new feature coming to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus that will finally address one of the biggest problems people have with Apple's current iPhones. Now, we're back with another big leak issued by not one but two different reliable sources. DON'T MISS: Leak: iPhone 7 will solve two of the three biggest problems with iPhones So, how are Apple's "boring" new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus shaping up? Oh, they'll only be the fastest smartphones you can buy, with twice the storage, killer cameras and an improved design. No big deal, right? Well, things get even better than that, Apple fans. It looks like we can count dramatically improved water resistance among the new features that will be touted by Apple's new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Still upset the company removed the headphone jack? You won't be the first time you drop your new iPhone 7 in a sink or toilet and it comes away working perfectly. Beyond that, we now have two independent reports from reliable sources suggesting that Apple's next-generation iPhones will come in not one but two new color options. This is a big deal considering Apple introduced its first new color in quite some time on last year's iPhone models, but it makes sense considering the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus look a lot like Apple's iPhones from the previous two years, so new colors will offer some more incentive to upgrade. According to both reports, we can expect a new matte black color to replace Apple's current Space Gray iPhones. The color appeared in an earlier leak to look like a much darker version of Space Gray. Additionally, it appears as though a new glossy black color is in the cards as well, and it's being referred to as "piano black." The news comes from two solid sources. First, the most reliable Apple insider in the world mentioned the two new colors in a note to clients on Saturday. KGI Securities' Ming-Chi Kuo has been wrong in the past, but it doesn't happen very often. Then gadget leaker The Malignant posted two photos sourced from an anonymous Chinese forum user. The pictures appear to show stickers that were taken from iPhone 7 prototypes and fixed to Foxconn badges in an effort to reinforce their legitimacy. One sticker apparently lists piano black as the iPhone 7's color, and the second lists dark black. https://twitter.com/the_malignant/status/772369664487911424 Apple is set to unveil its new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus during Wednesday's big press conference, so we'll find out exactly what these new iPhone colors look like soon enough. The phones are then expected to be made available for preorder beginning this Friday, September 9th, ahead of their release on September 16th.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Apple Music is now cheaper than Spotify Jacob Siegal BGR NewsSeptember 5, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Just in time for the launch of the iPhone 7, Apple has introduced a new 12-month Apple Music subscription gift card for $99. This brings the monthly cost down to $8.25 — an 18% discount off the standard $9.99 monthly cost — making the service more affordable than its top rival Spotify. All in all, you'll end up saving about $20 annually by purchasing a gift card rather than subscribing through the app, so it's a no-brainer if you're committed to Apple Music. DON'T MISS: Leak: iPhone 7 will solve two of the three biggest problems with iPhones You've got a few options if you want to pick up the gift card. As 9to5Mac explains, the gift card is available in Apple retail stores, but not all stores have it in stock yet, so be sure to call before you jump in your car. Secondly, Apple isn't selling the gift card online yet (or possibly at all), so you'll have to check other retailers if you want to order to card from the comfort of your home. Thankfully, you can purchase a code for the year-long subscription through PayPal Digital Gifts on eBay or from Walmart's online store. The timing of the gift card launch makes a great deal of sense. Not only is Apple preparing to unveil a new iPhone later this week, but the Music app itself is going to receive a significant makeover with the launch of iOS 10 this fall. If you though the war between Apple and Spotify was intense before, it's about to get worse.

Apple issued updates for OS X and its Safari browser last week to close a loophole that could allow attackers to take over a computer and execute programs to steal data or spy on its user. News of the update was first reported by Motherboard. The fix comes a week after Apple patched a similar vulnerability for iPhones , and the timing apparently is no coincidence. Apple credited digital rights group Citizen Lab and security software company Lookout with finding the now-fixed OS X vulnerability. Both were also at the center of last week's iOS fix. Read More When is iOS 10 coming out? UK release date, features and how to download Last week's iPhone update was the result of an attempted hack directed against pro-democracy activist Ahmed Mansoor, who was targeted for his work against human rights violations in the United Arab Emirates. Mansoor had received suspicious text messages, attempting to trick him into installing malware on his device. The software in question, which would have allowed outsiders to hijack his phone and download data from it, has reportedly been developed by the NSO Group, a secretive Israeli surveillance company. This trick will tell you your exact signal strength The New York Times reported that the NSO Group sells spyware like this to foreign governments for steep fees. Spying on 10 iPhone users costs up to $1.15 million. Most users will likely never be the subject to such targeted surveillance campaigns, but it's still a good idea to update your computer immediately. After all, other rogue actors could exploit the same vulnerability. Apple made the latest patches available as part of its regular update process.

KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has posted accurate Apple reports in the past, has shared new details on what he says will be included with the iPhone 7. Kuo says that we can expect a new Apple A10 processor in the iPhone 7 along with 2GB of RAM in the iPhone 7 and 3GB in the iPhone 7 Plus. Storage options will reportedly be 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB. Speaking of options, Kuo claims that there will be five colors available on the iPhone 7. Those include silver, gold, rose gold, a “dark black” that’ll replace the Space Gray color of the iPhone 6, and a “piano black” color with a glossy finish. Another notable feature of the iPhone 7, according to Kuo, will be IPX7 water resistance. That would make the iPhone 7 match the Apple Watch in terms of water resistance. Kuo also reiterates that the iPhone 7 will likely ditch the 3.5mm headphone jack found on past models. Rather than place another speaker there instead of the 3.5mm jack, Kuo suggests that Apple will put a speaker in the earpiece to give the iPhone 7 stereo sound when in landscape. Rounding out the new features that Kuo says are coming to the iPhone 7 are wider color displays, a pressure-sensitive home button that doesn’t actually click, an upgraded rear camera flash, an upgraded proximity sensor, and a dual lens rear camera on the iPhone 7 Plus that’ll offer two 12-megapixel sensors. One will reportedly be a wide-angle lens with optical image stabilization, while the second will be a telephoto lens. The design of the iPhone 7 will reportedly be very similar to the iPhone 6 and 6s, but if today’s report holds true, there could end up being a number of noteworthy features on the iPhone 7. The new processor will likely offer improved performance, and the two new black color options will help iPhone 7 owners to ensure that their device stands out, even if its design is similar to the iPhone 6 and 6s. If this report holds true, it’ll be interesting to see how many people opt for the iPhone 7 Plus. Many people use their smartphone as their only camera, and the dual lens rear camera setup could be a big enough upgrade over the iPhone 7’s single camera to convince some folks to go Plus. And while Apple likely won’t advertise the amount of RAM inside the phones, the 3GB of RAM in the iPhone 7 Plus could help to push spec hounds to go for the bigger phone.

X Apple ruling mixed for Irish economic outlook, says Fitch If upheld, ruling could deliver one-off boost on debt position but that could be overshadowed by uncertainty Mon, Sep 5, 2016, 17:12 Fitch says the Apple ruling could add to uncertainty created by the Brexit vote         The European Commission’s ruling on Apple has mixed implications for the Republic, according to rating agency Fitch, though it has played down the risks to inward investment. “It could result in a substantial one-off improvement to Ireland’s fiscal position,” the agency said in a statement, “but may also add to medium-term economic uncertainty and increase political risks.” Last week the commission ruled that Ireland should seek the repayment of €13 billion in back taxes from Apple. Both Ireland and Apple have said they will appeal. “If upheld, the commission’s ruling would represent a substantial one-off fiscal windfall for Ireland,” according to Fitch. Excluding interest, it said the payment could amount to around 5.1 per cent of 2015 GDP. “If used to pay down debt and/or reduce borrowing rather than spent, this would accelerate the improvement in public debt dynamics that has been driven by fiscal consolidation and robust nominal growth.” Government debt Fitch’s current forecasts are for gross general government debt falling to 63.7 per cent of GDP in 2020, down from 78.7 per cent at the end of 2015. These do not factor in any impact from the Apple ruling but do incorporate the large upward revision to 2015 growth announced in July, according to Fitch . However, Fitch warns that it is possible any such Apple benefit would be partly offset by increased uncertainty over Ireland’s attraction to global businesses, potentially damaging FDI and employment. However Fitch said it believed this risk was “limited”. Corporate tax rate Ireland’s 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate, and its high human development and governance indicators “should keep the business environment attractive to multinationals, and the costs of relocating would be large”, it says. “But the Apple ruling could add to uncertainty created by the UK’s Brexit referendum, which we think will slow export and investment growth.” Fitch also notes the political debate about whether to appeal the Apple ruling and divisions within the Cabinet.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming CES 2017 GPS & Sat Nav Mobile Apps Mobile Phone Accessories Mobile Phones Tablets Wearables & Fitness Trending: Christmas Gift Guide Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / News / Mobile Phone News / Dropping your iPhone 7 down the toilet probably won't be a problem Dropping your iPhone 7 down the toilet probably won't be a problem by Chris Smith 05 September 2016 0 shares Read Comments Apple will unveil the first waterproof iPhone this week… and it’ll come in five colours. That’s the latest from respected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who released a research report to investors ahead of Thursday’s launch. Kuo says the iPhone 7 range will benefit from the same IP7X waterproofing technology as the original Apple Watch. That means it’ll survive a drop in the washing up bowl and short underwater stints at depths of up to one metre. If this is true, we can’t wait to hear Tim Cook announce it on Wednesday like Apple invented water resistance. Kuo also claims (via MacRumors) the phone will arrive in five different colours, which will include two shades of black, a matt dark black and a glossy piano black. That’s backed up by the leak of test stickers uncovered by @the_malignant on Twitter and also the previous appearance of purported iPhone 7 SIM tray. Space Gray will be a thing of the past according to the KGI Securities analyst, while silver, gold and rose gold will remain. Related: iOS 10 vs Android Nougat Also on Kuo’s hit list is the A10 processor and the absence of the headphone jack, which will allow for the inclusion of a larger speaker and a new sensor to improve Force Touch. Interestingly, Kuo says Apple is boosting the audio abilities by turning the earpiece receiver in to a speaker, enabling stereo sound. Kuo believes the click-less Home button is also coming, along with the dual 12-megapixel camera lenses on the iPhone 7 Plus. Kuo has a decent track record when it comes to predicting these things, so it’ll be interesting to see whether he nails it when Apple unveils the devices on Wednesday.

Although Apple is notoriously secretive, almost every detail of the new device has emerged days before the company’s official event, if a major leak is to be believed. The report suggests the phone will be faster, water resistant and come in two new colours. Images recently emerged from designer Martin Hajek, who 3D printed mock ups of the iPhone 7 based on renders circulating online (pictured are the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Pro models) A detailed rundown from KGI Securities analyst Min-Chi Kuo, who has a good track record of correctly relaying information on Apple hardware before it launches, was obtained by Mac Rumours and confirms many of the predicted features of the iPhone 7. Here are the features that are expected to arrive on the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones. NO HEADPHONE JACK It appears Apple really will be taking the unpopular step of completely ditching the headphone port on its next-generation handsets. The technology firm is said to be bundling ‘EarPods’ with a Lightning connector, as well as a Lightning to 3.5mm adapter in the box. iPhone owners will also be able to use wireless Bluetooth headphones. Getting rid of the traditional headphone port will free up more room for a new speaker, and possibly a new sensor to improve Force Touch operation – Apple’s touchscreen and haptic feedback technology. Apple is controversially dropping the headphone jack in favour of its Lightning port. This leaked image shows what the iPhone 7 might look like without the headphone jack NEW COLOURS Apple will be adding a ‘dark black’ model to replace its Space Grey finish. This will sit alongside the silver, gold and rose gold finishes that have been popular parts of previous line ups. They will also be joined by another new colour described as ‘glossy piano black’. The iPhone 7 is said to come in five colours. Apple will be adding a ‘dark black’ model to replace its Space Grey finish. This will sit alongside the silver, gold and rose gold finishes that have been popular parts of previous line ups. Pictured are concept images Previous rumours have also suggested that a dark blue finish will be introduced, but there is no mention of this in the latest report. ‘We expect the iPhone 7 to come in piano black, dark black, rose gold, gold and silver,’ says the report obtained by Mac Rumours. ‘Only the piano black model will have a glossy finish. Given high production barriers, large-storage models may have first priority in adopting piano black casing in the initial stage.’  WATER RESISTANCE Apple is set to introduce IPX7 water resistance, which already exists on its first Apple Watch model. This should allow the new phone to be submerged up to three feet (1m) for up to 30 minutes. This would mean that the new handset would survive in the rain, or a brief spell in the shower, but is unlikely to survive a long dunk in a swimming pool. The event will be held in San Francisco at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, and could also see the release of new MacBooks and a second generation Apple watch MORE POWERFUL CHIP Apple could be replacing its current A9 chip with an updated A10 processor made by TSMC, which could run at speeds up to 2.45 GHz. This could mean a substantial boost to existing processing speeds leading to faster loader of apps. DUAL-LENS CAMERA A long-rumoured feature, the dual-lens rear camera is said to be coming to the iPhone 7 Plus, but not to the smaller iPhone 7. Leaked images show a new dual lens rear camera that is said to be heading to the larger iPhone 7 Plus, but which will reportedly not be included on the smaller iPhone 7 The double camera is said to take brighter pictures and will also be capable of merging two photos together to provide the best image possible. An improved LED flash will also be included on the rear camera, along with an ambient light sensor, says the report. REDESIGNED HOME BUTTON Apple is said to be overhauling the home button to make it fit flush against the chassis, which is a result of the new water resistant design. While the button will no longer be clickable, the phone is said to include haptic feedback, to mimic the response of a clickable button. A concept image shows what Apple’s new iPhone 7 handset might look like with a new home button and no traditional headphone port WIDE COLOUR DISPLAY The new iPhone is expected to include the wide colour display technology that was introduced on the iPad Pro. Influenced by the digital cinema industry, the tech is designed to improve colour saturation for a punchier and more realistic picture. +7 Early concept images show what the new iPhone 7’s rumoured chassis design STEREO SPEAKERS Apple is rumoured to be upgrading the earpiece receiver at the top of the device to work as a speaker. This would improve the audio by providing a stereo experience when the handset is held in landscape. CURVED SCREEN Earlier rumours have suggested that at least one of the new iPhone models will include a curved display. Rumours suggest that the iPhone 7 will be cased in curved glass made from liquid metal. Artist Martin Hajek created this concept images ahead of the iPhone 6 launch, based on similar rumours at the time This would put it head-to-head with the Samsung Galaxy Edge S7, which was released earlier this year and features a display that curves around the edges of the handset. ‘The standout features will be a dual-camera system on the larger iPhone, a re-engineered home button that responds to pressure with a vibrating sensation rather than a true physical click and the removal of the devices’ headphone jack,’ reports Mark Gurman from Bloomberg.

The third edition of First Annapolis’ semi-annual study of mobile banking & payments also reveals that 73% of those using the services reported no issues or challenges with the enrollment process. However, 8% indicated that the process took too long/had too many steps, while 8% experienced trouble loading a card, with issues being more common among Android Pay and Samsung Pay than those using Apple Pay. Apple Pay and Android Pay users have loaded an average of 1.9 cards into their wallet, while Samsung Pay users average 1.5 cards. Users reported an average satisfaction rating of 4.4 for each of the three mobile payment services. 61% of Android Pay customers are very satisfied with the service, compared to 59% of Samsung Pay users and 52% of those signed up to Apple Pay. “Adoption and use of the pays is increasing and satisfaction levels among users are consistently high but significant runway remains,” First Annapolis says. “Real and perceived merchant acceptance is the most common barrier to increasing frequency of use. “Younger consumers are most likely to use a pay service and their habits will drive migration over time but older demographics shouldn’t be ignored. Marketing and education beyond millennials to encourage enrollment will help drive mainstream use.” The research also reveals that 74% of Americans have made at least one mobile payment in the last 12 months — including online, in-app and in-store — representing an increase from 40% in May last year. 23% had made a mobile payment in-store as of June 2016, up from 20% in December 2015 and 16% in May 2015. More than half of the respondents (51%) now have a mobile wallet app on their phone, with only 7% of users reported using a mobile wallet through their bank. 27% of those surveyed who do not have a mobile wallet are interested in the idea of having one. When asked ‘Who provides the mobile wallet app on your phone?’ Apple (36%) and PayPal (21%) were the most frequently cited wallet providers, followed by Google with 15%. Banks, however, topped the list of the respondents’ most preferred provider of mobile wallets with 45%. Adoption of mobile payments is strong among millennials, with 82% of those under 35 having made a mobile payment. 37% of millennials have made a mobile P2P payment and 34% have enrolled to use a mobile payment service. This compares to 25% of those aged 35-44 and 14% of those aged 44-54. 64% cited security concerns as their main reason for not using mobile payments, followed by not having the need to use the service (42%), privacy concerns (41%), preferring the convenience of non-mobile payment methods (18%), lack of trust in mobile payment providers (16%), needing more documentation (10%), a fear that it would lead to an increase in spending (6%) and unreliable technology (6%).

Tech giant Apple has been accused of an illegal deal by basing its headquarters here to take advantage of our low corporate tax rate. EU bosses have now demanded that the American company pays back €13bn of taxes owed. IDA Ireland - which offers tax and investment advice on the Irish economy - reckons Ireland is being put under pressure. The firm’s CEO Martin Shanahan said: “What the commission is clearly asking is for Ireland be a collector general for the rest of the world. That is not acceptable to us. “I don’t accept that we are taking anyone’s tax.” He said that ultimately this was an international issue. “There are mismatches undoubtedly between international tax regimes. And Ireland has been to the forefront of playing its part in ensuring those mismatches are addressed. “We have made changes over the last number of years to our tax regime.” Apple CEO Tim Cook (Photo: Stephen Lam/Getty Images) Read More Apple boss slams EU chiefs for "picking on Ireland" over tax deal Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland on Monday, he added that the Apple tax ruling could spook potential investors. He explained: “Investors crave certainty. They want to know that the tax legislation of member states is what will apply if they invest in those countries. “What the commission has done is put that into question and that you can change the rules.” The government has decided to appeal the EU ruling to keep American companies based here sweet. On Friday, Minister for Finance Michael Noonan said the commission’s ruling was an attack on Ireland’s corporate tax regime. The Cabinet has agreed to appeal the commission’s ruling and Taoiseach Enda Kenny said he makes no apology “whatsoever” for defending the right to appeal. IDA boss Martin Shanahan on CNBC Read More Government and Apple join forces to fight Brussels' claims the iPhone maker owes Ireland €13bn in back tax The Dáil has been recalled to sit on Wednesday to debate the confidential 150-page ruling by the European Commission. Speaking last week, Apple boss Tim Cook said he believed Ireland is being “picked on” by EU bosses. He fumed: “It’s total political crap. They just picked a number from I don’t know where. In the year that the Commission says we paid that tax figure, we actually paid $400m. “We believe that makes us the highest taxpayer in Ireland that year.” Labour’s finance spokesperson Joan Burton has called on the Government to give more information on the Apple ruling to opposition parties, which, she said, is necessary for a proper Dáil debate on the matter.

The 3.5mm socket has been used as the default audio connector on the vast majority of electronic devices - from computers to game consoles - since the 1960s. Now Apple supposedly wants to shake things up by forcing customers to either use headphones that plug into the Lightning port, which is currently used for charging, or wireless headphones, which connect to the iPhone via Bluetooth. Read More When does the iPhone 7 come out? Launch date CONFIRMED for Apple's new smartphone Given that millions of iPhone owners around the world currently use wired headphones, it's a potentially risky move, but one that Apple evidently has confidence in. Leaked iPhone 7 v the iPhone 6 showing removal of the headphone jack (Photo: YouTube/9to5Mac) Read More iPhone 7: Release date, price, leaked pictures, and all the latest news and rumours about Apple's new iPhone Some rumours suggest that Apple is planning to bundle the iPhone 7 with new wired EarPods that use a Lightning connector, while others claim the phone will launch with wireless headphones, or "AirPods" . There has also been some suggestion that the new iPhone will come with a Lightning-to-audio adaptor, so you will still be able to use your regular wired headphones - though these things are easy to lose. While the move may seem like a travesty to anyone who has forked out for expensive headphones in the past, there may be method to Apple's madness.

Lightning connector headphones contain their own amp and DAC, putting the manufacturer in charge of the audio quality. Read More When does the iPhone 7 come out? Launch date CONFIRMED for Apple's new smartphone However, there's little doubt that headphones that plug into the Lightning port would offer significantly better audio quality than wireless ones. The 8-pin Lightning connector can handle more data than Bluetooth, which is what counts when your headphones decode audio signals digitally, according to TechRadar .

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 9:55 PM, September 5, 2016 HANGZHOU, China - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Monday that the United States had to move in concert with other countries on the issue of tax avoidance, as some U.S. allies were "racing to the bottom" with their tax policies. The European Commission said last week that Apple Inc <AAPL.O> owed up to 13 billion euros ($14.50 billion) in back taxes to Ireland, based on existing regulations, a decision that both Apple and Ireland, which relies on low taxes to attract investment, have vowed to fight. The ruling against Apple has pushed the issue into the limelight and raised the risk of significant push-back from the United States, where some lawmakers are saying it represents a European encroachment on the U.S. potential tax base. Obama said he had raised tax avoidance with leaders from the world's 20 biggest economies at the G20 summit in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, but did not mention the Apple case. "We're doing a bunch of stuff at home and we want to coordinate internationally," Obama told reporters at a briefing at the close of the summit. "The one thing that we have to ensure we do is to move in concert with other countries, because there is always a danger that if one ... acts unilaterally, that it's not just a matter of a U.S. company being impacted, but it may also have an impact in terms of our ability to collect taxes from that same company," Obama said. "In the same way, we then have to do some coordination with even some of our closest allies racing to the bottom in terms of how they enforce their tax policies in ways that lead to revenue shifting and tax avoidance in our country." Obama said tackling the issue effectively was important to "regain the trust" of people who feared the system is rigged, but that it would not be fixed overnight. The EU decision against Apple comes amidst a coordinated global initiative to crack down on tax evasion by multinational companies, spearheaded by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Apple's Chief Executive Tim Cook last week described the ruling as "total political crap", but France and Germany have come out to back Brussels on the decision. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Sunday in Hangzhou that the ruling against Apple was clearly based on facts and existing rules and was not a decision aimed against the United States.

Chance Miller - 2 years ago @ChanceHMiller iOS Devices iPhone 6 Apple Reviews hands-on Comments (12) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit LifeProof has become a household name in the iPhone accessory world since debuting its first ultra-protective case in 2011. The company has continued improving its waterproof cases with each new version of the iPhone. With the iPhone 5, LifeProof introduced its Nüüd series, which offers protection from water, snow, dirt, and shock while still exposing the display. We took a look at it last summer, noting that its an excellent choice for the adventurous iPhone user, albeit a bit bulky. It’s still available for $48. With the iPhone 6, Apple presented LifeProof with a new challenge. The large, thin form factor of the iPhone 6 meant that LifeProof would have to work incredibly hard to develop a case that maintained a manageable form factor, while offering the same protection that users of the case have come to expect. We reviewed the LifeProof Fre for the iPhone 6 earlier this year and pointed out that it was a well thought out option, but that the Nüüd model would be very much welcomed. I’ve recently been testing the LifeProof Nüüd case for the iPhone 6. Here’s what you need to know: Key Details: Designed for iPhone 6 Exposed display Protected ports and buttons Water/shock/dirt/snow proof 150.6 mm x 78.5 mm x 11.7 mm Case + iPhone 6 weighs 5.78 ounces Comes in black, white, pink, and blue                 Size The LifeProof Nüüd for the iPhone 6 features an ultra thin design at just 11.7mm. The iPhone 6 without a case is 6.9mm, so there is still a somewhat notable difference between using the device without a case and with the Nüüd. The case comes in at 148.3mm tall, which is 10mm taller than the iPhone 6 without a case and 10mm shorter than the iPhone 6 Plus without a case. The case + iPhone 6 weighs 5.78 ounces, which is 1.23 ounces more than a naked iPhone 6. Using the LifeProof Nüüd as someone who generally does not use any sort of case has been a challenge. When I do use a case, I use a thin, plastic offering such as this one that merely protects my phone from scratches. With that said, I was able to get used to the added size and bulk of the case after a week’s usage. More than anything, it is hard using the device with one hand, which is often a complaint associated with the iPhone 6 to begin with and the added size of the LifeProof Nüüd doesn’t make it easier. Design The design of the LifeProof Nüüd for the iPhone 6 is about as basic as it gets. The case is offered in black, blue, pink, and white. I’ve been using the black one during my testing. The back of the case is transparent, meaning that the Apple logo and branding is still visible through the case. All of the buttons and ports are covered by flaps, while the headphone port is hidden behind an attached screw mechanism. The Touch ID home button is hidden behind a thin piece of plastic, although it’s still functional. As expected, the added water, dirt, shock, and snow proofing of the LifeProof Nüüd means there are design drawbacks. For instance, the mute switch functionality is reversed when you have the case on your device. This means that flipping the switch towards you puts your device on silent, while pushing it away from you turns the sound on. It’s an annoyance at first but an easy adjustment. The Lightning port at the bottom of the iPhone is covered by a plastic guard that easily opens and closes for charging. If you use Apple’s Lightning cable then you shouldn’t have any problem fitting the cable through the case, but third-party cables may run into issues as the cutout is incredibly narrow. Perhaps the most annoying design sacrifice comes with the headphone port. To access the port you have to unscrew the cover, which is attached to the case. In the box with the LifeProof Nüüd is a headphone adapter that allows you to use any headphones you want with the case, because on its own, the port on the case is too small for anything except Apple’s EarPods. For me, this is annoying because I have three different pairs of headphones and an auxiliary cable that I regularly use with my iPhone. I had to constantly remind myself to grab the adapter for the Nüüd if I wanted to be able to listen to music while using the case. I do, however, love the thought that went into attaching the headphone port cover to the case. I greatly enjoy that the screen of my iPhone 6 is still exposed when I use the LifeProof Nüüd. I am not at all a fan of screen protectors, and that was always my primary reason for not using a LifeProof Fre. With the Nüüd, however, the iPhone 6’s full 4.7-inch display is still exposed in its entirety and that’s a huge benefit for the case. (Hence the name: “Nüüd”.) Speaker & Microphone Quality To ensure that the LifeProof Nüüd was totally resistant to a variety of conditions, the company had to protect the speakers, microphone, and cameras of the iPhone. Unfortunately, this means that speaker quality is somewhat muffled. There is a notable difference between listening to something via the iPhone 6 without a LifeProof Nüüd case and with the case. To LifeProof’s credit, the speaker quality has been improved greatly from its iPhone 5/5s versions, but it’s still not perfect. At high volumes, especially when listening to music or watching a video, you’ll certainly hear some crackling of audio. As far as voice calls go, the audio sounds relatively normal for the user with the LifeProof Nüüd case, but the caller on the other end will notice some distortion in voice quality. In my testing, the person I was calling didn’t notice a hindering amount of distortion when I was using the LifeProof Nüüd, but the quality of my voice was clearly poorer than without the case. Resistant to water, dirt, snow, and shock Here’s where the LifeProof Nüüd is truly unique. The case is snow proof, waterproof, dirt proof, and shock proof. The case is IP-68 certified, which means that the case is rated for water immersion to 6.6 feet for 1 hour. The LifeProof Nüüd is also tested to Military Standard 810G-516.6, which ensures that your phone is totally protected from drops. While I didn’t push the limits when it comes to the LifeProof Nüüd’s protection claims, I did put it through some light testing. I used the device in the shower several times, with it being splashed and sprayed with a decent amount of water. When I removed the case, I did not notice droplets of liquid that had seeped through onto the phone itself. I also submerged my iPhone 6 into a bucket of water while using the LifeProof Nüüd and it came out perfectly dry. As for the shock resistant feature, I dropped my device a few times from a moderate height onto my concrete driveway and it emerged without a scratch. Does the added protection make the LifeProof Nüüd worth the sacrifices? I’ve always been skeptical of cases. Especially cases that add unnecessary size and bulk to my iPhone. The difference with the LifeProof Nüüd, however, is that the size and bulk are necessary to make the case as tough as possible. The question is, are the many protection qualities of the LifeProof worth the design trade-offs and sacrifices. For me the answer is yes. There’s no better feeling than not having to worry about babying your iPhone 6 at every moment and the LifeProof Nüüd offers that from the second you put the case on your phone. You no longer have to fear that your phone could fall out of your pocket at any given time and lose the pristine design that everyone loves so much. Of course there are drawbacks to the using the LifeProof Nüüd for the iPhone 6, but if you value the benefit of protection from the elements they are worth it. The LifeProof Nüüd for iPhone 6 is available directly from the company for $89.99 and on Amazon for slightly less.

I DON”T WANT MY SCREEN SCRATCHED LikeLike davidvb77 - 2 years ago Reply WHY would you even upgrade to an iPhone 6 if you’re going to this with it!? What a horrific case…. LikeLiked by 1 person thewaterboy2015 - 2 years ago Reply God who are the idiots we have commenting on here now. The screen is still scratch resistant due to a protective film applied to the screen. And why upgrade to iPhone 6 and use this case ?? Maybe because you would want a larger screen and also happen to venture outside of your home/parents basement every once in a while. Say on a boat or the beach. LikeLiked by 1 person thewaterboy2015 - 2 years ago Reply This case is perfect for the outdoor enthusiast. I use it on my iPhone 6 plus and it’s half the size of Otterbox defender series which isn’t even waterproof. Way to go on another great case Lifeproof LikeLike sandy (@uuhm60) - 2 years ago Reply I purchased a lifeproof case for my 6 plus and had to return it, it was too muffled. Ended up with an otterbox. LikeLike Mike Wëwerka (@mikewewerka) - 2 years ago Reply I received a free Lifeproof Nuud case for my iPhone 6 Plus from Lifeproof as part of their ambassador program (I’m a photographer), unfortunately for me, I had to ditch the case. The sound quality of incoming calls was abysmal and people I spoke with, said I sounded far away in a tin can. I called Lifeproof about this issue and they told me to just take the case off and blow off the membrane near the bottom mic, that was the only known fix. That didn’t “fix” it at all. While I loved the protection it offered, it was just impractical to have a case that prevents me from using it as a phone. I love the Nuud case on my iPad Mini Retina, but when you need to hear people/vice versa, it’s terrible. LikeLike jsmallz - 2 years ago Reply Maybe they should just provide a decent bluetooth ear piece to go with it for the price? LikeLike degraevesofie - 2 years ago Reply I don’t usually use a case, but when we go to the beach I do. I think our Tethys case (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NTH146A/ ) is similar to this one, but costs only a fraction of the price. (It certainly works well to keep sand and the occasional liquid splash from damaging the device. It’s supposedly waterproof to 8ft depth, but we didn’t feel the need to test that claim.) LikeLike Mahesh Sanga - 2 years ago Reply I bought this recently the thing here you need to note is you do not have direct access to the headphones socket, you need to connect another converter which is so ridiculos imagine you are walking and you want to connect your headphones you need to pray god to connect to this safely with out making your phone fell down… also what if you lost the earphones converter which comes by this lifeproof case? you should buy another one again… I can give 2 out of 5 rating for this IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY because of not having direct access to the earphones port.. If you want to buy trouble but this like me.. I went to the shop to return this but they didn’t take it back, so I am going to through this in garbage and buy a nice flip case… LikeLike Carrie Vinson David - 2 years ago Reply I upgraded from 4s to the 6 a few days ago. My husband said, “Welcome to 2014, honey!” LOL. I obviously don’t usually go for the latest and greatest. I really liked my Lifeproof case for the 4s. I was willing to sacrifice a little sound quality and headphone accessibility for thee protection it offered. I like the look and sleek design of the Nuud and was excited about it. Unfortunately, I am probably returning it today. I am very frustrated with the voice quality. It often sounds almost like the caller is speaking through a kazoo. I guess that makes sense since the sound has to pass through a thin plastic membrane. The design was similar on the 4s but this kazoo voice didn’t happen. Maybe the plastic was thicker?? Also, several times while I have been in a conversation, there was a VERY loud reverb ringing that both parties can hear. Even people across the room from me said, “Is that coming from your phone??!!” Wow! I’m just hoping the Fre will be better because I really want the protection from water as well as dropping since I’m clumsy and like taking pictures of my children by the pool and at the beach. LikeLike Zach Brown - 1 year ago Reply Literally worst case I have ever had, first the case broke so they sent me a new one. Then, after I put the new one on, i dropped my phone on concrete from at least 3 feet and the screen shattered with the screen protector on. So after a long conversation with life proof, they only sent me a new case again. So after going to a local certified iPhone repair, and having my phone fixed for $167, i figured it would not break again and it was just a fault in the previous case, turns out a week later, it fell again, and screen shattered again. Personally, I think I would better off buying a cheap $10 case off Amazon. LikeLike Daniel Resnik - 4 months ago Reply Funny how there are no new posts for over a year. My only complaint is that when you swipe up from the bottom nothing happens 99% of the time. I must swipe from 20 to 100 times before it will work. It is extremely annoying.

Apple rolls out its new, personalized playlists to Apple Music subscribers on iOS, macOS betas Posted Sep 5, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Snapchat joins the Bluetooth SIG, fueling hardware speculation Ahead of Apple’s iPhone event on September 7th, the company has begun rolling out new, personalized music playlists to Apple Music subscribers, who are beta testing the soon-to-be-released iOS 10 mobile operating system and macOS Sierra. Originally introduced at this year’s Worldwide Developers Conference in June, Apple Music’s new playlists are a direct challenge to Spotify, whose “Discover Weekly” playlist is so popular it saw 40 million users in its first year. Apple, meanwhile, is taking on “Discover Weekly” with its “My New Music Mix” playlist, which is updated every Friday with new tunes. This playlist was called “Discovery Mix” when it was shown off at WWDC but, given the rebranding, it seems Apple decided its name was too similar to Spotify’s mix. img_6629 img_6630  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit “My New Music Mix” is found in the “For You” section of the Music app, and currently offers 25 tracks selected based on your listening history. The idea here is to expose Apple Music subscribers to more of the sort of songs and artists you would like, based on those you like to play – effectively, the same concept as Spotify’s “Discover Weekly.” The real question will be which service has the better algorithm? That remains to be seen, as the Apple Music feature only just rolled out this weekend, and no one has had enough time to test it, just yet. Alongside “My New Music Mix,” Apple Music subscribers on iOS 10 are also seeing the addition of another playlist called “My Favorites Mix,” which updates every Wednesday. This one includes both songs you love “and more,” says Apple, in its description. The “and more” here refers to the fact that the new playlist will use your most-loved tracks as the basis for adding more songs that match those you already like. This offers a different sort of twist on new music discovery, as it subtly mixes in new music with some of your favorite tunes. As with Spotify, Apple Music customers can subscribe to either playlists and configure them to automatically download the new tracks as they arrive. The two new playlists are now showing up in the Apple Music app on iOS 10 beta, as well as in iTunes 12.5 on macOS Sierra. The addition of the playlists is part of a larger makeover for Apple Music, which was criticized for being a bit cluttered in its original design. At WWDC, the company unveiled Apple Music’s new look, which included dropping its social networking attempt dubbed “Connect” from the bottom navigation tabs, and placing users’ libraries in the front-and-center of the application, among other things. Despite the issues with the earlier layout, Apple Music has presented a formidable challenge to Spotify, just by its nature of being built into Apple’s OS. The company revealed in June it has already reached 15 million paid subscribers. Spotify is still ahead with 30 million paying customers, and 100 million listeners, however. But a revamped Apple Music which comes with better music discovery features could pose a threat.

Microsoft and its supporters argue the very future of mobile and cloud computing is at stake if customers can’t trust that their data will remain private. A group of 11 technology firms including Google said on Friday in its court filing that the federal law allowing the searches goes “far beyond any necessary limits” while infringing users’ fundamental rights. “The government’s ability to engage in surreptitious searches of homes and tangible things is practically and legally limited,” the companies said in the filing. “But the act allows the government to search personal data stored in the cloud without ever notifying an account owner that her data has been searched.” Delta Air Lines and BP America along with the US Chamber of Commerce and other businesses also asked to join the case in support of Microsoft, saying the benefits of cloud computing won’t be realised if privacy rights aren’t protected against government surveillance. Those companies, some of which are Microsoft customers, include Eli Lilly & Company and GlaxoSmithKline. Twitter also sought to join the fray. The Justice Department, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and their backers, defend the searches, saying they need digital tools to help fight increasingly sophisticated criminals and terrorists who are savvy at using technology to communicate and hide their tracks. Mark Abueg, a Justice Department spokesman, didn’t immediately respond to a call seeking comment on the filings supporting Microsoft and whether the government was expecting any on its behalf. The government said in its response to the lawsuit in July that Microsoft doesn’t have the authority to sue over whether its users’ constitutional protections against unlawful search and seizure are being violated. It argues the company has asked the court to rule on thousands of cases related to the dispute without considering the individual basis for each one. Endpoint ‘unclear’ Apple said in its filing that the frequency and volume of the government’s use of the gag orders are “virtually unlimited in practice because their endpoint is unclear”. In 2016, Apple said it has received almost 600 gag orders. Fox News Network, the Associated Press and 27 other news organisations asked in a separate filing on Friday to join the case, saying restraints on disclosing warrants to email users violate free-speech rights. The American Civil Liberties Union, along with privacy groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, are also seeking to file so-called friend-of-the-court briefs in support of Microsoft. “It’s not every day that Fox News and the ACLU are on the same side of an issue,” Brad Smith, Microsoft’s chief legal officer, said in an emailed statement. “We believe the constitutional rights at stake in this case are of fundamental importance, and people should know when the government accesses their emails unless secrecy is truly needed.” Microsoft has been fighting the US over customer privacy and clandestine disclosures to investigators for more than two years. In July, the software maker persuaded an appeals court to overturn an order to hand over e-mails stored on servers in Ireland as part of a Manhattan drug prosecution. Government warrants In the case before a federal judge in Seattle, Microsoft calls the 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act unconstitutional, citing its own First Amendment free speech rights and its customers’ Fourth Amendment right to know whether the government has searched or seized their property. Those very laws allow the US to obtain electronic communications with a warrant and secrecy order if it would endanger their case or a person, the government contends. Global trust in U.S. surveillance has waned since the disclosures of former CIA employee and security contractor Edward Snowden, to the point that companies now have to make overtures to consumers about their interest and ability to keep content secure, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Matt Larson. “Microsoft wants to be able able to tell its customers that these types of proceedings are going on to protect their privacy,” Larson said. “The end game for Microsoft here is to at least have the DOJ revisit its procedures when pursuing these warrants.” Microsoft alleges that in the 18 months leading up to the April complaint, it received more than 5 600 federal demands for customer data, about 2 600 of which were accompanied by secrecy orders that prevent Microsoft from disclosing searches to the affected customers. Microsoft’s supporters include four former US attorneys in Washington state and a former special agent in charge of the FBI’s Seattle office. They contend that secret searches are unconstitutional because “obtaining a warrant, but not disclosing it, nullifies an essential function of the warrant, which is to provide notice to the person who is the target of the search”. The case is Microsoft Corporation vs US Department of Justice, 16-cv-00538, US District Court, Western District of Washington (Seattle).

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion Apple Watch 2 Release Date, Leaks and Updates: GPS and Water Proofing Included? Price Details and Features By Christian Ver Marcelo Sep 4, 2016 | 11:50 PM The iPhone 7 will not be the only Apple product we will be seeing on September 7. With the emergence of smartwatches and its steady rise in the mobile tech field, the Apple Watch 2 wants to step up its predecessor's game by integrating new innovations for the end buyers. Display and Design The biggest rumor perhaps regarding the upgraded display of the Apple Watch 2 is with its usage of Micro LED technology. Last year's iteration used an OLED panel, similar to its Samsung competitor. However, the new Micro LED screen would offer broader colors and more brightness, making it more efficient performance and battery-wise. The Apple Watch 2 is also said to be 40 percent thinner than its predecessor. Aside from this, Apple would still be offering the same shape, sizes, and variants of the smartwatch. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit GPS and Barometer Last year's Apple Watch model did not have GPS features. The lack of a GPS chipset was received with an outrage as it was deemed essential, especially for fitness tracking. Tethering the smartwatch to an iPhone, which is then connected to GPS, initially solved this. This entails a lot of hassle to the users as carrying a separate device while doing physical activities pose some safety issues. However, cellular connectivity may be the factor hindering the Apple Watch iterations from having a GPS connection. If the new cellular technology gets finalized before the release of Apple Watch 2, then maybe GPS support would be possible, a report said. A barometer sensor is also expected, as it would perform the basic function of measuring atmospheric pressure. This would work hand-in-hand with the GPS radio for a more accurate geolocation tagging. Waterproofing This seems like an obvious choice for an upgrade, given the device's nature and the new iPhones getting waterproofed. While the current Apple Watch is water resistant, it could only stand dips through water and some running water pressure. The IPx7 of the new iPhones, or even an IP-68 rating of Samsung's Gear S3, is expected to be incorporated in the new smartwatch. Smartwatch competitors such as Pebble, Misfit, and Withings already offer devices users can take swimming for prolonged periods of time. Power The new Apple Watch 2 is expected to come with an ARM Cortex A32 chipset. This processor would be 25 percent faster than the current offering of Cortex A7. It would also be more battery efficient, balancing performance and power with battery life. Apple is also reportedly working on an extended battery life. With the current 42mm variant packing 250 mAh and the 38mm sporting a 205 mAh one, we should be expecting bigger capacities for the Apple Watch 2. Third-party straps with built-in battery packs would also be supported. Price The original Apple Watch base model was unveiled with a $349 price tag. Due to low market reception, it was cut to $299 shortly after the release. The Apple Watch 2 is predicted to come out on September 7 with the same $349 price point given its upgraded specs.

Both Lenovo and Apple packed powerful specs and a slew of unique features in the devices.  ( Lenovo ) Advertisement Lenovo's Yoga Book has brought to life some pretty futuristic looking technologies, but the gadget might see fierce competition from the purported 2016 MacBook Air. We took the info we have about the two devices and pitted them one against another so you know what to expect. Display Yoga Book does not break ground with its screen, which sports a Full HD resolution of 1,920 x 1,200p. In all fairness, the IPS touchscreen display of 10.1 inches could be better, as brightness only reaches 400 nits and the screen can cover a color gamut of 70 percent. Lenovo's challenger, the rumored MacBook Air from 2016, is said to come packing a Retina Display. The present model packs a 13.3-inch screen able of displaying resolutions of 1,440 x 900p. Insiders say that the upcoming variant of the MacBook Air should have an LED-backlit monitor with a resolution of 2,304 x 1,440p. Hardware The Yoga Book managed to holster a number of powerful specs in a very thin laptop, with a noteworthy 10 millimeters of thickness. This means the 2-in-1 will follow the steps of the MacBook Air 2016, which sources say could be even thinner. Both devices are sturdy and resistant to shocks, despite their thin and elegant construction. What is more, the MacBook Air could pack the next iteration of solid state drive, meaning that it will pack Fusion Drive hybrid support. This will make Apple's laptop superior to Lenovo's gadget, which only holsters a 64 GB storage option, albeit expandable with a microSD card. Taking a leaf out of the latest MacBook design, this year's MacBook Air will feature the good for all USB Type-C port. Meanwhile, the Yoga Book comes with a microUSB port, a headphone jack and a mini-HDMI. Looking at processing power, the MacBook Air 2016 might overapass the Yoga Book. Apple's device is rumored to sport the Intel Skylake i5 CPU, which benchmarked higher than the Intel X5 processor found in Lenovo's laptop. Both devices rely on 4 GB of RAM to back the processing power, but the MacBook Air could offer the possibility for extra RAM. One thing to keep in mind is that the Lenovo Yoga Book can easily transform into a tablet in its own right by rotating the monitor 360 degrees. Unique Features One area where Lenovo stepped into the future is its touch keyboard, dubbed the Halo keyboard. Lenovo turned the standard keyboard into a flat, LED-backlit blank surface slate with matte finish. The surface acts pretty much like a tablet, and some insiders from Apple touted that the MacBook Air 2016 could also feature a similar asset. A neat addition to the Yoga Book is the ability to use the keyboard slate as a drawing/writing surface for the stylus. With a full 2,048 pressure levels and a maximum of 100 degrees of angle, the slate is clearly targeted toward creative users. Keep in mind that if you use the pen to take notes on normal paper, the content can get transferred to the Yoga Book. Software On the software side of things, you should know that Apple will embed the latest laptop OS in the MacBook Air 2016, so users who are used to El Capitan will make a move toward macOS Sierra in this year's laptop. Meanwhile, the Yoga Book offers users two options, so whether you prefer Windows 10 or Android Marshmallow is entirely up to you.

Home Industry Technology As smartphone wars rage on, here’s how iOS 10 fares against Android Nougat 7 As smartphone wars rage on, here’s how iOS 10 fares against Android Nougat 7 With the launch of several new high-end smartphones including tech giants like Apple and Samsung, the virtual war has reached very interesting times. By: Sumit Chakraborty | Published: September 5, 2016 5:23 PM The question arises whether there are any differences between Android Nougat and Apple iOS 10 and whether one of them can overtake the other at least for a year. (Source: Reuters) With the launch of several new high-end smartphones including tech giants like Apple and Samsung, the virtual war has reached  very interesting times. Apple and Google’s major operating systems – Android and iOS are fighting it out as well. On September 7, Apple is most likely to launch its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. According to reports, there have been key changes in the camera and power among other things. The final versions of iOS 10 and Android Nougat 7 are not out yet, but their beta versions have made their way into the market. There is much official information by developers on the features and reviews. It is interesting to note that both the platforms have borrowed features from each other and are eventually becoming more similar than ever before. Apart from the platform’s fragmented nature, the update cycles look to be a bit problematic for most parts of the Android Nougat, added with the fact that often only new handsets can receive the updates leaving out most old phones. The problem occurs as the Google’s platform is used by other manufacturers, and they in order to sell new hardware neglect the previous versions of smartphones in a vast majority. Consumers generally have to update their hardware each year. Apple, with its top-down management, has complete control of both its hardware and software. The adoption of latest iOS is very high as the updates are available as soon as it arrives in the market. Now the question arises whether there are any differences between in other aspects so that one of them can overtake another at least for a year. Here are a few differences found in the beta version: Operating system updates: Android has long been untethered from its stock applications and has been implementing the updates faster than iOS. This helps because Google doesn’t have to update every default apps each time the main OS is updated, which makes it quicker. But now iOS has made it possible to delete the stock apps, and it may help Apple to push in faster updates. User Interface: Bothe iOS and Android have long been trying to reach various aspects of each other when it comes to user interface. They have been vying to achieve similar aesthetics of design as one another. For starters, this year Android has redesigned its user interface, and the most notable feature is its minimalistic borders. The icons occupy the width of the screen along with smaller fonts. It will be safe to say the Android looks more like iOS this year. iOS too is not far behind, by using the 3D Touch and implementing widgets to the home screen, it has tried to go the Android way here as well. Operating system updates: Android has long been untethered from its stock applications and has been implementing the updates faster than iOS. This helps because Google doesn’t have to update every default apps each time the main OS is updated, which makes it quicker. But now iOS has made it possible to delete the stock apps, and it may help Apple to push in faster updates. Stock applications and Delete Now, its is possible in both iOS 10 and Nougat to delete stock apps. But what the feature does is, it just hides the app instead of deleting it from the device, and that too not all. photo app iOS 10 now offers a feature which Google has been providing to its users for a year. It uses machine learning and identifies places and people in the image and users can use it to search as well. Like, if one searches for ‘mountains’ the app with automatically return with images features mountains. The app also creates slideshows with the user’s best images. Hence when it comes to this feature, both of them are going neck to neck. Music applications: Although Apple has revamped its Music app in iOS 10 with a more simplified navigation and user interface, yet Android has better options. While Apple offers a good streaming option, Google goes one up for its music fans by giving an app which along with streaming also allows the user to store and play music. Personal assistants Siri and Google Now: According to reports, Apple has massively improved upon its virtual personal assistant Siri. Siri has better  features, and although late, has allowed developers all over the world to provide suggestions with an aim to improve the build. It will be a tough task to compete with Google’s algorithms, in its Google Now, yet the competition can get interesting.

According to reports on the beta versions by developers, iOS 10 appears to have more features and improvements than its Android counterpart. But when it comes as a whole the OSes are more similar than ever before. Apple firstly needs to catch up with Android in its personal assistant department with Siri, especially since it will be used in many other devices. With Artificial Intelligence being the next big thing in the world of technology, both the platforms will try to capture that area with as much aggression as they can.

The 12-month gift cards work out at $8.25 per month, offering an 18 percent saving over the standard $9.99 monthly subscription rate for Apple's streaming service. Currently the gift cards are being offered at brick-and-mortar Apple stores and select third-party sellers like Best Buy, but eGift cards can also be purchased online at PayPal and Walmart for instant activation. Elsewhere, residents in the U.K. can use PayPal's online eGift shop to buy 12-month Apple Music gift cards for £99, which works out at £8.25 instead of £9.99, for those willing to sign up for a full year. Apple still offers eligible students 50 percent off an Apple Music subscription, while the family plan lets up to six people pay $15 per month, or $2.50 each. The new Apple Music, which has seen a significant redesign in iOS 10, will launch to the public this fall. (Via 9to5Mac) Tag: Apple Music 65 comments Top Rated Comments (View all) landroverz7 17 weeks ago I love that you can pay for Apple Music using iTunes credit. Currently paying $14.40 AUD a month family plan here in Australia because iTunes gift cards are always 20% off down here in Oz ;) Rating: 8 Votes tasset 17 weeks ago I would like to know too if this gift card can be used to fully pay or somewhat finance part if the family plan... Yes it can (or apps for that matter), they do not earmark the credit for music-only. To that end this is nothing more than a discounted iTunes gift card, just with a psychologically creative spin by the marketing team. I wait for other promos or holiday events to stock up on iTunes credit for 60-80 cents on the dollar. Rating: 4 Votes newyorkone 17 weeks ago I always get Apple gift cards around the Holidays. Best deals in past years were $100 for $75, and you can easily find $100 for $80. I re-load my iTunes account for the year, and Apple Music automatically deducts from there. So I'm essentially getting my family plan at 20-25% off. Rating: 4 Votes Brookzy 17 weeks ago iTunes Gift Cards can be used as Apple Music payment, so can these similarly be used for iTunes? Wondering if it's a way to get £119.88 worth of iTunes credit for £99!

I wish, more like 70% of the music ever recorded with a bias towards the mainstream. Oh, also I hope you like tracks/albums randomly disappearing from your library due to legal rights expiring; no notification no nothing, just the pleasant surprise of finding out just when you want it. Just not worth the hassle right now, maybe in 10 years it'll be good (same goes for all streaming services). Rating: 3 Votes Tuci 17 weeks ago Streaming music. Great for commuters but a killer when there is airplane, roaming or PLOPS on your schedule. You can download you know. Rating: 3 Votes jayducharme 17 weeks ago Hmmm ... Apple is making Music more tempting.... I'm still not keen on the fact that I don't "own" any of the music. But at the lower price, it's a bit easier to swallow financially.

No surprise there really. Rating: 2 Votes OllyW 17 weeks ago Did not realise the UK pricing was converted exactly from dollars to pounds without conversion! Means the UK pricing works out at $13.38 per month. No surprise there really. $9.99 is £7.50 at today's exchange rate which is £9.00 including VAT, so it's £1 a month more expensive here. Spotify and Tidal costs exactly the same as Apple so I'm guessing it's the UK music industry which is setting the price.

I’m lucky enough to get my tech support from JK Scheinberg, the engineer at Apple who led the effort that moved the Mac to Intel processors. A little restless after retiring in 2008, at 54, he figured he’d be a great fit for a position at an Apple store Genius Bar, despite being twice as old as anyone else at the group interview. “On the way out, all three of the interviewers singled me out and said, ‘We’ll be in touch,’ ” he said. “I never heard back.” I wonder whether they read his CV or Googled him … ? Scheinberg worked on the Intel conversion privately in his home office. When he was able to demo it running on a Sony Vaio, Steve Jobs rushed off to Sony to offer it to them, the company originally aiming to take the route of allowing other companies to license the OS. Sony turned him down. Via Business Insider Guides Apple View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

According to a report by BBC, the decision follows reports from the United States and South Korea of the phone exploding or catching fire, during or after charging. The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 was only just released two weeks ago, on August 19. According to Samsung, as of the time the recall was issued, only 35 reports of exploding batteries had been reported worldwide, but they had confirmed “a battery cell issue” leading to the recall. “… we are currently conducting a thorough inspection with our suppliers to identify possible affected batteries in the market. However, because our customers’ safety is an absolute priority at Samsung, we have stopped sales of the Galaxy Note7.” Samsung also indicated that they would voluntarily replace existing devices “with a new one over the coming weeks.” As CNN notes, that’s over 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7s. The recall comes just one week before Apple is expected to present its new iPhone, and may represent a significant stumbling block for Samsung, Apple’s main competitor. Samsung posted significant record earnings in the past quarter, and the Galaxy Note 7 was very well-received by critics — but for many, having to return their new device and wait until Samsung issues a new one may prove to be too much of a hassle, especially if Apple is unveiling a shiny new iPhone at the height of their frustration. The Galaxy Note 7 was only unveiled as of one month ago today. [Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images]Prior to the recall, Samsung had predicted that demand for their phones and tablets would continue to increase throughout the remainder of the year. Now, it’s anyone’s guess, but their stock has only seen a minor dip since the recall announcement was made. Several images and videos of fire-damaged Note 7s have already shown up on social media. YouTube user Ariel Gonzalez shared a video of his fire-damaged phone, alleging that the device had “caught fire” shortly after being unplugged from the charger. “Came home from work, put it to charge for a little bit before I had class, and, went to put it on my waist, and, it caught fire.” Users on Kakao Story, a South Korean social media site, also shared images and stories of burnt Note 7s. “There was another explosion of the Galaxy Note 7. It was my friend’s phone. A Samsung employee checked the site and he is currently in talks over the compensation with Samsung. You should use its original charger just in case and leave the phone far away from where you are while charging.” More images of burnt Note 7s were circulated on Chinese social media site (and rough Twitter equivalent) Baidu. [Image via Baidu/ user 倪先生666666]According to the Chinese man whose Galaxy Note 7 exploded, it had been plugged in overnight when he heard a “sudden bang.” Upon investigating, he found his device literally in flames. And while there were no injuries or serious damage to anything but the phone, there easily could have been; it’s a scary thought that it could just as easily been sitting on the bed next to him while he slept. Meanwhile, Samsung has indicated that their preparations for the recall should take about two weeks. In the meantime, if you already have a Samsung Galaxy Note 7, it might be best to leave it unplugged and away from anything flammable. “… our customers’ safety is an absolute priority at Samsung.” “We acknowledge the inconvenience this may cause in the market but this is to ensure that Samsung continues to deliver the highest quality products to our customers. We are working closely with our partners to ensure the replacement experience is as convenient and efficient as possible.” [Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images] Now Read This: CES 2017: Dell And Samsung Will Introduce New Groundbreaking Products Share 494 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Don Crothers Tags: Galaxy Note 7, recall, samsung January 2, 2017 Irish Investigator Senan Molony Claims Titanic Fire Weakened Hull, Resulting In Fateful 1912 Sinking January 2, 2017 ‘Gasolinazo’: Mexico Gas Prices Spike 20 Percent On Deregulation View full timeline 2 hours ago Samsung Galaxy S8 Leak Teases Continuum Feature For Next Flagship: Android/Chrome OS Hybrid On The Way? 21 hours ago Apple 2017 Predictions: Steve Jobs Helps iPhone 8 Sales, Stock Prices Comments LATEST HEADLINES Camila Cabello Gets The Last Laugh As She Thanks 2016 Melbourne Polluted Beaches: Australia Officials Facing Stinky Situation, Warn Public Of Fecal Matter Incursion The Chicago Bears Should Target These Three Players In The Offseason Trump’s New Year: Parties With Friends, Tweets Enemies Mark Hamill Writes Touching Tribute To His Friend Carrie Fisher Boy George Slammed For Mocking Bisexuals On Social Media WWE News: Alberto Del Rio Arrested After Fight In Austria Hillary Clinton’s Loss In The Election Was Imminent When She Canceled The Fireworks Show, Donald Trump Says Supreme Court Showdown: How President Obama Could Still Fill That Vacant Seat To Thwart Trump ‘The Walking Dead’ Ratings Cause Red Alerts With AMC Stocks Never miss a story get the latest viral news to your inbox Delivered To Your INBOX Never miss a story get the latest viral news to your inbox Email Address Or follow us online Facebook Twitter Google-plus Rss Follow Inquisitr Trending Stories Julian Assange Has Confirmed That The U.S. Government Is Lying To The American People About Russia 34k 0 0 2NE1: YG Entertainment K-Pop Girl Group Confirmed To Disband, CL And Dara Re-Signed To Label As Soloists 37.1k 0 0 Win An iPhone 7 From ‘The Inquisitr’ 52 0 0 Theo James Not Engaged To Girlfriend Ruth Kearney, Shailene Woodley And ‘Underworld’ Actor Say Goodbye To ‘Divergent’ Movies 2.6k 0 0 Delayed Kindergarten Enrollment Dramatically Reduces ADHD In Children, Study Shows 374.7k 0 0 Bernie Sanders Tells Trump ‘Keep Your Promises’, Don’t Cut Social Security Or Medicare 2.3k 0 0 Entertainment Celebrity News TV Famous Relationships Movie Trailers Movies Music Online Videos Rumors Lifestyle Shopping Travel Fashion Food & Dining Geek Culture Parenting Religion Health Health Studies Medicine Nutrition News Politics Animal News Education Green News Media Industry Odd News World South America Africa Asia Australia News Canada Europe Middle East Odd News Pics Opinion Sports Baseball Basketball Boxing Football Golf Hockey MMA NASCAR Soccer Tennis Science Discoveries Space Theories Technology Automotive Green Tech Gadgets Mobile Gaming Business Social Media Start-up BuzzWorthy Info About Advertising Write for Inquisitr Privacy Policy Contact News Partners Opposing Views Huffington Post Fark Buzz Feed Supported By DoubleClick Google Adsense Softlayer Connect Facebook Twitter Delivered To Your INBOX Never miss a story get the latest viral news to your inbox Email Address All content © 2008 - 2017 The Inquisitr News.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion iPhone 7 News, Rumors and Release Date: Analyst Weighs In on Features; 2.4GHz Chipset and 12-Megapixel Sensors? By Christian Ver Marcelo Sep 4, 2016 | 10:24 PM The big reveal is coming. On September 7, Apple will be unveiling a new lineup for its most anticipated products, the iPhone 7. With so much hype built up around these devices, tech bloggers, fans, and even analysts are already weighing in on what to expect from the new smartphones. Performance KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts the internal specs of the iPhone 7 based on the rumors and feasible possibilities. For the performance, it is widely known that the iPhone 7 lineup will be packing the new A10 chipset. Developed and manufactured by Apple itself, the A10 will most likely have its CPU clock set at 2.4GHz. This is predicted to be its raw power, but then a lower clock speed should be welcomed to prevent overheating, inefficient power management and consumption, and unmanageable performance. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit For the RAM, the base model of iPhone 7 is said to remain the same, at 2GB. The iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7 Pro, on the other hand, may be packing 3GB in its might. On paper, these numbers are relatively low in comparison to the competition. However, users must also consider the fact that the A10 chipset and the iOS 10 are all designed for minimal memory consumption, allowing for a more efficient and fluid overall performance. Dual Camera Setup The bump in both processing power and RAM in the higher-end models are mostly likely implemented to support the dual lens camera setup. This new setup entails the usage of two different sensors with 12 megapixels each up its sleeve, geared to different optic technologies. The first snapper would have relatively larger pixels on a 6-element lens with a wide-angle focal range. This shooter would also have Optical Image Stabilization. The second one will integrate a 5-element lens with a tighter focal range. The dual-lens camera setup will be available only to the iPhone 7 Pro (if it will be available to the iPhone 7 Plus is still unconfirmed). The base model of iPhone 7 will come with a singular 12-megapixel camera. However, a 4-LED flash technology will come with the cameras on all models. Storage, Headphone Jack, and Other Changes As previously reported, the new iPhones will come in three storage options. The new standard storage offering would now be 32GB, with all models seemingly giving double the capacity of previous iterations. The 128GB and 256GB versions would then accompany the base model. Pricing would pretty much stay the same for all models as with previous iterations. The headphone jack rumor has seemingly become all too real, as different reports seem to support it already. However, Lightning EarPods and a Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter will come bundled with the phones. The Home Button would no longer be clickable. It will now be flush along the bottom bezel, with pressure sensitivity so pressing and tapping would be the new interaction method. The waterproof rating would also be at IPx7 certification, meaning that the device could be submerged in a meter of water up to half an hour. Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7.

WIRED runs down what may be coming next.

Since the iPhone 5 launch, in 2012, the company has revealed its latest iPhone in September. This year the iPhone event could be all about what the company is taking away from the phone, rather than what it is adding. One of the biggest changes that will affect the phone's usability is the reported dropping of the headphone jack. According to Eurogamer, Apple accidentally confirmed this on their website, posting an image of the bottom of an iPhone 7 with the headphone jack gone. The mistake was quickly corrected by the firm, but its all but certain now that Apple will be ditching the 3.5 headphone port in favour of Lightning-connected audio devices. This would mean the iPhone would not be compatible with the vast majority of headphones currently existing. Apparent leaks have shown new headphones from Apple, which have a Lightning cable connector. Read more Apple is uncharacteristically opening up its artificial intelligence, but how smart is it? Apple is uncharacteristically opening up its artificial intelligence, but how smart is it? By James Temperton The other option for users will be Bluetooth headphones. Apple, which owns Beats, could also be releasing new wireless Beats or its own, branded wireless headphone buds. The iPhone 7's home button is also rumoured to be getting the chop. The physical button is said to have been converted to use Force Touch. This is likely to mean the area where the home button currently sits will be flush and will be activated by sensing how hard the user is pressing the area. Current iPhone screens, and some MacBooks, have Force Touch built into them. To convert this to the home button, Apple will have to develop technology that allows Force Touch to also sense fingerprints – which can be used to unlock the iPhone. It is also said the iPhone will be waterproof to a IPX7 standard, the same as the Apple Watch and finally catching up with rival Samsung. It's likely there will be other improvements to the screen, these could range from a screen that runs from edge to edge, to an OLED instead of an LCD one.

A dark black and a 'piano' version are said to be being added to the 'rose gold,' gold, and silver models. Other rumours have suggested a blue version of the iPhone 7. Elsewhere, reliable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, has published some apparent specifications about the new flagship Apple device. Kuo says Apple will finally drop the lower 16GB storage version of the phone: favouring 32, 128 and 256GB versions. This was also previously reported by the Wall Street Journal. A future iPhone 7S could additionally have 3GB of RAM. A larger iPhone 7 Plus, said to have a 5.5inch screen, is also likely to have dual rear cameras. According to Kuo, there will be a wide-angle camera and a telephoto camera, which are said to both have 12MP sensors. The Apple Watch 2? While a new iPhone is almost certain, an update to Apple's key wearable is less so. Since the Apple Watch was unveiled in 2014, the offerings from competitors has moved on hugely – Samsung just unveiled its Gear S3 smartwatch, for example. Rumours of new Apple Watch hardware have been circling for a number of years but this Apple event could be the one where the company reveals a new device. In June, the company launched WatchOS 3 for the device and a number of new straps. The operating system update is significant though as often, as with the iPhone, new OS' appear ahead of a new device. MacRumours has reported a new watch could have a bigger screen than the original device and also be slightly thinner than the previous device. In a Bloomberg report it is stated the biggest update to the new Watch will be GPS-based location tracking. This would allow for greater location tracking that doesn't rely on being connected to an iPhone – effectively it would make the watch useful as a sports tracking tool. However, Bloomberg reported Apple had failed to make the watch available to connect to mobile phone networks, which has been called for by carriers. ADVERTISEMENT Meanwhile Kuo said a new Apple Watch will also have a barometer and a cheaper price. Several more things... The latest iPhone will garner most of the attention from the Apple event but for hardcore Apple fans there could be something even more eagerly awaited – a new MacBook Pro. The company hasn't updated the high-end laptop since May 2015. 9to5 Mac has reported the company will launch a new MacBook Pro with a bigger battery; thinner casing; Touch ID; and an OLED screen. Other reports have also said the trackpad will be able to be used with a stylus. There are also reports the iPad Pro will be updated as well as the launch of a 5K iMac.

Although Digitimes makes often unreliable claims, it is more accurate with supply chain reporting like this one. The report says Apple has boosted production for iPhone 7 components by about 10%. A reason for the spike in production is not given but it implies Apple is more confident about iPhone 7 sales this year than it was initially. Apple regularly changes production plans so its always hard to triangulate a trend but investors are anxious to see customer reception to Apple’s new flagships with many labelling the rumors about the upcoming iPhone as ‘boring’ given the device’s external appearance will not drastically change. The iPhone 7 will feature a design close to the iPhone 6s but will feature sleeker antenna lines and lack a headphone jack. Apple will rely on . A report from analyst KGI detailed many of the expected new features in a weekend report, including the radical new ‘dual camera’ rumored for the larger iPhone 7 Plus. The iPhone 7 is also expected to debut in two new colors, with Space Grey being replaced by a darker grey finish as well as the addition of a new glossy ‘piano’ black color. Of course, we’ll know for sure on Wednesday when Apple unveils the iPhone 7 for real. Stay tuned to 9to5Mac for comprehensive coverage of all the announcements!

What other country in the world, when offered a financial windfall equivalent to 20 per cent of its government revenue, would angrily turn it down? Yet that is what Ireland did last week when a fairy godmother, in the shape of Margrethe Vestager, the ultra-ambitious head of the European Union’s competitive watchdog, insisted it accept €13 billion (Dh53.3bn) – €20bn including interest – from Apple for underpayment of past taxes. Lesser countries might have pocketed it and used it to pay down debts of €200bn, or get back some of the €64bn it spent bailing out its banks in 2008. But not Ireland, whose cabinet arraigned themselves solidly on the side of Apple, which will appeal the EU ruling. Tim Cook, the man who succeeded Steve Jobs as Apple’s boss, blasted the EU judgment as "total political crap" and the US Treasury, which has been pursuing Apple for years to pay more tax, branded it as "unfair" and said it could adversely affect future US investment in the EU. The history briefly is this. Back in the 1960s, Ireland, then the poorest country in Europe, began offering international companies low taxes and cash grants as an incentive to invest and create jobs. It was a policy which exceeded beyond its expectations and became the single-biggest driving force for what became known as the Celtic Tiger, which in two glorious decades took Ireland from an essentially rural economy to the OECD’s fastest-growing country through the 1990s and early 2000s. The official rate of corporation tax, originally 10 per cent, was raised to 12.5 per cent, by far the lowest in Europe and well under half the US corporate tax rates. Big international companies have poured into Ireland to site their European headquarters there, taking advantage not just of low taxes but of its EU membership, a well-educated workforce and the fact it is English-speaking. Among them was Apple, which in 2003, when it moved into an office in Cork, wasn’t the giant it is today, but was still a big catch. Today Apple employs 6,000 people across the country and has spent €300 million developing an area outside Dublin known as Silicon Docks, with another €150m on the way. Apple has proved a magnet for other big names. Facebook is currently constructing a €200m data centre in Dublin and Amazon and Twitter have also used it as their gateway into Europe, or, if you prefer, their tax shelter for profit earned in the rest of the EU. The EU officials have always hated Ireland for that but, even when they had to bail it out in 2010, could not blackmail the country to change. But when the true scale of the "sweetheart" deal with Apple was uncovered, EU officials threw the book at it, accusing the California tech firm of paying just 0.005 per cent on its 2014 Europe-wide profit, or €50 for every €1m in profit it made on the continent, and demanded it refund the Irish government the difference between that and the official rate. Although Ms Vestager is basically accusing Apple of a giant tax dodge, she knows there is nothing illegal about what it has done. Her case is that the deal with the Irish government constituted illegal state aid as similar terms were not offered to all firms. The figures involved are enormous. Apple has US$215bn in cash held offshore to avoid the penal taxes the US imposes on overseas profit. The result is that Apple borrows heavily in the US to finance its dividends while keeping its cash pile, earning almost nothing, sitting in London and elsewhere. Officials in Washington have branded Apple "the holy grail of tax avoidance" and have been chasing it for years, as has the EU. Now they think they have found a way to get it through competition law. But little Ireland is refusing to join in, even at the mouthwatering prospect of receiving all that Apple loot. It is becoming clearer by the day that the world is uniting against the tax avoidance measures pursued by the big international companies and, acting together to plug the loopholes, is already forcing them to make at least a token contribution. Google has agreed to pay the UK government a derisory £130m (Dh637.7m), just 3 per cent of revenue, and Amazon, Starbucks and McDonald’s are under even more ferocious pressure. The biggest threat to Ireland’s low tax regime may come from an unexpected quarter – even before its EU referendum, Britain had already cut its corporate taxes to 17 per cent. Now it is looking at further cuts to the 12 to 15 per cent range. There may be some benefits to Brexit after all.

It all started with the rumors that Apple has an ambitious and secretive project for a car – and we already know that looking at a rumor concerning Apple we need to treat it almost as a given fact. The most interesting theory is that Apple is looking to create a vehicle that would revolutionize personal mobility. Apparently billions of dollars have been thrown into research and development, prescription more than 1000 people work on the project and there are mysterious workshops – the Apple iCar seems to be a poorly kept secret after all. But most interesting is the premise that it will revolutionize personal mobility – with technologies that would alter our perception of a car. That would be a huge achievement – since Apple didn’t do that since way back when they presented the first iPhone and iPad. It appears sources are talking now about the project as one that has been greenlit by the top brass. Apparently the company is already hard at work testing a fleet of Dodge Caravan prototypes – sighted at the GoMentum Station, a former naval base in San Francisco with over 20 miles of paved streets and used by carmakers for tests. Here the company is testing autonomous driving tech, which could be considered for the “iCar” – as everyone has nicknamed the model.

 The Apple engineer who moved Mac to Intel applied to work at the Genius Bar in an Apple store and was rejected Jim Edwards Sep. 5, 2016, 7:35 AM 387,750 facebook linkedin twitter email print JK Scheinberg.JK Scheinberg / Linkedin JK Scheinberg, the engineer who spent 21 years working at Apple and is best known for persuading Steve Jobs to move the Mac from PowerPC to Intel in 2005, was rejected from a job at an Apple store a few years later. He had applied to work at a Genius Bar, according to The New York Times. The Times used it as an example of age discrimination in the workplace. Ashton Applewhite wrote in The Times: "I'm lucky enough to get my tech support from JK Scheinberg, the engineer at Apple who led the effort that moved the Mac to Intel processors. A little restless after retiring in 2008, at 54, he figured he'd be a great fit for a position at an Apple store Genius Bar, despite being twice as old as anyone else at the group interview. 'On the way out, all three of the interviewers singled me out and said, "We'll be in touch,"' he said. 'I never heard back.'" Apple, notoriously, employs very young workers in its stores. It is unlikely that anyone is more qualified to work at an Apple store than Scheinberg, who ran the "Marklar" Intel project. Business Insider described Marklar in an article on the extreme culture of secrecy inside Apple: "Kim Scheinberg tells this story about her husband, Apple employee JK, who invented an Intel version of Mac OSX that ran on PCs. Bertrand Serlet, the svp of software engineering, liked the project: "'Bertrand sits JK down and has a talk with him about how no one can know about this. No one. Suddenly, the home office has to be reconfigured to meet Apple security standards. "'JK points out to Bertrand that I know about the project. In fact, not only do I know about it, I am the person who named it. "'Bertrand tells JK that I am to forget everything I know, and he will not be allowed to speak to me about it again until it is publicly announced. "'I guess he had some kind of "Total Recall" memory wipe in mind.'" MacRumors has a nice summary of the story too. It begins with Scheinberg realising that he could use an off-the-shelf Sony PC to run a version of Mac OS X, the Apple desktop operating system: "Bertrand walks in, watches the PC boot up, and says to JK, 'How long would it take you to get this running on a (Sony) Vaio?' JK replies, 'Not long' and Bertrand says, 'Two weeks? Three?' "JK said more like two *hours*. Three hours, tops. "Bertrand tells JK to go to Fry's (the famous West Coast computer chain) and buy the top of the line, most expensive Vaio they have. So off JK, Max and I go to Frys. We return to Apple less than an hour later. By 7:30 that evening, the Vaio is running the Mac OS. [My husband disputes my memory of this and says that Matt Watson bought the Vaio. Maybe Matt will chime in.] "The next morning, Steve Jobs is on a plane to Japan to meet with the President of Sony."

Doc Searls Weblog Home About Adblock War Series Subscribe to feed ‹ The cash model of “customer experience”  •  Turing wins again › Apple is a clothing company September 4, 2016 in Apple, Events, Technology | 4 comments The headline above came to me this morning after reading Walt Mossberg’s latest, titled The post-Jobs Apple has soared financially, but lacks a breakthrough product. Because the main things Apple makes are extensions of ourselves. That’s what our phones and laptops have become. They are things we almost wear, like our clothing. Is it just coincidental that Apple Stores inhabit shopping districts also populated by upscale clothing retailers? Or that Angela Ahrendts, who runs those stores, came to the company from Burberry? Or that its Watch, sold as what the fashion business calls an accessory, clearly matters far more to the company than what we used to call “peripherals” (screens, printers, drives, etc.) and that Apple hardly seems to care at all about the latter? And is it coincidental that Apple has lately clarified how it differs from nearly every other tech company by caring almost absolutely about personal privacy? Apple’s Jobsian obsession with design (and, one might say, fashion), while interesting, also misdirects attention away from the company’s deeper focus on enlarging its customers’ capacities in the world. Dig this: Apple cares so much about the bodies using its products that Tim Cook recently said this to Rick Tetzeli of FastCompany: “When you look at most of the solutions, whether it’s devices, or things coming up out of Big Pharma, first and foremost, they are done to get the reimbursement [from an insurance provider]. Not thinking about what helps the patient. So if you don’t care about reimbursement, which we have the privilege of doing, that may even make the smartphone market look small.” With all that in mind, it’s easy to understand why Apple’s product lineup looks stale. Shirts, skirts and hats are stale too. They’ve also been around for thousands of years, and we’ll never stop wearing them. It took me a long time to come to this realization. Here’s what I wrote in Apple Rot, a post here in January 2013, and repeated in Proof that Steve Jobs is dead, posted May 2014: …look at what Apple’s got: The iPhone 5 is a stretched iPhone 4s, which is an iPhone 4 with sprinkles. The 4 came out almost 3 years ago. No Androids are as slick as the iPhone, but dozens of them have appealing features the iPhone lacks. And they come from lots of different companies, rather than just one. The only things new about the iPad are the retina screen (amazing, but no longer unique) and the Mini, which should have come out years earlier and lacks a retina screen. Apple’s computer line is a study in incrementalism. There is little new to the laptops or desktops other than looks — and subtracted features. (And models, such as the 17″ Macbook Pro.) That goes for the OS as well. There is nothing exciting on the horizon other than the hazy mirage of a new Apple TV. And even if that arrives, nothing says “old” more than those two letters: TV. Since then Apple has come out with the Watch (points for originality with that one), introduced the hardly-seen (but cool-looking) Mac Pro (now also very stale), killed its Thunderbolt display, held its Time Capsule to a paltry (and damn near useless) 3Tb, done little to improve its AirPort Wi-Fi base stations — and has iterated its desktops and laptops so minimally that you can get along for years without a new one. Kinda like a good pair of jeans. So maybe all that matters for Apple is that it accessorizes its customers better than everybody else. You can hear a hint toward that from Tim Cook in this recent FastCompany report: “Our strategy is to help you in every part of your life that we can…whether you’re sitting in the living room, on your desktop, on your phone, or in your car.” Here’s betting Apple’s announcement on Wednesday will be all about stuff meant to be a part of you. And not much that sounds like the rest of the personal computer business. (Which, we might remember, Steve Jobs pretty much invented.)

As Apple always does, it would transform a broadly attempted, badly implemented tech like VR and leverage it into a line that extends to the winning carplay UX. Also adds 1,000 or so retail points of presence and an army of affiliated optometrists who can act as agents and guides for customers/patients the HealthKit revolution Apple is clearly planning. They’d be Eye Beacons–the next level of Apple intimacy, for which the Apple Watch would be seen as a UI prototype. Doc Searls on September 12, 2016 at 9:55 am Good call, Britt. Eyeware is an expensive business, largely because of regulatory capture. Ever wonder why you can buy off-the-shelf glasses with +1, +1.5, +2 diopters and not with -1, -2, etc.? It’s because the latter are illegal, to protect the optometry fulfillment business. Basically, to protect the likes of LensCrafters. Apple would have to deal with those laws as well as the market opportunities.

However, new details have emerged just days before the reveal from well-connected analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities. The details include one very useful feature for those who enjoy taking photos as the phone will have four LED flash lights, up two from the iPhone 6s. Two of these LEDs will be in cool colours and two in warm colours. It is also expected Apple will add an ambient light sensor to the iPhone 7. Apple iPhone7 launch date finally CONFIRMED The camera on the iPhone 6s receives a lot of praise but it struggles to take good photos in low-light situations. The additions should improve image quality which is good news for people who enjoy taking pictures on a night out. It is unclear whether these features will appear on the 4.7-inch iPhone or just the 5.5-inch iPhone. The latter is expected to feature a dual-lens camera which could take SLR-quality photos. These aren't the only details that haver come to light. When does the new Apple store in Birmingham open? According to Kuo, the iPhone 7 will boast an A10 processor that will be a dramatic increase in speed over the existing A9 chip. Furthermore, the device will be waterproof to a depth of one metre for up to 30 minutes. The rumour that the 3.5mm headphone jack will be removed also appears. The iPhone 7 will reportedly ship with both Lightning EarPods and a Lightning-to-headphone adaptor in the box.

At the launch event in San Francisco, the company revealed an upgraded iPhone that, while aesthetically similar to the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, has several important differences, including a pressure-sensitive home button, better camera, a faster processor and improved battery life, as well as having no headphone jack. It also comes in a new range of colours and a starting size of 32GB. Watch | Apple iPhone 7 Plus - hands on 01:38 Now available for pre-orders Pre-orders for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have opened online. Many models of the phone are already in high demand, with pre-orders pushing back shipping dates on Apple’s website. How long until I can order the iPhone 7 or 7 Plus? The handsets are due to start shipping on September 16, but the company's site listed the jet black iPhone 7 Plus as shipping in November just hours after orders opened, with other colours set to take 2-3 weeks.  Before orders opened reports suggested that supply could be limited at launch, with the Nikkei Asian Review claiming that problems with faulty components could lead to the phone being sold out.  Wireless Airpods for the new iPhone 7 Credit: EPA How much will it cost? For the last two years the cheapest model of the latest iPhone has cost £539 but the new iPhone 7 price will start at £599 for the 32GB model. The iPhone 7: £599 for 32GB £699 for 128GB £799 for 256GB The iPhone 7 Plus: £719 for 32GB £819 for 128GB  £919 for 256GB apple profit counter in £ What are the new features? The most significant changes on the new phone include an upgraded camera, a new home button and the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack.  Watch | Apple's wireless AirPod headphones - hands on 00:22 Instead of the traditional headphone connection, iPhone packages will now come with earphones that fit into the phone's Lightning port, currently used for charging and data transfer. The bigger "Plus" model has an even-more powerful "dual-lens" camera, explained below.

Infared sensors detect when each pod is in your ear and motion sensors control the headphones to use Siri and detect your voice.

Apple has faced opposition over changes before, such as when it introduced the lightning connector with the iPhone 5 in 2012. Apple will also supply an adaptor that enables traditional headphones to continue to plug into the iPhone, but it will not allow for charging at the same time. Apple AirPods | Pros and cons The pods can connect to Apple watches, laptops and iPads. Beats have also released two versions of wireless headphones for the iPhone 7 models.

Watch | Watch: Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus key features 01:59 Upgraded camera The camera has been revamped to enhance low-light capabilities and take even sharper photos. The smaller 4.7-inch device has a f/1.8 lens that lets 50 per cent more light onto the lens, a new 12MP sensor that's 60 per cent faster and 30 per cent more energy efficient.

The iPhone 7 Plus has two 12MP cameras, one of which is a wide angle lens and the other a telephoto lens that can zoom 2X in high quality without using any software. The telephoto lens means the camera can zoom to 10X with optical and soft zoom. iPhone evolution Cameras on both models will also have 12 megapixel sensors as well as 4K video recording capability. It also enables live editing of video files and with wide colour capture. It also has image stabilisation and a new camera flash to improve photos shot in low-light. Apple has also doubled the number of LEDs to four - two cool, two warm - in order to create a more effective flash. That gives 50 per cent more light. It also has a flicker sensor that makes the flash look like natural light. The front camera has also been upgraded to 7MP from 5MP for FaceTime and selfies.  Example of selfie taken on an iPhone 7 front camera  Credit: AP Appearance Apple has introduced two new colours for the iPhone 7 to replace space grey.  The new models are available in five different colours including two new shades of black. A matte "black" and a glossy black will join silver, gold and rose gold in the colour options for the iPhone. The new shiny "jet black" finish will be offered exclusively on the 128GB and 256GB models.  The new handset look very similar to the current iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, but with the antenna bands moved from the back of the device to the edges.

An iPhone 7 lasts, on average, two hours longer than an iPhone 6s and an hour longer than iPhone 6s Plus. The battery on the iPhone 7 lasts 14 hours when using WiFi and 12 on 4G. The iPhone 7 Plus meanwhile lasts 15 hours on WiFi and 15 on 4G.  Watch | Connecting USB Fan to Mobile Battery Has Interesting Results 00:17 Internal performance The model will be powered by a new Apple A10 Fusion which has a 64-bit 4 core CPU. Forty percent faster than A9 of iPhone 6s and double the speed of the A8 processors. It also has a ramped up graphics performance which is also 40 percent more powerful than the A9. 14 alternatives to Apple's default apps that will supercharge your iPhone Water-resistant The new iPhones are also water-resistant with an IPX67 rating which means the hardware can withstand immersion in up to 1 metre of water for 30 minutes. Apple’s high standards for waterproofing have impacted the supply chain and lowered total production of iPhone 7. Watch | How Apple is making itself smarter 01:24 The company is believed to have slashed production levels of the iPhone 6s and partner unit the 6s Plus by a third amid fears of slowing demand for the 'fallow year' s models, despite initial sales of more than 13 million units within three days of availability. KGI is forecasting 65 million iPhone 7 units will be shipped by the end of the year, a 20.7 pc decrease compared to iPhone 6s in the same period last year. Home button The home button has been given a vibration-based taptic feedback system so it now vibrates when touched to give users feedback. The feature is already in use on the firm's MacBook laptops.

The big changes Apple is rumoured to be saving for the 2017 iPhone include its chassis being made entirely from glass. It could have an edge-to-edge display with an OLED screen, a significant step forward from the LCD screens the company currently uses.

No one likes a bully. Not even the bullies themselves, in truth. But no one sees a bully coming. At least until it is too late. Behind the flattery and initial friendship, it is hard to see the jealousy and resentment behind their eyes as they sniff out or wait for vulnerabilities. Inevitably, the mask slips, the undermining process begins, and the victim discovers all too late that they are all alone in a crowded room. That’s how Ireland looked to me last week after the EU Commission revealed a landmark ruling that Ireland must collect €13bn tax, plus interest, from Apple. Ireland looked alone and lost and, from a height, the European Commission damned Ireland for allegedly flouting state aid rules. ‘Not to appeal the European Commission’s ruling would be a massive disservice to the hundreds of thousands of Irish people who gave multinationals a return on their investment and then some’ The ruling outlined by Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager is as big an existential threat to Ireland’s future as the fallout from Brexit. At the core of the ruling may be jealousy around Ireland’s 12.5pc corporate tax rate and the country’s success at winning foreign direct investment. But it wasn’t presented to the Irish people that way. Instead, a €13bn carrot was dangled in front of the masses and a populist agenda was ignited to claim the windfall. It was as if Ireland had won the lottery. While Apple itself was resolute from the get-go that it would appeal the decision in the European courts, the €13bn carrot caused an already vulnerable cabinet to dither and delay before a decision to appeal was finally reached on Friday. Was this by design? Are Ireland and Apple pawns in a wider game by the larger countries of Europe to achieve tax harmonisation? If this is the case, they are going about it in the wrong way. Aside from the press statement, little is known yet about how, precisely, the European Commission arrived at its €13bn figure. In the same breath as dangling the €13bn carrot, the EU helpfully suggested that other countries in the EU and elsewhere could require the taxes be paid locally. Talk about a contradiction. Picture a carrot dangling in front of a hungry beast of burden. The carrot was a complete misnomer. For now, the €13bn will sit in an escrow account while several years of court battles lie ahead. But the carrot had already been seized by populist politicians who mistakenly thought it was free money to suddenly spend on urgent issues like Ireland’s broken health system, the housing crisis and a lot more. Apple CEO Tim Cook dismissed the ruling as “maddening”, while both Cook and Ireland’s Finance Minister Michael Noonan TD pointed to how the figure made a mockery of sovereign tax laws – which individual states in the EU are entitled to – and agreements by retroactively applying taxes. IDA Ireland chief executive Martin Shanahan insisted Ireland does not do tax deals. For her part, Vestager denied the ruling was political. But from the ground, it looks like it was a week of misinformation following months of misinformation. Irish officials believed that Vestager would not announce the ruling until after the Budget in October. Even though they were told it would be bad, they also believed that that the figure could be as low as €1bn. Noonan stated publicly that the money, if it exceeded €1bn, could only be used to repay the national debt. Oh, actually, that is not so, chimed in EU officials rather helpfully. But it would be good policy to do so, of course. Once again, picture a carrot dangling in front of a donkey. “Nothing happens by accident,” a seasoned civil servant murmured drily on Friday. With friends like these … Let’s be really honest and admit that, in all of this, Ireland has hardly covered itself with glory. Until the previous government reluctantly shut down the so-called Double Irish, it was among a number of well-known tax avoidance schemes used by multinationals, along with others such as the Singapore Sling, the Double Irish Dutch Sandwich, the Bermuda Black Hole, and others. Across the world, it is an acknowledged truth that multinationals do not pay enough taxes on their profits. This is an issue that the United States government, and not only Europe, is keen to address. And this is why Ireland appealing the European Commission’s €13bn ruling against Ireland is so critical. It is about integrity. If Ireland is to defend its 12.5pc corporate tax rate in the face of manoeuvering to harmonise corporate taxes across Europe, it must demonstrate how this is now above board and completely legal. The 12.5pc tax rate is one of the few levers Ireland has to compete in the fast-moving world of foreign direct investment. Yes, we have brilliant, highly-educated people. Yes, Ireland is a wonderful place to do business. Yes, there are strong cultural ties with North America. And, yes, with Britain about to Brexit the EU, our stance as the only English-speaking economy in the union and the Eurozone is pivotal. It’s like a win-win, and that is also why the bigger countries of Europe are coming after us. When the UK voted to leave the EU, we Irish were astonished. That’s because we appreciate the value of what Europe has done for us: the ability to travel freely across borders, vital science and technology investments through Horizon 2020, and a hell of a lot more. And, yet, our loyalty to the European Experiment is being cynically tested. In the years before Ireland joined the EU, it was an economic backwater dependent on agriculture and trade with the UK. In the 1960s, fed up with never-ending emigration and a struggling economy, Taoiseach Seán Lemass and, later, Jack Lynch along with senior public servants like TK Whitaker decided to shake things up. They embarked on making Ireland an open, global economy and made education free for everyone. In 1973, approximately five decades after gaining independence from the UK, Ireland became a member of the EU – believe it or not, with the help of the UK. The most ardent opponent of Ireland joining the EU was Charles de Gaulle, president of France. It appears this haughty attitude of bigger countries over smaller countries has never left the EU and, if anything, it appears to be getting worse. I will never forget reading of the lonely feeling former finance minister, the late Brian Lenihan, described as he watched his airplane taxi to the gates at Brussels Airport in 2010 as snow fluttered outside the window. He was returning to Ireland having negotiated the terms of Ireland’s financial bailout and his back was to the wall. It was his job to tell the people the next day. The contentious terms were that Ireland would shoulder an incongrous 42pc of Europe’s entire banking debt. Children not even born today in Ireland will still be paying for this, decades from now. That was the price Ireland paid for not burning the bankers or bondholders. Iceland, which did so, is in rude economic health today. Other small countries were punished for their temerity in trying to stand up to the EU – Cyprus had its banking system shuttered and chaos ensued. The Greek tragedy is still being played out and Greece is bearing the brunt of the human tragedy of the migration of Syrian refugees from their war-torn country. Ironically, larger countries like Spain were able to negotiate a €100bn bailout on reasonable terms, while Italy is currently dealing with its financial crisis by subsidising its own banks from taxpayers’ money, which is against EU rules. Accepting the unfair decision to shoulder 42pc of Europe’s banking debt, Ireland was widely lauded – even by multinatinals – for taking its medicine and the country is only now slowly returning to a growing economy. US multinational investment overseas is at its peak. Europe is the go-to location because of its relative stability, and Ireland is capturing the lion’s share of this. No wonder the European overlords still aren’t happy. Another Greek tragedy in the making? In 1980, Ireland’s people were among the lowest paid in Europe, emigration was still rife and the country had a massive inferiority complex. Around that time, a four-year-old US tech company called Apple took a chance on Ireland, locating its first overseas manufacturing site in Cork. 37 years later, some of the first employees of the company still work there and some 5,000 people (soon to grow to 6,000) work at Apple across Ireland. In 1985, one of Apple’s biggest rivals, Microsoft, came a-callin’ to Dublin to manufacture software. It is still there, with over 1,200 people on book, and a new hi-tech campus being built in south Dublin. In 1989, Intel came to Ireland to make chips to fuel the PC revolution of the 1990s. Intel is still in Leixlip, with over 4,000 people moving to the latest chip building processes. In 2002, Google came to Dublin to create 80 jobs. Today it is Dublin’s biggest employer, with 6,000 people at work in the city. In the years since Apple, thousands of US companies, as well as companies from Europe and Japan, have taken a chance on Ireland, and Ireland – thanks to the volume of big name tech companies based here – can rightly claim the title of Silicon Valley of Europe. The truth is that every European capital would like to have Facebook headquarters. Dublin has already succeeded. In the years that followed Apple, hundreds of thousands of Irish people have worked in multinationals, and many can be discovered in senior positions in Silicon Valley, Seattle, New York and elsewhere, thanks to their start achieving a highly prized job with a US multinational. When I first started writing about technology in the 1990s, the plethora of jobs announcements laid the groundwork for the Tiger economy. This was great until people lost their heads on property. Back then, these investments weren’t known as foreign direct investment, but mobile investment. They were called mobile investments because there was the inherent understanding that these investments could move if a more advantageous location presented itself, or if the business environment changed. In recent weeks, eBay revealed it was closing its Dundalk operations with the loss of 150 jobs. And this is why Ireland’s decision to appeal the European Commission ruling is so important. Investment is in constant movement. Organisations like the IDA need to keep bringing in new investors, and local arms of global giants need to evolve to stay alive. There are currently 187,000 people at work in multinationals in Ireland today. For every one of these, there are at least two to three more people at work in the local economy because of the money the multinationals spend on everything from taxis and trucks, to loaves of bread or cartons of milk in the local supermarket. By this logic, a considerable share of up to 1m people in Ireland depend on, or are some way supported, by multinationals. The longevity of investments like those of Apple or Microsoft or Google or Intel in Ireland are not solely down to convenient tax arrangements. They are down to the hard work of local people and local management competing aggressively to win new responsibilities and evolve. Apple is no longer just manufacturing in Cork, it is the hub and spokes of a global wheel accounting for everything from legal, HR and finance to e-commerce, supply chain and, soon, data centres. Every single one if its highly-paid staff pay their taxes in Ireland. Why we must appeal Not to appeal the Commission’s ruling would be a massive disservice to the hundreds of thousands of Irish people who gave multinationals a return on their investment and then some. Not to appeal the Commission’s ruling would be a betrayal of companies that took a chance on Ireland when we had very few friends willing to help. Not to appeal the Commission’s ruling would be surrendering a corporate tax rate that is key to one of the few, unique things a country that missed out on the first industrial revolution had managed to create for itself in adverse circumstances. Thanks to our so-called friends in Europe,, Ireland has shouldered 42pc of Europe’s banking debt. We have signed away the rights to fishing. We have signed away the rights to oil and gas. We have even signed away the rights of people to cut turf. Failure to appeal this one last unique thing would have meant resetting the clock back to 1973. Ireland was correct to ignore the €13bn carrot mischievously presented last week. But with a Budget looming and a Government on fragile ground, the damage may already have been done. As a two-speed Europe emerges between big countries and small, it is time to bring the fight to Europe and show we will not be bullied any longer. At the very least, an appeal will get the facts out in the open.

News Stocks Technology Science Tech Space Human Earth Health Politics World Videos The Tape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeNewsNFLX Stock: Hedge Fund Legend Says Netflix Likely to be Taken Over NFLX Stock: Hedge Fund Legend Says Netflix Likely to be Taken Over Famed investor Leon Cooperman says he’s done with Netflix (NFLX) in his latest interview with CNBC. September 5, 2016 WSP Hedge fund legend Leon Cooperman has some surprising things to say about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in his latest interview with CNBC. The famed investor said the video streaming service, which has a market cap of around $41 billion, is likely to be taken over. “I think ultimately Netflix is going to work, but I think somebody buys the company at a nice premium,” the billionaire investor said. “Netflix is an acquisition candidate for somebody.” In his Wednesday interview, Cooperman said there was no particular reason for selling the online streaming service other than he is “doing other things.” Cooperman, who is the CEO and chairman of an investment firm, noted that the time is fast approaching when banks can turn meaningful profits and he decided to set his money to work elsewhere. “We have a bunch of financials in the portfolio that seem a little bit cheaper than Citibank, but I think Citibank would work, will make money if interest rates will start to rise,” he said. He added, “Another idea came in, I didn’t want to raise my exposure so I sold, and went to something else.” Speculations over a Netflix takeover have been ongoing for a long time with heavyweights such as Apple and Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) attached to a potential deal. However, the billionaire investor noted that he does not think a takeover at a “nice premium” will be announced anytime soon. Cooperman revealed that he sold his $34.1 million stake in Netflix, which he bought sometime between April 1 and June 30 this year. Cooperman’s flagship fund, the Omega Overseas, which averaged 14.6% returns since 1992 to mid-2014, has beaten the S&P 500. However, the fund has faltered in recent years. In fact, the fund lost 10.4% in 2015. He also waved a red flag over Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a company which he held on and off over the past several years. Apple’s latest issues, including flagging sales of its main breadwinner, the iPhone, are making a lot of investors wary of the company’s future. When asked what would it take for Omega to take Apple back, Cooper said the Cupertino tech giant’s best days might be over. Cooperman explained, “My concern is that Apple’s best days might be behind it because there’s nothing to replace the iPhone and so it’s a company that generates lots of cash but may be a smaller company in three of four years so we’ve put our money elsewhere say Google, or Facebook, which we think has more visible growth.” Meanwhile, Apple is gearing up for the grand launching of the iPhone 7 this September 7. If rumors about the iPhone’s design are true, Apple’s newest flagship smartphone is likely to disappoint a lot of fans. Wall Street analysts are generally bullish about the stock, especially with the iPhone’s redesign rumors for 2017. Virtually 85% of analysts covering the stock are giving it a buy rating. Apple shares are up $0.25 to $106.35 in pre-market trading today. On valuation-measures, the issue has a trailing-12 and forward P/E of 12.37 and 11.91, respectively. P/E to growth ratio is 1.64, while t-12 profit margin is 21.70%. EPS registers at 8.58. The company has a market cap of nearly $572 billion and a median Street price target of $120 with a high target of $185. On trading-measure, Apple stock has a beta of 1.38 and a short float of 51.7 million. In the past 52 weeks, shares of the iPhone maker have traded between a low of $89.47 and a high of $123.82, with the 50-day moving average [MA] and 200-day MA located at $104.83 and $101.21 levels, respectively. AAPL currently prints a one year loss of more than 6 percent, and a positive year-to-date return of around 1 percent.

Apple is all set to reveal its new flagship smartphones today at an event in San Francisco, USA. Like last year, it is expected to launch two phones probably named as iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus as last year iPhone 6s and 6s Plus were launched. There have been many speculations about the phones which started soon after the launch of iPhone 6S itself. The new iPhones are expected to come with some eye-catching features as Apple is facing stiff competition from World's No 1 smartphone maker, the Samsung. Here are some speculations which are widely expected to come true tonight. So let's check out what the new iPhones may have. Dual-Camera Setup: Apple iPhone 6s was criticized heavily for not having something new. But this time the grapevines are filled with rumours of a dual camera set up in the upcoming phone. A lot of images showed up on the internet showing the dual camera set up in the iPhone 7 Plus/Pro variant which will be more like what we saw in the Huawei P9 rather than what we saw in the HTC One M8. Touch-Sensitive Home Button: Apple is also likely to dump its outdated home button for a touch-sensitive home button. It will be interesting to see how Apple takes the advantage of this new change. Most likely, the new home button would recognise different tap combinations for various functions. No Headphone jack: One of the first rumours that came about this year's iPhone was the absence of a headphone jack. Instead this year's iPhones are said to be coming with pair of Lightning EarPods. Moreover, it is likely that Apple includes a lightning to 3.5mm jack adapter in the box. Specifications: Just like last year's iPhone, iPhone 7 will come with 4.7 inch display and the Plus variant will come in 5.5 inch display. The iPhone 7 is expected to be powered by a 2.4GHz A10 chipset which might be clocked at a slower speed. The iPhone 7 is said to be coming with 2GB of RAM, while iPhone 7 Plus is expected to have 3GB of RAM. Moreover, iPhone 7 might sport a 12 megapixel camera with OIS and 4-LED flash lights. Whereas, theiPhone 7 Plus will have two 12 megapixel sensors, one of which will be 6 element wide angle lens and other one being a 5-eleent wide angle lens. Apple is also likely to dump the 16GB storage option with the base model coming with 32GB storage. Also there is likely to be no 64GB model and we will see a straight bump to 128GB and 256GB. Another interesting rumour has it that the iPhone 7 will be IPX7 certified dust and water resistant. Price: The iPhone 7 is expected to be priced at Rs 53,000 onwards while the iPhone 7 Plus is expected to cost above Rs 61,200. However, these rates have been only calculated on the basis conversion rates. Actual prices may differ as there are a lot of other things which comes in the picture once the device is launched. Also, this year Apple is also planning to introduce a new colour variant with the name 'Space Black' or 'Piano Black'. Nonetheless, everything will be cleared in just a couple of days as we see Apple revealing the next iPhone on Wednesday.

The company is instead likely to launch both Bluetooth headphones and headphones with lightning connectors as a part of the major change in terms of design in the new iPhones. As the countdown to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus starts, headphone maker JayBird spoke to Forbes about its take on Apple's speculated move. For those unaware, JayBird was recently acquired by Logitech for $50million. In an interview, JayBird chief marketing officer Rene Oehlerking told Brooke Crothers, a contributor for Forbes, "My personal opinion is that it's absolutely going to happen. It's going to happen next week when they announce it. And I believe this will be seen as very similar to when Apple decided to get rid of the floppy disk or decided to get rid of the CD-ROM or DVD drives in all of their MacBooks. It's going to be that kind of a leap." Oehlerking further added that 3.5mm headphone jack came with Walkman and the CD players and while all of them have been replaced by more advanced tech, 3.5mm headphone jack stayed unchanged and is now outdated. JayBird CMO said that shifting from 3.5mm headphone jack to lightning connector-based headphones will still compress and decompress audio "but the music quality can be drastically enhanced." According to him, "there will be some kind of adapter in the iPhone 7 box" that will enable using of wired headphones via the Lightning port. The rumours suggesting Apple to bring Lightning EarPods with the launch of the iPhone 7 got more credibility recently, courtesy a leaked image of iPhone 7 Plus' alleged packaging.

KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo - who has previously predicted significant iPhone changes with success - has said the new models will be available in five different colours including two new shades of black. Leaked images of SIM trays also confirm the rumours that a matte "dark black" and glossy "piano black" will be replacing space grey, while silver, gold and rose gold will still be on offer. Leaked SIM tray images also seem to corroborate the rumours A regular Apple leaker also posted a photo of the models, as well as prototype stickers, purporting to show the black variants of the new iPhones. #iPhone7 Storages apart, It's very interesting to see the 2 black variants confirmation (src 10低调的男人) Thanks Aidon😉 pic.twitter.com/VIATSsxNJr— The Malignant (@the_malignant) September 4, 2016 Glossy or Matt? What #iPhone7Plus do you prefer? Via KK低调 - Weibo 🙋 pic.twitter.com/UDXM0N44T1— The Malignant (@the_malignant) September 1, 2016 Kuo suggests that, initially, the "piano black" may only be offered exclusively on high-capacity iPhone 7 models due to low yield, as the company is said to be experiencing a production slump.  The decision would signal a return to iPhone 5, the last phone to include the shade, named black and slate. Two new models of the iPhone are expected to be released on Wednesday 7, but they are unlikely to feature many radical design overhauls. iphone 7: what will it look like In terms of the internal performance, Kuo reports that the model will be powered by a new Apple A10 chip, made by TSMC, which will reach CPU speeds of 2.4GHz - a dramatic increase over the existing A9 silicon chip on iPhones, which clocks a maximum of 1.85 GHz. The iPhone screen will also be getting an update. Although the dimensions and resolution will remain the same, the displays will reportedly ‘copy’ the visual features of the iPad Pro. This enables wide-colour imagery which will boost the aesthetic of photos taken on the iPhone's camera. countdown to iphone 7 event A new camera is another source of speculation as Kuo agrees with a line of rumours that predict the iPhone 7 Plus (or equivalent) will have a dual camera system. It is believed the camera will feature an optical zoom and both wide-angle and a telephoto lenses. The camera will also have image stabilisation and a new camera flash to improve photos shot in low-light. Apple are rumoured to be doubling the number of LEDs to four - two cool, two warm - in order to create a more effective flash. According to the report, cameras on both models will also have 12 megapixel sensors. Many have also suggested the iPhone 7 Plus will have a dual camera The analyst also anticipates that memory and RAM will be increased to offer 256 GB, and  dropping both 16 GB and 64 GB. This means new models will have either 32 GB, 128 GB or 256 GB. Apple will also create an additional 1GB of RAM on the iPhone 7 Plus to enable the advanced camera processing. It will include a total of 3 GB RAM while the iPhone 7 will feature 2GB RAM, the same as an iPhone 6s. The removal of the round 3.5mm headphone jack in an effort to make the device marginally slimmer has caused controversy in the run up to the launch. An unconfirmed image of the new headphones The company would presumably include new wireless headphones with the new handset, or a pair of headphones which connect to the phone through a lightning connector. Kuo’s report corroborates these rumours but  says the space created will be used to enhance a Force Touch recognition system which triggers multiple functions depending on how much pressure is applied to the trackpad. A new internal amplifier is also reportedly being added to boost sound output. The iPhone 7 will be following the Samsung Galaxy S7 by becoming waterproof, the KGI report said Credit: AP The new iPhones are also said to be waterproof with an IPX7 rating, the same as the Apple Watch, which means the hardware will be able to withstand immersion in up to 1 metre of water for 30 minutes. According to the report, Apple’s high standards for waterproofing have impacted the supply chain and lowered total production of iPhone 7. The company is believed to have slashed production levels of the iPhone 6s and partner unit the 6s Plus by a third amid fears of slowing demand for the 'fallow year' s models, despite initial sales of more than 13 million units
