The iMac was updated a year ago, while the Mac Mini and Mac Pro haven't been refreshed for more than two years. That's led to some speculation that the iMac and Mac Pro desktops were on the way out in order to focus on portable successes such as the iPad. Such chatter must have been kicking off around the water coolers in Cupertino, as Cook was spurred to respond on a message board for employees.  “Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops,” Cook wrote on the in-house message board, according to a TechCrunch report. “If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that.” He goes on to stress that desktops remain "really important" to users. "The desktop is very strategic for us," he said. "It's unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop — the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people."   Cook also added Apple has a clear idea of what's coming next in the market, but realises there's value in exploring new ideas to see where they go - praising Apple employees for being willing to take that journey. "The fantastic thing about Apple employees is they get excited about something, and they want to know how it works. What it will do. What its capabilities are," he wrote. "If they want to know about something in an entirely different industry, they start pulling the string and see where it takes them. They're focused more on the journey, which enables so many great things to happen." He added: "We've got a ton of things on our roadmap that I can't talk about, but that I'm incredibly excited about, that are the result of pulling that string and not being bound by the box that so many people in life get bound by."

So while the initial inventory of a product like AirPods may sell out online within minutes of going up on Apple’s site, you can typically count on Apple’s retail stores to carry stock on launch day. This was the case with AirPods – most Apple stores in the U.S had them yesterday – but they quickly sold out. So the issue is figuring out which stores have them in stock, especially since you can’t call Apple stores directly anymore. Enter iStockNow.com. The site gives you live inventory updates for all major Apple products at every Apple Store around the world. While this information is available on Apple’s website, there’s no way to see it on a map view or check multiple stores at once – hence the helpfulness of iStockNow. The website has been around for a while, but is becoming useful again because of how hard it is to find AirPods. The site also shows stock of iPhones, MacBooks, Apple Watches – and the DJI Mavic, which joins AirPods as being the hardest gadget to find this holiday season. For things like iPhones and MacBooks you can filter by storage size, color, etc – which is also helpful when trying to find the exact device you want at a local store. The website refreshes whenever Apple’s inventory on their website updates, which seems to be each night sometime after midnight PT. While the website currently shows that no stores in the U.S have AirPods, keep checking frequently and you may see a local store turn green. If they do, you can order them on Apple’s website for in-store pickup. Oh, and the site also says they are working on free notifications, which would presumably let you select your local store and get an email when the item you are looking for is in stock. We have one thing in the works right now that’s notifications and it’s coming for free (as it used to be). cc @rommelnoodles @fitztepper — iStockNowCom (@istocknowcom) December 20, 2016   0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Founded 1976 Overview Apple is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications.

Bellamy's has extended the suspension in sharemarket trading of its shares for another three weeks pending "negotiations with key supplier / manufacturers" as it seeks to clarify underlying demand for its products and the state of its finances. The shares won't resume trading until January 13 unless a statement is released to the market before then, the company said in a statement to the ASX on Wednesday morning.

Vision courtesy ABC News 24. Bellamy's shares last traded at $6.68 on December 9. Trading has been suspended since as its management has sought to clarify the full impact of a slide in sales of its products. Both Bega Cheese and A2 Milk were quick to reaffirm their previous earnings forecasts, signalling the problems faced by Bellamy's are specific to that company with underlying demand for their products remaining firm. Related Content Markets Live: ASX hits new highs Bellamy's faces two more class actions "There continues to be strong consumer demand for infant formula in China and in other Asian markets," Bega said in a statement to the market. "Moreover, as a sub category the consumer demand for organic infant formula which Bega Cheese produces is also strong." Similarly, A2 Milk reaffirmed its recent earnings forecast while pointing to the fact that it has its own supply chain with guaranteed supply, which is not subject to so-called "take or pay" provisions. Advertisement Following Bellamy's extended trading suspension as the company seeks to renegotiate supply contracts, NZ-based Forsyth Barr analyst James Bascand said this could reflect cashflow challenges from infant milk formula already produced for Bellamy's either at Bega's Tatura unit or Fonterra, which has to be paid for but is yet to be sold and hence has created a build-up in inventory. There may also be "possible future volume contracts that Bellamy's is potentially trying to cancel which may have break costs", the analyst said.   SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Bellamy's Organic chief executive Laura McBain (left) and chief financial officer Shona Ollington. The company's financial struggle is set to continue over the Christmas period. Photo: Paul Jeffers "Either way it appears to be a company-specific issue between Bellamy's and its supplier/manufacturers."  Bega said it is a "key supplier" to Bellamy's and "continues to discuss supply arrangements and volume forecasts" with the client. Competitors such as A2 Milk have continued to invest heavily in the brand and brand support, one industry analyst said, while Bellamy's has lagged. 'Suicide in the China market' "It is very much self-inflicted," this analyst said. "All of the regulatory changes in China occurred early in the year, but Bellamy's is trying to cling on to this as a reason for its woes. Also Bellamy's began to sell discounted stock. That is suicide in the China market." The latest extension of the Bellamy's trading suspension marks a widening of a review that began when Bellamy's first sought a suspension earlier this month to prepare an "updated announcement of the impact of current trading conditions on the company's trading results". Two days later, Bellamy's said "a review" of its business was underway which has now been broadened to encompass negotiations with suppliers and manufacturers. The company didn't explain why it decided to widen the scope of the review. Investor concerns weighed on other stocks with a large exposure to China such as vitamins maker Blackmores, which hit the lowest level since mid-2015, although A2 Milk gained 7¢ to $2.02 and Bega Cheese rose 10¢ to $3.98. Citi​ analysts told clients in a recent note that Bellamy's was facing several company-specific issues such as under-investment in marketing relative to its rivals, product discounting which has damaged its brand image, and poor distribution. "Bellamy's cut pricing during Singles Day this year and its Chinese pricing remains 50 per cent to 63 per cent cheaper than A2 Milk," Citi analysts said in the note. Doubts about the business model "We are concerned the cheaper pricing is creating a consumer perception of inferior quality", the Citi analysts wrote. "We prefer to see Bellamy's holding or increasing pricing, and investing in below-the-line marketing or a brand ambassador as opposed to discounting its product." Bellamy's sources much of its products from abroad, given the small volume of organic milk and dairy products produced within Australia, which has also raised doubts about its business model. Beyond its inventories, the company has negligible assets "so if earnings continue to deteriorate" there won't be much else to support its valuation, Citi warned. "While Bellamy's could be acquired by a multi-national or Chinese company, recent signs of weakening momentum reduce the probability of this event, in our view," the analysts said. Lawyers are already lining up for potential class actions, with Maurice Blackburn, ACA Lawyers and Slater & Gordon all investigating shareholder claims against the Launceston-based company amid "considerable concern" in the investment community over the $500 million plunge in Bellamy's share price since early December. Bellamy's advised in early December that regulatory changes in China had hit its sales, with the potential for full-year revenue to come in below last financial year's $244.6 million if conditions do not improve.

In October, after more than 500 days without an update, Apple unveiled the new MacBook Pro, with a slimmer design and louder speakers. The laptop garnered mostly favorable reviews from the technology press but grumbles from creative types, a key constituency, who said the device under-performed rival products. Interviews with people familiar with Apple's inner workings reveal that the Mac is getting far less attention than it once did. READ: What to expect as Apple gets ready for Mac update They say the Mac team has lost clout with the famed industrial design group led by Jony Ive and the company's software team. They also describe a lack of clear direction from senior management, departures of key people working on Mac hardware and technical challenges that have delayed the roll-out of new computers. While the Mac generates about 10% of Apple sales, the company can't afford to alienate professional designers and other business customers. After all, they helped fuel Apple's revival in the late 1990s. In a stinging critique, Peter Kirn, founder of a website for music and video creators, wrote: "This is a company with no real vision for what its most creative users actually do with their most advanced machines." If more Mac users switch, the Apple ecosystem will become less sticky — opening the door to people abandoning higher-value products like the iPhone and iPad.   People now have more options. Microsoft, once derided by Mac loyalists for its clunky, buggy software, offers Windows 10, which provides the tablet type functionality Apple pioneered with the iPad. Microsoft's Surface computers offer Apple-esque quality and a well-reviewed creative paint program aimed at the Mac's audience. Sensing an opportunity, Microsoft called the MacBook Pro a "disappointment" and said more users than ever were switching to its Surface laptops.   An Apple spokesman declined to comment. However, the company has said the Macintosh remains one of its most important products and denies it takes a back seat to other gadgets.  Four years ago at Apple's annual developer conference, marketing chief Phil Schiller pledged to keep the computer front and center in the company's product arsenal. "Nobody turns over their entire line as quickly and completely as we do at Apple," Schiller said. "We’re really proud of the engineering team and the work they do to do this quick so you can get the exact product you need." READ: Apple adds keyboard touch functions to Mac in major refresh Two years later, the company held a 30th birthday party for the Macintosh, a splashy event that featured a OneRepublic concert at Apple's Cupertino, California headquarters. The company also created a website celebrating the Mac's history. To be fair, Apple depends on Intel Corp., which still makes key chips for Macs. Like the rest of the PC industry, Apple's innovation and product cycles are sometimes constrained by when Intel produces new chips — a process that's getting more difficult. Making a laptop stand out is also harder these days. But when Apple has tried to leapfrog the competition, it has fallen short. Take the company's attempt to create a longer-lasting battery for the MacBook Pro. Apple engineers wanted to use higher capacity battery packs shaped to the insides of the laptop versus the standard square cells found in most machines. The design would have boosted battery life.  In the run-up to the MacBook Pro's planned debut this year, the new battery failed a key test, according to a person familiar with the situation. Rather than delay the launch and risk missing the crucial holiday shopping season, Apple decided to revert to an older design. The change required roping in engineers from other teams to finish the job, meaning work on other Macs languished, the person said. The new laptop didn't represent a game-changing leap in battery performance, and a software bug misrepresented hours of power remaining. Apple has since removed the meter from the top right-hand corner of the screen.  In the Mac's heyday, people working on new models could expect a lot of attention from Ive's team. Once a week his people would meet with Mac engineers to discuss ongoing projects. Mac engineers brought prototypes to Ive's studio for review, while his lieutenants would visit the Mac labs to look at early concepts. Those visits have become less frequent since the company began focusing more on more-valuable products like the iPhone and iPad, and the change became even more obvious after the design team's leadership was shuffled last year, according to a person familiar with the situation. In another sign that the company has prioritized the iPhone, Apple re-organized its software engineering department so there's no longer a dedicated Mac operating system team. There is now just one team, and most of the engineers are iOS first, giving the people working on the iPhone and iPad more power.  That's part of a broader shift toward making Macs more like iPhones. Apple prioritizes features, like thinness and minimal ports, that sell its iPhones and iPads, which generated about 75 percent of revenue this year. Those are contrary to professional needs, like maximum computing power. Early prototypes of the 12-inch MacBook used the iPhone's Lightning connector, although this was ditched for a more standard USB-C port. There was even a gold MacBook Pro planned, but this was shelved because the color didn’t look good on such a large product.  In recent years, Apple managers have also become more likely to float two or more competing ideas, meaning designers and engineers must work on more than one concept at a time. In the past, managers pushed a more singular vision. Engineers are now "asked to develop multiple options in hopes that one of them will be shippable," a person familiar with the matter said.  When the company was developing the first 12-inch MacBook, Apple tested two primary prototypes. One, known internally as Stealth Fighter, was lighter. The second, a slightly less ambitious design known as Stealth Bomber, was heavier. The lighter model prevailed, but with engineers developing and testing two competing concepts, they had less time to figure out how to cram all the electronics into a thin slab of aluminum that would hold together. In the end, Apple shipped the laptop in 2015, months after its 2014 goal. READ: Apple to end Mac update drought with October event For a 2016 MacBook update, some Apple engineers wanted to add a Touch ID fingerprint scanner and a second USB-C port (which would have made some power users happy). The update instead included a new rose gold color option alongside a standard speed increase. The internal turmoil has taken a toll. More than a dozen engineers and managers working on Mac hardware have left for different Apple teams or other companies in the past year and a half, said people familiar with the situation. Some were looking for a less all-consuming work environment, while others felt the future of Mac hardware was unclear in a world of iPhones and iPads.  In 2013, Apple launched a redesigned Mac Pro, a black cylinder with bright white LED lights. It was a powerful desktop machine created partly to cast a halo over the entire Macintosh lineup. The Mac Pro was also the first Apple computer in years to be assembled in the US Under pressure from politicians to create manufacturing jobs at home, Apple was looking to score political points. The decision caused production headaches though.  The Mac Pro's glossy exterior and chrome beveled edges meant Apple had to make its own manufacturing tools and then train people to run those machines in an assembly plant. This slowed production and constrained Apple's ability to make enough computers to meet demand. Three years on, the Mac Pro is ripe for an upgrade with its chips and connector ports lagging rival products. Because of the earlier challenges, some Apple engineers have raised the possibility of moving production back to Asia, where it's cheaper and manufacturers have the required skills for ambitious products, according to a person familiar with those internal discussions. The political environment is tougher for such a move now. During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump hammered Apple for building most of its products overseas and since his election he has pushed other companies to keep some jobs in the US.  Still, Apple hasn't given up on Macs. In a recent company Q&A session, employees asked whether Mac desktop computers remain strategically important. "We have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that," Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said, according to a transcript of the discussion obtained by Bloomberg News.  The latest MacBook Pro has a "Touch Bar," a thin touchscreen built into the keyboard that lets users quickly access app shortcuts, change system settings, and pick emojis. The laptop also has Touch ID to speed up online purchases and a giant trackpad for easier gesture control. Apple designers are already exploring standalone keyboards with the touch strip and a fingerprint reader for desktops. Apple will decide whether to release these based on how well the features do on the MacBook Pro. Mac fans shouldn't hold their breath for radical new designs in 2017 though. Instead, the company is preparing modest updates: USB-C ports and a new Advanced Micro Devices Inc. graphics processor for the iMac, and minor bumps in processing power for the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro. Cue the outrage.

December 20th 2016 14 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ Rod Chester reviews the Apple AirPods Wearables Apple says it will replace lost AirPod for $99 Matthew Dunn, news.com.auDecember 22, 2016 9:11am APPLE’S AirPods are finally here and they are going to change your life for the better. With claims it will change the way you use headphones, the AirPods has been dubbed “the tech product of the year”. Part of this glowing review was refuting suggestions the AirPods would fall out of your ear, with claims the product would remain firmly in place — even when running long distances. However, what if the worst happens and you lose one of the AirPods? Because we all know everyone has different shaped ears and we can’t forget those who are prone to misplacing large items, let alone two small AirPods. Apple recently addressed the issue in an update to its iPhone service pricing page. Let’s start with the good news. media_cameraAirPods will be covered by a one-year warranty for defective batteries and other manufacturing issues. If there are defective batteries or other manufacturing issues during the first year, the AirPods will be covered under warranty and repaired by Apple for free. Unfortunately, this one-year warranty does not cover loss or accidental damage. So, if you damage or lose one of the AirPods or charging case, you can have it replaced by Apple for $99. This isn’t terrible if you consider the most clumsy person could lose two AirPods and have them replaced for $31 cheaper than it would be to purchase a new set for $229. Apple introduced the product back at the September launch of the iPhone 7 as an answer to the tech giant’s controversial removal of the standard 3.5mm headphone jack. Will you be buying the AirPods?

Apple working on a Dual SIM iPhone? by: Nirupam Manik, The Mobile Indian,New Delhi | Last Updated: Wednesday, December 21, 2016 - 12:51 While almost all the mobile manufacturers have included the Dual SIM functionality somewhere down the line, Apple is one of the few firms which are yet to enter the Dual SIM game. Dual SIM, though not very popular globally is one of the top priorities when you touch the Indian smartphone market. While almost all the mobile manufacturers have included the Dual SIM functionality somewhere down the line, Apple is one of the few firms which are yet to enter the Dual SIM game. Well, seems like the Cupertino-based giant is finally working on the Dual-SIM functionality. According to Forbes, Apple is reportedly working on a special version of the next iPhone which will sport two SIM slots, as evident from the recent patents filed in different countries. Digging out more, the documents filed with China's State Intellectual Property Office reveals that the next gen iPhone will come with Dual SIM capability. Interestingly, the application was first submitted in March 2016 before it was published back in September 2016. Further, the filing identifies the inventor as Li Su who as per his Linkedin Profile is a principal architect for cellular software at Apple. Adding to this, Apple just got a patent for Dual SIM card technology from United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) which further adds up the spice to this latest rumour. Nevertheless, it will be extremely exciting if Apple can push the Dual SIM slot in its next iPhone because in countries like India and China, Dual SIM slot in a smartphone may soon become a necessity in a smartphone. However, it is still too early to authenticate such reports and we would advise you to stay updated on this on The Mobile Indian network. Yesterday, a report from Korea Herarld revealed that the next iPhone (probably iPhone 8) will come with curved OLED display after the company ordered only the Plastic OLED displays from Samsung Display. iPhone Apple iPhone Dual SIM Dual SIM iPhone Forbes Patents iPhone 7 iPhone 7 Plus First Published : Wednesday, December 21, 2016 - 12:50 Related Apple Stories Apple working on iOS 10.3, will bring Theatre Mode and fix Battery Gate issue by: Nirupam Manik | 02 Jan, 2017 Developed under the codename 'Erie', the new update will be the 8th one after the company first released the iOS 10 about 4 months back with iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.

Jon Fingas, @jonfingas 12.21.16 in Wearables Comments 431 Shares Share Tweet Share Save You no longer have to wait for a sale to snag an Apple Watch at a more reasonable price. Apple has quietly started selling refurbished Series 1 and Series 2 models through its American online store, lowering the barrier of entry if you don't insist on untouched wristwear. They're currently the most common models, to no one's surprise (no ceramic Apple Watch Edition here), but you're getting a sizable 15 percent discount over brand new: Series 1 begins at $229, while the GPS-equipped Series 2 variants start at $309. The Series 2 lineup also includes a few stainless steel versions starting at $469. These aren't the lowest prices we've seen. At the height of the holiday shopping frenzy, you could buy a Series 1 for under $200. With that said, these discounts are considerably more reliable... and importantly, they lower the official cost of entry for the Apple Watch world. While we wouldn't exactly call $229 an impulse buy, it's considerably more palatable if you're not sure about this whole smartwatch thing and would rather not spend more than necessary.

You can now purchase a variety of Apple Watches from both the first and second Series. The cheapest option to buy refurbished is the 38mm Apple Watch Series 1 with Sport band (All refurbished Apple Watches come with the Sport band) which will go for $229 while the 42mm Series 1 Watch will go for just $20 more at $249. There arent any refurbished Stainless Steel configurations available for Series 1, but you can grab a Series 2 Stainless Steel 38mm Watch for $469. If you want to go with the Series 2 Stainless with a 42mm body, thatll be an extra $40 at $509. If you dont want to splurge on the Stainless models, you can still get the Aluminum bodied 38mm or 42mm Series 2 Watches for $309 and $339, respectively. Strangely, all models listed on Apples page are described as Originally released September 2016, which is untrue of the Series 1 models. Surely, Apple has yet to notice the error or hasnt updated each listings description individually. All Apple Watches come with Apples 1-year warranty, ship for free, and offer free returns. Given the limited variety of refurbished Apple Watches, your favorite color combination may not be available in a refurbished model.

Is Apple alienating its Mac loyalists? Apple has been disappointing its Mac loyalists by placing large gaps between hardware updates By: Tech Desk | Published:December 21, 2016 1:48 pm Apple launched its latest MacBook Pro (2016) series laptop back in October, after almost one and a half years after the previous one Fans of Apple’s Macintosh systems have been less than overwhelmed with the company’s motivation to update its iconic computers over the past few years. In a Bloomberg report, Mark Gurman talks about how Apple has alienated Mac loyalists by reducing the number of Mac upgrades from a frequent ritual to a once in a few years thing – disappointing a lot of die-hard fans of the brand. Apple launched its latest MacBook Pro (2016) series laptop back in October, after almost one and a half years without an update. Among some hardware changes, the new MacBook Pro got a new multi-touch display called Touch Bar, a Touch ID and a new Force Touch trackpad. The company also amped up the pricing of the new MacBook Pro series, which starts at Rs 1,55,900 for the 13-inch laptop with Touch Bar. Meanwhile, Apple’s primary rival, Microsoft had said in a blog post earlier this month that November was the best month for the sales of Surface devices following the disappointment in the tech industry following the launch of the much-hyped 2016 MacBook Pros. The company went ahead to say that the trade-in program for MacBooks in the US had also helped boost sales of Microsoft’s new Surface devices. The Cupertino giant has been less generous with fans of other Macintosh systems like the Mac Pro, which hasn’t seen an update since 2013; the Mac Mini, which was last updated in 2014 and the MacBook Air, which was last updated in early 2015. The report says that people familiar with the inner workings of Apple have revealed that Macs are getting much less attention as they did earlier. A lack of direction from senior management and the departure of key people in the Mac technical and hardware teams have also led to delays in new launches. A majority of Apple’s revenue is generated by iPhones, with Macs only contributing to 10 per cent of sales. This, however, does not mean that Apple can afford to alienate these customers by delaying updates to Mac systems. Gurman believes that as Mac users switch over to other ecosystems, Apple’s own ecosystem will be devalued by a lot that can open the door of people abandoning the iPhones and iPads to invest in the new ecosystem. Read: Apple Airpods tough to recycle: Report Even while the new MacBook Pros have received generally warm views from the tech community, it falls short on some key selling points of the series, for example battery life. Users of the new MacBook Pros have complained that the notebooks are unable to run for 10 hours as promoted by Apple. To tackle the problem, Apple simply removed the time estimate option that shows against the battery status on the top of the display. Gurman also believes that it is harder to make laptops that stand out, and whenever Apple has tried to create something new, it has failed to impress. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: Apple Best of Express PM Modi frames UP fight: Growth exiled for 14 yrs, give us majority EntertainmentDangal box office collection day 11: Aamir Khan film all set to take over Sultan as biggest hit of 2016 EntertainmentRaees: Dear Shah Rukh Khan, why are you so 'Zaalim' on us?

But based on several patents filed in different countries, that might be changing soon and the iPhone of the future might start supporting more SIMs at the same time. However, it might not come in a form that most users will be familiar with. It’s a convention alien to the US and the UK but is almost natural in China, India, and many emerging markets. Users in these regions usually have separate SIM cards, one for work and one or more for personal use. Sometimes those SIM cards don’t even come from the same carrier. As such, phones with dual SIM card slots or, more recently, hybrid traya have become en vogue there, as many Android device maker can attest to. Apple, however, has never been one to jump on fads quickly, sometimes preferring to create trends of its own. It has so far resisted adding that feature but it might no longer be able to afford to ignore it. And patents show that Apple is at least open to the idea. But, unlike almost all smartphone makers, it is eternally obsessed with how it is implemented. Space has always been a premium on iPhones and a dual SIM card tray would have forced Apple to rearrange its innards and bulk up the iPhone, taking it in a direction opposite its current one. Instead, Apple seems to be toying with alternative methods to support two SIMs in the same space. A possible answer would be eSIMs or embedded SIMs, which it already uses on the iPad Pro. These are basically reprogrammable chips which, in theory, could switch between different configurations. That, however, would revert to the inconvenient “dual standby” technology of old. But while Apple might have a valid business motivation to add support for dual SIM card slots, it has an equally strong business reason to keep the status quo. While large and lucrative, China and India aren’t Apple’s only markets. In other countries, it already has equally strong deals with carriers, who would prefer to keep their iPhones locked to their networks. And Apple might not be able to afford producing and maintaining different models whose only difference lies between single and dual SIM support.

Research firm eMarketer has slashed its forecast for wearable devices in 2016. This year, 39.5 million US adults will use a wearable device (with internet connectivity) at least once a month, far less than the 63.7 million previously forecast, eMarketer said in research released on Tuesday. This means that wearable usage in the U.S. will only grow 24.7 percent in 2016 versus a previous forecast of 60 percent. "Before Apple launched its Watch, fitness trackers dominated the wearables space, and consumer surveys consistently found that tracking health and fitness was the main reason people were interested in wearables," Cathy Boyle, analyst at eMarketer, said. "They also reported high price-sensitivity. Without a clear use case for smart watches—which have more features than fitness trackers, but significant overlap with smartphone functionality—the more sophisticated, expensive devices have not caught on as quickly as expected." Drew Angerer | Getty Images A customer tries out an Apple Watch Nike+ at an Apple Store in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan, October 28, 2016 in New York City. The tepid growth predicted by eMarketer appears to be in line with other conservative forecasts in the market. Total smartwatch shipments will reach 20.1 million units in 2016, an increase of 3.9 percent from the 19.4 million units shipped in 2015, according to IDC data published in September. While smartwatches struggle, fitness trackers still remain the most popular wearable. Fitness bands accounted for 85 percent of the wearable market in the third quarter, IDC said. EMarketer's data found that younger people are heavier users of wearables with around 30 percent of adults aged between 18 and 34 expected to use such devices in 2017, higher than the 17.6 percent estimate for the overall population. "Younger adults are getting into the wearables market primarily with fitness trackers," eMarketer said. Wearable device makers have been under pressure. Fitbit, the number one vendor by market share, reported revenues that missed analyst expectations in its latest quarter and shares in the firm are down over 74 percent year-to-date. The company recently acquired the assets and intellectual property of rival Pebble in a bid to shore up its offering. Meanwhile, Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that the Apple Watch had its best week of sales ever, without giving specific figures.

Top 2017 iPhone Codenamed “Ferrari,” Featuring OLED and New Internal Design GO Report claims Apple planning three different iPhone models Dec 21, 2016 05:35 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Apple’s next-generation iPhone is expected to bring major overhauls in terms of design and features given the fact that it marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and a new report provides us with a closer glimpse into what Cupertino has in mind for the device. A report from China-based cnbeta (via AI) reveals that Apple plans to launch three different iPhones next year which are currently designated D20, D21, and D22. Oddly enough, the existing models, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, are labeled as D10 and D20, respectively, so Apple might be using the same D20 codename for the next generation. But according to this new leak, Apple is also planning a third model that would come with some exclusive features, and it appears that this version is internally codenamed “Ferrari.” This moniker hints at an exquisite approach for this particular model, and chances are it’ll be indeed the top-of-the-range SKU featuring the long rumored OLED screen. In addition, it could also come with a fingerprint sensor integrated into the display, wireless charging, and a bezel-less design that could be 5.1 or 5.2 inches in size, according to previous reports. The new lineup won’t launch as the iPhone 8, as many sources suggested, but as iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, today’s leak indicates. There’s still no information as to how Apple plans to call the iPhone Ferrari when it launches. New internal design for iPhone Ferrari The display and the new features won’t be the only exclusive upgrades available on the iPhone Ferrari. The Chinese blog also reveals that Apple wants to go for a new internal design that would allow the company to get space for some new components under the hood. The logic board will be divided into two different parts, one of which will be placed at the top and will hold the A11 chip and the NAND flash storage. The second part will be located at the bottom and will be the home of the Wi-Fi and the cellular modules, being connected to the top side via a flex cable. The SIM card tray will be moved to the bottom of the iPhone in order to make more room for components at the top of the phone, the report also reveals. The next-generation iPhone is expected to launch in the fall of 2017, so expect more such reports to emerge in the coming months. #Apple#iPhone#iPhone 7s#iPhone Ferrari subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Seeds Second Betas of macOS Sierra 10.12.3 and iOS 10.2.1 to Developers How Apple Wanted (But Failed) to Boost Battery Life of Its New MacBook Apple AirPods Can Survive Drops and Full Washing Machine Cycles Apple Working on Improved Sound Solutions for Portable Devices, Patent Shows New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    Next iPhone could launch as 7s after all new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Apple Still Planning to Bring the Watch Digital Crown on iPhones more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

The latest leak is of alleged manufacturing documents from Apple's East Asian supply chain, posted to Weibo and picked up by Apple Insider, that seemingly confirm there will indeed be three iPhone models in 2017. Apple iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus: What's the story so far? It's not the first time we've heard there will be three phones next year, but this new leak has more concrete evidence to back it up. It mentions three models: D20, D21 and D22. D20 and D21 are said to be the standard upgraded models over the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, but D22 will be a high-end model, currently codenamed 'Ferrari'. Interestingly, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were known internally as D19 and D20 according to cnBeta. It's unlikely the high-end model will sport a red paint finish and do 0-60mph in under 4 seconds, but it's said to be the model that will feature a bezel-less OLED screen, embedded home button and wireless charging. Apple Insider goes on to say the 'Ferrari' model will receive a complete internal overhaul that will split the logic board into two pieces. One will play host to the new A11 processor chip and flash storage, while the second will house the Wi-Fi and communications components. Apple iPhone 8 might include two 5.5-inch models with dual cameras The 2017 iPhone 8 may be called iPhone 7S after all All iPhone 8 models will have curved OLED screens made by Samsung, says report One thing the leak doesn't talk about is naming of the new models. Some rumours suggest we'll get the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus while others allude to an iPhone 8 because 2017 will mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. As for the high-end model, we're still none the wiser.

Niantic has since debunked the rumors by reassuring gamers that the game was still in development for the Apple Watch. In fact recently it has been discovered by folks at The Silph Road that the latest Pokemon GO APK for Android reveals hints at the Apple Watch app. The Silph Road writes, “Many new references to the watch ‘faces’ and interactions are showing. Code to sync KMs walked has appeared, along with a few other tie-ins to the main app (e.g. the Pokedex). We are not able to see how Apple HealthKit has been integrated, and whether the watch itself will be involved in tracking KMs.” If anything this seems to more or less confirm that the game has been anything but cancelled. It also seems to hint that Niantic could be getting ready to launch the Apple Watch app, but when exactly that will take place remains to be seen. As it stands Niantic has yet to provide gamers with a specific date as to when the game will be released. All we heard from Niantic is that it would be “coming soon”, whether or not this will see a release by the end of 2016 or in time for Christmas is anyone’s guess, but here’s hoping that gamers won’t have to wait too long for it.

Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations TechEye Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations Menu Apple’s airpods are a disaster Posted on December 21, 2016 by Nick Farrell - News Fruity tax-dodging cargo-cult Apple might have surprised the world by getting its Airpods into the shops in time for Christmas, but it turns out they are as useful as having too much ear wax. Early buyers of the ear-buds say that they fall out, which can be expensive if you lose one down the back of the sofa.  But it turns out that in addition to being expensive, they will be a major problem for recyclers. Jobs’ Mob has been touting its environmentally friendly image of late having come under fire in the past for constructing its devices so tightly that their components can be difficult to cost-effectively disassemble for recycling. Apple’s AirPods are a back to the days of creating environmental time bombs. Apple glued-in tiny lithium batteries that make recycling difficult. Kyle Wiens, chief executive of iFixit said that Apple was claiming that these are the future of headphones which means that the planet will see a billion of these things over the next decade. Apple claims the $159 AirPods can be returned to the company for recycling but it did not say how it would go about recycling it itself. The AirPods contain three lithium-ion batteries, one in each pod and one in an accompanying charging case. Recyclers shred wired headphones and send them to a smelter that will melt them down for the copper inside. But the lithium-ion batteries in AirPods cannot be shredded because they could catch fire while being destroyed. The AirPods warn that the they cannot be thrown away in the trash and should be disposed of as electronics waste. Recyclers say it would be too expensive to recycle because it could not be done by hand because it would be too expensive. What is likely then is that the batteries would be shipped to some Chinese landsite where they would be dumped and leak toxic waste which would eventually kill polar bears.

Benchmark Awards Reports Blogs Topics CXO Challenge Whitepapers What's On Apple lashes out at EU in tax ruling appeal By Staff Writer on Dec 21, 2016 10:49AM Brussels says no cause for low tax bill. Apple has appealed against a US$14 billion tax demand as the European Union issued details of its ruling that the iPhone maker won sweetheart tax deals from the Irish government which amounted to illegal subsidies. The tech giant's combative stand -- its lead lawyer said Apple was a "convenient target" for an EU antitrust chief driven by "headlines" -- underlined its anger with the European Commission, which it says ignored evidence from Irish experts before the decision on Aug. 30. The Obama administration also voiced displeasure at what it said was the European Union helping itself to cash that should have ended up in the United States, while many in Silicon Valley saw it as further proof that an envious Europe, having lost out on new tech markets, is trying to rig regulations against them. Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager has rejected those claims and today, while making no new comment on a case which is also being appealed by the Dublin government, the EU executive published an edited text of her judgment. Apple's Irish tax arrangements have allowed it to pay tax at a rate of 3.8 percent on US$200 billion of overseas profits over the past 10 years. This is a fraction of the tax rate in the countries where Apple’s products are designed, made and sold. The low rate is achieved by Apple telling US authorities that the profits are earned by Irish units. Meanwhile, Apple and Ireland agree the profits are generated in the United States. Among elements revealed by the commission's edited text was a record of a meeting between an Apple tax adviser and the Irish revenue service in 1990 in which they discussed setting an apparently arbitrary ceiling on the profit on which Apple's Irish unit would be taxed locally. A year after Apple's Irish branch had recorded a net profit of US$270 million, its tax adviser proposed that no more than US$30-40 million a year be taxed in Ireland, since the rest was attributable to technology and marketing businesses elsewhere. "[Apple’s tax adviser] confessed there was no scientific basis for the figure. However the figure was of such magnitude that he hoped it would be seen to be a bona-fide proposal," the excerpt cited in the commission judgment read. The reference is part of the commission's case that Ireland gave Apple special treatment to induce it to base its European operations in the country and channel profits through Ireland. While independent tax experts scanned the documentation for more clues to Vestager's overall approach, another element that stood out was its concern about the way Dublin did not set time limits on its rulings on how Apple's income would be taxed. That could signal trouble for other multinationals facing Brussels' ire, not just in Ireland but in several other EU countries. US tax reform Apple lodged its appeal at the EU's general court, setting up a legal battle that has strained Transatlantic relations and could remain a factor after celebrity businessman Donald Trump succeeds Obama in the White House next month. The US Treasury Department said in a statement it continued to believe‎ that "the commission is retroactively applying a sweeping new state aid theory that is contrary to well-established legal principles, calls into question the tax rules of individual countries, and threatens to undermine the overall business climate in Europe‎. Moreover, it threatens to erode America's corporate tax base". The Irish government, which faces anger at home among opposition politicians that it is trying to turn down a huge tax windfall, separately published its legal arguments against the commission's case, saying Brussels had exceeded its powers and stepped on EU states' sovereignty. Lawyers have previously said it was impossible to predict how EU courts will rule in an area that has not been tested before. Ireland’s tax treatments, now amended, have allowed Apple to avoid tax on tens of billions of dollars of non-US profit. The commission says the Irish units conducted key functions for developing the Apple brand and that Dublin underestimated their importance when determining their taxable profit. Apple says all the research and development takes place in the United States, which is also where key decisions about its products are made, meaning taxes should be paid there. Under US tax law, however, companies pay tax on global profits but only when they are repatriated to the United States. The incoming Trump administration could change this. © 2016 Thomson Reuters.

This means that either you’ll have to find a new gift, give it as a belated present, or try your luck at third-party resellers. As you can see in the screenshot above, it seems that trying to purchase the Apple Watch Series 2 online you’ll only receive it early January, 2017. Trying to pick it up in the store will not  yield any different results. In fact the screenshot above also shows that you’ll have to wait until January 2017 to get it. We’re not sure what’s with the shortages, but it does seem to indicate that a lot of people are getting the Apple Watch Series 2 for Christmas presents, or are giving it away as presents. Either way this is probably good news for Apple, especially when you consider that the company’s market share in the wearables space is rather low. A report from earlier this month revealed that Fitbit is the current market leader with a market share of 23%. Xiaomi and Garmin are actually ahead of Apple who only commands 4.9% of the market, down from 17.5% the same quarter last year. Filed in Apple >Gadgets.

This means that you won’t be able to downgrade if you run into issues with iOS 10.2. Here’s what it really means. Code Signing With every iOS update, Apple eventually stops signing the code of the previous releases. This is a security measure designed to prevent iOS devices from running code that Apple doesn’t approve. When you power your iDevice on, several things happen (via InfoSec Institute): The processor immediately executes code called the boot ROM. This ROM code is designed during chip fabrication. It contains Apple’s root certificates that is used to signature check the next stages of the boot process. After the signature check, the low level boot loader (LLB) is loaded. It runs a couple of different setup routines and checks the signature of iBoot before it loads. iBoot verifies and runs the iOS kernel, and your device fully boots up. Chain of Trust This process of signature checking is called the Chain of Trust. It makes sure that the low levels of the OS haven’t been tampered with, and that iOS only runs on validated Apple devices. If even one step of the boot process [PDF] can’t load or verify the next process, the startup is stopped and your device will show a Connect to iTunes screen, also known as recovery mode. Code Signing If the entire Boot ROM can’t load or verify the LLB, it enters Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) mode. When this happens and you connect to iTunes, the device is restored to factory default settings. There doesn’t seem to be a definite timeline for how quickly Apple stops signing iOS releases. However, a website called IPSW.me provides the current signed iOS release, as well as a list of unsigned releases and the date on which Apple stopped signing. This Reddit thread also speculates that Apple usually stops signing within a maximum of two weeks. The only Apple users affected by this are jailbreakers, but 9to5Mac noted that there was never a jailbreak available for either iOS 10.1 or iOS 10.1.1.

Read the small print 21 Dec 2016 at 10:01, Danny Bradbury Move to the cloud, they said, everything will be better, they said. Security, reliability, scale. We take the work and the worry off your hands. Except nothing is that simple or straight forward – and that includes cloud. When your IT ran the tin and it crashed, they weren’t running your entire business. If a server flamed out, you’d lose email or the CRM for a few hours. Tops. Today, though, cloud isn’t just running the email or the CRM – it’s running the phones, Office and HR, too. Consolidation means if your cloud provider’s servers crash, so crashes your business. Microsoft, Salesforce, Symantec, Google and Amazon have at different times inflicted crippling outages on customers, taking down their entire businesses for hours and hours – up to 24 hours at times – in Canada and the US, Europe and the rest of the world in some cases. Microsoft and Salesforce, for all their grand promises, are repeat offenders. But Apple made a relatively rare appearance in June: disappearing for nearly eight hours and taking down App Store, iCloud, Apple TV, photos and iMovies. And sure, they all offer X-nines availability with compensation, but in reality that compensation is not just “too little” – it doesn’t begin to cover the inconvenience and loss of productivity and business. Wouldn’t it be nice if service level agreements extended to cover the full impact on a customer’s business? That’s unlikely to happen in the real world. But cloud providers are unlikely to take on business impact liability based on the value of a customer’s data, because it’s a difficult thing to measure and could potentially cost them dearly. “We have to push back and say we can only take responsibility for what’s in our control and we can only take on a certain amount of risk at this price point,” Ross Woodham, director of legal affairs and privacy officer at cloud and hosting firm Cogeco Peer 1, told The Reg. That leaves insurance as an option, but it’s a complex one. Cloud providers can manage some risk using technical protections, although contract costs may go up as they do so. Customers can use technical measures to manage some of the risk at their end, too. The gap in the middle is where insurers might come in, Woodham argued, but the customer must foot that bill. “What the customer is doing and what the risks are associated with that customer’s business is theirs to decide,” he points out. Insurance companies have provided cyber-risk policies to corporate customers for years, explains Ty Sagalow, CEO of cyber-risk insurance and consulting firm Innovation Insurance Group. A veteran of the cyber-risk insurance business, Sagalow reckons he pretty much invented this category of coverage in 2000, when he was working at AIG e-Business Risk Solutions. “Back then in the year 2000, it was only AIG and a couple of Lloyds syndicates,” he said. “Today, fifteen years later, there are over 80 companies that provide cyber-insurance in a multi-billion dollar industry.” The market may be well-populated, but the bulk of cyber-risk insurance products don’t target companies depending on cloud service providers, explain experts. “Trying to insure for a cloud service provider’s system outage is tricky, because the insurance really should be protecting the insured, not the third party that they rely on,” said Michelle Lopilato, director of cyber and technology solutions at insurance broker Hub International. Traditional cyber-risk insurance falls under business interruption. This is first-party coverage for any organization that loses business income and incurs expenses thanks to some cyber-disaster. Not any old disaster, though: It generally only covers a disruption to a service you operate yourself, and it typically focuses on intrusions and data breaches. In short, if you want to insure yourself against having your customer details stolen from your own servers and splattered all over Pastebin, a lot of these companies will help you. Companies wanting to insure against a third-party cloud service going AWOL will need to look at dependent or contingent business interruption, said Bob Parisi, managing director at insurance broker and risk management firm Marsh’s financial and professional liability practice. “That’s where you’re fine, but your cloud vendor isn’t there when you need them and that means you’re not able to function,” he said. These policies are typically not off-the-shelf, said Parisi. “It’s often a special request, where you have to work with the carrier to get the appropriate information from the client.” Contingent business interruption policies may help companies to insure against data loss at the provider level, too, according to Lopilato. “The likelihood of them having some kind of cyber attack at the [cloud service provider] level is likely because that’s where all the data is,” she says. Insuring yourself against a cloud provider disappearing your virtual machines thanks to a system outage leaves you with fewer options. There can be challenges in negotiating system outage contracts, because they’re difficult for underwriters to grapple with. Valuing the loss from a potential data breach may be hard enough, but doing the same thing for an outage is harder still, said Parisi. There are more things to go wrong. Then, customers are asking insurance firms to extend that even further, insuring not just the customer’s systems, but some other company’s. If they get it wrong, the financial blowback could be painful. “Not all carriers will offer the system outages or the system failures or administrative failures,” said Lopilato. “The ones that do, where we see that the client is vulnerable to that kind of loss, we want to get them as much coverage as possible.” Those conversations get difficult, and often focus on how well the customer is protecting themself with their own disaster recovery and business continuity plans. Insurance carriers may ask you to specify which vendors you’re using so that they can evaluate them individually, warned Parisi, adding that this becomes a secondary underwriting exercise. The alternative is to get blanket coverage for every technology service provider you deal with, but you’d better have a mature management process, warned Parisi. “If they’re comfortable with the fact that you’re truly managing your interaction with these vendors in terms of who you let in, redundancies and all this kind of stuff, then you might be able to get it as a blanket for all the vendors,” he said. So, be prepared for lots of paperwork. Most of Parisi’s clients wanting this kind of coverage tend to be larger and more sophisticated. “If you’re a startup, you typically don’t have enough clout to get anything other than off-the-shelf products,” warned Sagalow. A startup with a high-risk third-party cyber insurance requirement that requires negotiation and customisation may not be considered worth an insurance carrier’s time. In some cases, startups will hire an insurance consultant to get insurance carriers to the table, Sagalow added. The problem is that many of these companies may not be sophisticated enough to have those conversations. Where does that leave companies without that negotiating power that rely on cloud service providers for their operation? If a cloud outage would severely impede your business, then it might be best to adopt some technical measures such as multi-cloud failover or a Netflix-like ability to bend, rather than break, when a storm takes out part of your cloud provider’s infrastructure. Alternatively, you could always just try to sue them if they send you out of business, and hope that they have their own liability insurance to cover it.

However, there’s still one big question on the lips of many Nintendo fans – when will Super Mario Run be available to download on Android? Considering the title was originally announced by Nintendo’s Shigeru Miyamoto at Apple’s iPhone event, it was always a given that the title would be available to play first on iOS devices, but exactly how long will Android users have to wait? Will there be an Android version? According to Forbes, Nintendo has already confirmed that they do intend to release an Android version of Super Mario Run. With that in mind, it appears that Nintendo is playing its cards pretty close to its chest when it comes to the Android version of Super Mario Run. Nintendo’s decision to release Super Mario Run on Apple’s ecosystem before Google’s Android isn’t all that much surprising, however. For a start, Nintendo is an incredibly careful company and has in the past, only released software on its own hardware. iOS’ closed ecosystem is a lot closer to Nintendo’s than Android is in that respect. What’s more, the limited number of iOS devices available on the market gives Nintendo a more narrow scope of devices to develop their game, whilst also allowing for greater protection against piracy. Warning: Super Mario Run for Android doesn't exist, so don't download it https://t.co/bX15Bw7W5o by @morlium pic.twitter.com/SgvneRdVaa — PCWorld (@pcworld) December 16, 2016 When will the Android version be released? The news that an Android version is coming is good news for fans of Nintendo, however, exactly when remains to be seen. When Nintendo unveiled Super Mario Run at Apple’s iPhone event in September, the two companies assured that Super Mario Run would be iOS exclusive for now at least. With that in mind, it’s pretty safe to assume that Super Mario Run won’t be available to Android users before the end of the year, or even within the first quarter of 2017. Android is an altogether more difficult platform to develop for in comparison to iOS. That’s because, unlike iOS, there’s a pretty much unlimited variety of Android devices on the market, making it a lot more difficult for Nintendo to ensure the quality they’re known for. Plus, Nintendo isn’t known for being a timely company.

According to the Chicago Tribune, Nintendo has attracted a good deal of criticism for its pricing with Super Mario Run. The game is currently free to download and play from Apple’s App Store, however, when players reach a certain level, they’ll need to make a one-off payment of $9.99 in the US, AU$14.99 in Australia, and £7.99 in the UK to play all six worlds. Whilst that price means Nintendo’s mobile game doesn’t include any adverts of in-app purchases, it’s still received criticism for being too high. Nintendo largely isn’t expected to alter the pricing of Super Mario Run before the game releases on Android. However, considering Android users typically spend less on apps than iOS users, Nintendo may need to rethink their strategy with Super Mario Run ahead of the game’s Android release. That being said, Nintendo is well known for being a pretty stubborn company, suggesting that they’ll most likely keep the price of their Android version in line with that on iOS, no matter the consequences. Nintendo says it doesn’t have plans for any additional Super Mario Run content https://t.co/atYqF9es2o pic.twitter.com/Y2yQYX8J5X — 9to5Mac  (@9to5mac) December 21, 2016 Super Mario Run is available to download and play on Apple’s iPhone and iPad right now, with an Android version expected to release in 2017.

However, if only the best from Apple will do, you might be excited to get your hands on a pair. If you also have an Android device but don’t have money to spend on headphones for it since the AirPods broke the bank, here’s how to pair Apple’s newest creation with your Android device. First, place the AirPods into their charging case. Open the lid, then find the little pairing button on the back of the case. Hold that in for a few seconds and you’ll see the light on the case flash white. This means that the Pods are in pairing mode, so open up the Bluetooth settings on your Android device. Tap the AirPods in the device list, and accept any prompts that come up. This will pair the AirPods to your Android phone (or Windows PC that supports Bluetooth), and they’ll act like a standard pair of Bluetooth buds. Apparently, they still pause music when tapped, even on non-Apple devices. Of course, the AirPods can’t activate Siri or instantly switch between devices when used with Android, but at least you can listen to music with them.

By William Gayde on Dec 20, 2016, 3:45 PM 20 comments TechSpot With all the buzz about MacBooks, iPhones, and AirPods, it's easy to forget what used to be Apple's core product line and what they were founded on. 2016 saw no major desktop releases from Apple, but CEO Tim Cook hasn't forgotten about them or so he's said. In an internal memo obtained by TechCrunch, Cook made it clear that great desktops would be part of Apple's roadmap in the future. Previous rumors centered on the belief that Apple would no longer pursue desktops because the mobile market was growing so quickly. Cook reassured Apple employees that nobody should worry about the issue. He cited key benefits of desktops over portable devices like better performance, higher storage capacity, and a greater variety of I/O. That's definitely a welcomed change of pace over Apple's recent product launches. The desktop refresh cycle at Apple is much slower than with the iPhone and MacBook. Given that the current 5K iMac is still performing well (uses a Core i5 Skylake on the base model), Apple wanted to focus elsewhere for the time being. On the other hand, hardcore Mac users certainly have valid reasons to complain with base iMacs still using standard disk drives and the Mac Pro not receiving any updates whatsoever in three years. Alluding to the recent AirPods release, Tim Cook maintained that Apple will focus on bring together both their hardware and software teams. This is what gave them success in the past and also what Cook hopes will make Apple successful in the future. The latter part of the memo was a bit of a pep talk for employees. Cook touched on renewable energy and the company's culture in what amounts to a very traditional end of year memo. There was no mention however of whether Apple will be focusing on the iMac or Mac Pro but regardless of your opinion on Apple, expect to see many new products in the coming months.

Shares There’s growing evidence that Apple is working with Energous – a company which is developing a wireless charger that can work over up to 15ft, meaning the device it’s charging doesn’t need to be in contact with it. In a research note from market analyst Louis Basenese, obtained by Apple Insider, it’s noted that someone who worked as Regulatory Certification Program Manager at Apple for seven years has recently taken a similar job at Energous. While another senior Energous employee is a member of the same wireless charging ANSI Working Group as Apple. Energous is also apparently aiming to release a mid-range transmitter sometime in the third or early fourth quarter of 2017, which would be in time for the expected iPhone 8 launch.  And Basenese speculates that the rumored move to a glass back on the next iPhone is further evidence that wireless charging is on the way (since it’s trickier to implement through metal). A wire-free future On their own, these things could be written off as coincidences, but when you consider existing evidence – such as the fact that Energous itself has previously said it’s working with “one of the top five consumer electronics companies”, and has partnered with Dialog Semiconductor – a company which primarily supplies chips to Apple, it starts to look a lot more convincing. If the iPhone 8 does have long-distance wireless charging that could give it a massive selling point over the competition, and make wireless charging genuinely a lot more useful than wired. That’s a big if, but even if it just uses more conventional short-range wireless charging it looks like the iPhone 8 could go wire-free, as it’s also recently been rumored that Foxconn is experimenting with the tech for Apple. There are unlikely to be any firm answers for a while, but the days of plugging your iPhone in could be numbered. The iPhone 8 could also have a 3D camera Tags iPhone ABOUT THE AUTHOR James Rogerson James is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

However at the end of the day, they are still monitors which means that if you have the necessary ports, you should be able to use it just fine. In fact you’ll be pleased to learn that if you have an older Mac, the displays will work just fine with them. In a support document posted on Apple’s website, the company revealed that the new UltraFine displays will play nicely with older Macs. All users will need to do is purchase a Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter and they should be good to go. However the only downside here is that your resolution will be lowered. This means that the 27-inch 5K LG UltraFine display, which should display a resolution of 5120×2880 @ 60Hz on Apple’s latest laptops, will instead display a resolution of 3840×2160 @ 60Hz on the older Macs. These older Macs includes the 2013 Mac Pro, 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pros from mid-2014 or later, the 27-inch iMac from late 2014, the 21.5-inch iMac (Retina and non-Retina) from late 2015 or newer, or the 11- and 13-inch MacBook Air from early 2015 onwards. Presumably devices not listed above will not play nicely with the new LG UltraFines. That being said the decrease in resolution is a bit of a bummer since the 5K resolution is probably one of the reasons customers purchase it in the first place, but if you’re not too fussed then we guess this is a setup you could check out. Also keep in mind that Apple’s discount on the displays has been extended to March 2017, so you still have time to take advantage of it if you choose. Filed in Apple >Computers. Read more about LG.

Patent filing indicates this just might be true Apple may bring the dual-SIM facility in the new iPhone 8 series in 2017, which also marks the company's 10th anniversary of its first ever mobile handset. Rohit KVN   December 21, 2016 16:18 IST 2 Shares 2 Shares [Representational Image] Will Apple iPhone 8 come with dual SIM? patent filing hints it might In Picture: Customers take a look at the new iPhone 7 smartphone inside of an Apple Inc. store, September 16, 2016.REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz Apple might bring the much awaited dual-SIM capability in the new iPhone in 2017, which also marks the company 10th anniversary of its first ever mobile handset. The company has filed a couple of patents related to the incorporation of a dual-SIM tray in a phone at the regional United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Apple has also filed similar patents at the State Intellectual Property Office of China too, Forbes reported. Also read: Samsung bricks Galaxy Note7 in US; here are 7 top flagship phablet alternatives As per the patent filed by Li Su, principal architect for cellular software at Apple is named as the inventor. It says a dual-SIM card feature would allow the iPhone to store two phone numbers. Why is Apple adopting dual-SIM for iPhones now? The revelation comes at a very crucial juncture for Apple, as it is finding really hard to arrest the fall in iPhone sales. With the US and developed markets reaching its peak in terms of smartphone penetration, India is emerging as the biggest and fastest growing smartphone market almost clocking at more than 15% growth rate every quarter. Currently, Apple holds a meagre two percent share in the Indian smartphone market. One of the prime reasons for the company's failure is the iPhone's expensive price due to a high import tax. Just a day ago, a report emerged that Apple is contemplating to set up a local manufacturing plant to build iPhones and is already in talks with the Indian government for tax exemption, which would eventually cut down the manufacturing costs and they will be able to pass on the benefits to consumers by selling the device at lower prices. Apple rivals Samsung, Lenovo (including Moto, formerly known as Motorola) and Xiaomi, among others, have already commenced local production. Due to import duties imposed on the iPhones, they cost Rs 12,000 to Rs 15,000 more in India, compared to the US and other developed markets. Also read: Apple iPhone 8 round-up: What we know so far If Apple does commence local assembling of iPhones, it is certain to bring the cost of the devices down and if they equip the iPhone with dual-SIM tray, it will definitely attract more buyers in India and also in China, as most of the local population uses different SIM for voice call and internet data. Also read: Apple may 'Make in India', so will iPhones, iPads, Macs get cheaper? Apart from Apple, all other phone brands in both the countries offer dual-SIM options. So far, Apple has not made any official comments whether it has any plans of using dual SIM slots in future iPhones. If the Cupertino-based company manages to find space for two SIMs in iPhone 8 (aka iPhone 7s) series, there is no doubt it will be able to celebrate 10th anniversary iPhone launch with blockbuster sales in 2017.

When Apple kicked the headphone jack to the curb in September in favor of wireless headsets, all eyes were on the change and futuristic-looking earpieces. After all, the company was betting big on its wire-free earbuds and wasn't afraid to upset some Apple fans along the way. The concept is simple: Users sync the earpieces up with an iPhone (via Bluetooth) to play music, take calls and send Siri requests. But AirPods raised a lot of questions. To start, it looked like Apple (AAPL, Tech30) chopped the wires off of its existing EarPods and turned them into oversized plastic earrings. Would people actually wear these? Another question: How well would they actually stay put? Not to mention how lose-able each earpiece appears to be. It's hard enough to keep track of wired earbuds. But after spending a few days with the AirPods -- now available in stores and online orders arriving at doorsteps on Wednesday -- one thing is clear: Don't worry too much about them flying out of ears. We did jumping jacks, head bangs and even somersaults while wearing AirPods. They handled movement surprisingly well. There were times the AirPods became somewhat loose, but all normal activities such as walking and jogging far with them exceeded our expectations. Some users, however, have already reported issues with the set staying in place. Apple Airpods review: can they handle a grown man's somersaults? #Content pic.twitter.com/qxGzaDpXL3— Don Yemen (@ramyzab) December 21, 2016 The fit is comfortable too; we forgot we were wearing them after about 30 minutes. The issue, however, of potentially losing one when you've left the pair on the kitchen table is another story. Sure, the cleverly-designed AirPods case, which doubles as a charger, keeps them intact, but it's not insurance you'll always be able to find both them when you want. (This is more about the user than the product itself). Related: You can already buy a $10 wire for Apple's wireless AirPods The good news is if you've misplaced one, the other still works. But it's ultimately a costly mistake to fix: Replacement earpieces cost $69 each. The sound quality is surprisingly strong for such small set. Wireless headphones and earbuds are notorious for less-than-stellar audio, but AirPods pack a powerful punch. The stems host the antennas and bring the microphone closer to your mouth. It also comes with internal sensors, so if you take one earpiece out, whatever you're listening to or watching will pause. AirPods can interact directly with Siri, too. The voice assistant takes requests, such as providing weather updates or opening apps, after tapping the side of either earpiece. But Siri integration isn't perfect. It works better with Apple's built-in apps, but it's limited when it comes to third-party programs (i.e. you'll often need to reach for your phone to perform tasks, such as upping the volume). Related: Apple's headphone jack: all your angry questions answered Getting Siri to work can also be a challenge. It often takes several taps on the earpiece to get a response. The same issue surfaced for answering phone calls. But the AirPods' ability to otherwise take calls is impressive. With a synced iPhone on a desk about 230 feet away, we could clearly engage in a phone conversation without needing the device nearby. But those who don't have an iPhone and want to use the AirPods may be in luck: they also work with Android products. Meanwhile, the AirPods charging case is brilliantly designed. Resembling a small container of dental floss, it snugly houses each earpiece. The case gets about a day's worth of charge before it needs refueling (via a Lightning cable). AirPods placed inside receive about a five hour power boost after just 15 minutes. That's pretty solid mileage, but if you're new to wireless headsets, remembering to charge yet another gadget comes with a learning curve. Although investing in the future of wireless audio technology isn't cheap, the AirPods are priced competitively at $160. Other wireless earbud options cost more, such as the Samsung Gear iconix ($199) or Jabra Elite Sport ($239). The concept of wireless earbuds in general might take some time for a mass audience to accept, but in a few years, we'll likely look back on how weird it was that we once wore wires dangling from our ears.

Now the 5K display has reached 'retail' and is orderable online at Apple.com for $974 (£884 in the UK). Please note that orders won't be fulfilled for approx 2 to 4 weeks. LG's specially made 27-inch UltraFine 5K Display offers users "a stunning 5120x2880 resolution and P3 wide colour". The 'retina' style high pixel density display brings images and videos to life with the wide colour gamut and 500 cd/m² of brightness. Used with a MacBook Pro, in MacOS, it is simple for users to adjust monitor volume and brightness without the need for physical buttons. As it is targeted at users of the new MacBook Pro machines, LG's 5K display exclusively offers Thunderbolt 3 connectivity. This 14.7 million pixel packing monitor uses a single provided 2m Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) cable, which supports 5K video, audio and data simultaneously - all while supplying up to 85W of charging energy to your MacBook Pro. There are three further USB-C ports (USB 3.1 Gen 1, 5Gbps) available. LG's monitor uses a built-in PSU, so there isn't a power brick to be seen. The monitor bezel features a built-in camera and microphone, plus stereo speakers. While the monitor comes with a stand it is VESA mountable too. "Great Desktops" on the way from Apple In one more Apple Mac related news nugget, company CEO Tim Cook posted a message on an employee message board insisting that Apple is still committed to desktop computers. As TechCrunch reports "Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops," wrote Cook. "If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." The new Macs will bring the generally improved performance you see in desktop computers plus a greater variety of I/O. It's not sure which desktop Mac range will get upgraded first.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming CES 2017 GPS & Sat Nav Mobile Apps Mobile Phone Accessories Mobile Phones Tablets Wearables & Fitness Trending: Christmas Gift Guide Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / Mobile / Fitness / Apple AirPods Apple AirPods 0 shares Read Comments By Max Parker Updated: 21 December 2016 1 of 5 Summary Page 1: Apple AirPods: First listen 5 Pictures Best Deals for Apple AirPods Key Features W1 chip 5-hour battery life Included battery case provides further five charges Completely wireless Works with iOS, Mac and Android (with limited functions) Manufacturer: Apple Review Price: £159.99 What do we think after 24 hours with Apple's controversial AirPods? Following a few delays, Apple’s first totally wireless set of earbuds are here. And they’re actually a lot better than I'd expected. Announced alongside the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the AirPods were meant to be for those who bemoaned the lack of a headphone jack on the new phones – because who needs an old jack when you have a fancy new set of wireless buds? Instead, they quickly became an internet meme and have been compared to an electric toothbrush head, encased in a dental-floss holder. WATCH: Google Pixel vs iPhone 7 A few months on and I’ve finally got my hands on a pair of AirPods, and in many ways they’re the perfect wireless earphones. In other ways, they’re a bit odd. My first concern is the design. AirPods look as though someone has taken a pair of scissors to the cord of some EarPods, leaving only the buds. They look just like Apple’s older earphones – those that accompanied your iPhone – but the stem is slightly elongated to accommodate the improved microphones. Some will think they look odd protruding slightly from your ears like an über-futuristic Bluetooth headset, but they don't bother me. They’re surprisingly subtle when viewed face on, although I'd have preferred a matte black colour scheme to white. It wouldn't be a surprise if a Jet Black model appears so Jet Black iPhones can buy a matching pair. Related: Best Wireless Headphones My second concern is fit, because what use are earphones this small and delicate if they just fall out. In my ears they fit perfectly, however, nestling comfortably within. Even when vigorously shaking my head, they refuse to fall out. But then I've never had a problem with the fit of EarPods; but I know others who have. I passed the AirPods around a group of friends and found that in around 50% of folk they fell out after even a slight shake of the head, while others managed to retain them in place despite some strong movement. So it appears the experience varies from one person to the next, so it seems naive of Apple to not include any tips to improve the fit of the AirPods. My advice would be to try them out before you buy. Sound quality is clearly important in a pair of headphones, but it’s the weakest part of the AirPods. They're not terrible, but considering the price – that’s £159/$179 – I was expecting more. There's certainly more bass than the EarPods; but they lack clarity in vocals, and guitar-heavy music sounds a bit mushy and smooth. I’ll have more thoughts on the sound quality in the full review. In general, Bluetooth headphones are good – but few are great. I love my Bose QC35s and I know our Home Technology editor Ced Yuen swears by Sony’s excellent MDR-1000X, but they still suffer issues. With Bluetooth headphones to date, audio is prone to cutting out when you put the phone in your pocket, and pairing is a cumbersome affair of pressing a myriad of buttons and hoping the connection is made. Most of what makes the AirPods so exciting is the W1 chip tucked inside that addresses both issues. Related: Best Headphones for Runners Pairing is as simple as opening the battery case, popping it next to your iPhone and waiting. A message will appear, tap "connect" and you’re done. After which the battery status will show up. It's incredibly simple. What’s even cooler is that those AirPods are now connected to every other iPad, MacBook, Apple Watch signed in with your iCloud account. I opened up my MacBook and there they were, sitting in the Bluetooth menu. Whatever you think about the design, that’s darn clever. Range is excellent, too, with audio never seeming to drop. The W1 chips really appears to be the future. There are a bunch of accelerometers inside too, just like an iPhone. These know when you put the AirPods in and start the music, and they pause when you remove one. You can keep one ‘Pod in the case and all audio will be routed through the one in your ear. Tap on the centre and Siri will pop up, too, which is another nice touch. I'd have liked some sort of skip-track feature, as well as volume changing options, though – I feel a bit stupid asking Siri to do it – but you can switch out Siri so the tap simply pauses the music. Battery life is the final piece of the jigsaw, but I haven’t had these buds in my ears long enough to make a judgement call on that yet. Apple says you’ll get five hours of continuous playback, plus the supplied charging case will then power up the AirPods fully a further four times. That’s about 24 hours of listening – better than most other pairs of completely wireless earphones we’ve tried; I hope it lives up to billing. First Impressions I’m strangely intrigued by the AirPods – they’re a lot more exciting than they appeared when first announced. They’re clever in so many ways, not least the seriously impressive W1 chip, but their "love it or hate it" design could do major lasting damage. Best Deals for Apple AirPods 0 shares Read Comments PDAJah December 21, 2016, 1:20 pm Sound quality is the weakest part of the Airpods! And at a cost of £160! Digitocrepitus December 21, 2016, 2:47 pm Top tip - cutting the wires off an old pair of pods provides almost all the benefits of the airpods. The sound quality is obviously terrible, but spending £0 on 0/10 sound quality is a better idea than spending £160 on 2/10 sound quality. RonRoyce December 21, 2016, 5:13 pm Sound quality is everything, if they sound poor at £150 there is no point in buying them. The design is stupid if it only fits certain ear canals. Moreover, you would have to try a dummy pod for fitment and the shops would have to sterilise them after each try. In ear phones cannot simply be taken back if you have used them because of hygiene issues. This from Amazon's returns policy:- "Please note we are unable to accept returns for in-ear/canal headphones due to hygienic reasons." PGrGr December 21, 2016, 7:23 pm I'm more interested in hearing how well they stand up when compared to the myriad of other wireless earbuds floating round the pages of Indiegogo and Kickstarter. Any comments to add on this subject? Ben Shayler December 21, 2016, 9:46 pm I got hold of some airpods on monday, having tried them for a couple of days i have returned them: Up until this week I have been using a cheap TaoTronics bluetooth earphone (with wire) and been perfectly happy with them. The airpods connect brilliantly to my iPhone 6 and do not dropout and the distance they will stay in range is fantastic. I have tried them on the tube and buses and with so much background noise the music was almost inaudible or you end up turning the volume to full which isn't good for your hearing. Secondly the lack of a volume control and skip function means i would always have to get my phone out or use my watch. Granted not hard to do but nowhere near as convenient as having an inline remote as the TaoTronics do. For now I'm going to stick with the cheap pair.. TacticalTimbo December 23, 2016, 2:29 am I have the iPhone 7 Plus and Bose SoundLink around-ear 2, and NEVER have they broken up/lost connection. Also pairing is instantaneous, and the battery lasts forever, like ridiculously long!

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming CES 2017 GPS & Sat Nav Mobile Apps Mobile Phone Accessories Mobile Phones Tablets Wearables & Fitness Trending: Christmas Gift Guide Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6S Google Pixel Galaxy S7 Home / News / Mobile Phone News / Leaked documents seem to confirm three iPhones for 2017, one codenamed Ferrari Leaked documents seem to confirm three iPhones for 2017, one codenamed Ferrari by Joe Roberts 21 December 2016 0 shares Read Comments Although we're some months away from the arrival of the iPhone 8, the leaks are flooding in already, and now it looks like we have further proof that Apple intends to launch three handsets next year. Previous reports from analysts have suggested Apple is readying three devices, two of which are said to be iterative updates, which could be called the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus. The other device is thought to be the iPhone 8, and is said to feature a major design overhaul with an almost full-face OLED screen and no home button. Related: CES 2017 And now, purported Apple manufacturing documents which seemingly confirm these plans have shown up on Chinese social media site Weibo (via AppleInsider). The documents appear to reveal that Apple is indeed working on three handsets for a 2017 launch, including the high-end variant, thought to be the iPhone 8, codenamed "Ferrari". A Weibo user known for leaking information from Apple's East Asian supply chain provided the latest documents, which also seem to reveal the three models are currently being referred to as D20, D21, and D22. The iPhone 7 is said to be getting an iterative update as part of Apple's 2017 plans What's more, the documents seem to confirm reports of the high-end model featuring an almost edge-to-edge AMOLED display, which is said to feature on a handset with a similar form factor to the current iPhone models. According to the report, this "Ferrari" model will also break the logic board into two discrete units which will be connected by a flex cable, with the phone's main hardware stored on one unit, and Wi-Fi and other communications tech on the other. Related: iPhone 7 Apple is also said to be considering moving the SIM card tray to the bottom of the handset, which should free up room for the internal hardware. As with all leaks of this sort, it's best to take the apparent revelations with a pinch of salt, as it's impossible to verify the information, and Apple is remaining characteristically tight-lipped on the matter. There's several months to go until we learn exactly what the company has in-store, so expect the leaks to keep coming, and make sure to stay tuned for the latest.

Apple AirPods review: Do they actually stay in your ears? Posted on Wednesday, December 21, 2016 by CNN in Business News After significant delays and months of hype, Apple AirPods are finally here. When Apple kicked the headphone jack to the curb in September in favor of wireless headsets, all eyes were on the change and futuristic-looking earpieces. After all, the company was betting big on its wire-free earbuds and wasn’t afraid to upset some Apple fans along the way. The concept is simple: Users sync the earpieces up with an iPhone (via Bluetooth) to play music, take calls and send Siri requests. But AirPods raised a lot of questions. To start, it looked like Apple chopped the wires off of its existing EarPods and turned them into oversized plastic earrings. Would people actually wear these? Another question: How well would they actually stay put? Not to mention how lose-able each earpiece appears to be. It’s hard enough to keep track of wired earbuds. But after spending a few days with the AirPods — now available in stores and online orders arriving at doorsteps on Wednesday — one thing is clear: Don’t worry too much about them flying out of ears. We did jumping jacks, head bangs and even somersaults while wearing AirPods. They handled movement surprisingly well. There were times the AirPods became somewhat loose, but all normal activities such as walking and jogging far with them exceeded our expectations. Some users, however, have already reported issues with the set staying in place. The fit is comfortable too; we forgot we were wearing them after about 30 minutes. The issue, however, of potentially losing one when you’ve left the pair on the kitchen table is another story. Sure, the cleverly-designed AirPods case, which doubles as a charger, keeps them in tact, but it’s not insurance you’ll always be able to find both them when you want. (This is more about the user than the product itself). The good news is if you’ve misplaced one, the other still works. But it’s ultimately a costly mistake to fix: Replacement earpieces cost $69 each. The sound quality is surprisingly strong for such small set. Wireless headphones and earbuds are notorious for less-than-stellar audio, but AirPods pack a powerful punch. The stems host the antennas and bring the microphone closer to your mouth. It also comes with internal sensors, so if you take one earpiece out, whatever you’re listening to or watching will pause. AirPods can interact directly with Siri, too. The voice assistant takes requests, such as providing weather updates or opening apps, after tapping the side of either earpiece. But Siri integration isn’t perfect. It works better with Apple’s built-in apps, but it’s limited when it comes to third-party programs (i.e. you’ll often need to reach for your phone to perform tasks, such as upping the volume). Getting Siri to work can also be a challenge. It often takes several taps on the earpiece to get a response. The same issue surfaced for answering phone calls. But the AirPods’ ability to otherwise take calls is impressive. With a synced iPhone on a desk about 230 feet away, we could clearly engage in a phone conversation without needing the device nearby. But those who don’t have an iPhone and want to use the AirPods may be in luck: they also work with Android products. Meanwhile, the AirPods charging case is brilliantly designed. Resembling a small container of dental floss, it snugly houses each earpiece. The case gets about a day’s worth of charge before it needs refueling (via a Lightning cable). AirPods placed inside receive about a five hour power boost after just 15 minutes. That’s pretty solid mileage, but if you’re new to wireless headsets, remembering to charge yet another gadget comes with a learning curve. Although investing in the future of wireless audio technology isn’t cheap, the AirPods are priced competitively at $160. Other wireless earbud options cost more, such as the Samsung Gear iconix ($199) or Jabra Elite Sport ($239). The concept of wireless earbuds in general might take some time for a mass audience to accept, but in a few years, we’ll likely look back on how weird it was that we once wore wires dangling from our ears. 2016: A tipping point for excitement in self-driving cars Stocks set to shine; Coca-Cola deal; Watching the banks Related Posts Violent protests ahead of Greek bailout vote Hundreds arrested as Beijing launches stock market crackdown Reddit launching original video unit AG Warns of Internet ‘Modeling Job’ Scams Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

To celebrate the launch on iPhone and iPad, creator Shigeru Miyamoto used an iPad Pro and Apple Pencil to quickly sketch an exclusive illustration of Mario as noted in our cover graphic. Today it's being reported that Nintendo's first Mario smartphone title has set a download record but gamers baulked at the one-time cost of unlocking content, prompting investors to push the Japanese game makers' stock to a one-month low.   Reuters reports today that "Super Mario Run hit 25 million downloads just four days after its Dec. 15 release in 151 countries on Apple's App Store, earning gross sales of about $21 million." Others are reporting the number is 40 million.    Reuters further notes that "Nintendo shares have lost 11 percent since the launch as the latest game to feature Nintendo's princess-rescuing Italian plumber received negative reviews from users mainly complaining about its $9.99 one-time cost, rather than the usual model of paying small amounts for special features.   'Mario is arguably the most popular gaming franchise in the world, yet we see only about 8 percent of those who try the game actually purchasing it,' said Sensor Tower analyst Spencer Gabriel. 'I don't think this is a statement on the game's quality ... but rather the perceived value when compared to free-to-play games that offer much more content with optional micro-transactions that enable players to experience it sooner.'   Super Mario Run is free to download on the App Store where, in Japan, it is rated 2.5 stars out of 5 based on 1,095 reviews.   'This is a fee app disguised as a free app,' wrote reviewer Racing Game Guy. 'You need to pay after playing for 10 minutes. I don't mind paying but the fee is a bit big. It's a disappointment after waiting with so much expectation.'"   There's more to the Reuters story here. It's really hard to understand the uproar over this. My wife bought a game called Pearl's Peril based on in-app purchases. I think there's been 10-15 points of paying $3.00 so that the game could continue. My wife gave up playing it as it was as much as an Xbox game for goodness sake for a tiny iPhone app. That's a practice that's terrible and so complaining over an honest one-time $10 fee and making a negative story about it is disingenuous and downright ignorant.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

By Owen Hughes December 21, 2016 11:23 GMT Desperate Apple fans are paying silly money to avoid shipping delaysReuters Apple's new wireless AirPods have only been available for a matter of days and already fans are clamouring to grab themselves a pair. So much so that the earphones selling for up to £340 on eBay, meaning you could double your profits if you've been lucky enough to snag yourself a pair and haven't yet stuck them in your lugholes. The new Apple AirPods went on sale online in the UK on 13 December and have been available to buy in-store since Monday. The £159 earphones have suffered a series of delays getting to shelves, arriving well after their intended October release date. These delays are still being felt now, with Apple's website giving an estimated shipping date of six weeks. Clearly this is too long to wait for Apple die-hards, who are now clearing out the Christmas shopping fund just to get their hands on the lose-tastic new Apple accessory. Yet in this case, it literally pays to be patient. A new, boxed pair of AirPods are selling for between £245 and £293 on eBay, with the highest sold bid going for £339 – more than double the retail price. There are currently hundreds of ongoing bids for the earphones on the website, with more optimistic sellers flogging their AirPods for up to £500 – that's with "guaranteed" delivery before Christmas, mind. You can make a tidy profit if you're willing to wait another six weeks for Apple's new earphones Even so, we can't recommend paying more than the already-high £159 asking price for the courtesy of walking around with these in your ears. While the new W1 integrated chip makes connectivity a breeze and provides truly intuitive auto-pausing magic, tired design and lacklustre audio quality make AirPods a hit-and-miss Apple accessory. There's a high price to pay for losing them too, with Apple charging £65 for a single AirPod replacement.

 Apple's new AirPods tough to recycle: report Reuters Dec. 20, 2016, 8:02 AM 5,707 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple AirPods are displayed during a media event in San Francisco Thomson Reuters By Stephen Nellis SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc's new wireless headphones could be a problem for recyclers, according to an electronics firm that took apart the device to review its component parts. Apple has been promoting a more environmentally conscious image for the company after having come under fire in the past for constructing its devices so tightly that their components can be difficult to cost-effectively disassemble for recycling. But Apple's latest 4-gram wireless headphones, or AirPods, have glued-in tiny lithium batteries that make recycling difficult, said Kyle Wiens, chief executive of iFixit, the company which took apart the AirPods and has previously analyzed other Apple products. "They're basically saying this is the future of headphones," said Wiens. He estimates Apple has sold 1.4 billion pairs of iPhone and iPod headphones, weighing about 31 million pounds. Given that the iPhone 7 ships without a traditional headphone jack, AirPods may signal Apple's future. "There could easily be a billion of these things over the next 10 years," Wiens said. Apple has said that the $159 AirPods can be returned to the company for recycling. A spokesman declined to comment further on recycling the devices. The headphones, which Apple released last week after a one-month delay, have garnered positive reviews. The AirPods contain three lithium-ion batteries, one in each pod and one in an accompanying charging case. Recyclers can shred wired headphones and send them to a smelter that will melt them down for the copper inside. But the lithium-ion batteries in AirPods cannot be shredded because they could catch fire while being destroyed. The AirPods carry regulatory markings that say they are not intended to be thrown away in the trash and should be disposed of as electronics waste. Willie Cade, CEO of Chicago-based PC Rebuilders & Recyclers, who was briefed on the AirPods' construction by iFixit, said the labor involved in removing the batteries would make it hard to cost-effectively recover any of the materials from the devices. "I can't do it by hand. It's cost prohibitive," Cade said, adding that the AirPods would need to go into a shredder, but that "there's a relatively high risk of fire".

Mac upgrades, once a frequent ritual, are few and far between. The Mac Pro, Apple's marquee computer, hasn't been refreshed since 2013. The affordable and flexible Mac mini was last upgraded in 2014. And when a new machine does roll out, the results are sometimes underwhelming, if not infuriating, to devotees. In October, after more than 500 days without an update, Apple unveiled the new MacBook Pro, with a slimmer design and louder speakers. The laptop garnered mostly favorable reviews from the technology press but grumbles from creative types, a key constituency, who said the device under-performed rival products. (Also see:  CEO Tim Cook Says 'Great Desktops' Are Coming From Apple)Interviews with people familiar with Apple's inner workings reveal that the Mac is getting far less attention than it once did. They say the Mac team has lost clout with the famed industrial design group led by Jony Ive and the company's software team. They also describe a lack of clear direction from senior management, departures of key people working on Mac hardware and technical challenges that have delayed the roll-out of new computers. While the Mac generates about 10 percent of Apple sales, the company can't afford to alienate professional designers and other business customers. After all, they helped fuel Apple's revival in the late 1990s. In a stinging critique, Peter Kirn, founder of a website for music and video creators, wrote: "This is a company with no real vision for what its most creative users actually do with their most advanced machines." If more Mac users switch, the Apple ecosystem will become less sticky-opening the door to people abandoning higher-value products like the iPhone and iPad. People now have more options. Microsoft, once derided by Mac loyalists for its clunky, buggy software, offers Windows 10, which provides the tablet type functionality Apple pioneered with the iPad. Microsoft's Surface computers offer Apple-esque quality and a well-reviewed creative paint program aimed at the Mac's audience. Sensing an opportunity, Microsoft called the MacBook Pro a "disappointment" and said more users than ever were switching to its Surface laptops. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. However, the company has said the Macintosh remains one of its most important products and denies it takes a back seat to other gadgets. Four years ago at Apple's annual developer conference, marketing chief Phil Schiller pledged to keep the computer front and centre in the company's product arsenal. "Nobody turns over their entire line as quickly and completely as we do at Apple," Schiller said. "We're really proud of the engineering team and the work they do to do this quick so you can get the exact product you need." Two years later, the company held a 30th birthday party for the Macintosh, a splashy event that featured a OneRepublic concert at Apple's Cupertino, California headquarters. The company also created a website celebrating the Mac's history. To be fair, Apple depends on Intel Corp., which still makes key chips for Macs. Like the rest of the PC industry, Apple's innovation and product cycles are sometimes constrained by when Intel produces new chips-a process that's getting more difficult. Making a laptop stand out is also harder these days. But when Apple has tried to leapfrog the competition, it has fallen short. Take the company's attempt to create a longer-lasting battery for the MacBook Pro. Apple engineers wanted to use higher capacity battery packs shaped to the insides of the laptop versus the standard square cells found in most machines. The design would have boosted battery life. (Also see:  Some MacBook Pro 2016 Users Are Reporting Battery Life Issues) In the run-up to the MacBook Pro's planned debut this year, the new battery failed a key test, according to a person familiar with the situation. Rather than delay the launch and risk missing the crucial holiday shopping season, Apple decided to revert to an older design. The change required roping in engineers from other teams to finish the job, meaning work on other Macs languished, the person said. The new laptop didn't represent a game-changing leap in battery performance, and a software bug misrepresented hours of power remaining. Apple has since removed the meter from the top right-hand corner of the screen. (Also see:  MacBook Pro 2016 With Touch Bar Gets Lowest Possible Repairability Score) In the Mac's heyday, people working on new models could expect a lot of attention from Ive's team. Once a week his people would meet with Mac engineers to discuss ongoing projects. Mac engineers brought prototypes to Ive's studio for review, while his lieutenants would visit the Mac labs to look at early concepts. Those visits have become less frequent since the company began focusing more on more-valuable products like the iPhone and iPad, and the change became even more obvious after the design team's leadership was shuffled last year, according to a person familiar with the situation. In another sign that the company has prioritized the iPhone, Apple re-organized its software engineering department so there's no longer a dedicated Mac operating system team. There is now just one team, and most of the engineers are iOS first, giving the people working on the iPhone and iPad more power. That's part of a broader shift toward making Macs more like iPhones. Apple prioritizes features, like thinness and minimal ports, that sell its iPhones and iPads, which generated about 75 percent of revenue this year. Those are contrary to professional needs, like maximum computing power. Early prototypes of the 12-inch MacBook used the iPhone's Lightning connector, although this was ditched for a more standard USB-C port. There was even a gold MacBook Pro planned, but this was shelved because the color didn't look good on such a large product. In recent years, Apple managers have also become more likely to float two or more competing ideas, meaning designers and engineers must work on more than one concept at a time. In the past, managers pushed a more singular vision. Engineers are now "asked to develop multiple options in hopes that one of them will be shippable," a person familiar with the matter said. When the company was developing the first 12-inch MacBook, Apple tested two primary prototypes. One, known internally as Stealth Fighter, was lighter. The second, a slightly less ambitious design known as Stealth Bomber, was heavier. The lighter model prevailed, but with engineers developing and testing two competing concepts, they had less time to figure out how to cram all the electronics into a thin slab of aluminum that would hold together. In the end, Apple shipped the laptop in 2015, months after its 2014 goal. For a 2016 MacBook update, some Apple engineers wanted to add a Touch ID fingerprint scanner and a second USB-C port (which would have made some power users happy). The update instead included a new rose gold color option alongside a standard speed increase. The internal turmoil has taken a toll. More than a dozen engineers and managers working on Mac hardware have left for different Apple teams or other companies in the past year and a half, said people familiar with the situation. Some were looking for a less all-consuming work environment, while others felt the future of Mac hardware was unclear in a world of iPhones and iPads. In 2013, Apple launched a redesigned Mac Pro, a black cylinder with bright white LED lights. It was a powerful desktop machine created partly to cast a halo over the entire Macintosh lineup. The Mac Pro was also the first Apple computer in years to be assembled in the US. Under pressure from politicians to create manufacturing jobs at home, Apple was looking to score political points. The decision caused production headaches though. The Mac Pro's glossy exterior and chrome beveled edges meant Apple had to make its own manufacturing tools and then train people to run those machines in an assembly plant. This slowed production and constrained Apple's ability to make enough computers to meet demand. Three years on, the Mac Pro is ripe for an upgrade with its chips and connector ports lagging rival products. Because of the earlier challenges, some Apple engineers have raised the possibility of moving production back to Asia, where it's cheaper and manufacturers have the required skills for ambitious products, according to a person familiar with those internal discussions. The political environment is tougher for such a move now. During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump hammered Apple for building most of its products overseas and since his election he has pushed other companies to keep some jobs in the US. Still, Apple hasn't given up on Macs. In a recent company Q&A session, employees asked whether Mac desktop computers remain strategically important. "We have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that," Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said, according to a transcript of the discussion obtained by Bloomberg News. The latest MacBook Pro has a "Touch Bar," a thin touchscreen built into the keyboard that lets users quickly access app shortcuts, change system settings, and pick emojis. The laptop also has Touch ID to speed up online purchases and a giant trackpad for easier gesture control. Apple designers are already exploring standalone keyboards with the touch strip and a fingerprint reader for desktops. Apple will decide whether to release these based on how well the features do on the MacBook Pro. Mac fans shouldn't hold their breath for radical new designs in 2017 though. Instead, the company is preparing modest updates: USB-C ports and a new Advanced Micro Devices Inc. graphics processor for the iMac, and minor bumps in processing power for the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro.

Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 115.82 -0.91 -0.78% To this day, the Mac Pro remains one of the few products that Apple (AAPL) actually manufactures in the U.S. And it's not just final assembly that takes place stateside, either; Apple even makes other components like the metal chassis for the professional desktop here in the U.S. When the company unveiled the new is-it-a-trash-can-or-a-jet-engine design in 2013, it made sure to point out the shift in manufacturing. At the time, like now, Apple was on the receiving end of criticism regarding its use of Asian contract manufacturers abroad (although the Mac Pro facility is operated by Singapore-based contract manufacturer Flextronics). CEO Tim Cook tweeted about it: Watching the Mac Pro come together in Austin yesterday,thanks to a team loaded with American manufacturing expertise. pic.twitter.com/5LcCOFIVgC— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) June 6, 2014 It was a big deal at the time, even if mostly symbolic. Apple earned some political goodwill in the process, while minimizing the financial impact by choosing one of its lowest-volume -- and most expensive -- products to make at home. Here's the thing: Apple would still probably prefer to kill off its U.S. manufacturing. It's about skills In a recent Bloomberg report by Mark Gurman discussing the broader state of the Mac, some light has been shed on some of the challenges that have plagued the Mac Pro and its domestic production. Behind the scenes, Mac Pro manufacturing suffered from a few operational bottlenecks. For example, Apple had to create its own manufacturing tooling equipment and then train workers on operating the machines in order to construct the glossy chassis. While investing in customized tooling infrastructure is nothing new for Apple, and comprises the bulk of its capital expenditures (which are expected to soar to a mind-boggling $16 billion next fiscal year), the real kicker is this snippet from the report (emphasis added): "Because of the earlier challenges, some Apple engineers have raised the possibility of moving production back to Asia, where it's cheaper and manufacturers have the required skills for ambitious products, according to a person familiar with those internal discussions." This underscores a key reason that underpins Apple's preference of manufacturing in Asia. Sure, labor costs are lower, but the Mac maker has long noted that there is a dearth of mid-level manufacturing engineers with the right skill sets in the U.S. The Trump factor Just because Apple would like to kill off its U.S. manufacturing due to both operational and financial considerations, that doesn't mean it will. This is particularly true given President-elect Donald Trump's heavy emphasis on U.S. manufacturing on the campaign trail. We also know that Trump is vaguely offering incentives to Apple with the hopes of bringing some of those jobs back, a similar strategy that the president-elect used with Carrier parent United Technologies a few weeks ago. There's far more political pressure now than there was in 2012 and 2013 to create domestic manufacturing jobs. So while Apple and its investors would still rather keep manufacturing in Asia, the company still has to seriously entertain the idea of making iPhones in America.

If you haven’t heard of iFixit, it’s basically a team of tinkerers that regularly crack open gadgets to find out how repairable your favourite technology is. This week, the team managed to get their hands on a pair of Apple AirPods, the controversial wireless earbuds Apple just started selling – and the results weren’t pretty. When iFixit does a teardown, it assigns the gadget a score out of 10, with 10 being the easiest to repair, and zero being a complete nightmare. Unfortunately, the Apple AirPods scored zero, meaning it’s basically impossible to repair them on your own. One of the main problems iFixit encountered was the excessive use of glue: “Accessing any case component is impossible without destroying the outer casing,” writes iFixit. “Glue is the only external fastener used in the case or earbuds.” The report continued: “If jamming complex components into a small form factor and sealing it with a copious amount of glue were a game, Apple would be winning.” It went on to describe the earbud as a “hot mess of cables and adhesive”, adding that the teardown required “surgical precision”, including the use of an actual scalpel. Apple first announced the AirPods on September 7, alongside the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2. The headphones were seen as controversial at the time, largely owing to the high price tag (£159) and weird design. There was also concern that Apple had removed the headphone jack from the iPhone 7, which was seen by cynics as a ploy to boost sales of the Bluetooth-powered AirPods – they don’t need a 3.5mm jack to connect, after all. At the announcement, Apple said it planned to start selling the headphones in October, but they ended up being delayed until December 13 – with a shipping date of December 19. But just one day later, the AirPods shipping time had been delayed to four weeks. That’s why some pairs of AirPods are already selling for as much as £500 on eBay.

I don't think Apple plan to repair any of these - ever. If Apple sell these for £159, then the manufacturing cost will be somewhere in the region of £2-£3 - hardly worth repairing. toboev December 23, 2016, 10:31 am And if Apple won't want to repair them then they certainly don't want anyone else to. Typical dog in a manger attitude. TerFar December 23, 2016, 12:32 pm There are many excellent BT earbuds on the market, a copious number better and cheaper than these idiotic monstrosities.

When Apple kicked the headphone jack to the curb in September in favor of wireless headsets, all eyes were on the change and futuristic-looking earpieces. After all, the company was betting big on its wire-free earbuds and wasn't afraid to upset some Apple fans along the way. The concept is simple: Users sync the earpieces up with an iPhone (via Bluetooth) to play music, take calls and send Siri requests. But AirPods raised a lot of questions. To start, it looked like Apple (AAPL, Tech30) chopped the wires off of its existing EarPods and turned them into oversized plastic earrings. Would people actually wear these? Another question: How well would they actually stay put? Not to mention how lose-able each earpiece appears to be. It's hard enough to keep track of wired earbuds. But after spending a few days with the AirPods -- now available in stores and online orders arriving at doorsteps on Wednesday -- one thing is clear: Don't worry too much about them flying out of ears. We did jumping jacks, head bangs and even somersaults while wearing AirPods. They handled movement surprisingly well. There were times the AirPods became somewhat loose, but all normal activities such as walking and jogging far with them exceeded our expectations. Some users, however, have already reported issues with the set staying in place. Apple Airpods review: can they handle a grown man's somersaults? #Content pic.twitter.com/qxGzaDpXL3— Don Yemen (@ramyzab) December 21, 2016 The fit is comfortable too; we forgot we were wearing them after about 30 minutes. The issue, however, of potentially losing one when you've left the pair on the kitchen table is another story. Sure, the cleverly-designed AirPods case, which doubles as a charger, keeps them intact, but it's not insurance you'll always be able to find both them when you want. (This is more about the user than the product itself). Related: You can already buy a $10 wire for Apple's wireless AirPods The good news is if you've misplaced one, the other still works. But it's ultimately a costly mistake to fix: Replacement earpieces cost $69 each. The sound quality is surprisingly strong for such small set. Wireless headphones and earbuds are notorious for less-than-stellar audio, but AirPods pack a powerful punch. The stems host the antennas and bring the microphone closer to your mouth. It also comes with internal sensors, so if you take one earpiece out, whatever you're listening to or watching will pause. AirPods can interact directly with Siri, too. The voice assistant takes requests, such as providing weather updates or opening apps, after tapping the side of either earpiece. But Siri integration isn't perfect. It works better with Apple's built-in apps, but it's limited when it comes to third-party programs (i.e. you'll often need to reach for your phone to perform tasks, such as upping the volume). Related: Apple's headphone jack: all your angry questions answered Getting Siri to work can also be a challenge. It often takes several taps on the earpiece to get a response. The same issue surfaced for answering phone calls. But the AirPods' ability to otherwise take calls is impressive. With a synced iPhone on a desk about 230 feet away, we could clearly engage in a phone conversation without needing the device nearby. But those who don't have an iPhone and want to use the AirPods may be in luck: they also work with Android products. Meanwhile, the AirPods charging case is brilliantly designed. Resembling a small container of dental floss, it snugly houses each earpiece. The case gets about a day's worth of charge before it needs refueling (via a Lightning cable). AirPods placed inside receive about a five hour power boost after just 15 minutes. That's pretty solid mileage, but if you're new to wireless headsets, remembering to charge yet another gadget comes with a learning curve. Although investing in the future of wireless audio technology isn't cheap, the AirPods are priced competitively at $160. Other wireless earbud options cost more, such as the Samsung Gear iconix ($199) or Jabra Elite Sport ($239). The concept of wireless earbuds in general might take some time for a mass audience to accept, but in a few years, we'll likely look back on how weird it was that we once wore wires dangling from our ears.

You can now purchase refurbished Apple Watches directly from the Apple Store and right now there are several versions to choose from and they are offered at modest discounts. That modest discount for buying refurb is 14%. The Apple Watch Series 1 38mm with a silver aluminum refurb with white band sells for $229. That watch was launched in September 2016 and has a S1P dual-core processor, OLED retina display, Bluetooth, heart rate sensor, and more. The Series 1 can also be had in 38mm black case for the same $229. Other Series 1 devices offered in the refurb store include the 38mm gold aluminum case with concrete sport band, and 38mm rose gold with pink sand band. If you want the larger Apple Watch series 1 you can get a 42mm rose gold with midnight blue band for $249. Apple Watch 42mm buyers can also get space gray with black sport band, gold with cocoa sport band, or silver with white band all in Series 1 configuration. If you want the fancier Series 2 version you can get that too, but it costs a lot more. A 38mm Series 2 that originally launched in September 2016 with S2 dual-core processor, GPS, 50m water resistance, OLED retina display, WiFi, Bluetooth and more will cost you $469. A 42mm Series 2 in space black with black sport band sells for $509. A white 42mm Series 2 with white sport band is also available for the same $509. There is no indication of exactly how many of each configuration Apple has available.

Resend activation e-mail Opposable Thumbs / Gaming & Entertainment Can we go back in time and wipe Assassin’s Creed film from our DNA? Michael Fassbender is the only light in this slow, nonsensical waste of a franchise. by Sam Machkovech - Dec 21, 2016 12:00 pm UTC Login to bookmark 156 Enlarge / Fassbender ain't havin' none of your 'tude today. The most telling line in the Assassin's Creed film, based on the video games of the same name, comes about midway through the film. Our hero, Callum Lynch (Michael Fassbender), is bombarded by nonsensical comments while trying to eat his lunch. After he's left alone for a moment, he chuckles to himself—the first and only time he does so in an organic fashion through the whole movie—before exclaiming, "What the fuck is going on?" I'm shocked that the filmmakers left this moment in the film, seeing as how Assassin's Creed's every element—the plot beats, the characters' decisions, the logical leaps—begs such a question. Assassin's Creed has the dubious honor of combining ho-hum action sequences, half-baked characters, and a script no larger than a doctor's free pamphlet. The results leave both series fans and curious passersby with nothing to sink their hidden blades into. Apple of no one's eye At the film's outset, Callum Lynch (Michael Fassbender) is read his rites before what he thinks is his execution. Much worse stuff awaits him—as in, the rest of this film's runtime. At the film's outset, Callum Lynch (Michael Fassbender) is read his rites before what he thinks is his execution. Much worse stuff awaits him—as in, the rest of this film's runtime. Sofia (Marion Cotillard) helps Lynch back up to his feet. "I see you've played knifey-spoony before." How to make a motion picture bad guy: Just add turtleneck. "Dad, your whole Steve Jobs complex has really spiked since you've been searching for this apple. It's not Apple. Just an apple." Lynch's origin story will sound familiar to anybody who has ever played the games. Most of them star a modern Everyman-with-a-checkered-past... who just so happens to have a bunch of badass assassin ancestors. Rather than try to recreate the games' longtime protagonist, Desmond Miles, Director Justin Kurzel (Snowtown) starts from scratch with Fassbender's Lynch—who, much like Miles, almost immediately gets tangled up with a shady research institute. Lynch is kidnapped, and his body is plugged into a giant, hydraulic claw. This device, called the Animus, reads Lynch's DNA before overloading his mind and senses with the feeling that he's back in the year 1492. Convinced he's in the Renaissance, Lynch relives the adventurous memories of a Spanish ancestor named Aguilar who was a member of a longtime order of assassins. They were charged with protecting the world's citizens from an equally longtime order of devious "Templars." (By the way: Spain, 1492. Yes, you are free to start groaning at the duhhh-I-saw-it-coming possibilities.) At the outset, I had faint hopes that Kurzel's film might pull off a high-octane version of Quantum Leap or Doctor Who. The game series, after all, updates its location, time, and historical potential with every entry. The problem with the game sequels is that they rarely match their new settings with new gameplay. With TV or a film, on the other hand, that kind of new-every-episode refresh can be a fun way to mix familiar, beloved characters with new villains and bizarre circumstances. The film's first problem comes from how painfully thin the script is. Does Lynch have a personality? Hard to tell. All he gets to do is groan about his captivity, groan about his pain, and groan about his confusion. His history and personality are hinted at with a three-second glimpse at a wall of news clippings about his life—the kind of stuff, I should note, that gamers would get to pore over during a lengthy quest. Movie viewers aren't given this luxury. The only other speaking character with a sliver of personality is Sofia, played by Oscar-winner Marion Cotillard. She's the primary researcher assigned to Lynch's DNA depths. She wants Lynch to help her discover Eden's Apple—a holy relic that she's been led to believe will let her "cure" all of mankind's violent tendencies. Spoiler alert: Eden's Apple does this by depriving all humans of their capacity for free will. When Sofia eventually learns this from Rikkin (her father, played by Jeremy Irons), she acts plum-shocked that such a thing could happen. Um, no. Cotillard's biggest screw-up in her portrayal of Sofia is that she's clearly a good actress, and she therefore resembles a reasoned, emotionally capable person who should have such insight. "Maybe taking away the ability to be violent, which has decided the fates of various species throughout the entirety of evolution, might be a misguided goal," you'd expect her to mutter at some point. That doesn't happen. We only hear insipid one-liners, as if we're too stupid to question how ridiculous they sound. When Rikkin stands before a UN-like committee in an early scene, he declares, "The economic impact of antisocial behavior was $9 trillion last year." What? What's the metric here? Reality TV ratings? Number of houses TP'ed in the nice part of town? Ninja, ninja, rrrrrap Put yo hood up. Put yo hood up. I really wish there'd been more horse riding, but alas. Andalusia probably looks nice from a rooftop. Let's slice some fools. Assassin's Creed's modern-day characters receive no development, and gosh, the fact that the movie squanders Michael "Omar from The Wire" Williams as a result is unforgivable. Worse, once Lynch enters the Animus and slashes dozens of fools in 15th-century Andalusia, dialogue pretty much drops to zero. Even the worst Assassin's Creed games pump their worlds full of dialogue, stories, and history odes—and those are often my favorite parts of the games because they show just how much the series' developers love their source material. Kurzel seems content to conjure up an imaginary version of Renaissance Spain. If the action were up to snuff, that might be tolerable. Bad news: Assassin's Creed is replete with some of the most cookie-cutter martial arts to pad a blockbuster in years. You wanna know Fassbender's cleverest attack? While cocking an arrow back, he uses his elbow to smack a guy's jaw before releasing the arrow and shooting someone else. ("Elbow-and-arrow," I wrote in my notepad.) The main reason I clearly remember that elbow-to-jaw moment is because nothing else came close, unless you count the film's final, hilariously awkward fight. This cheeseball, one-at-a-time karate-and-swords fight—complete with armies of armed guards who shout maniacally for no logical reason—better resembles something out of a '90s Ninja Turtles film than an Assassin's Creed game. Did you come hoping for at least a few authentic, series-worthy run-and-climb moments? Fassbender and his ancient-Spain cohorts occasionally jump from rooftop to rooftop, sure, but the whole thing honestly looks more like the Prince of Persia game remasters than it does an Assassin's Creed title. This film's namesake games astounded when they first debuted because of their amazing wall-scaling and parkour movement systems. You're not gonna find much of that here. (Series note: thank goodness at least one dude fell from a great height into a bale of hay, but not the same way that you do in the games.) I appreciate that the film relies largely on practical effects, as opposed to a boatload of CGI. What's more, the Animus sequences—in which modern-day Fassbender jumps around in a lab and battles transparent, particle-loaded versions of his time-travel foes—look cool on occasion. That's in spite of the Animus contraption, which straps to Fassbender's back and resembles this South Park episode. Someone, please go back in time and unmake this movie By the end, the whole production goes off the rails. Its Brave New World Eden's Apple schtick concludes with Sofia blaming Lynch for committing a crime that she encouraged him to do, at which point she gives up on her save-the-world perspective and turns into a furrow-browed villain (just before the credits roll, of course). This crime, by the way, happens inside the most sensationally protected sanctuary of rich nobles, and it happens so quickly and uncontested that you get the feeling the film's editor had a train to catch. The only thing that got me through the movie was my belief that Ubisoft could honestly try again. Fassbender is clearly a great actor (although I've never seen such talent chained to such a rusty furnace of source material). Someone half as good as Fassbender could carry a serial TV show about a time-traveling assassin who lands in a new time period, complete with tons of series-worthy historical-icon cameos, every 44 minutes. If we could pretend this movie never existed, that'd help. My advice to Ubisoft: please hook one of your executives to the Animus and have him or her assassinate this filmmaking disaster from the nucleotides within all of our DNA.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Super Mario Breaks Download Record on the App Store but Reviewers Complain over the One-Time Hidden Fee | Main | The EU's High Court Forbids Key Elements of UK's Newly Passed Investigatory Powers Bill » December 21, 2016 Rumor Claims that Google will Stop Samsung from using their own AI for the new Galaxy S8 Smartphone   In Early November Patently Apple posted a report titled "Samsung Confirms AI is coming to the Galaxy S8 in Late February Courtesy of Viv." The news of Samsung delivering a custom AI solution to their Galaxy smartphone line-up and extending it to home automation hubs was quite the leap and a way to challenge Apple's Siri in a way different from all other Android smartphones. The fact that Viv's AI team was the group who invented Siri gave it instant credibility. But now, in a surprising news story today, we're learning that Google may have stomped on Samsung's plans to introduce a Viv based AI solution to their Android devices.   Today's Asian report notes that Samsung and Google have generally maintained a close relationship but that they're now turning their back on each other over the next-generation growth engine, artificial intelligence (AI). This is because Google has stomped on Samsung's plans to launch the Galaxy S8 with an AI-powered assistant.   The problem is that Samsung signed a patent-sharing agreement with Google back in 2014. Under the deal, the two companies share each others patent technologies as well as existing patents for the next ten years. The agreement also included a non-compete provision.   Richard Windsor, an analyst at U.S.-based investment intelligence firm Edison Investment Research, said in a report, 'Since the non-compete agreement means that Samsung cannot offer any Android services that compete with Google's own services, Samsung may not be able to release smartphones with its own AI service.' For now, Google is currently providing its voice-recognition AI assistant service 'Google Assistant' with Google Pixel premium phones.   Information and communications technology (ICT) experts say that it is a very serious problem if Google thwarts Samsung's plan on the AI service is true. They criticize that Google should not hinder the development of new technology and innovation considering the fact that AI is not a simple tool to target the smartphone market but rather a next-generation indispensable technology that embraces smartphones, home appliances and cars.   If Google cracks down on this, then it will effect Huawei's latest Honor Magic smartphone that we touched on yesterday as well. Huawei claims that their AI is better than Apple's Siri because it's tuned to local needs in China better than what Apple provides.     For the record, there's been no official statement from Google on this matter as of yet and I'm sure that they'd like to avoid making this a major issue publicly to hurt Android. But if most major Android OEM's choose to use their own AI solutions and not adopt Android's 'Google Assistant' then fragmentation of Android will deepen over time and put the whole ecosystem in danger.   On the flip side, Android is supposed to be an open OS. Some say it's just 'more open' than iOS. Either way, it's an interesting conundrum for Google.   To date, Google Assistant is only on Google's Pixel smartphone. Will Google quickly make this available to their partners to avoid a war with their partnering OEM's or did the rumor miss the boat? Considering that that the publication reporting on this today is a business site, rumors aren't generally something they openly support unless they have something supporting it.   Of course in the end, it'll all come down to what Samsung actually introduces with their Galaxy S8 at the Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona in February. That's where the rubber meets the road. So we won't have long to wait to see how this plays out.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Learn why 2016 was beautiful and terrible in tech. By Jason Hiner , Chris Duckett , Larry Dignan , and Steve Ranger | December 18, 2016 -- 23:00 GMT (15:00 PST) | Topic: Innovation Image: Sarah Tew/CNET Every week, we sound off on the most important technology trends in our Monday Morning Opener. Looking back on 2016, we've identified the five tectonic plate shifts that have made the biggest impact on the industry and our readers who use these tools to drive the progress of the planet. So, without further ado, here are the five big tech trends of 2016 according to ZDNet's global editorial board: Larry Dignan, global editor in chief Jason Hiner, global long form editor Steve Ranger, EU editor Chris Duckett, APAC editor 1. Cybersecurity: Data breaches accelerate It's almost a cop out to declare 2016 the year of the data breach since you could say something similar each year since 2000 or so. But 2016 brought maturity to data breaches and a marketplace where attacks from years ago still deliver value for cybercriminals. Yahoo closed out the year by disclosing 1 billion accounts were breached and that incident was separate from a previous attack that compromised 500 million folks. Yahoo takes the cybersecurity whipping boy prize for 2016. What we've learned is that yesterday's data breach can resurface and be remixed into new security headaches years later. It's almost like data breaches are like sitcoms that have make money in syndication. Consider: Yahoo disclosed an attack that compromised 1 billion accounts. Yahoo had 500 million names swiped just as Verizon was about to close an acquisition of the company. Oracle's Micros unit had its payment systems hacked. 400 million users of AdultFriendFinder were exposed. Meanwhile, data from older attacks resurfaced again. Just ask LinkedIn. SEE: Cyberwar and the Future of Cybersecurity (ZDNet and TechRepublic special report) Distributed denial of service attacks also regained momentum. Dyn, a managed DNS service, was hit with a DDoS that ultimately turned out to be an attack that revolved around using Internet of things devices as a weapon. The one common theme that always remains is that humans are the weakest link in the security food chain even as the attacks become a bit more creative. Photos: These were the biggest hacks, leaks and data breaches of 2016 Image: Spencer Platt, Getty Images 2. Cloud: AWS built on its lead as cloud providers mature What was most interesting about the Amazon Web Services re:Invent powwow was how far the company has come in landing enterprise customers as well as all-in bets on its infrastructure as a service. Not that the rest of the field was standing still, but AWS easily became Amazon's most profitable business. Amazon is basically an enterprise cloud company that engages in e-commerce for giggles (at least based on the bottom line). But the cloud sector had a bevy of other developments worth noting: Google is clearly betting on artificial intelligence and machine learning as its primary differentiator. Machine learning and AI will be the cloud driver for all the major players. Microsoft Azure is gaining hybrid momentum and has embraced open source and technologies like Docker at a clip that continues to surprise. And IBM is building out its platform as a service efforts to ultimately tie them to Watson. On other fronts, Oracle's cloud business grew at a rapid clip and will expand more via the acquisition of NetSuite. Salesforce rolled out Einstein, an effort to infuse its services with artificial intelligence. When we look back at 2016 the inflection point of the cloud will be obvious. Earlier this decade we talked a lot about the cloud. Today, cloud services will fade to the background as the primary way to build enterprise architecture. The revolution will continue, but move more to the background. Sound familiar? Think Linux. Linux made a big splash and wound up being in every data center--once we stopped yapping about it. 3. Apple: Can't get out of its own way We can't help but look at 2016 as a year of Apple sliding back toward mediocrity--despite the fact that it remains the most profitable company in tech and the most valuable business in the world. Nevertheless, it did little to dispel our long-term skepticism about the company as its competitors continue to gain ground and Apple shows few signs of opening new markets or finding its next big thing. The greatest indictment against Apple may be its sheer number of frayed edges. For a company that now has over 100,000 employees, the lack of focus is beginning to show. Its iCloud services remain second class behind Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. The latest Apple Watch still fails to live up to Apple's design prowess. Its new laptops continue to tax the loyalty of power users. Its flagship iWork suite is one of several crusty software relics that continue to lag on the Mac. The iPad Pro line still leaves us scratching our heads about who it's actually for. The company's biggest bright spot in 2016 was the success of the iPhone 7, which exceeded expectations. Still, it's important to remember that Apple spent most of the year lowering expectations ahead of the launch of the latest iPhone in September. And, both interest and sales were artificially bolstered by Samsung's epic fail with the Galaxy Note7. Despite the iPhone 7 turning into a win, overall iPhone sales decelerated in 2016 as high-quality, low-cost Android devices siphoned off demand in China. Since the iPhone makes up roughly 70% of Apple's revenue, that's the biggest danger sign of the year in Cupertino. In 2017, Apple has a lot of cleanup work to do across board--especially in software and services--and it needs to hit a homerun with the 10-year anniversary iPhone. 4. The PC: Dead like vinyl records Microsoft's Surface Pro and Surface Studio, Apple's MacBook with Touch Bar, various gymnastic Yoga devices from Lenovo; after years in the doldrums, the PC is suddenly interesting again. A few years back it looked like tablets and smartphones would drive the PC into extinction. And that might still be true: PC shipments are sliding and there's little likelihood that they will leap back up again. And even worse, voice-powered digital assistants packed into new devices like the Amazon Echo are also taking on the jobs that PCs used to do in the home. Business users will remain PC loyalists--they're the people who need to type or write or draw and so the PC is evolving to suit them better. That means lower volumes, higher prices and better design than ever before. In future, the PC will be more of a niche device, and unexpectedly all the cooler for it. Perhaps PCs will go the same way as vinyl records--spurned by the majority and loved by the hipster connoisseur. 5. Governments: The underfunded giants are at risk in tech As we look back at the OPM hack of 2015, it was not a one-off, and instead signalled a new normal in the state of affairs for governments handling technology. For as much as concerned citizens may fear Facebook sweeping up all personal information put into its systems, it is yet to surpass the treasure trove of data compiled by governments, and you have no choice but to hand over that personal information for their safekeeping. While governments are looking to appear innovative with big data projects to defeat slumlords, or want to "uberify" buses, there remain legacy systems and underfunded departments struggling to keep pace. Years of budget cuts to public agencies in jurisdictions the world over have led to institutional knowledge and capability disappearing in droves--ironically at a time when governments need to be smarter than ever. The Australian Census debacle stands tall as an example of an agency trying to deal with a dismal budget, a multinational vendor with bad plans in the shape of IBM, and a structural inability to change its ways. To cap off 2016, Australia's version of the IRS, the Australian Taxation Office was victim to a two-day outage thanks to its HPE storage arrays falling over. Until governments start to refund agencies to handle IT and protect their data properly, there will be a cavalcade of governmental security and infrastructure bungles that should serve as a warning to the private sector on what not to do. And these are only the mishaps and problems we know about. ZDNet Monday Morning Opener The Monday Morning Opener is our opening salvo for the week in tech.

New, 44 comments December 21st, 2016 by Thomas Ricker@Trixxy Dec 21, 2016, 7:30am EST share tweet Linkedin Apple Remember when Apple came out with its six-guns a blazin' to announce its Mac Pro and a return to US manufacturing? It was a big deal for much of 2013 and 2014, accompanied by a lot of flag-waving bombast and back-patting bravado. But then Apple fell mysteriously silent on the topic as the months turned into years without any upgrades. It was President Obama who, at the beginning of 2011, asked Steve Jobs what it would take to build iPhones in the United States. Why can't that work come home, the president asked. Steve Jobs' answer was unequivocal: "Those jobs aren't coming back." Nevertheless, in 2012 Tim Cook's Apple committed to investing over $100 million to kickstart US manufacturing. In 2013, Apple would launch the completely redesigned Mac Pro, which would be partially manufactured and then assembled in Austin, Texas though a partnership with Flextronics. “Those jobs aren't coming back.” Cook spoke triumphantly of the undertaking as he did the rounds on the media circuit. But he also expressed his concerns in an interview with Brian Williams: Cook said he believes the U.S. education system is failing to produce enough people with the skills needed for modern manufacturing processes. He added, however, that he hopes the new Mac project will help spur others to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. “The consumer electronics world was really never here,” Cook said. “It’s a matter of starting it here.” Cook knows a little something about "modern manufacturing processes" because he was there at its invention. Cook joined Apple in 1998 with a mandate to clean up Apple's woeful manufacturing apparatus around the world. He's the guy who closed Apple's factories and warehouses in earnest and outsourced the work to more efficient and flexible contract manufacturers that could scale a skilled workforce quickly and still do the work more cheaply. It was a move that paid off when the world demanded hundreds of millions of iPods after the product’s 2001 debut, and established a highly visible precedent for the rest of the consumer electronics industry to follow. The corresponding supply chain is firmly entrenched in China as a result. Despite this, the US-made Mac Pro went on sale on December 19th, 2013. We have begun manufacturing the Mac Pro in Austin. It’s the most powerful Mac ever. Orders start tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/Jrd1Gic3Ya— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) December 18, 2013 Notoriously, the Mac Pro hasn't seen an update in over three years — an eternity for computers. Yet it's still for sale. Bizarre, don't you think, for a product that received annual updates in the years preceding it? Yesterday, Mark Gurman writing for Bloomberg gave us some insight into what's going on (emphasis mine): Under pressure from politicians to create manufacturing jobs at home, Apple was looking to score political points. The decision caused production headaches though. The Mac Pro's glossy exterior and chrome beveled edges meant Apple had to make its own manufacturing tools and then train people to run those machines in an assembly plant. This slowed production and constrained Apple's ability to make enough computers to meet demand. Three years on, the Mac Pro is ripe for an upgrade with its chips and connector ports lagging rival products. Because of the earlier challenges, some Apple engineers have raised the possibility of moving production back to Asia, where it's cheaper and manufacturers have the required skills for ambitious products, according to a person familiar with those internal discussions. This seems to validate Cook’s concerns about having enough skilled workers for modern manufacturing processes. Makes you wonder what the hell is going on in that Austin factory, doesn't it? Apple declined Bloomberg's request for comment on the story before it was published on Tuesday. But that's okay, because Tim Cook's posting to an internal Apple message board just happened to leak on Monday. A coincidence I'm sure. Cook said that Apple has "great desktops" on the roadmap, a term he used interchangeably with iMacs. Some read that to mean that the Mac Pro was dead. A token political gesture? In hindsight, one could argue that the Mac Pro was merely a token political gesture, akin to Budweiser changing its name to "America" in an election year. Apple knew it couldn’t kickstart US manufacturing because those jobs aren’t coming back. Instead, it was willing to play along in order to win favors in DC, and the patriotic admiration of US consumers. In that context, $100 million, or whatever Apple ultimately invested in the Mac Pro manufacturing line, can be written off as lobbying and marketing expenditures over the last three years. (Pennies compared to the $238 billion it hoards in cash.) The less cynical answer is that Apple was truly committed to the effort, and so surprised by its failure that it never had a plan B — though I have a hard time believing Tim Cook, the guy who helped create the template for the modern manufacturing process, could have been so easily blindsided. Now President-elect Trump is again asking Apple to bring back manufacturing; and Apple again seems to be playing along. But you’re fooling yourself if you think the outcome will be any different this time around.

The short answer is ‘not really,’ but a new Apple support document shows that it is kind of compatible with some older machines … Only the 2016 MacBook Pro models can drive the display at its full 5120×2880 5K resolution. This is the Retina version of the 2560×1440 of the now-discontinued Apple Thunderbolt Display – pixels doubled in both X and Y axes to provide that ‘cannot discern the individual pixels’ quality. The latest MacBook Pro models are also the only ones that can be powered by the monitor, providing a single-cable connection. But the display is compatible with Thunderbolt 2 machines at lower resolutions, and the support document shows what you can get from each of the compatible machines by using the Apple Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter and a Thunderbolt 2 cable. 3840 x 2160 @ 60Hz: Mac Pro (Late 2013)* MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014) and later MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2014) and later iMac (Retina, 27-inch, Late 2014) and later iMac (Retina, 21.5-inch, Late 2015) iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2015) MacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2015) MacBook Air (11-inch, Early 2015) 3200 x 1800 @ 60Hz: Mac mini (Late 2014)* Apple does note one important proviso with the Mac Pro and Mac mini: the LG UltraFine is only recommended as a second display, as it may not turn on until booted into macOS – meaning that you’ll get no access to Boot Picker or macOS Recovery mode. We noted that the delay in the display going on sale would have meant Apple cutting it fine to allow customers to take advantage of the introductory pricing, and the company responded by extending the discount period into March.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Apple CEO promises fresh Mac hardware, as report shows Apple is ignoring its desktops, macOS Apple CEO promises fresh Mac hardware, as report shows Apple is ignoring its desktops, macOS By Joel Hruska on December 21, 2016 at 7:30 am Comment Apple’s recent MacBook Pro updates and “courageous” iPhone 7 have proven to be controversial, and a recent pair of news items highlights how much pent-up frustration is aimed at the device manufacturer. First, Tim Cook made several posts to an Apple employee bulletin board, detailing Apple’s thinking on thinking on both desktops and the intersection between hardware and software design. Cook writes: The desktop is very strategic for us. It’s unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop — the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people. The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we’re committed to desktops. If there’s any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that… From a strategic point of view, we also focus on things where software, hardware and services all come together and bring out the magic that only Apple can. That’s our secret sauce. It shows up in a lot of different places, and it’s something that we look for in new employees. Apple CEO Tim Cook. A brand new report from Bloomberg offers an interesting counterweight to Cook’s confidence. According to that investigation, Apple has made a number of strategic decisions that took emphasis away from the Mac design teams. The software team has been reorganized, such that a dedicated macOS team no longer exists and most of the software engineers at Apple are iOS first, Mac second. Hardware engineers are now asked to work on multiple projects at once, or to develop multiple versions of a potential product simultaneously. For example, Apple engineers working on the 2016 MacBook update reportedly wanted to add a second USB-C port and Touch ID support, according to the report. Instead, Apple pushed out a slightly iteration of the same platform and a new “rose gold” color. Engineers working on Mac hardware no longer command the same attention from Jony Ive, the report said, and the appetite for leapfrogging the competition with a more daring approach to technology doesn’t always pay dividends — apparently Apple intended to introduce new battery technology with the MacBook Pro, but unspecified problems killed that option. The Bloomberg report concludes on this note: “Mac fans shouldn’t hold their breath for radical new designs in 2017 though. Instead, the company is preparing modest updates: USB-C ports and a new Advanced Micro Devices Inc. graphics processor for the iMac, and minor bumps in processing power for the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro.” Apple’s innovation decline Part of the problem Apple is facing is straightforward: CPUs haven’t really scaled since 2013. I discussed this last August, but it bears repeating. The image below shows the CPUs Apple currently sells in the three-year-old Mac Pro as compared with the most recent chips available from Intel: Each 2013-era chip is contrasted with its 2016 equivalent. Now, the one thing Apple could do is introduce some high core-count chips that weren’t really available in 2013. Back then, the Xeon E5v2 family topped out at 12 cores; modern CPUs in the E5v4 family top out at 22 cores within the same 135W TDP. But that option carries a hefty frequency penalty: The 12-core E5-2697v2 has a base clock of 2.7GHz and a boost clock of 3.5GHz. The 22-core E5-4699v4 has a 2.2GHz base frequency and a 3GHz boost clock. In other words, if your workload is embarrassingly parallel and can easily scale above 12 threads, the E5-4699v4 is a better option. If it doesn’t — or if you can’t afford the $7,000 price tag Intel has hung on the chip — you won’t see benefits. The GPU market is a markedly different story. AMD’s Polaris refresh would be a good fit for the iMac or even potentially lower-end variants of the Mac Pro, while Vega should address the Mac Pro market head-on (and of course, Nvidia has its own lineup of GPUs, should Apple be interested). Either way, the GPUs baked into current Mac systems are quite old. Apple has never put graphics front-and-center, and it failed to follow up on the graphics-centric argument it made for the Mac Pro. Instead of investing in OpenGL or OpenCL (macOS still only supports OCL 1.2, despite OCL 2.0 now being widely available), Apple has doubled-down on Metal, its own custom iOS API that it also backported to macOS. But major companies like Adobe, which do make use of GPU acceleration, have only begun to add Metal support and it’s not fully baked yet. But I don’t think the issues Apple is facing with macOS and its various Mac systems are simply a matter of lackluster hardware cycles. Apple used to present buyers with a very simple argument: “It just works.” Those three words, however inaccurate or accurate you feel they happen to be, captured most of how Apple marketed itself to customers. MacOS was easier to use. The iPhone and iMac were designed to work together. Apple hardware was a consolidated, discrete ecosystem, with fewer choices but better integration of its various components. And while you may not have found this argument particularly appealing, there was truth to it. Apple built routers and peripherals that were designed to interface with its own software and platforms in ways that other companies rarely matched. That argument seems much less potent now than it did in the past. Apple is leaving the peripheral business (apart from dongles, natch) and its clearly not putting the resources into macOS development that it once did. The latest MacBook and MacBook Pro don’t ‘just work’ unless you’ve got a varying number of dongles to hook up. In the event the company does refresh the Mac Pro, everyone who shucked out for Thunderbolt 2 adapters so they could plug non-Thunderbolt peripherals into the system is going to need to buy Thunderbolt 3 adapters for their Thunderbolt 2-to-USB (or what have you) adapters so they can continue to use their hardware. It’s not very Mac-like, when you get right down to it. In fact, it’s precisely the kind of inelegant-but-functional arrangement I associate with PCs. There’s another answer to this issue, though — one that has nothing to do with Tim Cook or Steve Jobs and everything to do with the evolution of the PC and smartphone ecosystems. In retrospect, it’s clear that the iPod, iPhone, and touchscreen interfaces arrived during the last great hurrah of Moore’s Law, at a time when process node scaling and multi-core products were still delivering rapid improvements. The original iPhone in 2007 happened because it became possible for a capacitive touchscreen device to happen. Steve Jobs and Apple still deserve credit for the idea, but the idea only worked because technology had advanced to the point that it could be made to work. Such inflection points are rare — one could argue that we’ve only had a handful throughout the entire history of computing. The first computers relied on a non-realtime batch interface, followed by command-line interfaces that incorporated video terminals and keyboards. The addition of the mouse and GUI are significant enough to deserve their own separate classification, followed by the rise of capacitive touchscreens since 2007. In 72 years (1945 – 2016) we’ve had four of these transitions, and Steve Jobs’ career happened to fall at a time when he could make significant contributions to both. In the end, it scarcely matters. However loyal Apple customers may be in the short term, they’ll inevitably leave the platform if Tim Cook doesn’t give them reason to stay. 2016 was a distinct let-down in this regard, and 2017 isn’t looking much better if the Bloomberg report is right.

The Apple Watch was a long-rumored product, often referred to as the iWatch before its release. At the time, it represented the best attempt that I had seen to provide a compelling smartwatch experience, but it was clearly a first generation product with flaws and shortcomings. It was not unlike the iPhone 2G or the iPad 1 in that regard, and for all the things it did well, there were other parts of the experience that really didn't deliver. While this shouldn't have been unexpected given the nature of first generation products, when a device is surrounded by so much hype for so many years, expectations can begin to run wild. On top of that, certain aspects like application performance were not up to the standards that are expected of a shipping product. In our review of the original Apple Watch we concluded that it was a good first attempt, but obviously flawed, and that ordinary consumers should wait for future iterations. Jumping to the present, Apple is back with the second generation of the Apple Watch, the aptly named Apple Watch Series 2. The launch of Apple Watch Series 2 comes two years after the original announcement of the Apple Watch. Even when you consider the six month gap between the first Apple Watch's announcement and launch, this still represents a longer time between versions than the yearly cadence that we've come to expect for many other products. Having a product in the market for one and a half years is a good span of time to observe how users are making use of it, what features they are and aren't using, and what parts of the experience create friction. For a first generation product this kind of information is essential to make the necessary improvements in future iterations, as taking the product in the wrong direction could doom its future prospects entirely. In addition to the improvements made in watchOS 3, Apple Watch Series 2 includes a number of hardware improvements. While one might think that specs are entirely irrelevant in a smartwatch, that actually couldn't be farther from the truth. Many of the issues with the original Apple Watch stem from various limitations in the hardware, particularly the slowness of the CPU and GPU. With Series 2 Apple has a chance to address many of these problems. I've compiled a table below with the specifications of both sizes of the original Apple Watch compared to their successors in Series 2.   Apple Watch 38mm Apple Watch 42mm Apple Watch Series 2 38mm Apple Watch Series 2 42mm SoC Apple S1 CPU: 520MHz Cortex A7 GPU: PowerVR Series5 Apple S2 CPU: 2 x 520MHz Cortex A7 GPU: PowerVR Series6 'Rogue' RAM/NAND 512MB LPDDR3 (?) RAM / 8GB NAND Display 1.32" 272x340 OLED 450 nit brightness 1.5" 312x390 OLED 450 nit brightness 1.32" 272x340 OLED 1000 nit brightness 1.5" 312x390 OLED 1000 nit brightness Size / Mass 38.6x33.3x10.5mm 25/40/55g (Alu/Steel/Gold) 42x35.9x10.5mm 30/50/69g (Alu/Steel/Gold) 38.6x33.3x11.4mm 28.2/41.9/39.6 (Alu/Steel/Ceramic) 42.5x36.4x11.4mm 34.2/52.4/45.6 (Alu/Steel/Ceramic) Water Resistance IP67 "Splash proof" Water resistant up to 50 meters Battery 0.78Whr 0.93Whr 1.03Whr 1.27Whr Connectivity 2.4GHz 802.11 b/g/n + Bluetooth 4.0 2.4GHz 802.11 b/g/n + Bluetooth 4.0, GPS Launch OS watchOS 1 watchOS 3 Price $349/549/10,000 (Alu/Steel/Gold) $399/599/12,000 (Alu/Steel/Gold) $369/549/1249 (Alu/Steel/Ceramic) $399/599/1299 (Alu/Steel/Ceramic) The exterior design of the Apple Watch is clearly something that has been locked in for several generations. As you can see above, Apple has increased the size of watch slightly with Series 2, but it's not something that can really be noticed in practice, and it doesn't break compatibility with existing watch bands which is good news for anyone upgrading from the original Apple Watch. The water resistance of the case is also greatly improved, having gone from the vague "splash proof" rating in the original model to being rated for water resistance up to a depth of 50 meters. The jewelry-focused gold Edition models are also gone, replaced by a ceramic model at 10% of the price. Apple S2. Source: Chipworks Internally, Apple has made some key changes that have a profound impact on the user experience. The most obvious is the new chip powering the watch. Apple's S2 SiP now has a dual core processor and an improved GPU. Apple rates it as 50% faster for CPU-bound workloads, and twice as fast for GPU-bound workloads. Apple has been known to state smaller gains than the theoretical doubling of performance when moving from a single core to a dual core CPU, and based on some investigation it appears that Apple has simply doubled up on CPU cores, adding another 520MHz ARM Cortex-A7 core to complement the first. Single-core/single-threaded performance appears unchanged, so getting better performance out of the S2 means putting that second core to work. As for the GPU, this is much harder to pin down. It's most likely the case that the Apple S1 SiP used the PowerVR GX5300 GPU, and I suspect that Apple is using Imagination Technologies' newer PowerVR "Rogue" architecture - likely some variant of the G6020 GPU - in the Apple S2. I say variant, as Apple's recent work with GPUs in their SoCs could be indicative that Apple does not need to use Imagination's reference design. Like the S1, the S2 is paired with 512MB of RAM. It's again hard to verify that this is LPDDR3 memory so I've marked that as speculative in the chart. I did want to note that other sources have reported 1GB of RAM for the S2, but I am fairly sure that this is not the case. iOS, and subsequently watchOS, provides an API for developers to query the number of CPU cores and amount of RAM available in the device, and it confirms that Apple has not increased the amount of RAM available in Apple Watch Series 2. Apple Watch Series 2 42mm battery. Source: Chipworks Another major internal change is the battery. Apple has increased the battery capacity on the 38mm model by 32%, and the 42mm model by 36%. This will do well to offset the increased power requirements with the introduction of GPS in the Apple S2 SiP. Apple still rates the battery life for Series 2 at eighteen hours, and in my experience you could wear the watch for two days before having to recharge as long as you don't do too many workouts. However, I still charge it each night, and we're still not close to the point where you can wear a smartwatch for a week with both daytime tracking and sleep tracking. The last major hardware change in Series 2 is the display. Apple still uses a 326ppi OLED panel on both models, with the 38mm casing having a 1.32" display and the 42mm casing being a larger 1.5" display. What has changed is the peak brightness. One of the issues I encountered with the original Apple Watch was an inability to see what was on the screen when there was heavy glare. This was even more pronounced on the steel versions that use sapphire glass, which is more reflective than the Ion-X glass on the aluminum models. Apple rated the original Apple Watch displays at 450 nits of brightness, and with Series 2 they claim to have increased this to 1000 nits, which is an enormous improvement. Given that the Apple Watch is still a relatively new product, it's likely that many people have still not interacted with one before. Because of that, and the very personal nature of watches, it's worth covering the design in more detail, and so I'll talk about that next.

Full-fledged smartwatches are simply not attractive to the normal consumer. When you can spend $50 for an entry level wearable that lasts for a few days, reports the time, measures fitness activity, why purchase a $400 Apple Watch that only has the benefits of a screen and GPS (which your phone is for)?

Reply Cygni - Tuesday, December 20, 2016 - link Good analogy, but remember that the vast majority of people already have a car (smartphone) that does everything a Harley can do but better.

Pebble was launched primarily on runkeeper integration, but failed hard (especially hard is the start/stop functionality: being able to lock your phone and put it in your pocket would be key.

The battery life of Apple's new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has been a huge disappointment. It has a lower capacity than the battery inside last year's MacBook Pro, likely due to weight and space constraints. Apple engineers reportedly wanted to use higher capacity battery packs shaped to the insides of the MacBook Pro, compared to the standard square cells found in most machines. The design would have boosted battery life. But, the company had to scrap the plans as the design failed a key test in the run-up to the MacBook Pro's planned debut this year. The company then used an older design, fearing that a delay in the launch would risk missing the crucial holiday shopping season. If the plan was successful, the laptops may have lasted 10 hours that Apple claimed, instead of five to six hours available at present, the report noted. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News The World's Best Ad Campaigns of 2016 India's Demonetization Drama, Explained Novel Drug Approvals Of 2016 More Top Stories Asian Markets Mostly Higher Bass Pro/Cabela's Merger Facing Regulatory Scrutiny Twitter's China Head Kathy Chen Quits European Shares Rise After PMI Data European Shares Seen Flat In Holiday-thinned Trade Magic Mushroom: Caution Is The Word Stocks See Three-Day Losing Streak To Close Out Strong Year - U.S. Commentary Trump On Putin: I Always Knew He Was Very Smart Trump's Inaugural Parade To Include Several Veterans Groups Schumer Demanding More Disclosures From Trump Cabinet Picks Giuliani Urges Trump To Get Own Intelligence On Russia Stocks Continue To See Modest Weakness In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary Stocks Extending Recent Pullback In Morning Trading - U.S. Commentary Senator Dean Heller To Run For Re-election Rather Than Governor Chicago Business Barometer Indicates Notably Slower Growth In December <<Previous        87 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus RELATED NEWS Court Rules You Must Give Police Your Phone Passcode Apple: TV App, Emoji Updates In IOS 10.2 Apple: AirPods For $159 In Time For Christmas WSJ : Apple Holds Talks About Investing In Softbank's $100 Bln Tech Fund Apple's Growing Battery Problem Trade AAPL now with  Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Twitter's China Head Kathy Chen Quits The Ten Richest Presidents Before Donald Trump May Surprise You Twitter Has 360 Degree Live Video Stream INNL Bleeds Over Dashed Hopes, CRBP To Report Data In Q1, FDA Snubs CEMP Taco Bell Testing Loaded Fries Yacht Sales Down In China Biotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In January American Flight Attendants Say Uniforms Make Them Sick Airbus Delays Delivery Of 12 A380 Aircraft To Emirates Biogen, Ionis Get FDA Approval For SMA Drug Snapchat Reportedly Buys Augmented Reality Startup ANTH Plunges On Failed SOLUTION, All Eyes On CEMP, FDA Says No To AMPH Again Biotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In January ANTH Plunges On Failed SOLUTION, All Eyes On CEMP, FDA Says No To AMPH Again INNL Bleeds Over Dashed Hopes, CRBP To Report Data In Q1, FDA Snubs CEMP Taco Bell Testing Loaded Fries American Flight Attendants Say Uniforms Make Them Sick LSE Reportedly Agrees On Sale Of Clearing Unit As Soon As This Week IBM Working On Robot To Help Elderly Snapchat Reportedly Buys Augmented Reality Startup Twitter Has 360 Degree Live Video Stream Fairpoint CEO Chris Moat Resigns - Quick Facts The Ten Richest Presidents Before Donald Trump May Surprise You Yacht Sales Down In China Biotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In January Holiday Inn Parent Looking Into Possible Data Breach ANTH Plunges On Failed SOLUTION, All Eyes On CEMP, FDA Says No To AMPH Again Hitachi Considers Transfer Of Shares Of Hitachi Koki - Quick Facts Ford Introduces Next-generation Fusion Hybrid Autonomous Development Vehicle Bovis Homes Issues Pre Close Update; Expects Volume Delivery Below Prior Outlook Sports Direct To Sell Dunlop Business To Sumitomo Rubber For $137.5 Mln INPP Increases Stake In Gold Coast Light Rail Project - Quick Facts Fairpoint CEO Chris Moat Resigns - Quick Facts Loxam Again Increases Offer For Lavendon; TVH Says Considering Options Southwest Gas Board Approves To Implement Proposed Holding Company Structure Brown Gibbons To Sell Snappy Co.

And boy do I hope you weren’t expecting to get them for your favorite Apple (AAPL) fan in time for Christmas, because the soonest you can get the $160 headphones through Apple’s website is Jan. 30. There’s still a chance you’ll be able to score them before the big man comes sliding down the chimney this year, as Apple says it’ll have AirPods at its retail stores, authorized Apple resellers and “select carriers” next week. That’s right, the week before Christmas. Apple says its AirPods will ship in “limited quantities at launch” and encourages customers to check estimated delivery dates before clicking the purchase button. Stores, though, will receive regular shipments, so you might have the option to grab some if you search hard enough. Apple’s AirPods were met with a mixed reception when they debuted alongside the company’s headphone jack-less iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in September. The headphones feature a receiver so you can use them to make hands-free calls and Siri integration lets you control your music without having to pull out your phone. But using Siri to raise or lower the volume of a song drew the ire of early reviewers. Still, AirPods received praise for how easy they are to pair with your iPhone. Simply pop open the AirPods’ charging case and they’ll instantly detect your handset, so you can start listening in seconds. It’s truly impressive. The headphones also include built-in sensors that can detect when you place them in your ears, and get up to five hours of battery life on a single charge. Oh, and that charging case holds enough power for an extra 24 hours of use. If you can’t get your hands on a pair of AirPods before Christmas, there are always other options including Apple’s own Beats X wireless headphones, which go for $150. Or you could just use the headphones that come with your iPhone. Daniel Howley is tech editor at Yahoo Finance. Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Recently Viewed Your list is empty.

But instead of heading to the store and grabbing the first handset you see on sale, you’re going to want to make sure the phone you purchase is the right one for you … err, I mean, your loved one. Fortunately, we’ve got the lowdown on the best smartphones for everyone on your holiday shopping list. And, you know, you too. For the ultimate Apple lover View photos Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus is the ultimate phone for Apple fans.More If you’re shopping for an Apple (APPL) lover, you’re going to get an iPhone. And of the five models currently on the market, the best of the best is Apple’s $770 iPhone 7 Plus. The 5.5-inch behemoth takes the top spot thanks to its fantastic dual-camera setup, which features an optical zoom and a portrait mode that produces a depth-of-field effect. Oh, and then there’s the phone’s blazing performance, beautiful display and water-resistant design. Basically, if you’re shopping for someone who lives and breathes for Apple, this is the phone to get. The iPhone for the first-timer View photos Apple’s iPhone SE is the perfect iPhone for first-timers.More Whether your kid is begging for her first iPhone, or you’re shopping for your dad who’s still desperately clinging to his 15-year-old Nokia, the best iPhone for smartphone first-timers is the iPhone SE. The $400 handset runs the latest version of Apple’s iOS operating system, and features the same great camera and powerful processor as the $550 iPhone 6s in a slightly smaller package. It’s not exactly cheap, but it’s a solid choice for someone taking his or her first steps into the Apple ecosystem. The Google phone for Google enthusiasts View photos Google’s Pixel is the ultimate Google smartphone.More Google’s Android is the most widely used smartphone operating system in the world, which means there are plenty of Android handsets on the market. But if you’re shopping for someone who loves Google (GOOG, GOOGL) products, then you’re going to want to get them the smartphone that represents the epitome of what Google thinks a handset should be: the Google Pixel. Available for $649 for the $5-inch model and $770 for the 5.5-inch XL version, the Pixel runs an unaltered version of Google’s Android 7.0 Nougat operating system. What’s more, it’s got a brilliant camera, vibrant display and speedy processor. It’s the Google phone for Google fans. The Samsung fan who still believes View photos Samsung’s Galaxy S7 is still one of the best phones you can get.More Read More Samsung took a huge hit this year with the recall of its fire-prone Galaxy Note7, but the company’s Galaxy S7 is still one of the best smartphones on the market. Untouched by the issues that plagued the Note7, the S7 features a crisp, colorful display; razor sharp camera and incredibly fast performance. The fact that the S7 is water-resistant is just icing on the cake. Better still, you can find a host of deals packaging the Galaxy S7 with Samsung’s Gear VR virtual reality headset. A smartphone for those looking for something a little different View photos You might not know OnePlus, but the company makes great phones.More Among Android smartphone makers, China’s OnePlus is a major standout since the company produces high-end handsets at relatively low prices. The smartphone maker’s latest effort, the OnePlus 3T, is a perfect example of the company’s “Never Settle” motto. That’s because this handset, which runs a customized version of Android called Oxygen OS, features a whopping 6GB of RAM, a high-end processor and your choice of either 64GB or 128GB of storage. You’ll also get a 16MP rear and front cameras, so your selfie and portrait games are always on point. At $440 the T3 is practically a steal. If you want something a bit less expensive, you can always opt for the standard OnePlus 3, which features a slightly less powerful processor and 8MP front camera for $400. The control freak View photos The Moto Z Force can transform into a speaker, point-and-shoot camera or projector.More There’s always that one person on your list who wants things their way, which can make buying them anything a bit tough. Lenovo’s $720 Moto Z Force (Verizon only) and $700 Moto Z, however, can make things a little easier. That’s because these handsets feature modular components that expand their capabilities. An $80 JBL speaker turns your handset into a portable speaker, while the $300 Insta-Share Projector lets you project movies directly from your phone to the nearest projector screen or wall. View photos The Moto Z’s camera mod turns it into a point-and-shoot with 10x optical zoom.More Then there’s the $300 Hasselblad True Zoom camera mod, which turns the handset into a point-and-shoot camera with a 10x optical zoom.

But Apple’s engineer elves worked for a year to overhaul iOS 10, and they’ve planted lots of hidden gems. Today, I’m happy to present another of the best iOS 10 features that Apple forgot to mention. Medical research tells us that sleep deprivation and inconsistent sleep schedules take a terrible toll on our health, mood, and productivity. So iOS 10’s Clock app offers a new Bedtime tab. You answer a few questions about your sleep habits, and the app will attempt to keep your sleep regular—prompting you when it’s time to get ready for bed, waking you at a consistent time, and keeping a graph of your sleep consistency. And there you have it: 12 of the hidden gems in iOS 10. If you wind up regularly using only one of these tips—well, then I guess this wasn’t a very useful article!

X Government says ECJ ruling has no bearing on Apple case Department of Finance responds to ruling in relation to Spanish tax concession scheme Wed, Dec 21, 2016, 13:17 Guy Hedgecoe In Madrid, Eoin Burke-Kennedy ECJ decision casts doubt on tax concessions offered to companies such as Santander.         The Government has dismissed suggestions that a ruling by Europe’s top court on tax concessions given to Spanish companies represents a setback for the State’s appeal against the Apple tax ruling. The European Court of Justice’s (ECJ) ruling on Wednesday cast doubt on a tax scheme used by some Spanish firms to reduce their corporation tax liability, and appeared to back the European Commission’s view that it constituted a breach of state aid rules. The verdict was seen to give an insight into the court’s likely stance on the European Commission’s €13 billion tax ruling in relation to Apple, which is being appealed by the Government. However, this was rejected by the Department of Finance. “It is a complete overstatement to say that the Irish appeal of the Apple decision is dependent on the outcome of the Santander and Autogrill decision of the European Court of Justice, or that today’s judgement is crucial for the Irish case,” a spokesman said. “The facts and the approach in the Santander and Autogrill cases are very different from those that have now been presented in the final decision in the Apple case,” he added. However, Sinn Féin finance spokesman Pearse Doherty said the ruling shows why the Government’s decision to appeal the Apple decision will be a waste of money. “The spin that the Apple ruling was a case of the commission exceeding its powers is now debunked,” he said. In its ruling, the Luxembourg-based court said EU’s General Court had been mistaken in deciding that the European Commission had not managed to demonstrate that a group of companies had been singled out by the programme. The scheme, which offers tax breaks for firms with a 5 per cent shareholding in a foreign company, will now have to be re-examined by a lower court. ADVERTISEMENT The case affects World Duty Free Group (formerly Autogrill España) and Santusa Holding, as well as Santander. The European Commission welcomed the judgment, saying its state aid decisions were reinstated and that it would now work with Spanish authorities to recover the aid granted. ‘Floor clause’ mortgages In a separate ruling, the ECJ also decided that homeowners affected by so-called “floor clause” mortgages should be reimbursed money dating back to when their mortgage contract was signed. Previously, they were only entitled to reimbursement as far back as May 2013 when the Spanish Supreme Court first ruled that such mortgages were unlawful. Banks started to offer the now-infamous “floor clause” mortgages during Spain’s decade-long economic boom, which was fuelled by the property sector. The clause ensured that the homeowner would have to pay a minimum amount of interest, despite having contracted a variable interest mortgage. When European interest rates plummeted, these clients – numbering around three million – continued to pay a higher monthly rate than other homeowners. The Luxembourg-based court said that limiting the timeframe to 2013 “makes consumer protection incomplete and insufficient and is not an adequate and effective means for preventing the use of unfair terms”. Estimates vary as to how much lenders will have to pay back clients as a result of the ruling, with financial consultancy AFI putting the figure at approximately €4.5 billion.       Topics: Eu European Commission Apple Bbva Santander Spain Read More Fiscal council’s work lacked basic coherence, says civil servant ECB Irish bond restrictions may be eased by NTMA, Central Bank Gideon Rachman: Britain’s third option is train-crash Brexit Apple ruling: EU accuses Ireland of inconsistencies on tax rules Finland plans to hand out no-strings cash to unemployed Ireland fails to justify selective treatment of Apple, commission says Dublin’s pre-emptive strike directs narrative on Apple tax Apple dismisses tax bill, says Ireland ‘doesn’t do any engineering for us’ Commission accused of undermining Ireland’s tax code Apple judgment partly about making big political statement Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Transport & Tourism Why Ryanair is offering package holidays now Work Millennials start new year with old-school paper diaries and pens English Soccer Jermain Defoe double leaves Liverpool frustrated Irish Times After 2016, economic forecasting for 2017 has got to be perilous Sponsored Making a difficult fertility journey a lot less lonely Redbreast Lustau: an old friend with a new whiskey perspective Infertility and the workplace: one woman's experience Do you know how much you’ll save by switching health plan?

Here are the biggest disasters we saw this year. By Scott Matteson | December 21, 2016, 4:26 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStock/Varijanta Mobile devices had a booming 2016, with usage of iOS and Android handhelds growing steadily throughout the year. By contrast, desktop operating systems other than Windows 10 and OS X generally showed a decline in growth. In fact, last month Marketing Land reported that global mobile internet usage was higher than that of desktop systems as of October, and predicted that nearly 80% of internet usage will be mobile by 2018. As with any element of technology, more widespread usage leads to greater and more widespread threats, and mobility is no exception. Here's a rundown of ten mobile risks we experienced in 2016, as well as some solutions to prevent or protect your devices from them (where applicable). SEE: Poll: What new cybersecurity trends will dominate 2017? 1. Unsecured devices This is a significant issue and, sadly, it hasn't been a problem exclusive to 2016, but has been a plague in prior years as well. It was reported in January this year that only about one-third of Android users lock their screens with a passcode. Apple users are much more diligent — The Verge reported in April that 89% of iPhones are locked with TouchID or a passcode. That still leaves millions of devices out there which can fall into malicious hands and render the owner completely at someone else's mercy if the device stores confidential data. Even if it doesn't, someone could still wreak havoc with a found or stolen phone since many people store account IDs and passwords with device apps such as email and Facebook. Using complex passcodes (your date of birth or street number is a bad choice) and encryption on the device can greatly help reduce the risk of stolen data or malicious mischief. Encryption on removable micro-SD cards which contain private data is especially a must. SEE: Worried about identity theft? Then you should avoid these password pitfalls More about Mobility Mobile app developers: Here's what uninstall rates can tell you about your product Photos: The trendiest smartwatches and fitness bands for 2016 holiday season Mobile has officially passed desktop as the top source of web traffic worldwide Subscribe to TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise newsletter 2. Lack of Mobile Device Management solutions in place Businesses can greatly benefit from the use of mobile device management (or MDM) solutions to provide enhanced security for mobile users, especially if a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy is in place. Microsoft Exchange Server, for instance, has options to block unauthorized devices from connecting to user mailboxes, can require passwords, and can remote wipe lost or stolen phones. Other third party solutions can implement detailed and granular controls such as whitelisting and blacklisting applications, employing anti-malware protection, enforcing encryption, pushing out updates, enabling and disabling various device functions such as the camera, and in general providing a good standardization of device settings. Consumer devices do have some measure of available management options; Apple and Android each provide a "find my device" feature for lost phones as well as the option to ring or erase said devices, but this is usually more reactive rather than proactive. The bottom line: if your business doesn't use MDM, it should. Start conducting research now to find products that match your needs. 3. Apps that request too many permissions It should raise a red flag when a newly-installed app wants access to various components of your phone, such as your contacts, or functions such as your location service. If you were installing a simple flashlight app, hopefully you would be suspicious if it began making such requests when you launched it. Unfortunately all of us who use technology are routinely inundated with what I call the "Are you sure you want to do that?" prompt, whereby you are forced to select "Yes" or "OK" to continue with something you're doing. Browsers and operating systems themselves (cough, Windows, cough) are notorious for this and while it's usually well-meaning it puts us in a mindset to just click Yes to make the prompt go away. Don't let apps which may have ill intentions take advantage of your complacency or impatience. SEE: 10 mobile security myths that need debunking 4. Outdated apps Outdated apps can represent security risks if attackers find exploitable code in them. Reputable app stores like Google Play and Apple's iTunes and App store have options so apps will update on their own. To check and confirm this is working on Android, open the Google Play Store app, tap the Menu icon, choose Settings, and select Auto-update apps. You can choose to have apps update any time or exclusively over Wi-Fi. For Apple's iOS 7, go to Settings and scroll down to iTunes and App Store. Tap this icon and scroll down towards the bottom until you see Automatic Downloads. You can activate automatic downloads for Music, Apps, Books and Updates and specify the update intervals (you should pick the most feasible option which will result in the most frequent updates). Of course, this doesn't guarantee that apps installed from other less reputable places will benefit from this function. Which leads me to number five. 5. Bogus app stores App stores besides iTunes and Google Play are like Forrest Gump's famous "life is like a box of chocolates" analogy. You truly never know what you're going to get. Maybe it's a legitimate app. Maybe it's otherwise. Apple and Google vet the apps which they permit to be distributed via their stores, and yet they still deal with a deluge of fake apps which scammers and hackers try to slip past them (which is why you should be judicious even with apps found in the Apple and Google Play stores). Third party app stores can contain much more dangerous content which can be completely unscreened. One example is the Chinese-based app store called Haima which Trend Micro reported in September contains repackaged apps which aren't vetted by Apple and which can contain malicious payloads. Hiapk and Anzhi are two other third-party app stores which have been known to offer malware-ridden applications. 6. Decoy apps In September, I covered the topic of how a supposed Pokeman Go guide actually contained a trojan which had the potential to steal confidential data which could then be sold. This app was made available from a third-party app store. What's especially troubling about this kind of risk is the app SEEMED legitimate and users had no immediate cause for concern — until it began trying to harvest data. As you can imagine, decoy apps like this will closely match current trends (such as the Pokemon Go craze) so as to attract as many victims as possible. 7. Mobile app malware The last three entries in the list lead directly to this one, which is the risk of mobile app malware which can be installed deliberately or via exploited vulnerabilities. Legitimate and bogus apps alike may be subject to malware which can operate in many different ways and comes in several types of forms. Exploitable vulnerabilities such as Stagefright are bad enough, but other vulnerabilities can lead to the installation of spyware such as Pegasus, malware such as Hummer and Hummingbad, and ransomware. A report discussed on TechRepublic in August listed five threats that had either emerged, or gotten worse, over the last few months: Android GMBot - A spyware, usually from third-party app stores, that tries to trick users into giving up their bank credentials. AceDeceiver iOS malware - Malware that works to steal a user's Apple ID. SideStepper iOS vulnerability - A technique that works in between the MDM server and a device to install unapproved applications. High-severity OpenSSL issues - Two OpenSSL flaws that can either decrypt traffic or corrupt memory. Marcher Android malware - A malware that pretends to be a bank website in hopes that users will give up their login credentials. Apps and operating systems should be kept up to date religiously to protect mobile devices from vulnerabilities or at the very least to maximize their protection. Running anti-malware on your device makes sense along with keeping up on the latest mobile security news via sites like Security Week, ComputerWorld, DarkReading and, of course, TechRepublic. It's also important to note that security experts often advise against rooting or jailbreaking phones, since this can render them more susceptible to risk. I realize technical people thrive on experimenting with and customizing their devices, but it's fair to point out the danger involved. SEE: Infographic: Businesses are more concerned about security of mobile devices and employee data than cyberwarfare 8. Botnets Botnets are technological entities made up of many compromised mobile devices which can then be collectively harnessed like flying monkeys into performing nefarious tasks. For example, they can launch distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks against websites in an attempt to extort money from the website owner. Botnets can utilize a diverse array of other tricks; one such example discovered this August operated by checking a specific Twitter account periodically to receive commands, which are critical for impacted devices to operate in sync with one another. Other online elements such as blog pages or messaging system can also be used to control botnet participants. Botnets are even being sold online to bidders willing to pay for their utilization, a troubling sign of what lies to come. Suspicious phone behavior such as a quickly draining battery can be a sign that your phone is part of a botnet. Also be on the lookout for network connectivity problems, sluggish performance, the presence of unknown applications or the absence of known ones, and text or email communications sent without your knowledge and consent. There is also virus scan engine called VirusTotal which you can use to check for malware on your phone. It's free to use and can work via a browser or apps for Android and iOS. 9. Exploding Notes Not all mobile risks are security-related. The infamous Samsung Note 7 phone was recalled in October after several dozen devices caught fire. In fact, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) actually banned the Note 7 from being taken on board all aircraft flights. Samsung began offering extra money to Note7 owners for turning their phones in and recently confirmed that it will shortly release a software update which will completely disable these phones, knocking them out of service for good. Lesson to be learned here: wait a bit before buying a new device model, to see if design or operational issues such as these begin rearing their heads. 10. Open Wi-Fi networks The proverbial Wi-Fi in the coffee shop was just the beginning. Wi-Fi connectivity is everywhere now. Restaurants, airports, stadiums hotels and many other places where groups of people congregate offer free open Wi-Fi. It's like that old saying about how you can never have too much money or be too thin. There's no such thing as too many Wi-Fi networks, especially for devices without global data access. However, Wi-Fi availability isn't necessarily a good thing at times. Open, unsecured Wi-Fi networks can pose a significant security risk, especially if you're using credentials to log into other sites or accessing confidential data. Wi-Fi traffic can be "sniffed" and unencrypted data may end up stolen — including passwords, credit card data or other sensitive details. If you're connecting to an open Wi-Fi network to play Candy Crush, that's probably not such a big deal. If you're logging into your company's Exchange server, however, that might be something else. If you're doing something which might lead data or credentials to fall into the wrong hands, make sure to do it over a virtual private network (VPN) or use your own Wi-Fi hotspot or some other secure means for access.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Apple CEO promises fresh Mac hardware, as report shows Apple is ignoring its desktops, macOS Apple CEO promises fresh Mac hardware, as report shows Apple is ignoring its desktops, macOS By Joel Hruska on December 21, 2016 at 7:30 am Comment Apple’s recent MacBook Pro updates and “courageous” iPhone 7 have proven to be controversial, and a recent pair of news items highlights how much pent-up frustration is aimed at the device manufacturer. First, Tim Cook made several posts to an Apple employee bulletin board, detailing Apple’s thinking on thinking on both desktops and the intersection between hardware and software design. Cook writes: The desktop is very strategic for us. It’s unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop — the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people. The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we’re committed to desktops. If there’s any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that… From a strategic point of view, we also focus on things where software, hardware and services all come together and bring out the magic that only Apple can. That’s our secret sauce. It shows up in a lot of different places, and it’s something that we look for in new employees. Apple CEO Tim Cook. A brand new report from Bloomberg offers an interesting counterweight to Cook’s confidence. According to that investigation, Apple has made a number of strategic decisions that took emphasis away from the Mac design teams. The software team has been reorganized, such that a dedicated macOS team no longer exists and most of the software engineers at Apple are iOS first, Mac second. Hardware engineers are now asked to work on multiple projects at once, or to develop multiple versions of a potential product simultaneously. For example, Apple engineers working on the 2016 MacBook update reportedly wanted to add a second USB-C port and Touch ID support, according to the report. Instead, Apple pushed out a slightly iteration of the same platform and a new “rose gold” color. Engineers working on Mac hardware no longer command the same attention from Jony Ive, the report said, and the appetite for leapfrogging the competition with a more daring approach to technology doesn’t always pay dividends — apparently Apple intended to introduce new battery technology with the MacBook Pro, but unspecified problems killed that option. The Bloomberg report concludes on this note: “Mac fans shouldn’t hold their breath for radical new designs in 2017 though. Instead, the company is preparing modest updates: USB-C ports and a new Advanced Micro Devices Inc. graphics processor for the iMac, and minor bumps in processing power for the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro.” Apple’s innovation decline Part of the problem Apple is facing is straightforward: CPUs haven’t really scaled since 2013. I discussed this last August, but it bears repeating. The image below shows the CPUs Apple currently sells in the three-year-old Mac Pro as compared with the most recent chips available from Intel: Each 2013-era chip is contrasted with its 2016 equivalent. Now, the one thing Apple could do is introduce some high core-count chips that weren’t really available in 2013. Back then, the Xeon E5v2 family topped out at 12 cores; modern CPUs in the E5v4 family top out at 22 cores within the same 135W TDP. But that option carries a hefty frequency penalty: The 12-core E5-2697v2 has a base clock of 2.7GHz and a boost clock of 3.5GHz. The 22-core E5-4699v4 has a 2.2GHz base frequency and a 3GHz boost clock. In other words, if your workload is embarrassingly parallel and can easily scale above 12 threads, the E5-4699v4 is a better option. If it doesn’t — or if you can’t afford the $7,000 price tag Intel has hung on the chip — you won’t see benefits. The GPU market is a markedly different story. AMD’s Polaris refresh would be a good fit for the iMac or even potentially lower-end variants of the Mac Pro, while Vega should address the Mac Pro market head-on (and of course, Nvidia has its own lineup of GPUs, should Apple be interested). Either way, the GPUs baked into current Mac systems are quite old. Apple has never put graphics front-and-center, and it failed to follow up on the graphics-centric argument it made for the Mac Pro. Instead of investing in OpenGL or OpenCL (macOS still only supports OCL 1.2, despite OCL 2.0 now being widely available), Apple has doubled-down on Metal, its own custom iOS API that it also backported to macOS. But major companies like Adobe, which do make use of GPU acceleration, have only begun to add Metal support and it’s not fully baked yet. But I don’t think the issues Apple is facing with macOS and its various Mac systems are simply a matter of lackluster hardware cycles. Apple used to present buyers with a very simple argument: “It just works.” Those three words, however inaccurate or accurate you feel they happen to be, captured most of how Apple marketed itself to customers. MacOS was easier to use. The iPhone and iMac were designed to work together. Apple hardware was a consolidated, discrete ecosystem, with fewer choices but better integration of its various components. And while you may not have found this argument particularly appealing, there was truth to it. Apple built routers and peripherals that were designed to interface with its own software and platforms in ways that other companies rarely matched. That argument seems much less potent now than it did in the past. Apple is leaving the peripheral business (apart from dongles, natch) and its clearly not putting the resources into macOS development that it once did. The latest MacBook and MacBook Pro don’t ‘just work’ unless you’ve got a varying number of dongles to hook up. In the event the company does refresh the Mac Pro, everyone who shucked out for Thunderbolt 2 adapters so they could plug non-Thunderbolt peripherals into the system is going to need to buy Thunderbolt 3 adapters for their Thunderbolt 2-to-USB (or what have you) adapters so they can continue to use their hardware. It’s not very Mac-like, when you get right down to it. In fact, it’s precisely the kind of inelegant-but-functional arrangement I associate with PCs. There’s another answer to this issue, though — one that has nothing to do with Tim Cook or Steve Jobs and everything to do with the evolution of the PC and smartphone ecosystems. In retrospect, it’s clear that the iPod, iPhone, and touchscreen interfaces arrived during the last great hurrah of Moore’s Law, at a time when process node scaling and multi-core products were still delivering rapid improvements. The original iPhone in 2007 happened because it became possible for a capacitive touchscreen device to happen. Steve Jobs and Apple still deserve credit for the idea, but the idea only worked because technology had advanced to the point that it could be made to work. Such inflection points are rare — one could argue that we’ve only had a handful throughout the entire history of computing. The first computers relied on a non-realtime batch interface, followed by command-line interfaces that incorporated video terminals and keyboards. The addition of the mouse and GUI are significant enough to deserve their own separate classification, followed by the rise of capacitive touchscreens since 2007. In 72 years (1945 – 2016) we’ve had four of these transitions, and Steve Jobs’ career happened to fall at a time when he could make significant contributions to both. In the end, it scarcely matters. However loyal Apple customers may be in the short term, they’ll inevitably leave the platform if Tim Cook doesn’t give them reason to stay. 2016 was a distinct let-down in this regard, and 2017 isn’t looking much better if the Bloomberg report is right.

We haven’t taken the new machine for a test run but according to early reviews one huge disappointment is the battery life. MacBooks have been known to have a longer and way more sturdy battery when compared to Windows notebooks. The reason for a weaker battery on the new MacBooks been revealed via a report by Bloomberg. Apparently Apple was planning to cram in higher-capacity batteries that were shaped to precisely fit to the inside the chassis of the new notebook. However the design failed a key test.  This made Apple go with an older battery design. According to the Verge, the new MacBook Pro, especially the Touch Bar models, offer lower capacity than the battery inside last year’s MacBook Pro. This was possibly to keep weight and space in check. They offer a five to six hour battery backup instaed of the claimed 10 hours. Apple has also said to have utilised less design resources for the production of Macs in recent years. It also pulled out engineers from macOS which no longer has a dedicated development team. These changes were to redirect resources to the decelopment of iPhone, iPad, and iOS. Just yesterday we heard Apple CEO, Tim Cook reassuring employees that Macs were still a point fo focus and that “great desktops” were on the way.

For lots of people, the year 2016 can’t end soon enough. Whether it’s the bitter, divisive presidential election; the misery in Syria; the horrible terrorist attacks in various cities; or the deaths of beloved figures, it’s been a lousy year. It’s also been a mixed year for the major tech companies, with a few big strides and many other missed chances. Their leaders sure didn’t look happy at the year’s end, gathered at Trump Tower last week with a soon-to-be president most of them opposed. At the start of the year, I wrote a column saying what I thought each of the digital giants should do to improve its products this year. Here’s how I think they fared, and how I missed some big issues that arose or ripened during the year. Google It was a big year for Google. The company became a vertically integrated hardware maker with the Pixel phone, along with the Google Home intelligent speaker and the Google Wifi router system. This was something I called for in the start-of-the-year column, as well as in an entire earlier column from 2015. What I didn’t get into was the fact that this move, while it has other virtues, was closely tied to the company’s decision to stake its future on artificial intelligence and machine learning, for which the phone and speaker are vessels. Google’s big moves have yet to pay off It’s too early to know if this move into hardware is paying off. I certainly doubt the Pixel will outsell the iPhone for the 2016 holiday quarter, despite lavish TV advertising. And the Google Assistant AI service is still rough around the edges. Google didn’t implement my call to make Android apps function out of the box on every Chromebook this year. But I’ll take partial credit. That project was indeed announced in 2016, but is proceeding slowly and in many cases requires running a developer’s edition of the Chrome OS. A hot issue I failed to mention back in January, with which Google is still wrestling, is the problem of excising fake news and hate speech from top-ranking search results. The company has taken a few steps, but has much farther to go to preserve the credibility of its search results. Apple Though Apple is primarily a hardware company, in January I urged it to focus on improving its core software: the Apple-made Mail, Calendar, Music, Photos, and other apps on its devices. And in fact the company did some of this. Examples include a new user interface for Apple Music, easier app access on the Apple Watch, lots of new features in iMessage and improvements in Apple Maps, and in the default keyboard’s predictive typing. And Apple’s commitment to privacy and security remains steadfast and admirable. But the all-important Mail app, on both iOS and macOS, is still poor at handling the overwhelmingly popular Gmail service and the iOS calendar is still clumsy; iTunes and Photos still need work. Apple has overemphasized design Most importantly, and unforeseen by me back then, Apple managed to disappoint in 2016 with a series of hardware products that, while very good, weren’t up to the company’s high historical standards, in my view. In most cases, I attribute this to an overemphasis on design at the expense of function. This isn’t solely an Apple problem, but it’s most clearly evident there. The iPhone 7, while boasting better specs, axed the long-standing, perfectly fine headphone jack, making a dongle necessary to charge the phone while using earbuds. The MacBook Pro was made thinner and lighter, and given a narrow function screen atop the keyboard called the Touch Bar. But, in the process, it became a tweener with less battery life. And the new, wireless AirPod earbuds, while impressive in many ways, can’t adjust the volume or skip a track without either interrupting the music to ask Siri to do it or fumbling for your phone or Apple Watch. That’s a step backwards from the silent, manipulable control module on familiar old EarPods. Microsoft In January, I called for the software giant to find a way to get more modern, tablet-style apps developed for its cross-device Windows 10 operating system, especially to help its anemic phone business. But there’s been little or no progress. In fact, Windows Phone continued to wither — almost out of sight. And, partly because of that, the company was forced to back off its pledge to have a billion devices running Windows 10 by 2018. Microsoft has had a very good year However, the company’s relatively small Surface hardware group scored a coup by enchanting designers, video editors, and other creatives with a gorgeous all-in-one desktop just as Apple was disappointing some of them with the new MacBook Pro. Overall, Microsoft had a very good year. Beyond the small hardware unit, new CEO Satya Nadella has the company churning out good software for rival platforms — Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android — challenging Amazon in cloud services, and right in the thick of the coming AI battle. Amazon The company continued its pursuit of commerce and media, even delivering a package by drone in 13 minutes. But I had urged it to break out with a big new hardware push, beyond the Echo intelligent speaker. I suggested maybe even resurrecting its failed phone effort, this time backed by the Alexa AI platform that powers Echo. Instead, Amazon doubled down on the Echo, even as Google brought out Home to directly compete with it. The retailer has added thousands of new apps, or skills, to Alexa, but didn’t bust out with major new hardware in 2016. And it’s difficult to know how many users employ the Echo’s more sophisticated functions, beyond things like listening to music and setting timers. Facebook Back in January, I urged Facebook to “rethink the news feed in a major way, with a central focus on giving users greater control and a clearer understanding of how to exercise it.” But, while the company is constantly tinkering with the News Feed, it didn’t give it a significant overhaul in 2016, though there are hints of bigger moves next year. Facebook may never again be able to behave like a neutral canvas What I didn’t foresee is that Facebook would face a crisis in tamping down fake news and hate speech, a crisis which made it clearer than even that the social network had become a major media company with new and more complex responsibilities. As the year is ending, Facebook is scrambling to form partnerships with fact-checking organizations, and taking internal steps, to try and suppress the fake news and hate speech. But it may never again be able to behave like it’s just a neutral canvas. One more thing… While it isn’t one of the major platform companies, and I didn’t touch on it back in January, no account of 2016 can ignore Samsung Electronics. The Korean colossus had an utterly miserable year in 2016 with the exploding Galaxy Note 7 disaster, a bungled recall and replacement, and finally a software patch that will disable remaining units. The company still hasn’t explained in any detail what went wrong and its reputation has taken severe damage. The next Galaxy phone will have a lot riding on it. Bottom Line Personal tech never sleeps, and, while 2016 was a mixed bag, all these companies and many others will have a chance to delight or disappoint next year. Will the 2017 iPhone finally be “spectacular”? Will Facebook and Google really clean out the garbage infecting their precincts? Will Microsoft try for a phone breakthrough under the Surface brand? And how will all these companies get along with the Trump administration? Stay tuned for the real news @verge.

 Leaked documents suggest Apple will launch a premium iPhone codenamed 'Ferrari' next year Hannah Roberts Dec. 21, 2016, 8:53 AM 21,494 facebook linkedin twitter email print AppleInsider A Chinese social media user has published what they claim are leaked manufacturing documents from Apple which appear to confirm rumours that the company will launch three iPhones in 2017 — "s" models of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and a redesigned, top-tier model internally codenamed "Ferrari," Apple Insider reports. The blogger, who posted the document on one of China's biggest social media platforms Sina Weibo (it was first noticed by Chinese technology site cnBeta), is known for leaking information from Apple's East Asian supply chain.  And the documents appear to confirm a list of rumours about features the "Ferrari" — perhaps a codename for the iPhone 8 or the iPhone 10 — will have. The rumoured features include an "AMOLED" panel — a new kind of OLED (organic light-emitting diode display) screen already used by Samsung — which would allow the phone to have a borderless, all-display front surface. Another rumour is that the OLED screen would be mounted on plastic, suggesting that it might be curved. This lines up with a report from The Wall Street Journal which says Apple is testing prototypes for new iPhones which may have a new design centered on a curved screen. Other rumoured features the document mentions include a glass-sandwich design (glass at the front and back of the phone), an "invisible" home button, and wireless charging. The "Ferrari" iPhone, which could be released to mark the iPhone's 10th anniversary, will come with "a substantial internal redesign," the leaked documents claim. The document also says that Apple is considering relocating the SIM card tray towards the bottom of the handset to make room for internal components. The iPhone 7s and 7s Plus, internally codenamed D20 and d21, are expected to have LCD displays like previous iPhones, the documents reveal. All of this is in line with speculation from KGI Securities, which pointed to three iPhone models in 2017, with only one sporting the new kind of OLED screen.

(AMZN) Stock Is Going to $800 on Best Holiday Ever View All Posts U.S. stock futures are headed higher again this morning, meaning today may be the day the Dow Jones Industrial Average caps the magical 20,000 level. The Dow closed at a record high yesterday, with a late-arriving Santa Claus rally lifting stocks across the board. With less than two weeks until 2017, all three major indices are on track to gain roughly 10% this year. At last check, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.03%, while S&P 500 futures had added 0.36% and Nasdaq-100 futures had risen 0.49%. On the options front, volume remained light on Tuesday, with about 14.4 million calls and 11.9 million puts changing hands. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio retreated to 0.63, while the 10-day moving average held at 0.57. Turning to Tuesday’s volume leaders, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) saw a pair of reports emerge on manufacturing, speculating on a plant in India and the company’s reluctance to continue making Macs in the U.S. Meanwhile, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) surged on a pair of significant price-target increases, while Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) offered up strong second-quarter earnings. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will they stay, or will they go? A pair of reports on Apple manufacturing surfaced yesterday: one all but confirming that the company was moving forward with manufacturing in India, the other underscoring Apple’s desire to kill off U.S. manufacturing. The 7 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks for 2017 Apple’s motives in India are clear — start making iPhones and Macs as a foothold for sales in the country (and, of course, cheaper labor). As for the U.S., just because Apple wants to move away from making Macs stateside doesn’t mean it will. As the article notes, doing so would be political suicide. Combining the mix of sentiment in these reports with the fact that AAPL stock is trading near its October highs has created some headwinds for the shares. And options traders were quick to pick up on the shift. Overall, total volume came in at 628,000 contracts on Tuesday, with calls accounting for a below average 58% of the day’s take. AAPL stock has cleared peak weekly December 23 series call open interest at $115, but OI is building in the weekly December 30 series at the $116, $117 and $120 strikes — all of which are sporting more than 10,000 contracts each. If Santa Claus fails to come through for AAPL stock, these calls may be in trouble heading into expiration. Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Both Goldman Sachs and Mizuho Securities boosted their price targets on NVDA stock yesterday — Goldman adding NVDA to its “conviction buy” list with a $129 price target and Mizuho setting its sights on $115 for the shares. Nvidia has come a long way since I last zeroed in on the shares, and if you got into that NVDA January 2017 $95/$100 bull call spread, now’s the time to get out and take profits. Why? As InvestorPlace contributor Josh Enomoto notes, “It’s a whole new level of crazy.” Even speculative options traders, seeing NVDA rush toward $105 yesterday, took a moment of pause. Volume on the chip maker came in at 201,000 contracts, with only about 59% of those crossing at call contracts.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « The EU's High Court Forbids Key Elements of UK's Newly Passed Investigatory Powers Bill | Main | Mossberg's Review of the Top Tech Dogs of 2016 Finds that Apple's products weren't up to their Historical Standards » December 21, 2016 Apple Files a Major Antitrust Case against Acacia Research Corporation Pointing to a Conspiracy with Nokia Corporation   On September 17, 2016 Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple lost a Patent Case based on a Nokia Patent. Will the EU now Open an Antitrust Case against Nokia as Promised?" Obviously we were bang on because Apple is going to wait for the EU to act, Apple has launched an antitrust lawsuit against Acacia and all those listed on the docket noted in our cover graphic. The filing has a notation at the top that states: "REDACTED VERSION OF DOCUMENT SOUGHT TO BE CONDITIONALLY SEALED."   Apple's Introduction of the Case   Apple Inc. ("Apple") brings this action to remedy a continuing anticompetitive scheme. Acacia Research Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, "Acacia") and Conversant Intellectual Property Management Inc. ("Conversant") and its subsidiaries (collectively, "Conversant") have respectively colluded with Nokia Corporation (itself and through its affiliates Nokia Solutions and Networks Oy and Nokia Technologies Oy (collectively "Nokia")) to obtain from Nokia thousands of patents as part of a plan to extract and extort exorbitant revenues unfairly and anticompetitively from Apple and other innovative suppliers of cell phones, and ultimately from the consumers of those products. Acacia, Conversant, and many other patent assertion entities ("PAEs") have conspired with Nokia to use unfair and anticompetitive patent assertions to improperly tax the innovations of cell phone makers.   This conduct is all the more pernicious because it unfairly and anticompetitively evades binding commitments that Nokia made to license declared standard essential patents ("SEPs") on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory ("FRAND") terms. Nokia positioned itself to claim that its patents cover technologies included in telecommunications standards by repeatedly assuring standard-setting organizations that it would license its patents fairly. Yet Acacia and Conversant are now conspiring with Nokia in a scheme to diffuse and abuse such patents and, as the PAEs and Nokia fully intended, monetize those false promises by extracting exorbitant non-FRAND royalties in ways Nokia could not.   Acacia's and Conversant's illegal conduct takes place against the backdrop of Nokia's failure as a supplier of cell phones. In 2011, Nokia remained a major supplier of cell phones, but, due to its failure to innovate, was facing business prospects so dire that Nokia ultimately exited the cell phone market. As Nokia's CEO had announced to employees the previous year, Nokia was standing on "a burning platform." Unable to compete with innovative companies such as Apple—which had developed a revolutionary hardware and software platform—Nokia quickly transformed itself. It changed from a company focused on supplying cell phones and other consumer products to a company bent on exploiting the patents that remain from its years as a successful cell phone supplier. In its changed form, Nokia has sought to extract exorbitant patent royalties from Apple and other cell phone makers, and Acacia and Conversant have been its willing conspirators to that end.   With the active collaboration of Acacia and Conversant, Nokia avoids licensing its own portfolio directly and transparently, though it is fully competent to do so. Instead, Nokia has 6    divided its patent portfolio and distributed portions of it among Acacia, Conversant, and other PAEs, while retaining an interest in revenues generated by those PAEs. Nokia then enlists mercenary PAEs including Acacia and Conversant – that have offered their services aggressively to threaten, sue, and thereby extract exorbitant, above-market royalties from cell phone makers, including for declared SEPs. The reasons why Conversant and Acacia have conspired with Nokia are clear. The PAEs can take advantage of the fact that—unlike Nokia, which now focuses on the network business—they produce nothing at all and therefore have no desire or need for "patent peace," and can impose disproportionate discovery and litigation costs on the product companies they sue. By conspiring with Nokia in a scheme to disperse the Nokia portfolio to the PAEs, Acacia and Conversant can obtain more royalties from product companies than Nokia cold have obtained through direct and transparent licensing, and then share with Nokia the ill-gotten fruits of their illegal exploitation. Acacia and Conversant are chief partners with Nokia in an overarching patent transfer scheme that has resulted in at least nine PAE partners armed with former Nokia patents, many of which have embarked on serial, abusive, and anticompetitive assertions of their former Nokia patents (both SEPs and non-SEPs) against Apple. These Nokia partners have sued Apple at least twelve times based on former Nokia patents alone. Acacia and its shell subsidiaries, themselves, have sued Apple in the United States and abroad more than forty times, based on patents they acquired from Nokia or others, demanding exorbitant royalties based on unsupported infringement claims. For its part, Conversant, through its subsidiary Core Wireless Licensing S.a.r.l. ("Core Wireless"), has asserted over two dozen patents against Apple. These serial assertions and litigations have forced Apple to incur multiple millions of dollars in defense costs, precisely the sort of leverage that Acacia and Conversant intended to create when they agreed to conspire with Nokia. In sum, by conspiring with Nokia to obtain weak Nokia patents and then using them to extort product innovators, Acacia and Conversant have engaged in widespread violations of competition law and breaches of FRAND commitments.   That Acacia and Conversant have fully intended to maximize the total royalties that can be extracted from Apple and other cell phone makers using former Nokia patents is apparent from the structure of their agreements with Nokia: Nokia has retained the right to receive a large portion of any royalties and settlements that Acacia, Conversant, and their respective subsidiaries extract. And, collectively, Nokia and its partners are demanding far more in royalties than Nokia could have sought on its own. Unless enjoined and remedied, the conduct described herein will continue to injure Apple, other participants in industries that are vital to the national economy, and consumers in the United States and elsewhere.   Acacia's and Conversant's schemes to conspire with Nokia for the abusive and anticompetitive diffusion of Nokia's patent portfolio has already imposed extraordinary costs and burdens on the cell phone industry. Rather than defend against patent assertions by Nokia alone, Apple and other victims of the scheme are subjected to serial assertions by Acacia, Conversant, and their shell subsidiaries, who (along with other PAEs) have offered up their services to add to the cumulative burdens on Apple, other suppliers of cell phones, and U.S. and other consumers.   Apple brings this action to address the harm it has already suffered from the violations of federal antitrust and state unfair competition laws and breaches of contracts set forth herein. Apple has suffered damages from excessive royalty payments and the costs and burdens of defending against the barrage of patent litigation unleashed by Acacia and Conversant, along with other PAEs. Apple also seeks injunctive relief to put an end to the illegal conduct and the resulting harm to Apple, the broader industry, and U.S. and other consumers, and to unwind the patent transfers that have enabled the anticompetitive conduct described herein.   Apple Files Five Counts   Count #1: Breach of FRAND Contract   Count #2: ACACIA-NOKIA, CORE WIRELESS-NOKIA AGREEMENTS to Restrain Competition in Cellular Technology Licensing (Section 1 of the Sherman Act).   Count #3: Unlawful Asset Acquisition (Section 7 of the Clayton Act)   Count #4: Conspiracies to Monopolize the SEP TECHNOLOGY MARKETS (section 2 of the Sherman Act)   Count #5: Unfair Competition under Cal. Bus. & Pro. Code § 17200   Apple Respectfully Requested the Following Relief from the Court   A. That Defendants' unlawful conduct be declared a violation of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1 and 2, and Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18;   B. That Defendants' unlawful conduct be declared a violation of Cal. Bus. Prof. Code § 17200, et seq.;   C. That Defendants' unlawful conduct be judged a breach of contract;   D. That Apple recover damages against Acacia and Conversant, including incidental and consequential damages, in an amount to be determined and multiplied to the extent provided by law;   E. That all contracts or agreements that Nokia, on the one hand, and or Acacia or Conversant, on the other, entered into in violation of the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, Cal. Bus. Prov. Code § 17200, et seq., or in breach of Nokia's FRAND undertakings be declared void and the patents covered by those transfer agreements be transferred back from Acacia and Conversant (or their respective subsidiaries) to Nokia;   F. That all patents transferred by Nokia to, or acquired by, Acacia or Conversant (or their respective subsidiaries) in violation of the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, Cal. Bus. Prof. Code §     17200, et seq., or in breach of Nokia's FRAND undertakings be declared unenforceable;   G. That Acacia and Conversant be enjoined from seeking injunctions against Apple based on declared SEPs for which Nokia made FRAND commitments;   H. That Apple be awarded expenses and costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys' fees, to the extent provided by law; and   I. That Apple be awarded such additional relief as the Court may deem proper.   Apple's antitrust case presented in today's report was filed yesterday in the California Northern District Court, San Jose Office. At present, no Judge has been assigned to the case.   About Comments: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit comments.

Today, Apple and Nintendo have announced that the game has set a new App Store record with more than 40 million downloads in four days. The game continues to rank #1 for Top Free and Top Grossing in the App Store. In a statement posted to Nintendo’s press site, Apple SVP Phil Schiller is quoted (in Japanese) to announce the App Store download record for a game launch and congratulates the game for its success. Shigeru Miyamoto also says that he was ‘delighted to deliver a new Mario game’ for mobile devices. The company does not disclose how many of the 40 million downloads converted into paying customers. Super Mario Run allows players to trial the first few levels for free, asking for a one-time $9.99 purchase to unlock all available content. In total, the game offers 24 levels across six themed worlds. In the game, players control Mario’s jumping through the stages as the character runs automatically. The game can be played with one hand; tap to jump onto platforms, avoid enemies and collect coins. It is not that surprising that the game has been downloaded a lot; Apple has been heavily featuring the game in the App Store and on the Apple.com homepage. Reception to the game has been mixed; whilst many enjoy the nostalgia, some were disappointed by how easy the game appears or felt that there wasn’t enough content to justify the $10 pricing. The game was also criticized for its over-zealous DRM policy — requiring a constant internet connection to play. Download Super Mario Run for iPhone and iPad in the App Store. Guides Super Mario Run for iPhone and iPad Super Mario Run is a new mobile game, published by Nintendo, for iPhone and iPad devices coming December 15. The game is a simplified version of a classic Nintendo platformer where the user can play the game one-handed.

Here's what you might've missed. Josh Miller Mobile by Xiomara Blanco December 21, 2016 6:00 AM PST @zeeohmara Up Next The robots are coming to CES, and we can't wait to meet them Oh, you don't have an Apple Music or a Tidal subscription? Then you probably initially missed out on some of the most buzzworthy albums of the year. Luckily for you, most of these were only exclusive for their first few weeks of release and are all -- save one -- now available for everyone to stream on Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora or whatever's your streaming platform of choice. Are these my favorite albums of the year? No, not all of them (Solange's "A Seat at the Table," my No. 1 fav, is notably missing), but these in my opinion are the most important releases of 2016. Drake -- 'Views' Release date: April 29, 2016 Platform: Apple Music Window of exclusivity: Three weeks "Views" is the first album to reach a billion streams on Spotify and Apple Music.Photo by Josh Miller/CNET Drake is like the Taylor Swift of hip-hop; his presence in pop culture in undeniable, his songs are emotionally driven while being catchy AF and he's a shill for Apple Music. His latest album, "Views," doesn't stray from his signature sound, but its chart-topping singles are a big reason why the dancehall sound was so popular in 2016. Despite its initial exclusivity and popularity on Apple's streaming platform, "Views" has been a great success on Spotify. Drake's ending 2016 as Spotify's most streamed artist of the year (for the second year in a row) and his infectious hit single "One Dance" is officially Spotify's most streamed song ever. Chance The Rapper -- 'Coloring Book' Release date: May 13, 2016 Platform: Apple Music Window of exclusivity: Two weeks "Coloring Book" is still a streaming-only album. No physical copies have been released.Photo by Josh Miller/CNET If you don't know who Chance The Rapper is, or haven't listened to his album "Coloring Book" (it's the sonic equivalent of bathing yourself in warm rays of sunshine on winter day), you should. Chance had a historic 2016. Aside from MTV naming him 2016's artist of the year and memorable features on Kanye West's new album and "The Hamilton Mixtape," "Coloring Book" is the first streaming-exclusive to be nominated for a Grammy and chart on Billboard. Kanye West -- 'The Life of Pablo' Release date: February 14, 2016 Platform: Tidal Window of exclusivity: Two months The album title refers to Pablo Escobar, Pablo Picasso and Paul the Apostle.Photo by Josh Miller/CNET Sigh. Where to begin? Kanye had a rough 2016. His first album in three years, "The Life of Pablo" was initially released as a "living album" and Tidal-only exclusive. As part owner of Tidal, Kanye infamously tweeted that the album would never be available via Apple. Fast-forward two months and the album eventually popped up on Apple Music and Spotify. One fan was so upset by this, they even went as far as suing him. (To be fair, if they're a fan they should know by now to take Kanye's tweets with a grain of salt.) Frank Ocean -- 'Blond' Release date: August 20, 2016 Platform: Apple Music Window of exclusivity: Three weeks "Blond" is technically Ocean's second studio album.Photo by Josh Miller/CNET Frank Ocean marches to the beat of his own bird sounds. Fans (like me) had been pining, waiting with bated breath since the summer of 2015 for a new album, only to be finally satiated in the summer of 2016 with the release of "Endless," an artsy-fartsy visual-album that follows Ocean as he builds a staircase, and "Blonde" the epic, emotive, vulnerable, progressive vision of modern R&B music fans (like me) could've only dreamed of. Beyonce -- 'Lemonade' Release date: August 23, 2016 Platform: Tidal Window of exclusivity: Still only streamable via Tidal You can stream some of the singles from "Lemonade" on other platforms, but the entire album is only streamable through Tidal.Photo by Josh Miller/CNET In 2013, when Beyonce unceremoniously released her self-titled album by surprise on iTunes with music videos for every song, no one knew what to expect from her next. Little did we know "Lemonade" was on the way. The critically acclaimed, genre-bending visual-album chock-full of personal and political commentary, made its debut on HBO and immediately after was made available to stream exclusively via Tidal, the streaming service she co-owns with her husband Jay Z, and Kanye West. Within a few days fans could buy the album via iTunes, but if streaming was preferred, Tidal was -- and still is -- the only place to stream "Lemonade."

The departures from the 2016 MacBook Pro — MagSafe charger, USB and memory card slots, and a keyboard with more than 0.55mm of travel — are all things the iPad lacks. The improvements to the same machine — thinner, lighter, all-metal chassis, a display with wider color gamut, and a sliver of a touchscreen called the Touch Bar — are all things the iPad has. If it’s not perfectly obvious, Apple’s efforts with its new Macs are to wean its old users off their desktop and laptop habits and familiarize them with the new world of touchscreen PCs. What that means for macOS is that it’s fast turning into legacy software: an afterthought on its way to becoming abandonware. This may all sound very dramatic, but yesterday’s report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, someone with impeccable connections within Apple’s ranks, agrees with my assessment: In another sign that the company has prioritized the iPhone, Apple re-organized its software engineering department so there's no longer a dedicated Mac operating system team. There is now just one team, and most of the engineers are iOS first, giving the people working on the iPhone and iPad more power. The internal rearrangement of priorities for Apple is very much evident in the changes the company has made in recent years. Final Cut Pro X was a simplification of Apple’s video-editing software that drove many pros away. The professionally inclined Aperture photo editor app has also been replaced by the more universal and simplified Photos. Siri made its way from iOS to macOS, and has been followed by Touch ID and a catalog of touch controls in the Touch Bar. The only other big user-facing alteration to macOS in recent times has been Apple’s Continuity, which is designed specifically to make Macs better at communicating and collaborating with iOS devices. Continuity is like the Mac’s W1 wireless chip for headphones: a spoke connecting the peripheral device to the iOS-based hub. Apple’s new features are "trickling up" from mobile to the desktop It might be arguable that Apple is melding its two operating systems into one, but the weight of evidence is heavily on the side of the company making iOS as good as it can be, and then dragging macOS along for the ride. Everything happening with macOS and the computers running it seems to be a retrofitting or adaptation of Apple’s leading-edge stuff on iPhones and iPads. We’ve long ago passed the point of "trickling down" desktop features to the mobile realm — Apple has been "mobile first" for much longer than competitors like Microsoft have been touting that slogan. Broader industry trends would appear to support Apple’s (unspoken) decision to treat Macs as its second-class citizens. The truth is that Intel-powered x86 computers — like the MacBook Pro, Mac Mini, and iMac — are hitting a performance and efficiency ceiling, whereas ARM chips like Apple’s A series keep going from strength to strength. Investors want to see growing sales, and to secure those, Apple needs to show consumers constant and meaningful improvements in its products. Thinking along similar lines, Microsoft recently announced it’s developing the means to make Windows applications run on ARM processors, and everyone else in the traditional PC industry is also working on blurring the line between tablet and laptop. The curious thing with Apple is how settled the strategy appears to already be. Even while the Bloomberg revelations seem to paint a rare picture of disorder within Apple, there’s no indication that the company’s vision is sundered. Scything off essential ports from the MacBook Pro, as Apple just did, is the expression of a deliberate choice from the company to move aggressively toward a less wired and more mobile future. Apple may be aggravating many of its established users today, but it sees a bigger market and greater opportunities by pursuing the path it has chosen. Macs are still a $22 billion business, but Apple is prioritizing the more lucrative iOS One of the things that can sometimes go neglected when discussing the Mac, which is after all the product line that first made Apple famous, is how small it has become on the company’s balance sheet. In 2016, Macs accounted for 10.5 percent of Apple’s net sales and were eclipsed by the company’s Services division, which includes things like the iTunes Store, Apple Pay, and Apple Music. The iPhone, by comparison, brought in six times as much in net sales. Macs are still a very meaningful $22 billion business, but Apple clearly has more lucrative opportunities that it has chosen to prioritize. macOS is, of course, not going to disappear anytime soon. Many people rely on it for their jobs — iOS app developers among them — and there’s a passionate user base that will extend its life far beyond the amount of time it takes Apple to transition all its eggs into the iOS basket. But make no mistake about it, that move is already underway. iOS is the center of Apple’s universe, and everything that is to come from the Cupertino company will be in service to its most profitable platform.

 Apple is focusing more on emerging markets BI Intelligence Dec. 21, 2016, 9:43 AM 876 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence This story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Apple is in talks with the Indian government to manufacture the iPhone and other products in the country, according to statements from two government officials obtained by the Wall Street Journal. This is likely part of a larger effort by the company to catalyze iPhone sales in India, a market that surpassed the US as the No. 2 smartphone market after global leader China. This is the second piece of news in the past week highlighting Apple’s ambitions to have a larger footprint in emerging markets. Apple is also making a significant $44 million investment in a research and development center in Indonesia over the next three years as part of a larger effort to get iPhones cleared for sale in the country by its government. This strategy is likely partly driven by the fact that Apple’s growth in developed markets has flatlined. Apple reported declining iPhone sales year-over-year (YoY) in the US and Greater China during Q3 2016, which drove overall iPhone sales to decline 5%. However, iPhone sales saw YoY growth in Latin America, India, and South Asia during Q3. Apple CEO Tim Cook swore a return to growth in 2017, and may be focusing on that latter set of markets to do so. But although there’s plenty of potential to capture new audiences in emerging markets, Apple’s unlikely to succeed there due to sky-high price points that don’t align with cost-conscious consumers who make up the large majority of the population in these regions. About 80% of smartphones sold in India cost less than $150, according to Bloomberg, and half cost less than $120. Comparatively, the average selling price (ASP) of an iPhone in Q3 was $618. Even Apple’s lowest cost phones are too expensive for most consumers in markets like India and Indonesia. Apple may be attempting to establish a presence and build name recognition in these markets early, before the middle class sees a surge in growth. A similar shift is what enabled Apple to succeed in China, which has added over 43 million citizens to the middle class from 2000 to 2015 to total 109 million. India had about 23 million adults in its middle class in 2015, out of a total population of 1.25 billion. The global smartphone market is expected to slow considerably over the next few years. Despite a record-setting holiday quarter, 2015 was likely the last year of double-digit growth for smartphone shipments. Mature markets were at the heart of this year’s deceleration. Adoption has reached new highs in key markets in the United States, Europe, and China. The pool of first-time buyers in these countries is shrinking rapidly, and sales are now primarily coming from phone upgrades. Meanwhile, emerging markets will continue to see robust shipment growth. India and Indonesia, in particular, will help fuel a large share of the shipments growth within the global smartphone market over the next few years. BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on smartphones by country that forecasts the market through 2021 to reflect slower, stabilizing growth in the long term. Here are some key points from the report: The global smartphone market is still growing at a steady pace due to more widespread adoption in emerging markets. We estimate the global market will hit about 2.1 billion units shipped in 2021. Shipments growth over the past few years has been driven by the falling price of smartphones, which has made handsets more accessible in emerging markets. The average selling price of a smartphone in India nearly halved between 2010 and 2015. With relatively low smartphone penetration, we forecast Indian smartphone shipments to grow rapidly over the next five years. Nevertheless, India has a long way to go before it surpasses China as the world’s leading market for smart handsets. India is estimated to account for roughly 10% of the global smartphone market in 2016, considerably less than China’s 30% share. The global platform wars are over, even as smartphone adoption continues to rise across various markets worldwide. Android and iOS are estimated to account for 97.3% of global platform market share in 2015, compared to 96.3% last year. Apple closed the year with another strong quarter on the back of its iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus launches. Still, the vendor saw a slight decline in YoY growth of its share of the market in the face of stiff competition from Samsung and Chinese vendors such as Huawei.

Meet The Publisher Meet The Team Subscribe Advertise Contact Us Home Mobile Gadgets Trending Business Women & Tech Contests Gift Guide: Fitness wearables and trackers By: Gadjo Sevilla December 21, 2016 By Gadjo Cardenas Sevilla We’re currently spoiled for choice when it comes to the range and capabilities of wearables and specially fitness trackers. Go to any consumer electronics store and you’ll see everything from lowly pedometers to wearable bracelets, fitness trackers with GPS and heart rate monitors and even complex smart watches that do a little bit of everything. What makes fitness trackers excellent gift giving ideas? Many of us tend to take our health and weight a bit more seriously towards the end of the year. With all the holiday feasting and libations that come with the festivities, fitness and exercise are usually easily forgotten. A good fitness tracker can motivate you, remind you to keep moving, track steps, measure exercises, note down your heart rate to find out if you’re performing at peak and even helps measure sleep, food and water intake. Here are some notable devices. Fitbit Charge 2 The leading fitness wearable company has a range of devices that cover every particular type of user. Their Charge 2 tracker is one of the most complete solutions in the market today. This understated and rather elegant bracelet has 5-day battery life, offers 24/7 fitness and sleep tracking, can be tuned to various exercise types and has a built-in heart rate monitor. It also pairs with your smartphone for message and call notifications (nothing too crazy). Fitbit’s app and web software is simply outstanding and best of all, you don’t even need a smartphone to make it work since you can synch it with your PC. Apple Watch Series 2 For their second version, Apple has  given the  Apple Watch 2 devices a faster dual-core processor. It has added onboard GPS to appease serious runners who don’t want an iPhone weighing them down. It has added water resistance and even incorporates some very advanced swimming exercise tracking technology which can measure various strokes. A Nike + variant is also available and caters to the sporty set. For those who don’t intend on getting their Apple Watch wet or who don’t need GPS capability, the Apple Watch Series 1, which is nearly identical is a good way to go for around $100 less. Best feature of all Apple Watch models is the ease of changing bands and faces to make the watch suit various conditions. Tom Tom Spark 3 Cardio + The Spark 3 improves on this in every way. It is slimmer, less obvious and maintains the features user’s love the most, namely the clear display, great GPS performance and outstanding battery life of up to 5 days on a single charge. Throw in the waterproofing (a solid 40m/ 130 feet or 5 ATM) plus the ability to track a range of exercises ( incident treadmill, running, indoor cycling, cycling, swimming, freestyle and gym) and you have one of the most comprehensive and accurate fitness trackers in the market, bar none. I like that Tom Tom has included a pair of comfortable Bluetooth headphones (not ware resistant) which pair nicely and save you the trouble of finding good sport headphones. The Tom Tom Spark 3 Cardio + has 3GB of onboard storage and a music player which makes it possible to store around 500 songs or other types of audio content such as podcasts, audiobooks or whatever helps you exercise, meditate or relax. FitBit Blaze  At the very top of Fitbit’s product line is the Fitbit Blaze which takes the look, feel and functionality of a smartwatch in a device with a large colour display and a variety of accessory bands that can be quickly switched as needed. Fitbit’s system really needs no introduction. The trackers are one part of the equation and the rest of the experience takes place on their apps as well as the web-based software. Overall design is slick, understated and well balanced and people generally gravitate towards it in public and want to know what kind of smart watch it is. Some caveats, the Fitbit Blaze is splash proof but you shouldn’t bathe with it. Also the Fitbit Blaze has a screen size of 31.75mm diagonally, with a display area of 25.38×19.04mm. The display offers 16-bit colour at a resolution of 240×180 pixels. The screen is scratch resistant and is made of Corning Gorilla Glass 3. It looks clear and bright under most but the brightest lighting conditions.

state aid cases, says expert A Spanish tax break that was only available to Spanish companies acquiring foreign companies constituted a 'selective' tax advantage in breach of EU state aid rules, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) said in two cases, overturning previous decisions of the EU General Court. 21 Dec 2016 State aid EU & Competition Tax Corporate tax Tax Disputes and Investigations International tax UK Germany France Caroline Ramsay, a competition law expert at Pinsent Masons, the law firm behind Out-law.com, said: “These decisions will come as a real disappointment to the other tax ruling appellants such as Apple, Starbucks and Fiat, as the point on selectivity of the individual tax rulings in questions is a key issue to be considered in the appeals.” Over the last few years the Commission has decided that tax rulings given by Ireland to Apple, Netherlands to Starbucks and Luxembourg to Fiat Finance and Trade constitute selective advantages and therefore unlawful state aid. Ireland is arguing that the Commission exceeded its powers in an appeal before the EU's General Court seeking to overturn a ruling that it must recover up to €13 billion in unpaid taxes from Apple. Ireland and Apple published their legal arguments this week as the Commission published its full decision in the Apple case. The decisions in relation to the rulings given to Starbucks and Fiat are also being appealed. The Commission is also in the process of investigating rulings given by Luxembourg to Amazon and McDonald's. This week's decisions by the CJEU concern a Spanish tax provision which gave a Spanish company acquiring a shareholding of at least 5% in a non-Spanish company a tax deduction for amortisation of goodwill. No such tax relief was available for a Spanish company acquiring a shareholding in another Spanish company. In 2009 and 2011, the Commission decided that the tax relief constituted state aid, which was contrary to EU law and directed Spain to recover the benefit of the aid. In 2014 World Duty Free Group (formerly Autogrill España), Banco Santander and Santusa Holding succeeded in getting the General Court of the EU to annul the decisions on the basis that the Commission had not established the selectivity of the Spanish scheme. The CJEU has now overturned the decisions of the General Court on the basis that the General Court erred in law in finding that selectivity had not been established. The CJEU said that a tax measure was selective if it favoured some businesses over other businesses in a comparable factual and legal situation. It said that this was the case even if the measure was in principle open to all companies. The CJEU said the tax benefits of the Spanish regime were selective because the relief was only available to Spanish companies acquiring a shareholding in a foreign company and not to Spanish companies acquiring a shareholding in a Spanish company. The court said that the fact that the conditions that a company needed to fulfil were not strict, and the benefits were therefore available to many companies, did not call into question the selective nature of the measure, but only its degree of selectivity. The CJEU said in its judgment "according to the Court’s settled case-law, the fact that the number of undertakings able to claim entitlement under a national measure is very large, or that those undertakings belong to various economic sectors, is not sufficient to call into question the selective nature of that measure and, therefore, to rule out its classification as state aid". The decision followed an opinion in August from advocate general Melchior Wathelet that the tax break was selective and that the General Court's decision should be overturned. The Commission welcomed the decision. It said: "The judgment is important because it confirms that a measure may be selective, if it benefits only those companies that carry out certain transactions".

Credit: Apple More like this How Apple will make you really, really want an Apple TV Tim Cook wants Apple to make your life better with AR Apple products will be rented like Apple Music, analyst claims Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell I don’t really think 2016 was a particularly great year for anybody. Why would any year that starts with the losses of Lemmy and David Bowie be anything other than awful? Apple felt it too, and it will take even more corporate courage for the company as it moves into another year of transition in 2017. Here are a few predictions for the year ahead: At the mothership Apple’s new spaceship-shaped campus is expected to open for business next year with around 12,000 employees moving to the new office. The campus hosts its own state-of-the-art auditorium, so it is reasonable to imagine the company will host some special events there, potentially including WWDC. Will this take place there next year? I think not, but think it may make a great location for the launch of the next iPhone. What’s on the box? Most movies are already filmed (but not released) in 4K. Most console games support it and televisions with 4K support are becoming cheaper. We don’t yet have a huge selection of available 4K content, but it seems inevitable. Apple is in the position to kick start this with iTunes, UHD movie rentals (big broadband only) and 4K support in Apple TV. Will this happen in 2017? Will Apple TV become a hub for next-generation AR and VR experiences? AirPods for everyone Used with an iPhone as the brain, an Apple Watch, and (perhaps in future) wearable touch displays or some form of eyeglass, AirPods will emerge as an important component to the post-iPhone augmented human age. The only problem with such a tech Nirvana is broadband access. Apple still needs to tell us what these connected devices can achieve when used without Internet access. Et tu, Siri? Apple Watch gets independence The Apple Watch needs to be a connected product to truly shine. It needs its own SIM. Once it has that you can predict a range of new medical sensors and services, and FaceTime camera. We may even see a round Apple Watch take a bow. iPhone transformed It seems incredible that the iPhone is only ten years old. The device transformed the mobile phone industry and set a template for smartphone design that no one in the industry has ever bettered. Apple set the bar, consumers know this, and this is why iPhones remain the best-selling devices despite imitative competitors. In 2017, Apple will use a range of proprietary technologies to set an even higher bar its competitors will find hard to emulate. A new design, incredible processor and graphics speed, completely wireless, a curved screen, and more. Expect three models, including a premium version with an OLED display and an A10-powered iPhone SE 2 for 4-inch phone fans. Tablet times iPads will all go Pro. I am hoping for an iPad Pro Mini, which I think would be popular, However, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo thinks the company will offer 9.7-inch, 12.9-inch and10.5-inch iPad Pros, with the smallest model being a lower powered version. I hate that idea, by the way, as it adds an unnecessary level of complexity for no compelling reason that I can see. Back to the Mac? Will Apple ever go back to the Mac? Where you stand on this is interesting – will Apple CEO, Tim Cook’s promise of “great” new Macs in 2017 trump Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman and his claims of trouble at the Mac mill? Apple must ask itself if it really wants to squander the loyalty of Mac users, or if it wants to win them back. There’s absolutely no doubt the company needs to refresh its desktops, there is little doubt that it will introduce its MacBook Pro Touch Bar across other products, and it seems likely we’ll see Touch ID deployed in future Macs, along with a Force Touch Keypad. USB-C will be in place across the range. We will see new iMacs, but will we see a Mac Pro? I think it’s arguable at this point – but I do believe Cook when he promises great new Macs. Though I am concerned if Apple’s senior management has succumbed to the kind of political in-fighting which cost the company so dear in the pre-Jobs, post-Jobs era when the company slowly lost its way. AR, VR and AI In future combining these three things will make more sense. 2017 may see Apple deploy machine intelligence based health solutions, and may also see it reveal some of the AR solutions it has been working on in its lab. If the company intends announcing AR products there is a possibility we may see them discussed at WWDC as the company seeks to motivate developers. Alternatively, the company may want to work with key developers in secret to develop new platforms with a view to making announcements later in the year. An Apple VR for Xmas 2017 doesn’t feel impossible. Services Apple Pay, iTunes, Apple Music and more. Apple will extend some services to new platforms in 2017 and is likely to build them out more. Apple Pay will gain more features, such as person-to-person and bill payments. There has been speculation  the company will migrate to a subscription model for all its products and services, meaning you’ll be able to own the best Mac and iPhones and access your choice of Apple services for a monthly fee. That’s not such a bad idea as it means the company will become less dependent on the erratic fiscal flow of its current product driven business model. Apple Music should gain high-res audio.  Apple Car We’re going to hear even more rumors about Apple’s work in automobiles, but I imagine that’s one Christmas we won’t be seeing in 2017. Operating systems Underpinning all of these things are Apple’s four operating systems, macOS, tvOS, iOS and watchOS. Expect more machine intelligence to bring all these elements together. Will we see carOS appear on the list? What are you expecting? Let us know on Twitter. Google+?

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Files a Major Antitrust Case against Acacia Research Corporation Pointing to a Conspiracy with Nokia Corporation | Main | The Congressional Encryption Working Group Hands Apple a Victory in their Year-End Report Just Published » December 21, 2016 Mossberg's Review of the Top Tech Dogs of 2016 Finds that Apple's products weren't up to their Historical Standards   Walt Mossberg today looks back at 2016 and provides a quick look at what the top dogs of tech and in this report we cover what Walt said about Apple. Mossberg notes in his report that although "Apple is primarily a hardware company, in January I urged it to focus on improving its core software: the Apple-made Mail, Calendar, Music, Photos, and other apps on its devices. And in fact the company did some of this. Examples include a new user interface for Apple Music, easier app access on the Apple Watch, lots of new features in iMessage and improvements in Apple Maps, and in the default keyboard's predictive typing. And Apple's commitment to privacy and security remains steadfast and admirable.   But the all-important Mail app, on both iOS and macOS, is still poor at handling the overwhelmingly popular Gmail service and the iOS calendar is still clumsy; iTunes and Photos still need work.   Most importantly, and unforeseen by me back then, Apple managed to disappoint in 2016 with a series of hardware products that, while very good, weren't up to the company's high historical standards, in my view.   In most cases, I attribute this to an overemphasis on design at the expense of function. This isn't solely an Apple problem, but it's most clearly evident there.   The iPhone 7, while boasting better specs, axed the long-standing, perfectly fine headphone jack, making a dongle necessary to charge the phone while using earbuds. The MacBook Pro was made thinner and lighter, and given a narrow function screen atop the keyboard called the Touch Bar. But, in the process, it became a tweener with less battery life. And the new, wireless AirPod earbuds, while impressive in many ways, can't adjust the volume or skip a track without either interrupting the music to ask Siri to do it or fumbling for your phone or Apple Watch. That's a step backwards from the silent, manipulable control module on familiar old EarPods."   To rub it into Apple's face, Mossberg noted in his coverage of Microsoft that "the company's relatively small Surface hardware group scored a coup by enchanting designers, video editors, and other creatives with a gorgeous all-in-one desktop just as Apple was disappointing some of them with the new MacBook Pro."    Ouch. Yesterday Mark Gurman hit Apple with a report that pointed to that same 'disappointment' of the MacBook Pro in contrast to Microsoft's Surface computers offering "Apple-esque quality." The tech press overall saw Microsoft's Surface Studio as a knockout blow to Apple this fall and see Microsoft's hunger at taking the fight to Apple all the way back to the top.   To read Mossberg's take on other tech giants such as Google, Facebook and Amazon, click here.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

U.S. wearables market is doing much worse than expected Posted Dec 21, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Enterprise social comes roaring back Apple may still be claiming that sales of its Apple Watch are “doing great,” but overall, the wearable device category is failing to grow at the rates forecasted earlier. According to a new report from eMarketer, wearables like Apple Watch and Fitbit were expected to grow more than 60 percent year-over-year from 2015 to 2016. However, the firm is now cutting that estimate down to just 25 percent growth this year. “Smartwatches in particular,” the report said, “have failed to impress customers.” Unlike other device categories, wearable devices have struggled to gain traction beyond early adopters. And with smartwatches, consumers struggle to find a reason to buy. eMarketer analyst Nicole Perrin pointed out that before Apple Watch arrived on the scene, fitness trackers dominated the space. Today, fitness and health tracking remain one of the key selling points for the new crop of wearable devices, Apple Watch included. But Apple hasn’t convinced everyone that a smartwatch is something they need, especially given the higher prices compared with standard fitness trackers for the watch’s enhanced functionality. “Without a clear use case for smart watches—which have more features than fitness trackers, but significant overlap with smartphone functionality—the more sophisticated, expensive devices have not caught on as quickly as expected,” said Perrin in the report. The firm estimates that 39.5 million U.S. adults will use a wearable device with internet connectivity at least once per month. However, this is much less than the 63.7 million eMarketer predicted back in October 2015. Use of wearable devices will only reach 15.8 percent of the population, and is only expected to grow to 21.1 percent by 2020. eMarketer isn’t the only firm noting the troubles in the wearable market. This month, IDC reported smartwatch numbers were on the decline, with Apple dropping to fourth place after a 71 percent year-over-year decline in total shipments. Fitbit instead won the category with 23 percent of the market and 5.3 million units shipped in the quarter. But even Fitbit could be struggling. New reports indicate that Fitbit’s Charge 2 may not be selling as quickly as expected, based on channel checks that found its inventory to be “particularly bloated,” along with weak demand for its Flex 2. In addition, IDC had said this past October that smartwatch sales were tanking, with total shipments down 51.6 percent from the same time last year. Apple had responded to IDC’s latest report not with hard numbers, but by touting the Apple Watch’s success as compared with its own prior sales. Apple CEO Tim Cook said that Apple Watch sales hit a record during the first week of holiday shopping, and that the current quarter is on track to be the best yet. It’s not surprising that the Apple Watch sold better than before during the 2016 holidays – after all, this is the time of the year where people tend to increase their spending. Plus, Apple released a new version of its smartwatch ahead of the holiday season which likely contributed to the bump. But that bump may not save the wearable category as a whole. eMarketer’s new report also noted that younger people are more interested in wearables, as around 30 percent of those 18 through 34 will be wearable users in 2017 – a figure that’s 17.6 percent higher than the overall population. Wearable early adopters also skewed male, until the shift toward fitness trackers, the report also found. By 2018, more wearable users will be female, it’s now forecasting. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Panasonic Founded 1918 Overview Panasonic Japan manufactures and sells various electronic and electric products under the Panasonic brand name worldwide.

Image: Piotr Adamowicz/Shutterstock In a move that could have ramifications for Apple and the Irish Government’s €13bn tax case, the European Court of Justice has found in favour of the European Commission in a case over illegal state aid involving Spain’s government. Today, the European Court of Justice found in favour of the European Commission (EC) in a case involving tax concessions for a number of companies, including Santander Bank, Sandusa and Autogrill. Earlier this week, the Irish Government, through the Department of Finance, formally objected to the EC’s decision in August to land Apple with a €13bn bill for unpaid taxes. The full ruling of the EC said Ireland’s actions were tantamount to illegal state aid. Apple is expected to issue its formal appeal against the ruling this week. Europe has little patience for illegal state aid In the Spanish case, the EC investigated complaints by a number of Spanish MEPs who argued that their government favoured companies that had a 5pc shareholding in a foreign company. The EC decided that this represented illegal state aid and ordered the companies to repay the tax to the Spanish government. However, while the decision may signal a frosty reception when the case eventually makes it to court in the coming years, the specifics are very different. “It is a complete overstatement to say that the Irish appeal of the Apple decision is dependent on the outcome of the Santander and Autogrill decision of the European Court [of] Justice, or that today’s judgement is crucial for the Irish case,” a spokesman was quoted as saying in The Irish Times. “The facts and the approach in the Santander and Autogrill cases are very different from those that have now been presented in the final decision in the Apple case,” the spokesman added.

report this ad / Cory Doctorow / 7:40 am Wed Dec 21, 2016 Companies' self-devouring buyback spree is finally slowing down From the Boing Boing Shop See all deals Popular Posts Follow Us Twitter / Facebook / RSS Stock buybacks are the preferred form of financial engineering in corporate America, through which companies borrow like crazy and give the money to their shareholders, artificially increasing their earnings-per-share ratio, massively reducing real economic growth, while enriching a tiny number of already-wealthy investors: but buybacks may finally be coming to an end. report this ad Buybacks have accounted for $3 trillion over the past 5 years, but in Q2 2016, buybacks fell for the first time since the buyback boom started; the next quarter, buybacks fell off 28% year on year, the first major setback in half a decade. Apple leads the pack in buybacks, and leads the practice of borrowing money to effect this spending. Apple has avoided taxes by claiming that it literally has no tax jurisdiction, a unique and uniquely outrageous claim that has got it into legal hot water -- so it has to borrow money against the funds it can't bring into the USA without paying its fair share of taxes. This strategy appears to have paid off, because now Donald Trump is promising to give Apple and other tax avoiders a massive tax break to bring their money back to the US -- a break that American businesses that followed the law will not get. Buybacks have driven the stock-market bubble for five years. As they slow down, it's not clear what will happen next -- maybe Trump will undo the Dodd-Frank Act and allow banks to go on another money-printing/bad-debt spree like the one that caused the 2008 crisis, producing a short term bubble to replace buybacks. This is a nasty wrinkle in the buyback scenario. But there’s hope. Trump has pledged to change the corporate tax code, and/or give corporations a tax holiday on this “overseas” cash so that they can “repatriate” it, by selling their US Treasurys and other investments and using the proceeds to buy back their own shares. That’s what happened last time the government granted this kind of tax holiday in 2004. And everyone is hoping that it will happen again. I suspect that’s one of the reasons for the surge in stock prices since the election. If not, and if this major stock-buying force continues to wheeze like this, our eternally wondrous stock market might be in serious trouble. What the Heck’s Happening to Our Share Buyback Boom?

Apple decided to offer the discount on adapters after it launched the new MacBook Pro in October. The company has now decided to extend its discount on adapters for several months. The new MacBook Pro is different from its predecessor in more ways than one. It features a multi-touch display in place of the function key row but that’s not something which will irk users, the fact that it only comes with USB-C ports will. USB-C is undoubtedly the next-generation standard of USB and it’s going to be on almost every device within a few years but it’s not that common right now. Even iPhone owners can’t connect their smartphones to their new MacBook Pros right now without buying an adapter first. The built-in Lightning to USB-A cable doesn’t work with the new notebooks. Hence you can see the reason why Apple decided to discount the adapters in the first place. Apple said that the discounts were being offered to make the transition easier for its customers and also accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem. It has now decided to extend this discount until March 31st, 2017. You can purchase the discounted adapters from Apple’s online store as well as through its retail stores. Filed in Apple.

Ben Lovejoy - 2 weeks ago @benlovejoy Opinion Lightning USB-C iPhone 8 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit When Apple launched the iPhone 5 with a new-fangled Lightning port – instead of the 30-pin dock connector that had been a standard feature on every previous generation of iPhone, as well as on iPods since 2003 – there was a great deal of outrage. ‘What about all the docks and speaker systems we own that have 30-pin connectors?’ was the question many asked. The decision was described as arrogant and unreasonable. Apple was accused of profiteering, by forcing everyone to buy new cables, docks and speakers. Apple responded in three ways. It pointed to the undeniable technical superiority of the new port. It explained the difficulty of making ever slimmer devices with a port designed for much thicker ones. And it assured everyone that this would be the last change for a long time – that the Lightning port would be around for many years to come … Fast-forward four years, and the company faced very similar controversy over its decision to first drop the headphone socket from the iPhone 7, and then to drop all other legacy ports from the new MacBook Pro models in favor of USB-C. (That fuss started with the 12-inch MacBook, but it was the pro market which has been most vocal – and they viewed the first-gen MacBook as merely an executive toy.) A year or two from now, I think the company may be about to provoke similar howls of protest: in my view, there’s a very strong possibility that either the 2017 or 2018 iPhones and iPads will abandon the Lightning socket in favour of USB-C. There are, of course, three objections to this idea. The first – that it would represent a second change in port for iPhones, with all the controversy that would imply – can, I think, be dismissed. Apple has a long track-record at being willing to weather short-term criticism for a move which makes longer-term sense. Abandoning first the floppy drive and later the optical one. Switching from FireWire to Thunderbolt. Dropping the headphone socket in the iPhone 7 and, not long afterwards, USB 3.0 ports and more from the MacBook Pro. Plus, of course, the previous port change in the iPhone itself. Apple does not lack courage when it comes to announcing that it has made the decision to move on to newer and better tech. The second is the physical dimensions of the two sockets. A large part of the reason for the switch to Lightning was the extremely compact dimensions of the socket, facilitating far slimmer devices. USB-C is notably wider than Lightning – something unlikely to prove an issue – but it is also very slightly fatter. For a company as obsessed with slim devices as Apple, that could prove a barrier. But if you put a Lightning and USB-C connector side-by-side, as I’ve just done, there is vanishingly little in it. Given the depth needed for multi-layer screens, circuitry and – especially – battery, I can’t see that tiny sliver of a difference being of any practical consequence. The third objection is that Apple currently makes a chunk of income from licensing the Lightning standard to third-party companies for its MFi program. Switching from a proprietary standard to a universal one would mean sacrificing those licensing fees. Apple doesn’t disclose the revenue from those fees – it’s all buried somewhere within the ‘Other’ category. I’m sure the total annual sum isn’t trivial, but I’m also sure it isn’t a massive sum by Apple standards. Not enough to drive a decision of this importance. What, then, would be the upside? The Lightning port is an extremely clever standard, able to perform multiple roles in an intelligently-reversible format, the physical pins being dynamically reassigned as needed. But USB-C is an even more capable standard. It offers all the advantages of Lightning – support for multiple protocols, intelligence, reversibility – but with support for more standards. When Intel announced that it would be integrating Thunderbolt 3 into the USB-C standard, it described the new version of the latest USB standard as ‘one port to do it all.’ Unlike many such statements, which are more hype than reality, this description is perfectly reasonable. USB-C supports USB 3.1, Thunderbolt 3, DisplayPort, MHL and superMHL, HDMI, DVI-D, VGA and even component video. Oh, and bi-directional power – allowing an external device to be powered or supply power – of up to 100 watts. USB-C can also exercise a whole bunch of its capabilities simultaneously. For example, a single-cable connection between a 2016 MacBook Pro and a compatible monitor – like LG’s 5K UltraFine – can simultaneously: power the MacBook Pro deliver video to up to four 4K monitors at 60Hz in over a billion colors output audio provide high-speed two-way data comms with multiple USB devices And still have another three USB-C ports left over. It’s precisely this reason – a single port that does everything we could ever need – that led Apple to equip its latest MacBook Pro models with nothing else (bar, ironically, a headphone socket). Adopting USB-C for iOS devices also would allow Apple to standardize on just one port across all devices. That would massively simplify the cable and connector ecosystem. There would be no more talk of dongles and carrying multiple cable types – everything would be USB-C to USB-C. Not just one port to do it all, but one cable too. Additionally, the high-speed data capabilities between Macs and iOS devices – like transferring a movie in just a few seconds – would enable Apple devices to work together better than ever. So while the AirPods case cutout may or may not be a coincidence, there is in my view a compelling case for Apple to make the switch to USB-C in iPhones and iPads as well as Macs. The one remaining question is when it will do so? We’ve heard plenty of rumors about the 2017 iPhone. OLED display, curved screen, bezel-free design, wireless charging, 3D camera, all-glass backs, embedded Touch ID … and more. If Apple were planning a switch from Lightning to USB-C, we might have expected to have heard some whispers about it by now. That might suggest that Lightning will hang in there for another year. But I don’t think it will be longer than that – and I’d say there’s at least a chance that USB-C will take its place in 2017. What are your thoughts? Do you think Apple will make the switch at all?

(AMZN) Stock Is Going to $800 on Best Holiday Ever View All Posts U.S. stock futures are headed higher again this morning, meaning today may be the day the Dow Jones Industrial Average caps the magical 20,000 level. The Dow closed at a record high yesterday, with a late-arriving Santa Claus rally lifting stocks across the board. With less than two weeks until 2017, all three major indices are on track to gain roughly 10% this year. At last check, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.03%, while S&P 500 futures had added 0.36% and Nasdaq-100 futures had risen 0.49%. On the options front, volume remained light on Tuesday, with about 14.4 million calls and 11.9 million puts changing hands. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio retreated to 0.63, while the 10-day moving average held at 0.57. Turning to Tuesday’s volume leaders, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) saw a pair of reports emerge on manufacturing, speculating on a plant in India and the company’s reluctance to continue making Macs in the U.S. Meanwhile, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) surged on a pair of significant price-target increases, while Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) offered up strong second-quarter earnings. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will they stay, or will they go? A pair of reports on Apple manufacturing surfaced yesterday: one all but confirming that the company was moving forward with manufacturing in India, the other underscoring Apple’s desire to kill off U.S. manufacturing. The 7 Best Monthly Dividend Stocks for 2017 Apple’s motives in India are clear — start making iPhones and Macs as a foothold for sales in the country (and, of course, cheaper labor). As for the U.S., just because Apple wants to move away from making Macs stateside doesn’t mean it will. As the article notes, doing so would be political suicide. Combining the mix of sentiment in these reports with the fact that AAPL stock is trading near its October highs has created some headwinds for the shares. And options traders were quick to pick up on the shift. Overall, total volume came in at 628,000 contracts on Tuesday, with calls accounting for a below average 58% of the day’s take. AAPL stock has cleared peak weekly December 23 series call open interest at $115, but OI is building in the weekly December 30 series at the $116, $117 and $120 strikes — all of which are sporting more than 10,000 contracts each. If Santa Claus fails to come through for AAPL stock, these calls may be in trouble heading into expiration. Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Both Goldman Sachs and Mizuho Securities boosted their price targets on NVDA stock yesterday — Goldman adding NVDA to its “conviction buy” list with a $129 price target and Mizuho setting its sights on $115 for the shares. Nvidia has come a long way since I last zeroed in on the shares, and if you got into that NVDA January 2017 $95/$100 bull call spread, now’s the time to get out and take profits. Why? As InvestorPlace contributor Josh Enomoto notes, “It’s a whole new level of crazy.” Even speculative options traders, seeing NVDA rush toward $105 yesterday, took a moment of pause. Volume on the chip maker came in at 201,000 contracts, with only about 59% of those crossing at call contracts.

The iPhone 8 will bring over a brand new design, and a bunch of highly anticipated features — including some exciting tricks that might not be available on any other smartphone. Don't Miss: Here’s Russia’s new stealth fighter that’s better than America’s in almost every way According to multiple reports, the iPhone 8 will feature a glass design, a curved OLED screen with almost no bezels, wireless charging and a fingerprint sensor placed under the screen. These are all features that are available on existing models, and should be expected on other high-end Android handsets next year — even Samsung’s Galaxy S8 is said to feature a fingerprint sensor under the display. But Apple’s wireless charging technology might be better than anything currently available in stores. And a new report seems to bring even more evidence that Apple is indeed working on a game-changing wireless charging iPhone for next year. All current devices that can recharge wirelessly need to be in close contact with a charging mat. Even Apple’s Watch is magnetically coupled with the wireless charger for the procedure to work. But, as we first discussed all the way back in February, the iPhone 8 may recharge from across the room, thanks to technology from Energous. Long-distance wireless charging would let users charge their iPhones while using them. Advanced software features could even let people customize charging patterns and schedule charging times. Neither Apple nor Energous has announced anything at this point, but people observing these companies have started connecting the dots. Market analyst Louis Basenese revealed a potential new connection between Apple and Energous in a note seen by Apple Insider. Long-time Apple exec Billy Manning, who served as Apple’s Regulatory Certification Program Manager for seven years, is now the Director of Regulatory Operations at Energous. Manning was responsible for obtaining regulatory certification for various Apple products, including iPhone, iPad, and iPod. His move to Energous is meant to help the company get its own regulatory certification for future products. That’s not the only link between Energous and Apple. A few days ago, Dialog announced a deal with Energous. Dialog will invest $10 million in Energous to become one of the company’s main suppliers. In return, Energous will get access to Dialog’s sales and distribution channels. Apple orders, meanwhile, account for 70% of Dialog’s business. Energous also inked deals with iPhone makers Foxconn and Pegatron to integrate wireless charging into future product designs. Finally, Energous said that it expects to see its wireless charger transmitter appear in consumer products in the third or early fourth quarter of 2017. As we all know, that’s when Apple launches new iPhones.

Follow TechnoBuffalo I was sitting on my couch last night flipping through Apple’s new “Apple TV” app, which I’ve already called a “smoking hot pile of garbage,” when I realized that I think Apple is really lost right now. I’ve been following Apple pretty closely since I started blogging in 2007, and, now more than ever, I’m confused with Apple’s each and every step. Yesterday, Bloomberg said that Apple’s Mac division is shambles as it shifts its focus on iOS and the iPhone. Apple CEO Tim Cook seemed to get ahead of the news, penning a letter to employees promising that the company has great new Mac desktop computers coming down the pipeline. As I was again recognizing how crappy the Apple TV app is, I thought back to that news and it hit me – I think Apple is lost. There are a few other signs that point to its confusion. Mac family loaded with cobwebs First, let’s address the Mac family. Apple hasn’t upgraded its Mac Pro in more than 1,098 days, according to MacRumors, which lists it as a “don’t buy” in its buyer’s guide. Similarly, the site says the iMac hasn’t been updated in more than 400 days, again a “don’t buy.” Either Apple thinks it’s going to turn the desktop computer market on its head, it’s really finished altogether, or it’s just approaching it in a much more lackadaisical manner. Maybe Apple knows Macs aren’t in as high a demand as they once were, given that consumers put a premium on portability, but there’s still a large audience of pros who prefer desktop-class processors and graphics capabilities. Microsoft is moving full steam ahead with its new Surface Studio, and Windows 10 PCs are becoming more appealing by the day. Will Apple sit by and let Microsoft eat its lunch? iPhone 7 was a yawn Speaking of advancements, Apple didn’t do much in the way of those with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus this year. Yes, the phones are water-resistant, offer better cameras and faster processors, but it’s the first time Apple has kept the same design for three years in a row. What’s going on? The iPhone 8 is apparently going to be a big leap forward with AMOLED Quad HD displays and more, but those have been available for several years now. Why didn’t Apple move quicker? Was it unsure of where to take the iPhone 7 design, and so stuck with a more conservative approach? What’s its VR/AR play? Speaking of Quad HD displays, what’s Apple’s VR/AR approach? Quad HD on a smartphone is, largely, only important if you’re planning to use a VR headset where the pixel density improves the VR experience. Apple hasn’t said much at all about VR, while Google, Samsung, LG and others are pushing forward. It may be working on perfecting that, though CEO Tim Cook has said he thinks AR will be bigger than VR. That’s fine, I don’t think anyone really knows which will be bigger yet, but what’s Apple’s plan in that space, then? Again, Microsoft is moving forward here while Apple sits watching. Nothing to watch on TV I hope you like login screens. And speaking of sitting and watching, that’s exactly what Apple is doing with the streaming TV market, too. It’s allegedly hitting roadblocks in trying to pull in TV networks to support its service while others, like AT&T’s DirecTV Now, Sling TV and even Sony’s PS Vue have all launched. Instead of making an attempt, Apple launched a really terrible “Apple TV” application that tries to sort of stitch some services together to make it easier for users to find content. Except it doesn’t support enough cable networks, lacks Amazon and Netflix content, and isn’t very intuitive. Is this really the best Apple could come up with? Home Alone Apple’s play in the smart home space is still just beginning and, I admit, Apple Home is a pretty good app for managing HomeKit devices. If you have an Apple TV or a dedicated iPad that sits at home, you can also access your home controls remotely. Apple still hasn’t entered into the smart home AI market yet, a market that Amazon has proven is worth entering. Indeed, the Amazon Echo is a fantastic device and Apple could compete in the same fashion with a Siri-powered gadget. Google knows there’s demand in the space, and Google Home is already off to a great start. Apple has Siri on the iPhone, Siri on the Apple Watch and Siri on the TV. This might be ideal if the same commands worked across all of those versions of Siri, but they don’t. Instead, we’re left with a sort of bizarre Siri experience. I’ll give Apple time in this space to improve, but I’m curious why it hasn’t put a higher priority on tackling the Amazon Echo and Google Home. Switch gears Let’ talk about Apple’s car project. Originally dubbed “Project Titan,” this, too, is apparently in shambles. Apple has reportedly ditched the idea of building a car altogether and may instead focus on technology that can be used in autonomous cars, leaving manufacturing up to automaker partners. One has to wonder how advanced Apple really is here, though. As I’ve said, I praise Google for at least discussing its project in public, which is important if we’re to trust the cars we’ll eventually trust to shuffle us around. Other firms like Volvo and Uber, are also testing in public. I’m not saying that Apple’s privacy suggests it’s lost, but I am suggesting that there’s no proof it actually knows what it’s doing and, indeed, with reports of layoffs and other changes, it seems things aren’t going very smoothly. Is Apple first, or really the last? There’s this weird conflict that presents itself when discussing Apple. The company likes to suggest that it’s the first to do a lot of things – ditch the floppy drive, remove the CD-ROM, bail on SD cards and USB, but, more recently, it’s lagging on the important stuff. In the past, I’ve argued Apple does this because it wants to perfect the technology. After all, it worked when Apple launched the iPhone, completely sending the smartphone market into chaos. It replicated that with the iPad, too. It was also incredibly successful with the app store and mobile payments. Just to make sure I address wearables: the Apple Watch Series 2 is good, but the wearable market is still largely focused on fitness tracking and the Apple Watch is nowhere near as disruptive as the iPhone and iPad were. If the Apple Watch finds more success in 2017, my guess is it’s because competition from Android Wear and the Pebble has completely diminished. What is Apple’s next big move? This can’t be it… The MacBook Pro with Touch Bar that, while unique, isn’t exactly going to change the way we use our computers. In fact, Windows 10 with the adoption of touch screen technology is much more likely to do that. The iPad Pro supports a pencil and a keyboard and is a fantastic product, but again, it’s not the sort of thing to drastically change anything the way the iPad and iPhone did. I wonder if it might be the car, but that doesn’t seem like a good fit given Apple’s roadblocks. A new iPhone 8 might be a good step, but what sorts of features will it offer that others can’t or already don’t? If anything, I see the iPhone 8 potentially playing a game of catch-up in the display department. Is it TV? If so, those rumors are almost as old as the Mac Pro, so when is Apple going to make its move? I have no answers, but I hope Apple does. Otherwise, it’s clear as day that Apple is lost.

Как рассказали CNews в компании, высокая степень проникновения услуг мобильного интернета и, в перспективе, развитие новых технологий, в том числе пятого поколения (5G), дает существенный импульс к дальнейшему развитию концепции Connected Car. С другой стороны, доминирование проприетарных систем и устройств является существенным тормозом российского рынка подключенных автомобилей. По прогнозам PwC, объем мирового рынка подключенных автомобилей в денежном выражении в ближайшие 5 лет вырастет более чем в три раза и к 2021 г. превысит 122 млрд евро. Крупнейшими сегментами рынка останутся системы обеспечения безопасности, автономного вождения и информационно-развлекательных услуг. На их долю в совокупности придется 83% в 2021 г. Одним из наиболее перспективных направлений является автономное вождение. Автомобильные концерны и крупнейшие интернет-компании Google и Apple активно инвестируют в создание беспилотных автомобилей. Например, в декабре 2016 г. компания Apple впервые публично признала наличие у нее планов разработки беспилотных автомобилей. В октябре 2016 г. компания Tesla Motorsанонсировала внедрение полноценной системы автопилота. Ожидается, что к 2020 году подключенные автомобили будут выпускать практически все гиганты автопрома – Daimler, Volvo, Nissan, Audi, Tesla, Ford, Toyota, Mercedes-Benz и др. В большинстве рассмотренных развитых стран, а также в России и Китае реализуются долгосрочные инициативы в области подключенных и беспилотных транспортных средств, интеллектуальной транспортной инфраструктуры. В частности, бюджет программы Connected Car в США составит 4 млрд долларов на 10 лет. В России часть проектов по модернизации транспортной инфраструктуры приурочена к проведению чемпионата мира по футболу, который состоится в 2018 г. Эти проекты входят в ФЦП «Повышение безопасности дорожного движения в 2013–2020 гг.». Кроме того, разрабатывается инициатива «АвтоНэт», в рамках которой к 2018 г. в автомобилях российского производства планируется внедрение систем помощи водителю (ADAS), а к 2035 г. – достижение полной автономности транспортных средств. Структура мирового рынка Connected Cars В настоящее время рынок подключенных автомобилей в России все еще находится на этапе своего становления и существенно, за исключением отдельных сегментов (например, мониторинг и управление автопарком), отстает от рынков развитых стран. Оптимистичные прогнозы в отдельных сегментах российского рынка (например, умное страхование, «ЭРА-ГЛОНАСС» и пр.) пока не подтвердились реальными показателями, а возможное расширение ряда «непопулярных» проектов (прежде всего «Платон») может вызвать очередной виток социальной напряженности и поэтому с большой долей вероятности не будет принято в ближайшей перспективе (1–2 года). Тем не менее в более долгосрочной перспективе рынок может получить существенный импульс. Например, в Правительстве РФ принципиально согласились с идеей оснащения всех автомобилей специальными устройствами, записывающими и передающими данные о движении и состоянии транспортного средства. Рассмотрим отдельные сегменты российского рынка ConnectedCar более подробно. По данным Всероссийского союза страховщиков (ВСС), объем рынка страхования КАСКО в 2015 году снизился на 14,3% (на 31,3 млрд руб.). По базовому прогнозу RAEX («Эксперт РА»), в 2016 г. этот сегмент сократится на 9–12% или на 15–18% по негативному прогнозу. Падение взносов будет связано с сокращением продаж автомобилей и отказом части автовладельцев от приобретения страхового полиса по возросшей цене. Предполагалось, что для поддержания интереса к страхованию КАСКО со стороны населения страховщики, в частности, будут усиленно продвигать продукты с использованием телематических устройств, которые позволят снизить стоимость страховой защиты. Однако рынок страховой телематики в 2016 г. не показал прогнозируемого взрывного роста, и доля умных полисов в общих продажах полисов КАСКО осталась на уровне около 1 %. Несколько страховых компаний фактически ушли с рынка, рост направления умного страхования у остальных участников рынка был ограниченным, а результаты деятельности новых игроков (например, проект умного страхования Smartdriving.io от компании «Лаборатория умного вождения») пока неизвестны. Сдерживающим фактором развития КАСКО с телематикой, по мнению экспертов, является довольно высокая стоимость установки и использования устройств, которая составляет порядка 10–15% от стоимости полиса. Большая часть страховых компаний, предлагающих умное страхование, устанавливают телематические устройства на автомобили клиентов за свой счет. По оценке компании Meta System, страховые компании РФ направили по меньшей мере 300 млн руб. на развитие КАСКО с телематическим устройством. Рынок подключенных автомобилей в России Еще в 2014 г. высказывались мнения, что умное страхование было бы логичнее реализовать не на базе отдельного устройства, а на основе бортового терминала «ЭРА-ГЛОНАСС» с доработанным программным обеспечением (при этом требовалось также внести соответствующие поправки в технический регламент). Очевидно, что услуга могла бы стать дешевле как минимум на стоимость отдельного устройства и попутно могла бы решиться проблема массового внедрения. В целом для реализации как государственных программ, так и коммерческих проектов вместо набора разнородного оборудования достаточно было бы использовать один предустановленный терминал «ЭРА-ГЛОНАСС» и необходимые дополнительные модули. Это позволило бы существенно (до 50%, по оценкам экспертов) сэкономить средства бюджета и частных инвесторов, в том числе при реализации таких крупных проектов, как систем платности пользования дорогами, систем мониторинга транспорта, интеллектуальных транспортных систем (ИТС) и др. Одним из коммерческих сервисов, запущенных на базе «ЭРА-ГЛОНАСС», является «ЭРА Транзит» – система контроля за сохранностью грузов и соблюдением маршрута перевозки. По итогам работы за 5 месяцев (с 16.04.2016 по 23.09.2016) автомобильным транспортом осуществлено 1173 транзитных перевозки с применением 1267 средств идентификации (пломб). В перспективе планируется реализовать сервис «ЭРА Помощь на дороге» (эвакуация транспортного средства, техническая помощь, техническая и юридическая консультация, аварийный и транспортный комиссар, подменное транспортное средство, вызов такси и пр.). В государственном сегменте продолжается сертификация телематических устройств. В частности, в августе 2016 г. был сертифицирован телематический терминал как устройство вызова экстренных оперативных служб (УВЭОС) «ЭРА-ГЛОНАСС» для установки на автобусы малого и среднего класса для городских и пригородных перевозок, для перевозок детей (школьный автобус) и специальные транспортные средства для перевозки вахтовых работников, специализированных строительных бригад, сезонных работников в сельском хозяйстве. Очевидно, что массовой услуга «ЭРА-ГЛОНАСС» может стать только за счет ее востребованности в сегменте частных пользователей. В условиях значительного сокращения роста продаж новых автомобилей в России рынок подключенных к «ЭРА-ГЛОНАСС» автомобилей мог бы вырасти за счет вторичного рынка подержанных автомобилей, на которые можно было бы устанавливать соответствующее оборудование. Однако сертифицированные центры по установке таких терминалов, как ожидается, будут массово доступны в России только с середины 2017 года. Кроме базовой функции спасения, для автовладельцев будет доступна система автоматизированного оформления европротокола, а также ряд дополнительных сервисов. Таким образом, к концу 2016 г. доля установленных терминалов «Эра-ГЛОНАСС» в новых автомобилях остается незначительной, а на вторичном рынке такие терминалы практически отсутствуют. Самой популярной моделью с предустановленной системой «Эра-ГЛОНАСС» является LadaVesta – 4-е место в общем рейтинге наиболее продаваемых марок легковых автомобилей в России по итогам октября 2016 г. Всего за 10 мес. 2016 г. было продано 42,5 тыс. таких автомобилей. С 1 января по 26 сентября 2016 г. в фильтрующий контакт-центр системы «ЭРА-ГЛОНАСС» поступило свыше 53,2 тыс. экстренных вызовов, из которых только 148 вызовов получили статус «истинные» и были переданы в службы экстренного реагирования. С 15 ноября 2015 г. в России начала работать система «Платон» для взимания платы с грузовиков массой 12 тонн и более в счет возмещения ущерба, наносимого федеральным автомобильным дорогам. По данным на 27 сентября 2016 г. (более 10 месяцев с момента старта проекта), в системе «Платон» было выдано 560 745 бортовых устройств, которыми обеспечено 86 % транспортных средств российских перевозчиков. В настоящее время идет поиск возможных путей дальнейшей монетизации проекта. В качестве возможных направлений рассматриваются весовой контроль (интеграция системы контроля), взаимодействие с госорганами – ФНС, МВД, ФТС, ФСБ, ФССП, РТН (обмен информацией), интеграция с системами взимания платы Таможенного союза, дополнительные сервисы для пользователей (умное страхование, мониторинг и пр.). Концепция подключенного автомобиля в России реализуется в основном в рамках крупных государственных проектов («ЭРА-ГЛОНАСС», «Платон» и пр.). При этом основным препятствием для более динамичного развития рынка являются закрытые платформы и решения, несовместимые между собой, что противоречит самой идее интернета вещей. Одним из вариантов решения проблем внедрения IoT на транспорте могли бы стать единые платформы по управлению грузовыми и пассажирскими перевозками, которые могли бы объединить всех эффективных участников рынка. Создание системы мультимодальных грузовых и пассажирских перевозок могло бы привести к снижению стоимости перевозок и повышению их качества, обеспечило бы рост деловой активности регионов и повысило бы мобильность граждан. Дополненные платформой по контролю транспортной инфраструктуры, эти платформы могли бы стать основой для развития электронной коммерции нового поколения, которая максимально бы уравняла возможности участников рынка независимо от географии, позволила бы максимально приблизить клиента к производителю, поддержать импортозамещение и снизить цены на продукцию.

U.S. wearables market is doing much worse than expected Posted Dec 21, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Enterprise social comes roaring back Apple may still be claiming that sales of its Apple Watch are “doing great,” but overall, the wearable device category is failing to grow at the rates forecasted earlier. According to a new report from eMarketer, wearables like Apple Watch and Fitbit were expected to grow more than 60 percent year-over-year from 2015 to 2016. However, the firm is now cutting that estimate down to just 25 percent growth this year. “Smartwatches in particular,” the report said, “have failed to impress customers.” Unlike other device categories, wearable devices have struggled to gain traction beyond early adopters. And with smartwatches, consumers struggle to find a reason to buy. eMarketer analyst Nicole Perrin pointed out that before Apple Watch arrived on the scene, fitness trackers dominated the space. Today, fitness and health tracking remain one of the key selling points for the new crop of wearable devices, Apple Watch included. But Apple hasn’t convinced everyone that a smartwatch is something they need, especially given the higher prices compared with standard fitness trackers for the watch’s enhanced functionality. “Without a clear use case for smart watches—which have more features than fitness trackers, but significant overlap with smartphone functionality—the more sophisticated, expensive devices have not caught on as quickly as expected,” said Perrin in the report. The firm estimates that 39.5 million U.S. adults will use a wearable device with internet connectivity at least once per month. However, this is much less than the 63.7 million eMarketer predicted back in October 2015. Use of wearable devices will only reach 15.8 percent of the population, and is only expected to grow to 21.1 percent by 2020. eMarketer isn’t the only firm noting the troubles in the wearable market. This month, IDC reported smartwatch numbers were on the decline, with Apple dropping to fourth place after a 71 percent year-over-year decline in total shipments. Fitbit instead won the category with 23 percent of the market and 5.3 million units shipped in the quarter. But even Fitbit could be struggling. New reports indicate that Fitbit’s Charge 2 may not be selling as quickly as expected, based on channel checks that found its inventory to be “particularly bloated,” along with weak demand for its Flex 2. In addition, IDC had said this past October that smartwatch sales were tanking, with total shipments down 51.6 percent from the same time last year. Apple had responded to IDC’s latest report not with hard numbers, but by touting the Apple Watch’s success as compared with its own prior sales. Apple CEO Tim Cook said that Apple Watch sales hit a record during the first week of holiday shopping, and that the current quarter is on track to be the best yet. It’s not surprising that the Apple Watch sold better than before during the 2016 holidays – after all, this is the time of the year where people tend to increase their spending. Plus, Apple released a new version of its smartwatch ahead of the holiday season which likely contributed to the bump. But that bump may not save the wearable category as a whole. eMarketer’s new report also noted that younger people are more interested in wearables, as around 30 percent of those 18 through 34 will be wearable users in 2017 – a figure that’s 17.6 percent higher than the overall population. Wearable early adopters also skewed male, until the shift toward fitness trackers, the report also found. By 2018, more wearable users will be female, it’s now forecasting. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Panasonic Founded 1918 Overview Panasonic Japan manufactures and sells various electronic and electric products under the Panasonic brand name worldwide.

Apple Watch Features One Apple Watch wearer noticed that when a call comes in through the wearable, there's a custom AirPods button when the headphones are connected and playing music. The AirPods button replaces the usual green answer button, simply designating that the call will be relayed through the AirPods and not through the Apple Watch speaker. Users of Apple's wearable can also swipe up from their watch face, tap battery percentage in control center, and check on their AirPods' battery levels from the Watch. Otherwise, the AirPods' battery levels can be checked in the iPhone's battery widget. Durability Test As is the case with most new Apple devices, durability tests are also underway, and YouTube channel EverythingApplePro this week shared one of the first major real-world drop and water tests with the AirPods. In the video, the headphones are put through basic drop tests from waist and ear height, and then to upwards of ten feet. Scuffs and marks hit the charging case hardest, but the AirPods themselves made it through largely unscathed thanks to their lightweight build. Most importantly, both the AirPods and the charging case continued to work normally after each drop. Water tests were also conducted on the AirPods, including a washing and drying cycle that confirmed the headphones and the case will survive and function as expected even after accidentally including them in a load of laundry. The channel's ultimate stress test was five minute submersion under one foot of water. Even with those extreme conditions, the AirPods synced up with the iPhone immediately after submersion, and both headphones were "working perfectly." Resale Prices Naturally, with so many people looking to gift the AirPods to family and friends for Christmas, resale prices are rising on eBay. Most auctions are sitting around the $250 mark with hours left to go, and guaranteed shipping by Christmas, but some Buy it Now prices are set at upwards of $350 and $500. Prices will only continue to inflate as Christmas grows closer and shipping costs rise to overnight packages. Availability and Tracking Certain retailers like Best Buy in the United States and Carphone Warehouse in the United Kingdom have restocked AirPods throughout the week, but Apple's online website now has an estimated delivery in mid-February for most countries. Anyone who wants to keep as up to date as possible on AirPods availability can use iStockNow's tracking map to see where the headphones are currently available. Users are likely to glimpse a map filled with red pins indicating no stock available, but we’ve seen occasional green pins show up throughout the morning. You’ll have to be fast though, as they sell out very quickly.

Rating: 7 Votes WilliamG 2 weeks ago I am still trying to grasp a product that 50% of the consumer base can't keep in their ears, or the fact these were released as a for profit product that only certain people can even use due to their ear shape. lol. The ones with the iPhones are free, so that doesn't matter. Who says 50%? It's amazing the number of people who don't own these who continue to poo-poo them. I can tell you I don't regret spending $159 + tax for these TWICE (one set for the wifey). Not even for a second. You couldn't pry them out of my warm, wax-filled ears.

It's instant, effortless, and is pretty magical compared to reg bluetooth. On my Apple Watch, iPhone, and MacBook, I have yet to find the slightest hiccup. As far as sound quality I have 0 complaints. They sound great even in noisy environments and the sound quality using the two mics (I haven't used just 1) is fantastic as well.

Here are five simple changes you can enact to make your iPhone more secure. By Conner Forrest | December 21, 2016, 7:24 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: James Martin/CNET For most users, smartphones are a treasure trove of personal data and private information. With the concept of mobility expanding to include more forms of communication than ever before, these phones become a central point where many aspects of life converge. As such, smartphones have also become a prime target for hackers and thieves. The hardware itself is valuable, sure, but the data within could give someone access to credit cards, bank accounts, and more. SEE: Apple iPhone 7: The smart person's guide The iPhone is known for its security, due to Apple's closed ecosystem and the company's stance on encryption, but there are some additional steps you can take and settings you can change to further improve it. Here are five quick tips that will help you boost the security and privacy of your iPhone. 1. Enable 'Erase Data' One way that an iPhone user can further limit an outsider's access to their personal data is to enable data wiping in the event of a passcode failure. If enabled, this feature will erase all the data on your iPhone after 10 failed attempts at guessing the passcode. To turn it on, tap the Settings icon, and then tap the "Touch ID & Passcode" option. After being prompted to put in your current passcode, scroll to the bottom of the page. Then, simply tap the slider next to "Erase Data" to enable the feature. If you plan on using this feature, make sure your data is regularly backed up to your computer, or to your iCloud account. Also, make sure you don't forget your passcode! 2. Limit access on the lock screen One of the more useful features of the iPhone is that it enables glanceable notifications and access on the phone's lock screen. However, this also creates privacy and security concerns, as thieves can access important information, including your Apple Wallet, and perform functions through Siri, without your password. To limit what is available to view on the lock screen, follow the same steps to get to the Erase Data feature above. Tap the Settings icon, and then tap the "Touch ID & Passcode" option. After being prompted to put in your passcode, scroll to the bottom of the page. Under "Allow Access When Locked," you will see a list of features you can enable or disable. The features with the green sliders are enabled and viewable on the lock screen, so tap them to turn off their lock screen access. 3. Limit advertising Much like other tech vendors, Apple uses your data to provide targeted ads. To disable this, start by tapping the Settings icon, and then tap "Privacy." Scroll to the bottom of this page, and tap on the "Advertising" option. Next, simply tap the "Limit Ad Tracking" slider to turn it on, and you're all set. 4. Turn off location tracking One of the ways that mobile devices provide contextual information is by leveraging your location data. To limit or disable location tracking on your iPhone, go into the Settings and tap on "Privacy." Toward the top of the screen, you'll see a "Location Services" options, which you should tap. If you want to customize and limit which features and apps have access to your location, tap the "System Services" tab at the bottom of the page. If you pursue this option, disabling features such as "Share My Location" and "Frequent Locations" are good places to start. However, if you just want to disable Location Services as a whole, at the top of the Location Services page, simply tap the slider next to "Location Services" so that it isn't green. Keep in mind, though, this will limit the functionality of some apps and services. 5. Authenticate like a pro Most iPhone users who have a passcode use a simple four- or six-digit code. But setting a longer and more complex passcode can improve your security. To do so, from Settings, tap "Touch ID & Passcode," and enter your current passcode. Tap the "Change Passcode" option and follow the prompt to enter your current passcode again. When you're given the option to input a new passcode, tap the "Passcode Options" link, and you can set a longer numerical or alphanumeric passcode there. If you want to improve your authentication even further, consider setting up two-factor authentication as well. Stay informed, click here to subscribe to the TechRepublic Apple Weekly newsletter.

Rumor has it that Apple’s third iPhone – which won’t likely be called iPhone 8, however you slice it – will be the highest-end of the bunch. The same source as listed above suggested that this third device is running under codename “Ferrari” and will be jam packed with high-end features. New features – features that have not yet been present on any of Apple’s previous models. The display up front of this device will be AMOLED – the much awaited switch-over to the brighter display technology for Apple. It’s not clear yet whether or not this means the regular iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will stick to the same displays their predecessors have now. We’re going to go ahead and call the third model the “iPhone 7s Pro” to make explaining it easy. In the iPhone 7s Pro, the body of the device will remain largely similar to the iPhone 7 Plus. Again – these are rumors, not official word from Apple. The display up front of this iPhone 7s Pro is said to be larger than the iPhone 7 Plus, meaning it’ll have a more edge-to-edge display sort of feel to it. This highest-end model is expected to work with a home button hidden in its display, and will – possibly – work with wireless charging, too. In fact the rumors from CNBeta and images surrounding this iPhone Pro device aren’t all that different from our June feature Apple’s Road to iPhone Pro or how to present an iPhone Pro. We’ll have to cross our fingers and hope for a wild-as-possible iPhone Pro inside 2017.

X Government says ECJ ruling has no bearing on Apple case Department of Finance responds to ruling in relation to Spanish tax concession scheme Wed, Dec 21, 2016, 13:17 Guy Hedgecoe In Madrid, Eoin Burke-Kennedy ECJ decision casts doubt on tax concessions offered to companies such as Santander.         The Government has dismissed suggestions that a ruling by Europe’s top court on tax concessions given to Spanish companies represents a setback for the State’s appeal against the Apple tax ruling. The European Court of Justice’s (ECJ) ruling on Wednesday cast doubt on a tax scheme used by some Spanish firms to reduce their corporation tax liability, and appeared to back the European Commission’s view that it constituted a breach of state aid rules. The verdict was seen to give an insight into the court’s likely stance on the European Commission’s €13 billion tax ruling in relation to Apple, which is being appealed by the Government. However, this was rejected by the Department of Finance. “It is a complete overstatement to say that the Irish appeal of the Apple decision is dependent on the outcome of the Santander and Autogrill decision of the European Court of Justice, or that today’s judgement is crucial for the Irish case,” a spokesman said. “The facts and the approach in the Santander and Autogrill cases are very different from those that have now been presented in the final decision in the Apple case,” he added. However, Sinn Féin finance spokesman Pearse Doherty said the ruling shows why the Government’s decision to appeal the Apple decision will be a waste of money. “The spin that the Apple ruling was a case of the commission exceeding its powers is now debunked,” he said. In its ruling, the Luxembourg-based court said EU’s General Court had been mistaken in deciding that the European Commission had not managed to demonstrate that a group of companies had been singled out by the programme. The scheme, which offers tax breaks for firms with a 5 per cent shareholding in a foreign company, will now have to be re-examined by a lower court. ADVERTISEMENT The case affects World Duty Free Group (formerly Autogrill España) and Santusa Holding, as well as Santander. The European Commission welcomed the judgment, saying its state aid decisions were reinstated and that it would now work with Spanish authorities to recover the aid granted. ‘Floor clause’ mortgages In a separate ruling, the ECJ also decided that homeowners affected by so-called “floor clause” mortgages should be reimbursed money dating back to when their mortgage contract was signed. Previously, they were only entitled to reimbursement as far back as May 2013 when the Spanish Supreme Court first ruled that such mortgages were unlawful. Banks started to offer the now-infamous “floor clause” mortgages during Spain’s decade-long economic boom, which was fuelled by the property sector. The clause ensured that the homeowner would have to pay a minimum amount of interest, despite having contracted a variable interest mortgage. When European interest rates plummeted, these clients – numbering around three million – continued to pay a higher monthly rate than other homeowners. The Luxembourg-based court said that limiting the timeframe to 2013 “makes consumer protection incomplete and insufficient and is not an adequate and effective means for preventing the use of unfair terms”. Estimates vary as to how much lenders will have to pay back clients as a result of the ruling, with financial consultancy AFI putting the figure at approximately €4.5 billion.       Topics: Eu European Commission Apple Bbva Santander Spain Read More Fiscal council’s work lacked basic coherence, says civil servant ECB Irish bond restrictions may be eased by NTMA, Central Bank Gideon Rachman: Britain’s third option is train-crash Brexit Apple ruling: EU accuses Ireland of inconsistencies on tax rules Finland plans to hand out no-strings cash to unemployed Ireland fails to justify selective treatment of Apple, commission says Dublin’s pre-emptive strike directs narrative on Apple tax Apple dismisses tax bill, says Ireland ‘doesn’t do any engineering for us’ Commission accused of undermining Ireland’s tax code Apple judgment partly about making big political statement Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Transport & Tourism Why Ryanair is offering package holidays now Work Millennials start new year with old-school paper diaries and pens English Soccer Jermain Defoe double leaves Liverpool frustrated Irish Times After 2016, economic forecasting for 2017 has got to be perilous Sponsored Making a difficult fertility journey a lot less lonely Redbreast Lustau: an old friend with a new whiskey perspective Infertility and the workplace: one woman's experience Do you know how much you’ll save by switching health plan?

Naturally, most assumed that Apple would then be using its own design teams for future Beats products. But we’ve learned that Ammunition is continuing to work with Apple in some capacity, at least collaborating on the design of its latest BeatsX and Beats EP headphones. Before Apple acquired Beats, Ammunition and its founder Robert Brunner, who happens to be a former director of industrial design at Apple from 1989 to 1996, was acting as chief designer for Beats by Dr. Dre. In May 2014, after Apple’s acquisition plans were revealed, Brunner confirmed he and Ammunition would be stepping down from designing Beats products: “Over the next few months, the design for Beats will transition away from Ammunition. It’s tough to step down as Chief Designer for a brand I take so much pride in, but it certainly makes it easier knowing we are handing the reigns over to one of the world’s most successful design teams. But it appears that transition never happened and Ammunition continues to work on Apple’s latest Beats headphone lines… Announced alongside Apple’s new cord-free AirPods at its iPhone event last September, Ammunition lists Apple’s now-delayed BeatsX Bluetooth earbuds as one of its latest contributions. It also lists the Beats EP headphones as one of its recent projects. Indeed Brunner’s LinkedIn profile confirms the partnership continues, albeit without mentioning Apple, noting his role as “Chief designer for Beats by Dr. Dre as partnership between Ammunition and Beats Electronics LLC.”  Brunner and Ammunition have been involved in the design of Beats products since the beginning of the company and he is also tied to a recent lawsuit launched by another early Beats partner over royalties. Apple has released a few products since the acquisition, but it’s mostly updated existing lines including launching new Beats Pill bluetooth speakers with Lightning connectors and updated Bluetooth versions of Beats’ popular on-ear headphones. Its first Bluetooth Pill speaker following the acquisition, which added its Lightning connector and other new features, was also designed by Ammunition according to its website. The most notable advancement for the headphones comes with Apple’s W1 chip, also used in the company’s new cord-free AirPods, which greatly improves the pairing and connectivity of wireless headphones. The now delayed BeatsX headphones designed by Ammunition will be one of three pairs of Beats with the new chip. We already reviewed the new Beats Solo3 and the PowerBeats 3. The new wired Beats EP headphones designed by Ammunition were also launched alongside the new models, although to less fanfare. Apple officially launched and started delivering its own cord-free earbuds this month called AirPods, and in the process delayed the BeatsX model now expected to go on sale in February. We went hands-on with the AirPods this week, and also put them up against the new Powerbeats3 to compare what are some of the first W1-enabled earphones available.

This Guy Has It All Figured Out By Adnan Farooqui on 12/21/2016 09:05 PST Apple finally started selling AirPods, its new wireless earbuds, about a week ago. They are not exactly cheap. The AirPods cost $159 and there’s a legitimate concern among customers who fear that they might end up losing one earbud. Replacing a lost AirPod is not going to be cheap either because Apple will charge $69 for it. If you haven’t bought them yet for precisely this reason, you need to see the solution this guy has come up with. You might not necessarily lose the AirPods when you have them on and are out for a run. They’re stable enough to stay in your ears throughout a rigorous workout session. There’s no guarantee, though, that you may not end up losing one in a random place. Andrew Cornett has a genius fix for this dilemma even though it involves keeping the AirPods on at all times. You see, he’s eliminating the fear of ever losing the wireless earbuds by sticking them inside his stretched ear piercings. So there you have it. If you want a foolproof way to secure your investment in the $159 AirPods, get a big hole punched in your ear and stick the earbuds through them. If you’re not up for that, then be prepared to pay $69 for a lost AirPod at some point in the future.

California start-up firm Energous is thought to be working on a mid-range wireless charging transmitter which could work over distances up to 15 feet (4.5 metres). It is expected to be released in toward the latter half of 2017, which would tie in with the expected release of three anticipated new models of iPhone. Scroll down for video Current wireless charging relies on contact between devices and a base unit (pictured). But leaked information suggests Apple is working with Energous, who specialise in long-distance wireless charging technology HOW WOULD IT WORK?  California start-up firm Energous is thought to be working on a mid-range wireless charging transmitter which could work over distances up to 15 feet (4.5 metres).  The 'WattUp' platform, which uses small antennas to transfer energy over fairly long distances.  It works at greater distances than existing wireless charging solutions that rely on traditional inductive charging coils. The charging process is controlled by software, meaning end users can decide the order in which devices receive power and create schedules for their charging. In a research note from market analyst Louis Basenese, which was obtained by Apple Insider, a number of connections between Apple and Energous were made.  Among them is the defection of Apple's Regulatory Certification Program Manager Billy Manning. Mr Manning spent seven years at the company before joining Energous as Director of Regulatory Operations in September 2016. It has also emerged that Energous is working with Apple suppliers Dialog Semiconductor and Pegatron. Energous is the company behind the 'WattUp' platform, which uses small antennas to transfer energy over fairly long distances It works at greater distances than existing wireless charging solutions that rely on traditional inductive charging coils.

SHOULD YOU UPGRADE TO THE IPHONE 7?  Some technology sites are advising users to hold off on upgrading their iPhones until the next year's version, which will mark the 10-year anniversary of Apple's revolutionary handset. Analysts say the iPhone 8 may feature a curved display that reaches from one edge of the device to the other and a home button integrated into the screen. A patent applied for by the firm, details of which emerged in September 2016, refers to an 'inductive charging station' similar to the plastic wireless charger used by the Apple Watch. The move would also fit with suggestions that the iPhone 8 will feature glass casing, to support wireless charging. Serbian-American inventor Nikolai Tesla first envisaged long-distance wireless electrical transfer more than 100 years ago.  But it is yet to make its way to the mainstream.  Previous rumours suggested Taiwan firm Foxconn Technology Group, a division of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, were making wireless charging modules to go with Apple's next iPhone. A patent applied for by the firm (pictured), details of which emerged in September 2016, refers to an 'inductive charging station' similar to the plastic wireless charger used by the Apple Watch Apple's upcoming iPhone 8 (artist's impression pictured) could be set to ditch the current aluminium and glass design in favour of a plastic OLED screen that curves 'all over' Rumours also suggest the iPhone 8 could be made from Bulk Amorphous Alloy, which is a mix of titanium, nickel, copper and zirconium melted together. This is said to have the smooth texture of glass and the rigid sturdiness of rubber (artist's impression)  IPHONE 8 RUMOURS  Several rumours have been circulating about the iPhone 8, and suggest the next device may have: - Dual-lens 3D camera - Augmented reality to generate real-time views of surroundings - Curved glass casing - Plastic OLED screen - Wireless charging - A folding element - New 5 inch (12.7 centimetre) and 5.8 inch (14.7 centimetre) models - A new 'pure white' model A research note from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo obtained by MacRumors commented on industry expectations. Mr Kuo said: ‘We believe one of the reasons why new iPhones will switch from metal casing to glass casing is to support wireless charging. ‘In order to ensure a superior performance, we believe it is most appropriate for EMS suppliers to develop and make the wireless charger because then a comprehensive test can be conducted.’ ‘As Hon Hai needs to deploy most resources to develop and produce OLED iPhone, we expect Pegatron will be the exclusive supplier of the wireless charger.’ A wireless charger would also solve a problem caused by Apple ditching the 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone. It would enable users to charge their phone while simultaneously using the Lightning port to plug in a pair of headphones. Some technology sites are advising users to hold off on upgrading their iPhones until the next year's version, which will mark the 10-year anniversary of Apple's revolutionary handset. Analysts say the iPhone 8 may feature a curved display that reaches from one edge of the device to the other and a home button integrated into the screen.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Stanton calls for more discussion of medical marijuana in Apple Valley Wednesday Dec 21, 2016 at 9:15 AM Dec 21, 2016 at 9:15 AM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — Prompted by the passage of Proposition 64 and comments lodged by medical marijuana proponents, Councilwoman Barb Stanton has asked for a discussion on removing deliveries from the town’s moratorium on medical marijuana. Stanton — a vocal medical marijuana and Prop 64 advocate — expressed concern for citizens “who aren’t participating in an activity that they shouldn’t be” when she broached the subject during the Dec. 13 Council meeting. “Right now ... any citizen receiving a delivery is breaking the law, in essence,” Stanton said. “I don’t believe any of our citizens should be put in that position for something that is fully available to them. So in the short term ... I’d like to consider just taking out the deliveries from any ban. We would allow the deliveries while we construct whatever we’re going to do.” Stanton’s comments come on the heels of Prop 64’s Nov. 8 victory, which was spurred by the nearly 8 million Californians who voted to decriminalize recreational use of marijuana. In Apple Valley, some 75 percent of registered voters weighed in on the issue, according to San Bernardino County Elections Office data, with 13,857 residents voting in favor of recreational use and taxation of the drug. While those numbers might appear staggering in a town with a relatively conservative history, nearly the same number of residents voted against legalization, leading to a 296-vote win for proponents of the proposition. Despite the slim margin, Stanton preferred to focus on the outcome while in conversation with the Daily Press on Tuesday. “This (issue) is huge in our state,” she said. “This is our prohibition. We can’t systematically deny the voters their rights.” Stanton sees future regulation and taxation as a boon to the town’s finances; however, she’s not as enthusiastic as Adelanto’s City Council, which sees the medical marijuana industry as the catalyst needed to jumpstart its struggling economy. “In this early stage, I believe our citizens should be of free mind,” Stanton said. “Even for the people delivering, our local citizens have begged for regulation. They want to tax it and regulate it, and I want our town to benefit from it. Apple Valley has a lot going for it. We have a lot of eggs in our basket. This could be just one.” Stanton said she’s pushed the issue hard because she has “very conservative colleagues,” but the distance between them might not be a bridge too far, according to Mayor Scott Nassif. Nassif told the Daily Press he was “a little surprised” Prop 64 passed in Apple Valley, but he added the results aren’t shocking when polls and shifting perspectives are taken into consideration."  “There’s a high republican registration in Apple Valley,” Nassif said, “(but) I think this issue crosses over quite a bit and that includes feelings on medical marijuana. The perception has changed and the older groups are moving on, if you want to put it that way. It used to be that Apple Valley was primarily a retirement community, but the pendulum has begun to swing and our average age has gone down." The often impenetrable divide separating conservatives and liberals doesn’t seem to apply itself to marijuana, according to Nassif, who said he spoke with a number of people about the issue leading up to the election. “It wasn’t that long ago (Proposition 19 in 2010) that legal pot didn’t pass (in California),” he said. “But there’s kind of a nonchalant attitude (toward marijuana) even among republicans.” And so there exists room on the Town Council for further discussion that could lead to the reaching of common ground, especially insofar as medical marijuana is concerned. Nassif said even Councilman Curt Emick isn’t as opposed as his profession — pharmacist — might suggest. “Curt’s not necessarily against the true use of medical marijuana,” Nassif said. “He believes it should go through the same criteria and be regulated like any other medicinal drug. I don’t even know where I stand on it, to be honest. I know people are benefitting from it, and I’m okay with that. I think we all kind of have that thinking, but where we're at in the big picture varies a bit.” The “big picture” for Nassif includes perceived complications related to regulation of dispensaries and cultivation, which — like delivery — remain illegal within town borders. “It’s a cash business,” he said, “so there’s virtually no regulation. That’s what California is going to struggle with and what other states have struggled with. When you have that kind of business, it’s difficult to regulate and manage from a societal and a governmental point of view.” Nassif said increased crime rates remain a concern for him, as does the industry’s ability to foster economic growth in the long term given that, according to Nassif, the free market eventually stabilizes surges in any industry via competition. According to Town Attorney John Brown, a presentation is in the works for a future Council meeting, during which the town’s moratorium will be addressed in relation to Prop 64’s passage. And that news appears to sit well with Stanton — who doesn’t want the issue “to get buried in the grand plan” — and Nassif who’s approaching the issue with caution. “If you can’t convince me, I’m going to vote no,” he said. “I don’t want to run into this blindly. I don’t do that in my business and I don’t do that on the Council. I need to know that this is the right thing for the community.” Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254. Follow him on Twitter @DP_MatthewCabe.

Image: Denis Kuvaev/Shutterstock Apple got a Christmas present from the House Judiciary Committee of the US Congress, which agrees encryption back doors are a security threat. In a year-end report the House Judiciary Committee, a bipartisan congressional panel, recommended that the US is better advised to support strong encryption, rather than weakening it by putting back doors into tech products. This puts the House Judiciary Committee at odds with the FBI, which is in favour of back doors in tech products and services. ‘Congress cannot stop bad actors – at home or overseas – from adopting encryption. Therefore, the committees should explore other strategies to address the needs of the law enforcement community’ – HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE In its report, the committee appears to be agreeing with Apple CEO Tim Cook’s warning that putting encryption back doors into tech products puts everyone at risk. The encryption working group, made up of members of the two house committees, was formed in the wake of the San Bernardino killings in the US. Apple v FBI The investigation into the killings centred on an iPhone belonging to one of the killers, and the FBI’s attempts to get Apple to back down on encryption caused a furious row. The report sides with Apple and its stance on strong encryption. However, it also acknowledges that encryption has become an obstacle for law enforcement. “Congressional action in this space should weigh any short-term benefits against the long-term impacts to the national interest,” the report said. “Congress cannot stop bad actors – at home or overseas – from adopting encryption. Therefore, the committees should explore other strategies to address the needs of the law enforcement community.” Encryption is important for personal, economic, and national security, said the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) in the wake of the report’s publication. “This report is welcome news for those who care about personal, economic, and national security,” said CCIA CEO Ed Black. “We are glad that after close examination of the security and technical issues, these leading lawmakers understand the considerable stakes and support strong encryption. “Deploying weakened forms of encryption in online services and consumer devices is short-sighted and would play directly into the hands of those who would do us harm.” Related: encryption, government & policy, Apple, legal, FBI Editor John Kennedy is an award-winning technology journalist. editorial@siliconrepublic.com You May Also Like You May Also Like Companies Irish Government cabinet agrees to appeal EU Apple ruling 2 Sep 201663 Shares Hiring Now A dynamic and rapidly expanding company Be part of a globally successful team Always at the cutting edge of new innovation Join us to create the technology of tomorrow Business ‘Ireland must fight the Apple tax case, and it must fight to win’ 6 Sep 201637 Shares Companies Has the train already left the station for the west’s digital dreams? 1 Nov 201694 Shares SUBSCRIBE TO OUR E-ZINE Sign up to receive weekly alerts bringing the best of Siliconrepublic.com straight to your inbox.

On Tuesday, a bipartisan congressional panel published a year-end report, advising the U.S. to explore other solutions to the encryption debate. According to the new congressional report, the U.S. is better off supporting strong encryption than trying to weaken it. The report specifically noted that "Any measure that weakens encryption works against the national interest."   There's no doubt that Apple pushed this issue to a head. The report begins this way:   "On February 16, 2016, a federal magistrate judge in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California issued an order requiring Apple, Inc. to assist the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in obtaining encrypted data off of an iPhone related to a 2015 shooting in San Bernardino, California. Apple resisted the order. This particular case was resolved when the FBI pursued a different method to access the data stored on the device. But the case, and the heated rhetoric exchanged by parties on all sides, reignited a decades-old debate about government access to encrypted data."   Tuesday's report essentially sides with Apple and its stance that strong encryption is vital for security. But the report also acknowledged that the technology has become an obstacle for law enforcement agencies when investigating crimes.   However, forcing U.S. companies to compromise their encryption wouldn't necessarily solve the problem. Consumers and bad actors, for instance, would likely choose to use more secure products offered by foreign companies, the report said.   The full 13 page report is available for your review which gives the impression that this is really the beginning of the debate and not the end. The report provides us with the committee's next steps.   Next Steps   Based on these observations, the members of the EWG listed above have identified the following areas for future discussion by the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on the Judiciary. These suggestions are not exhaustive, and are intended provide starting points for the Committees' work in this space in the next Congress, without precluding or undermining consideration of related issues as they emerge or evolve.   Law Enforcement Requests for Information   Congress should explore means of providing assistance to law enforcement agencies with respect to navigating the process of accessing information from private companies. A few relatively uncontroversial ideas could radically improve the ability of the law enforcement community to operate in a digital environment—and also reduce tensions between law enforcement and private industry. These ideas include, but are not limited to:   Exploring tools that might help companies clarify what information is already available to law enforcement officers, and under what circumstances.   Examining federal warrant procedures to determine whether they can be made more efficient, consistent with current constitutional standards.   Examining federal warrant procedures to ensure that they are clear and consistent with respect to law enforcement access to digital information.   Examining how law enforcement can better utilize existing investigative tools.   Authorizing and modernizing the National Domestic Communications Assistance Center (NDCAC). The NDCAC, organized under the Department of Justice, is a hub for technical knowledge management designed to facilitate information sharing among law enforcement agencies and the communications industry. NDCAC does not have an investigative role and is not responsible for execution of electronic surveillance court orders. Congress has never formally authorized the NDCAC, but its current structure seems conducive to providing the law enforcement community a forum through which to share information and benefit from existing technical expertise.   In conclusion, the report notes that "The debate about government access to encrypted data is not new—but circumstances have changed, and so too must our approach.   Encryption is inexorably tied to our national interests. It is a safeguard for our personal secrets and economic prosperity. It helps to prevent crime and protect national security. The widespread use of encryption technologies also complicates the missions of the law enforcement and intelligence communities. As described in this report, those complications cannot be ignored. This is the reality of modern society. We must strive to find common ground in our collective responsibility: to prevent crime, protect national security, and provide the best possible conditions for peace and prosperity.   That is why this can no longer be an isolated or binary debate. There is no "us versus them," or "pro-encryption versus law enforcement." This conversation implicates everyone and everything that depends on connected technologies—including our law enforcement and intelligence communities. This is a complex challenge that will take time, patience, and cooperation to resolve. The potential consequences of inaction—or overreaction—are too important to allow historical or ideological perspectives to stand in the way of progress."   Encryption Working Group Year-End Report PDF by Patently Apple / Jack Purcher on Scribd   Lobbying groups from the tech sector welcomed Tuesday's report. The Computer and Communications Industry Association said weakening encryption would be 'shortsighted.'   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

News EU Tax Ruling Could Mean Tough Battle For Apple, Anheuser-Busch Apple could face a tough road in its attempt to avoid paying billions of dollars in back taxes in Europe. (Apple) BLOOMBERG NEWS 12/21/2016 Reprints Apple (AAPL) and Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) may face a tough battle in disputes over European Union demands for back taxes after the bloc's top court partly backed regulators' attempt to force Spanish firms to repay millions of dollars in tax breaks. In a ruling that could ultimately add impetus to the region's clampdown on special tax treatment for selected companies, judges at the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg said a lower tribunal should re-examine a Spanish system that gave tax breaks to companies, including Banco Santander (BSBR), for the acquisition of stakes in foreign firms. Those tax advantages must now be repaid, the EU said in a statement. The EU General Court was wrong to rule that the European Commission failed to show that a group of companies was singled out by the program, which granted deductions for shareholdings in foreign firms, the top judges said Wednesday. Regulators don't always have to show that only certain companies benefit from the aid, the court said. "This is a landmark decision because it clarifies the rules of the game," said Raymond H.C. Luja, professor of comparative tax law at Maastricht University in The Netherlands. "That will also have its effect on a number of ongoing cases." Crusade Europe's crusade against unfair tax treatment has led EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager to order Apple to pay a record $13.6 billion in back taxes because of arrangements with Ireland that she says weren't open to others. Belgium was also told to claw back roughly $730 million in tax advantages granted to companies, including AB InBev, the world's biggest brewer. "The judgment is important because it confirms that a measure may be selective, if it benefits only those companies that carry out certain transactions," the commission said in an emailed statement. "The fact that the conditions that a company needed to fulfill were not strict and the benefits were therefore available to many companies does not call into question the selective nature." Action has now moved to the courts with Apple filing its legal challenge this week, joining Starbucks (SBUX), a Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) unit and more than a dozen Belgian-based companies calling on judges to halt the EU in its tracks. Amazon.com (AMZN), McDonald's (MCD) and France's Engie are also being probed by regulators over tax deals with Luxembourg. Re-Establishing Standards The ruling "re-establishes the comparability standards, meaning you have to look whether companies in the same legal and factual situation are treated differently, without proper justification," Luja said. "That's the argument the commission is also using in many of the tax-ruling cases." The court confirmed the principle that companies that are comparable, being in the same factual and legal situation, should be treated the same. But the ruling leaves a key question in the tax probes unanswered, Luja said. "It's not the standard that's the issue, because the court confirmed that," Luja said. "The question in the ongoing tax ruling cases is whether the commission's assumption that a stand-alone company and a group company are comparable, is applicable, and there this decision tells us little." So-called selectivity — or the notion that a tax break targets only certain companies and excludes others — is "the key issue" that links the Santander case with the EU's probes into the tax practices of international companies, said Edoardo Traversa, a professor who specializes in tax law at Belgium's Universite Catholique de Louvain. Court Support? Apple and other companies can take solace in another ruling on Wednesday, where the EU's top court criticized regulators in a case involving tax benefits to airlines using Germany's Luebeck airport. That judgment said the EU was wrong to determine the tax breaks were unfair to others simply because they were granted only to airlines at that airport. Tax breaks are a subsidy that give some companies an unfair advantage, especially if they plow back their savings into competing against others in industries with price pressures and where margins are razor-thin, the EU's top state aid official said earlier this month. Regulators are "very much concerned that this is going on" with Amazon's tax arrangements, he said. Wednesday's ruling focuses on Spanish tax breaks for homegrown firms that allowed them to go on a buying spree abroad. Santander grew from being a provincial lender to become the second-biggest by market value in the euro region with the purchase of banks in the U.K. and the Americas. It built a balance sheet that's as big as Spain's gross national product. Spanish companies including Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), Telefonica and Iberdrola (IBDRY) also aggressively pursued expansion abroad. Delay Spain must now demand the companies repay the tax advantages they received, the EU said. Regulators had agreed to avoid "actively" pursuing back-tax demands until the ruling was delivered. The European Commission told Spain in 2009 and 2011 to abolish the tax breaks and recoup tax advantages dating back to December 2007. But that order hit a roadblock two years ago when the EU General Court, the bloc's second-highest tribunal, ruled that the Spanish regime at issue was not selective and doesn't exclude any "company from taking advantage of it." Wednesday's ruling says regulators "properly established the selectivity" of the tax program because it was restricted to certain companies, undermining one of the key planks of the Spanish firms' arguments against the EU decision. While the case may take years to reach a conclusion, the judgment emboldens the EU in the midst of its war against tax subsidies.

Chinese blog cnBeta has cited sources from Apple’s East Asian supply chain that claim Apple will launch the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus as well as a third handset in 2017. The mystery handset is codenamed the Ferrari and features an edge-to-edge borderless OLED display with an “invisible” home button under the screen. Leaked documentation shows the phone featuring a larger AMOLED panel in a similar form factor to previous handsets.  That may mean we'll see a 5-inch - or maybe even larger - screen inside the body of a phone similar to the iPhone 7, which features a 4.7-inch screen. Three's a crowd TouchID will still be on the iPhone 7S variant, but it'll instead feature under the screen. The documents also claim Apple plans to move the SIM card tray toward the bottom of the phone.  Apple placed the SIM card tray lower down on the iPad Pro so this may be in an effort to include a Smart Connector, which is something we've heard rumored for the iPhone 7S/8 Pro. If these rumors turn out to be correct, it’ll be the first time we’ve seen Apple release three phones as a part of the main iPhone line up and give another premium alternative to the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. It’ll also be the first time Apple has employed AMOLED technology in its phones. Previous rumors have revealed Apple wants to include AMOLED panels in all of its phones, but there's a lack of resource in the phone industry right now and it's struggling to find a supplier. iPhone 8 release date, news and rumors Tags iPhone iPad ABOUT THE AUTHOR James Peckham James is Phones, Wearables and Tablets writer for TechRadar and covers all the big announcements from the best manufacturers making gadgets for your palms, wrists and face.

TECHNOLOGY 6 Things to Know About the Apple AirPods Before you spring for the Apple AirPods this week, read this. By John Brandon John Brandon is a contributing editor at Inc. magazine covering technology. He writes the Tech Report column for Inc.com. @jmbrandonbb Contributing editor, Inc.com@jmbrandonbb WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Apple released a new product just in time for the holidays. If you head to an Apple Store, Best Buy, or any of the wireless carrier stores, you could score a new set of AirPods for $159 (if they are in stock). Before you make the purchase, keep a few things in mind. 1. They last five hours and the case can recharge four times Apple is using the W1 chip in the AirPods, which means the battery life is much better than you might expect. In my tests, they lasted all week for occasional use or about five hours. A sensor knows when you take them off and eventually they power down on their own. The AirPods also charge up quickly--after 15 minutes you can expect to listen for about three hours. 2. The build quality matches up with the included Apple earbuds The actual earbud piece is not all that different from the EarPods included with the iPhone. That means the build quality is about the same--this product is not made for running or a workout, and there's no promise about water resistance. In my experience, the EarPods do tend to work if you're caught out in the rain and at least one teardown claims some water protection. 3. The earbuds stay put better without a wire One reason I like the AirPods so much is that they tend to stay put in your ear, which is one advantage of using wireless earbuds. On wired earbuds, the wire tends to pull down a bit and can cause the earpiece to move around while you listen to music or make phone calls. Also, no cord means no tangles. 4. Watch out for interference In a crowded coffee shop, I did notice some interference--my music stream stuttered a bit on only a song or two. This was likely because there were so many competing signals. (I made sure my music was downloaded locally.) Most wireless music products have some minor glitches on occasion, and Apple would say there isn't much you can do about interference in a public place. 5. You look a little weird One minor gripe here. The design of the AirPods is trim, small, and they fit nicely in your ear and that's fine. Yet, a few people commented that the white pods with a small antenna pointing down looked a bit odd, almost like you're wearing earrings. Wearing one at a time mostly solves that problem since it is not as weird. 6. The sound quality is more distinct due to the tighter fit In my review, I noted how the music sounds so distinct. That's the big selling point here and why I recommend them. There were some discoveries on some songs I've known for years, like a chirping sound in a song by How to Dress Well. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com. Published on: Dec 21, 2016 Advertisement

Apple designed the Safari Technology Preview to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari. Safari Technology Preview release 20 includes bug fixes and updates for Visual Viewport, Touch Bar, JavaScript, Web API, Security, CSS, Pointer Lock, Web Inspector, WebCrypto API, and more. The Safari Technology Preview update is available through the Software Update mechanism in the Mac App Store to anyone who has downloaded the browser. Full release notes for the update are available on the Safari Technology Preview website. Apple's goal with Safari Technology Preview is to receive feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. Safari Technology Preview can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download. Tag: Safari Technology Preview 13 comments Top Rated Comments (View all) JoshDoug 2 weeks ago Uh, 419 out of 555 on html5test. How have we gone down from 452 in version 19? Looks like mainly peering (WebRTC etc) isn't passing the tests and that section is weighted quite heavily it seems. It's worth noting that the tests aren't much more than feature detection, so early implementations of features that HTML5Test weights very heavily could cause the score to move drastically between versions, even if the progress of the feature implementation hasn't changed much. Could also be a gnarly regression issue, but this is a preview/beta browser so not a big deal. I'm mostly just guessing here though.

The underlying WebKit2 improvements naturally gets extended within OS X/macOS Sierra which both benefit from it. You also have to take into account that the entire platform has parallel teams working on moving the platform to Swift 4.x.

I'm guessing those changes are what makes this cursory feature test matrix fail. Rating: 2 Votes jvaska 2 weeks ago Wish Apple spent this much effort developing their operating systems. Their OS is pretty good. I think you mean their Mac Pro lineup. But, Apple really needs to sort out their stupid "ecosystem" of Account ID logins for every new service they offer. Why can't we get a single sign-on for iTunes, App Store, iCloud, etc.? There are permissions issues on iOS - like my wifes account has apps that she downloaded but are under my ownership (because iTunes screwed up backups).

Workouts++ Review By John Voorhees Workouts++ by David Smith takes my favorite aspect of Apple’s stock Workout app for watchOS – the ability to quickly start a workout – and adds layers of customization and workout tracking that takes the app to another level altogether. The key to Smith’s watchOS app is the inclusion of an iOS app that lets you customize the real-time statistics tracked on your Apple Watch during a workout and view the data collected in useful ways. The Workouts++ iOS app features a three-tab design. The app defaults to a chronological list of workouts that is color coded by type and includes the date, workout category, duration of your workout, calories burned, and distance covered. The list can be filtered by workout type and duration, and sorted by date, duration, distance, and active calories burned. Workouts are also saved back to Apple’s Activity and Health apps. Tapping on a workout entry in the summary list takes you to a detail view that adds heart rate, speed, and pace data, along with heart rate, pace, and speed graphs. One thing I particularly like about the graphs in Workouts++ is that they provide visual cues where there are gaps in the information collected. For example, if your Apple Watch fails to collect heart rate data for a while during your workout because of a bad connection to your wrist, the app connects the known data points with a thin line to indicate that there was a gap. Workout summary view, workout detail, and lifetime statistics. The Configure tab is where you set up as many custom workout UIs as you’d like for monitoring real-time data on your Apple Watch during workouts. To add a workout, you tap the plus button, pick a workout category, and choose whether it's an indoor or outdoor activity. Workouts++ supports six types of workouts (running, walking, cycling, rowing, elliptical, and stepper) plus ‘Other.’ Tapping on any workout in the Configure tab gives you six highly-customizable watch interface templates for tracking workouts. Each divides the watch face into as many as six rectangular regions that can display any of nine different metrics or graphs. In addition, for each type of data tracked, you can set a target range of values with visual cues using color and haptic feedback that lets you know when you’ve gone beyond your target range. All of the changes you make in the Configure tab are mirrored in the companion watchOS app. Workouts++ lets you customize the layout of real-time statistics tracking on your Apple Watch. The final tab in Workouts++ is Stats, which collects aggregate workout statistics about your workouts. The first three sections of Stats give you a visual view into the relative amount of time you spend doing each type of workout and what day of the week and time of day you workout most. The final two sections display totals and averages for each type of workout you’ve recorded. The layout of the Workouts++ watchOS app is similar to Workout's stack of buttons that start different types of workouts. The difference is that the Workouts++ buttons start the customized tracking you set up in the Workouts++ Configuration tab on your iPhone. Each button includes a small icon that gives you a preview of the watch layout for the workout, which is helpful if you’ve set up multiple interfaces for the same kind of exercise. Tapping one of the buttons starts the workout with a wrist tap to let you know the workout started and switches to a real-time view of the metrics you configured in the iOS app. When you’re finished working out, there are two ways to end a workout. The first is to swipe to the right and tap 'End Workout.' The second is clever. Because swiping on the Apple Watch face can be difficult if your fingers are sweaty, you can turn the Digital Crown instead. The twist of the crown necessary to end a workout is enough that it’s not something that I have accidentally triggered, and it’s an option that I’m sure I’ll find handy when the weather warms up again and I’m running outside. Ending a workout either way provides haptic feedback to let you know the workout has ended and then switches to a summary of your completed workout. There are two ways to end a workout in Workouts++. The number one thing I would like to see added to Workouts++ is a way to manually or automatically pause workouts. I have already run into the situation where I forgot to end a workout when I returned home from a walk. I would also like to see GPS tracking added for outdoor activities like running, cycling, and walking. The good news is that these and swimming workouts are already on Smith’s list of features he's considering for future updates. Tracking workouts is personal. Two people who do the same type of workout are unlikely to have the same goals. One runner may be targeting a certain heart rate, while another is working on hitting a certain pace for an upcoming race. Apple’s Workout app is a good way to get started with tracking workouts, but Workouts++ embraces the differences between people's workout goals by providing ways to monitor the information that is most relevant to them. I’ve been spending time lately thinking about how to record and monitor my health and fitness goals for 2017. I’ve used Apple’s Workout app to track workouts in the past, but I appreciate the level of personalization enabled by Workouts++ and look forward to using it more in 2017 and tweaking my workouts as my goals evolve throughout the year. Workouts++ is available in the App Store for an introductory price of $3.99 until January 2, 2017, after which it will be $4.99.

Apple is also known for encouraging their users to maintain up-to-date devices. Since the release of the latest iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus last September 16 this year, it is worth noting that Apple gives a lot of effort to make its iOS 9 users to upgrade into iOS 10 firmware. According to statistics compiled by research firm Mixpanel, as per Apple Insider, iOS 10 adoption is tracking at 55.29 percent as of September 30, while iOS 9 stands at 43.8 percent. Older iOS version distribution fell to 4.71 percent. The latest update for Apple’s firmware is iOS 10.2 which was released last December 12, but as recent reports suggested, Apple will now stop signing its predecessors, iOS 10.1 and iOS 10.1.1. The update is available as free-over-the air update for all iOS 10 users. Users can also get the update via iTunes. Advertisement The update includes a new app called the “TV” app which is aimed to help simplify the television-watching experience. This Apple-designed TV guide will replace the “Videos” App. The new app will also be able to play all the purchases from iTunes, as per iPhone Hacks. Apple users, however, can have the old “Video” app back from the App Store. It is not only a new “Video” app, the update also include new TV and Videos Widget. Other bug fixes and improvements are also added for the Music App. A lot whole lot of wallpapers and emojis are also in this update. Apparently, Apple stops signing previous versions of their firmware to encourage their users to use its latest version. Users can no longer downgrade to a lower version of the firmware once they updated into the latest version. Public beta testers can also download iOS 10.2.1, a future update of iOS 10.2 and is currently in a beta testing phase. Stay tuned for more exciting updates about Apple iOS 10.2.

We also don’t know what, if any, significant changes 3.1.3 contains. We’re installing the software now, and will be sure to report back if we find anything of note. As always, if you see something interesting in the new beta, feel free to tell us about it in the comments.

To install the update, the Apple Watch must have 50 percent battery, it must be placed on the charger, and it must be in range of the iPhone. watchOS 3.1.3 requires an iPhone running iOS 10 to install. We don't know yet what new features or bug fixes might be included in the watchOS 3.1.3 update, but we'll update this post with any new discoveries. watchOS betas are often rather minor in scale, focusing on small bug fixes and performance improvements rather than major interface changes. The watchOS 3.1.3 beta comes shortly after Apple pulled the watchOS 3.1.1 release after it was found to be bricking some Apple Watch Series 2 devices. Apple has not re-released an updated version of watchOS 3.1.1 that fixes the bug, so many users are still running watchOS 3.1.

Rating: 3 Votes MrGimper 2 weeks ago A lot of people on the original Apple Watch, which is no longer under warranty, seemed to be left SOL after 3.1.1 bricked their watches. I hadn't followed recently, but I wonder if they were able to get their watches repaired without cost. [doublepost=1482351903][/doublepost] I read about 3.1.1 final bricking devices, but not 3.1.1 betas. Rating: 1 Votes BaggieBoy 2 weeks ago Part way through the install on a Series 0, no problem so far. One thing I've noticed (and never seen before) when the progress "ticks" are making their way round the dial, the last mark turns on an off about once a second. Rating: 1 Votes Suckfest 9001 2 weeks ago Although I am on a first day update the HW with the iPhone and the Macs, I do have concerns regarding Apple Watch. I stopped installing Betas on any device, too many problems, too much battery consumption and so on. However the Watch - sacred me when I realised that Apple issues an update, it bricks your device and if it's not under Apple Care - you have to pay for their mistake.... No. They did not and never have charged for firmware flashes, especially when the update is what caused it. Rating: 1 Votes fulles2000 2 weeks ago Hi there! I found a solution to your (and my) problem, in case you haven't found one yet. 1. Delete the already downloaded watchOS update in the Watch app (if you haven't done so already). 2. Force restart your iPhone (hold power- and home-button until the Apple logo appears). 3. Force restart your Watch (hold side button and crown until Apple logo appears). Now, after both devices are powered back up, you should be able to install the app-updates from the Watch app on your phone. Strangely, already updated iPhone apps with Watch apps were not pending automatically for installation - I had to manually start the update/reinstall process. Hope this helps! Best regards, VSG Thanks. It works. Rating: 1 Votes fulles2000 2 weeks ago I'm hoping Apple release this (or at least a fixed version of 3.1.1) very soon. I downloaded 3.1.1 and left it to update overnight. When I got up the next morning there was a message on my iPhone saying it couldn't install because I didn't have an internet connection. Of course the real reason was that Apple had pulled the release. However this means I can no longer install apps on my watch. When I try it says something along the lines of "cannot install app because an OS update is in progress". This wouldn't be the end of the world but apps that are already installed on the watch that have been updated on the iPhone also can't be installed. Therefore even though the app is on the watch my iPhone doesn't think that app is installed on the watch and won't communicate with it. I have a couple of apps that I use very often (Hole 19 & Dark Sky) that I currently cannot use on the watch. I've deleted the 3.1.1 download from the watch and rebooted it but I still can't install or update apps on my watch. I could restore the watch from a backup to see if that solves it but then I would have to set up Apple Pay again and the whole process takes ages. It's really annoying not to be able to use the watch (especially Hole 19 which I use whenever I play golf - which will be several times next week).

Apple has joined the top 10 of the Fortune 500 list of the world's biggest companies for the first time. The Californian tech giant - one of the world's most valuable companies, with a cash pile of around US$215 billion ($311b) - has joined the exclusive list despite reporting a fall in iPhone sales in the last year. Apple's elevation comes as a number of companies in the top 10 have endured a tough year. Other entrants in the list - which is typically dominated by oil companies - have been hit by the low price of oil over the last 18 months, while German car maker Volkswagen has been rocked by an emissions cheating scandal in its diesel vehicles. Walmart - the US retail giant - retained the top spot for the third year in a row, despite its total sales falling in 2015. It has been investing heavily in its stores and in ecommerce in a bid to recapture market share from Amazon. "The world's largest companies took a major step back over the past year," said the editors of the list. "Cumulative sales of the global 500... declined for the first time since 2010. And not by a token amount either. Total revenue shrank from $31.2 trillion in fiscal 2014 to $27.6 trillion in 2015, or a fall of 11.5 per cent. Profits dropped by 11.2 per cent, to $1.48 trillion." Fortune blamed the poor collective showing on a slowdown in the Chinese economy and sluggish growth in the US and Europe. The Fortune 500 ranks companies according to their annual revenues. US firms dominate, with 134 entries, followed by China with 103, and Japan with 52. The Fortune 500 2016 - Top 10 Continued below.

New Headphones’ Batteries Can Ignite If Not Recycled Properly, Breakdown Found By Greg Price @GP_IBTimes On 12/21/16 AT 1:37 PM Close If you’re a devoted Apple product user, who also wants to preserve the environment via recycling, a breakdown of the technology company’s AirPods may pose a conflict of interest and could catch fire. Apple’s new wireless headphones contain small lithium batteries that are glued inside, which makes them “difficult” to recycle, according to private repair parts seller iFixit, Reuters reported Tuesday. Apple, headed by CEO Tim Cook, has faced backlash before over the recyclability of their products and in turn created the Apple Renew Program that allows customers to send back their old products, free of charge, for them to be recycled properly. With the launch of the iPhone 7, which does not have a headphone jack and thus requires a pair of wireless headphones, Apple users will no longer receive the white string headphones that are much easier to recycle, according to Reuters. Usually, the stringed headphones are shredded and then smelted for the copper wires inside. But the AirPods’ three small lithium batteries, including one in each pod and a third in a charging unit, can’t be shredded for fear they may ignite in the process. Related Stories How To Find Apple Stores Stocking AirPods Ireland Fights Against EU Order To Collect Taxes From Apple "They're basically saying this is the future of headphones," iFixit chief executive Kyle Wiens told Reuters. "There could easily be a billion of these things over the next 10 years." Wiens said Apple has sold about 1.4 billion pairs of stringy headphones for its iPhone and iPod, which weigh in at 31 million pounds, meaning as the company switches to all wireless headphones containing these difficult-to-recycle batteries there could be billions of the flammable AirPods around the globe and no way to properly dispose of them unless they are shipped back to Apple. Apple told Reuters that the AirPods can be mailed back for proper recycling. Creating a financial incentive could help Apple recycle the AirPods better. Recently, the Cupertino, California-based company added its Apple Watch to the renew program, but customers won’t be able to receive store credit for turning the watch in for recycling, MacWorld reported Dec. 1.  Usually, if customers turn in an iPhone or MacBook they can receive gift cards, but as of now they can’t when turning in the Apple Watch.

Beta testers who have signed up for Apple's beta testing program will receive the new iOS 10.2.1 beta update over-the-air after installing the proper certificate on their iOS device. Those who want to be a part of Apple's beta testing program can sign up to participate through the beta testing website, which gives users access to both iOS and macOS Sierra betas. Betas are not stable and include many bugs, so they should be installed on a secondary device. It isn't known what features are included in iOS 10.2.1, but as a minor 10.2.x update, it appears to focus on bug fixes and performance improvements rather than major outward-facing changes. No new features were discovered in the first two developer iOS 10.2.1 betas, and we likely won't know the full extent of the changes until the update is released with full release notes.

As I found in my full AirPods review, although the cable-free earbuds get the fundamentals right, you should still expect some frustrations along the way. Luckily, there are a few easy things Apple could do to fix that: read on for my big AirPods complaints, and how they could be addressed. Find My AirPods Unlike Apple’s wired EarPods, which delight in toppling out of my ears within minutes of my putting them in, the AirPods have proved fairly capable at staying in place. I put that down to the slightly changed shape or the earbuds themselves, and the absence of a cable dragging them down. All the same, they’re tiny and present a real risk of loss. Apple will sell you a replacement for $69 apiece, but what would really be nice is a way to avoid losing them in the first place. Some sort of “You’re leaving without your AirPods!” alert if you walk away and leave them on a table is one example, much like Tile and other locators ping you if you’re parted from your keys. However, Apple could go one step further. There’s no GPS, so the traditional “Find My iPhone” feature couldn’t work for the AirPods as-is. However, Bluetooth positioning can be surprisingly accurate these days, particularly if you factor in pinging the location off other Bluetooth-enabled users. That’s how TrackR’s crowd GPS network operates, the dongles automatically pinging in their location whenever another user’s device is nearby. Since Apple has a whole lot more iPhone owners in the wild, you could be pretty confident of not going too far without the AirPods being within range of one. More tap-controls Each AirPod is packed with sensors: that way, the earbud knows if you put it into your ear or take it out, or if you’re double-tapping it to trigger Siri. Unfortunately, right now that’s the only tap-based control you get. Sure, you can switch it in the AirPods settings on your iPhone to toggle play/pause instead, but then you lose everything else that Siri does. What would be useful is a system whereby further tap-commands could be set, preferably with your own sequence of taps. An obvious one would be controlling volume, but if you regularly make calls to the same contacts, you could program that in as a shortcut too. Since the AirPods know whether you’re wearing one or both, the same taps could even do different things depending on if you have a single earbud in or two. Yes, it could get confusing, but that’s why making the whole thing user-customizable is vital. Nobody needs a dozen different tap-commands all with slightly different triggers: you’d end up looking like you were sending Morse code on the side of your face. Still, one or two essentials (which will likely differ for every person) would be welcome for when asking by voice is intrusive, inefficient, or just plain impossible. Free Siri from the tyranny of the internet If Apple is really, really committed to making Siri your guide for navigating everything including the simplest of AirPods controls, it’s time the digital assistant went offline. Currently, even the easiest of instructions – like “skip track” or “lower volume” – have to be sent off to the cloud for processing, before Siri can do anything in response. That presents two big issues. First, there’s the offline problem. If you’re in Airplane Mode or just don’t have a data connection, Siri can’t connect to the cloud. Without that, you can’t control anything from the AirPods themselves (bar physically taking one out of your ear to force your music to pause): instead, you need to pull your iPhone out of your pocket. Even if you’re still connected to the delicious, milky teat of the internet, relying on cloud processing is hardly efficient. Say you want to lower the volume: first, you double-tap an AirPod, wait for the chime to confirm Siri is listening, ask “lower volume,” wait for that instruction to be shuttled off into the ether, get processed, and then finally have the volume decreased, before your music resumes. Suddenly the dedicated volume buttons on most Bluetooth headsets stop feeling like control overload and start looking fairly sensible. Local Siri functionality could address both of these problems. No, it wouldn’t be able to do everything the virtual assistant currently can, but the technology for basic speech recognition done on a phone rather than in the cloud is more than sufficient today for handling play/pause, volume, track navigation, and other fundamentals. It should be faster, too. Make Siri rely less on the screen and more on voice We’re still some way off from the movie Her and the idea of a virtual personal assistant whispering useful things in your ear. Siri, though, does have a few talents she can discreetly muster, though as it stands she prefers to point your attention away from your AirPods and down to your iPhone. That seems a waste. Apple could do worse than look to Amazon’s Alexa. Since the Echo doesn’t have a screen of its own, Amazon avoids directing users to the Alexa app on their phone as much as it can. Instead, the majority of queries are responded to by voice. In an ideal world, you’d be able to use AirPods to get spoken pedestrian navigation directions from Apple Maps, and have text messages read out to you (and respond to them with text-to-speech) as they arrive. Being able to double-tap an AirPod and request an Uber to your current location is another obvious possibility. Really, though, asking you to take your iPhone out to get an answer should be Siri and the AirPods last resort. Wrap-Up Assuming you can find them in stores or online, Apple’s AirPods demonstrate just how simple connecting and managing wireless devices with an iPhone should be. The basics of audio playback are dealt with well, too, and I can’t fault how conveniently they store and charge in their flip-top companion case. It’s a great start, but Apple can’t afford to slow down. NOW READ: Apple AirPods Review The good news is that it wouldn’t take much to polish away the AirPods’ rough edges. Most of it comes down to how Siri behaves and interacts, and for the most part it could all be addressed with software updates, something Apple has a decent track record in pushing out. Today, AirPods aren’t a must-have iPhone accessory, but a few key changes could make all the difference.

By Jake Smith for iGeneration | December 21, 2016 -- 18:30 GMT (10:30 PST) | Topic: Mobility Apple's Tim Cook testified before the Senate Homeland Security Committee's in May 2013. (Image: file photo) Nokia on Wednesday announced a number of patent infringement complaints against Apple in Europe and US courts. 'Mobile phones are our history, not our future': Nokia on where next for hardware Nokia's hardware chief reveals what to expect in health, virtual reality, and the Internet of Things Read More "Since agreeing (to) a license covering some patents from the Nokia Technologies portfolio in 2011, Apple has declined subsequent offers made by Nokia to license other of its patented inventions which are used by many of Apple's products," said Nokia. The lawsuits were filed with the Regional Courts in Dusseldorf, Mannheim and Munich in Germany and the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. There are a total of 32 patents that Nokia said Apple infringed. They cover technologies such as display, user interface, software, antenna, chipsets, and video coding. "Through our sustained investment in research and development, Nokia has created or contributed to many of the fundamental technologies used in today`s mobile devices, including Apple products. After several years of negotiations trying to reach agreement to cover Apple`s use of these patents, we are now taking action to defend our rights," said Ilkka Rahnasto, head of Patent Business at Nokia. Nokia said it plans to file "further action" in other jurisdictions. Trading of Nokia was halted temporarily on Wednesday. We have reached out to Apple for comment. Apple launched an antitrust complaint on Wednesday against Acacia and, in turn, Nokia for the use of "patent assertion entities" to make a grab for excessive license fees. "With its cell phone business dying, Nokia began to seek out willing conspirators and to commence its illegal patent transfer scheme in full force; that scheme has continued in full effect to the present," wrote Apple in its complaint Wednesday. "The driving force behind Nokia's strategy was to diffuse its patent portfolio and place it in the hands of PAEs. Acacia and Conversant were its chief conspirators."

CNBC reports that Nokia has filed several complaints in a lawsuit against Apple over patent infringement in the United States and Germany… StreetInsider.com has additional details: As one of the world’s leading innovators, and following the acquisition of full ownership of NSN in 2013 and Alcatel-Lucent in 2016, Nokia now owns three valuable portfolios of intellectual property. Built on more than EUR 115 billion invested in R&D over the past twenty years, our tens of thousands of patents cover many important technologies used in smartphones, tablets, personal computers and similar devices. Since agreeing a license covering some patents from the Nokia Technologies portfolio in 2011, Apple has declined subsequent offers made by Nokia to license other of its patented inventions which are used by many of Apple’s products. The gist of the complaint appears that be that Nokia owns (in part through acquisitions) patents that it believes are being violated by Apple. Apple apparently disagrees as Nokia says it has tried to reach a licensing deal with the company without any success. Ilkka Rahnasto, head of Patent Business at Nokia, said: “Through our sustained investment in research and development, Nokia has created or contributed to many of the fundamental technologies used in today’s mobile devices, including Apple products. After several years of negotiations trying to reach agreement to cover Apple’s use of these patents, we are now taking action to defend our rights.” Nokia says its complaint includes “32 patents in suit across all of the actions, covering technologies such as display, user interface, software, antenna, chipsets and video coding. Nokia is in the process of filing further actions in other jurisdictions.” Back when Nokia was in the smartphone business a few years ago, the company targeted the iPhone in camera quality: Apple will likely have a response to this breaking news so stay tuned for further reporting.

Register for an Exam Today> Apple's AirPods: So Easy To Wear You'll Forget They're On By Ben Bajarin PUBLISHED: DECEMBER 21 2016 After a delayed start, AirPods finally started appearing in Apple Stores, and inventory quickly sold out in many locations. Before they went on sale, we had quite a bit of information about AirPods and what they were capable of doing. We knew they would pair easily, and that there were sensors built in that knew when you are wearing them and when you weren't. But some things just have to be experienced to appreciate their magic, and AirPods are one of them. First, you will never see a more seamless pairing experience than the first time you pair the AirPods. Open the case, press Connect and they are instantly paired with all your iOS devices, including iPad and Apple Watch. As soon as you put one AirPod in your ear, a subtle sound lets you know they are on and ready to be used. The theme of both of Apple's wearable computers -- Apple Watch and AirPods -- is comfort to the degree of making them feel as though they disappear. Perhaps my favorite feature is when you take one AirPod out, the music automatically pauses. Put it back in, and it resumes flawlessly. This is useful when someone is talking to you and you need an ear free to listen and respond. I have some context with this experience, having used the Plantronics BackBeats Pro 2, which offer a similar smart sensor that pauses your music when you take off the headphones. For whatever reason, I found taking one AirPod out much more convenient than lifting the entire headset off my head. Perhaps just personal preference, perhaps not. In either case, the seamlessness of this experience is fantastic. Whenever you need to know the battery level of the AirPods or the charging case, simply open the case next to your iPhone and this screen instantly pops up. Apple is using some sort of close-proximity solution, because if you move the case even one foot away and open it, nothing happens on the phone. I've been using Bluetooth headphones for years, so the awesomeness that is wireless headphones was not new to me. But these were the first I'd used that are independently wireless - not connected to anything. With sports Bluetooth headphones, you notice and feel the wire on the back of your neck as you move. Similarly, with over-the-ear wireless headphones like the Bose QuietComfort or Beats Wireless, you feel the band that goes over the top of your head. The point is, they don't disappear. I was surprised and delighted by how comfortable the AirPods are in my ears, and how easily you forget they are there. Interestingly, I feel the same way about my Apple Watch. It seems that the theme with both of Apple's wearable computers (and yes I consider the AirPods to be wearable computers) is comfort to the degree of making them feel as though they disappear. This may be ear-shape-dependent, so my statement may not be true of everyone but it is with me. Many others who have tried them have commented on how well they stay in your ears. I found this to be true. I used them while doing light exercises like yoga and even some living-room cardio (via the Apple TV app Zova) and they stayed in perfectly. The lack of a cable makes a difference in helping them stay in your ears. I took it one step further and played a singles tennis match with my playing partner. I'm sure Apple wouldn't recommend them for an intense run or similar activity, but I figured I'd try it. I've tried every form of sport Bluetooth headphones and, because of the wire behind my neck and some of the violent movements of tennis, they all fall out regularly. Here again, not having the wires attached made all the difference in the world. Maybe the AirPods shape fit my ears like a glove - they didn't fall out one time during my match. In case it matters, I'm a fairly high-level (by USTA ranking) tennis player, so I go at it pretty hard. When I was tweeting my thoughts about AirPods, I got resistance from some saying, "Aren't they just wireless headphones?" Apple's AirPods are "just" wireless headphones about as much as the Apple Watch is just a watch and iPhone is just a phone. Nothing makes this more apparent than the Siri experience. Siri in Your Ear It is remarkable how much better Apple's Siri experience is with AirPods, in part because the microphones are much closer to your mouth and, therefore, Siri can more clearly hear and understand you. I'm not sure how many people realize how many Siri failures have to do with the distance you are from your iPhone or iPad, as well as ambient background noise and the device's ability to clearly hear you. Thanks to the beam-forming mics and some bone-conduction technology, Siri with AirPods is about as accurate a Siri experience as I've had. It's remarkable how much better Apple's Siri experience is with AirPods. In fact, in the five days I've been using AirPods extensively, I have yet to have Siri not understand my request. Going further, the noise-canceling built into AirPods is impressive as well. I've intentionally created noisy environments to test AirPods and Siri to see how it handles loud situations. Perhaps the most intense was when I turned my home-theater system to nearly its peak volume, blasted Metallica and activated Siri. Remarkably, it caught every word and processed my request. Furthermore, having Siri right in your ear and available with just a double-tap on the side of either AirPod profoundly changes the experience. In many ways, AirPods deliver on the voice-first interface in the ways I've been impressed with Amazon's Alexa. There is something to not having to look at a screen to interact with a computer, especially in a totally hands-free fashion. The AirPods bring about an experience which feels like Siri has been set free from the iPhone. This was something that enhanced the experience, but also pointed out some holes that I hope Apple addresses. Voice-First Versus Voice-Only Interfaces There is, however, an important distinction to be made where I believe the Amazon Echo shows us a bit more of the voice-only interface, and where I'd like to see Apple take Siri when it is embedded in devices without a screen, like AirPods. The more you use Siri with AirPods, you very quickly realize how much the experience today assumes that you have a screen in front of you. For example, if I use AirPods to activate Siri, and say, "What's the latest news?" Siri will fetch the news and then say, "Here is some news -- take a look." The experience assumes I want to use my screen (or it at least assumes that I have a screen near me to look at) to read the news. Whereas the Amazon Echo and Google Home just start reading the latest news headlines and tidbits. Similarly, when I activate Siri on the AirPods and say, "Play Christmas music," the query processes and then plays. With the Echo, the same request yields Alexa to say, "Okay, playing Christmas music from Top 50 Christmas songs." When you aren't looking at a screen, the feedback is important. If I was to ask that same request while I was looking at my iPhone, you realize, as Siri processes the request, it says, "Okay," on the screen but not in my ear. In voice-only interfaces, we need and want feedback that the request is happening or has been acknowledged. Take the screen away, and things start to get really interesting. This is when new behaviors and new interactions with computers take place. Again, having Siri in your ear and the ability to have a relatively hands-free and screen-free experience broke down when you asked Siri something which required unlocking your phone. For example, one of my most common Siri interactions is to locate a family member, particularly my daughter, who takes a bus home from school that has a variable drop-off time due to traffic or student tardiness. Nearly every day, I ask Siri to locate my daughter. But, when I do so via AirPods and my phone has been off long enough to lock, it says I need to unlock my iPhone first. I hit this wall due to Apple's security protocols, which I appreciate greatly. I wonder if, in the future, we can have a biosensor in AirPods that authenticates with me and thus gives me security clearance to process a secure request like reading email, checking on a family member or other sensitive requests without having to unlock the phone first. There were cases where Siri assumes I can look at my iPhone to deliver the request. There are certainly plenty of queries where Siri, in a voice-only experience, works - when you ask Siri to read your new emails, or set timers, appointments, ask what time a sports game is, etc. - but the sweet spot here will be when you can thoroughly use Siri and not need any screen for the full experience. I'm confident that Apple will increasingly go in this direction. Creating the Siri experience to be more than just voice-first but voice-only will be an important exercise. I strongly believe that when voice exists on a computer with a screen, it will never be the primary interaction input with that screen. Take the screen away, and things start to get really interesting. This is when new behaviors and new interactions with computers take place, and it's what happens when you start to integrate the Amazon Echo or Google Home into your life, as both are voice-first experiences. Looking Ahead There is a great deal to like about AirPods. Those who buy them and use them will be pleasantly surprised and delighted by their performance as wireless headphones, and impressed with the upside of Siri in your ear. I consider the AirPods an important new product in Apple's lineup, and in the same category as the Apple Watch regarding importance for the future. A significant observation of both the Apple Watch and the AirPods worth pointing out: Apple has a tendency to push engineering limits at times to learn or perfect a technique it believes is important for the future, or to learn from it in order to integrate into other products. While iPads and iPhones are getting larger, the Apple Watch and AirPods are pushing the limits of miniaturization. That miniaturization is key when we start thinking about future wearables, where companies will pack tremendous amounts of technology -- sensors, microprocessors, batteries and more -- into extremely small objects and manufacturing them at scale is an incredibly important skill set to develop for the future. © 2017 Re/Code under contract with NewsEdge.

Nokia's lawsuit stems from a disagreement between Apple and Nokia over licensing fees for Nokia technology. Apple this morning filed an antitrust lawsuit against several patent assertion entities that it claims are attempting to collect excessive fees for Nokia patents through lawsuits and royalty demands. According to Apple, Nokia's failing cellphone business has prompted Nokia to transfer patents to patent assertion entities to get out of FRAND (Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory) licensing deals it established for essential patents, allowing the company to collect higher royalties. From Apple's complaint: With its cell phone business dying, Nokia began to seek out willing conspirators and to commence its illegal patent transfer scheme in full force; that scheme has continued in full effect to the present. The driving force behind Nokia's strategy was to diffuse its patent portfolio and place it in the hands of PAEs. Acacia and Conversant were its chief conspirators.Nokia's own patent infringement complaint against Apple claims that Apple has declined to establish licensing deals for Nokia technology that is used in Apple products. Ilkka Rahnasto, head of Patent Business at Nokia, said: "Through our sustained investment in research and development, Nokia has created or contributed to many of the fundamental technologies used in today's mobile devices, including Apple products. After several years of negotiations trying to reach agreement to cover Apple's use of these patents, we are now taking action to defend our rights."Nokia has filed lawsuits in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas and Dusseldorf, Mannheim and Munich in Germany. The lawsuits cover 32 patents that cover technologies including display, user interface, software, antenna, chipsets, and video coding. Nokia says additional actions are to come. Update: Nokia today filed additional patent lawsuits against Apple in Asia, Europe, and the United States. As of today, Nokia has filed 40 patent suits in 11 countries. Update 2: Apple is now suing Nokia itself as the legal battle continues to escalate. Apple has added Nokia Corporation, Nokia Solutions and Networks Oy, and Nokia Technologies Oy to the list of defendants in its aforementioned antitrust case against several patent assertion entities that have sued Apple over Nokia patents.

The courts will decide who is right. Rating: 24 Votes jk76 2 weeks ago I'll be waiting breathlessly for the final verdict in July, 2032, when the term "mobile phone" will seem quaint or archaic. I might be a bit too dry, but seriously... Nokia is a company in networking business, in control of significant portions of patent pools and R&D of Nokia (eh), Siemens, Motorola and Alcatel-Lucent in cellular networks. Without the research they put in the subject, there would be much less of anything those iPhones could use to communicate. They are one of the behemoths of telecom technologies in the background, along with Ericsson and Huawei. These companies are not a joke; they are building blocks of our current society. Sure, Apple would want to be let to take advantage of their research for free. I have been professionally involved with most of these companies over my career. I have also been involved with several central companies without which Macs wouldn't be possible - and also defence companies making existence of Western democracies a real thing. The amount of interest these companies put on research is central to our modern societies, and it costs real money. Nonetheless, only expectation on this forum is some sort of a poop-throwing festivity. Amount of fixation on a single company, in good or bad, on this forum is absurd. Let's put it straight: no company has a chance to survive purely on its own. This especially applies to markets such as telecommunications and microelectronics. Apple is reliant on hundreds of companies to make a single working product on these markets. Nokia is really one of those companies that has put - even conservatively speaking - tens of billions on R&D which has benefited Apple. What's the moral high ground choosing to unquestionably defend Apple on this case? Rating: 16 Votes tooltalk 2 weeks ago Third parties have commented ('http://www.fosspatents.com/2015/05/privateering-lets-name-and-shame.html') on the deplorable practices taken by Nokia and it's PAEs before, this isn't exactly a new scenario. It sounds like Apple just decided that enough is enough; considering the lawsuit they filed is about antitrust allegations, they're obviously trying to bust the whole system open. This is the exact tactic Apple had tried to use against Android with their Rockstar Consortium -- until Google successfully convinced the court that Apple was orchestrating it behind the curtain and moved the case from TX to CA. Why is it ok when Apple does it, but "deplorable" when someone else does it?

Worlds largest networking technology company who owns Alcatel and Bell labs (ever heard about that?). Most of the technology used by cell phones has been developed by Nokia. Maybe you tried to be edge about the old Nokia phones which were sold to Microsoft but that ain't the same company anymore. [doublepost=1482401645][/doublepost] Nokia still exists? Check your facts. Old Nokia phones <> Nokia 2016. [doublepost=1482401789][/doublepost] Since Nokia can't make a decent smart phone they buy up patients and then sue the like of Apple to make money. Maybe Apple should just buy Nokia :) They are not buying patents. They create them. Your iPhone would not work without them or any other cell phone or network in world. http://www.prime-patent.com/nokia-patent-portfolio/ (I'm so ****ing tired of Apple fanboys with blind faith and zero knowledge.

It's been shown time and again that Apple tries to strong arm these negotiations and are often successful. Then they complain when someone else does it back. Nokia might not be the giant it once was, but they definitely spent time, money and resources for years on developing tech we all take for granted today. As someone who worked in the industry once upon a time ago, they are entitled to their cut.

We couldn't end 2016 without one last iPhone rumor, could we? The latest reports suggest Apple will introduce three new iPhone models in 2017, including a high-end model codenamed Ferrari. It will reportedly include an AMOLED screen for an edge-to-edge experience, as well as an internal redesign, according to Chinese tech site cnBeta, which cites Apple manufacturing documents. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo in March hinted at Apple's move from LCD displays to the more power-efficient AMOLED. In line with that prediction, the latest leaks tip a bigger screen packed into same-size frames, indicating a bezel-less front. Next year's smartphones, meanwhile, may also feature a divided motherboard. As AppleInsider reports, the circuit card will be split in two pieces—one for operating elements, the other for Wi-Fi and cellular components—connected by a "soft cable," cnBeta said in a translated report. A two-tier motherboard might help save space, as would Cupertino's idea to relocate the SIM card tray to the bottom of the handset, AppleInsider adds. Related Human Life Requires 26 Essential Elements, an iPhone Requires 75 Human Life Requires 26 Essential Elements, an iPhone Requires 75 Apple did not immediately respond to PCMag's request for comment. MacRumors last month suggested Apple will ship its next iPhone in an all-glass casing; the switch from metal to glass allows for wireless charging, and the potential to use the device without ever plugging it in. That prediction comes from Kuo, who also believes that Pegatron—not Foxconn, as previously reported—will be the exclusive supplier of Apple's wireless charger.

A boy carries a bag used to transport cobalt-laden dirt and rock at Musompo, a mineral market outside Kolwezi, Congo  (Michael Robinson Chavez / The Washington Post)   By Peter Whoriskey Todd C. FrankelThe Washington Post Wed., Dec. 21, 2016 Separate groups of the world’s leading technology companies are launching two initiatives to curb “the worst forms of child labour” and other abusive practices in the supply chain for cobalt, a key ingredient in lithium-ion batteries that power smartphones, laptops and electric cars. About 60 per cent of the world’s cobalt originates in the Congo, where hand-dug mines rife with dangers attract legions of poorly-equipped, “artisanal” miners who work for as little as $2 a day Apple, HP, Samsung SDI, and Sony have joined an effort, known as the Responsible Cobalt Initiative. It is being led by a Chinese business group, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce for Metals, Minerals & Chemicals, and supported by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), according to the group. Members of the initiative pledged to follow OECD guidelines for mining supply chains, which call for companies to trace how cobalt is being extracted, transported, manufactured and sold. Any abuses would require immediate correction. While advocacy groups have alleged for years that cobalt was posing deadly risks to miners and causing environmental damage, eradicating the worst abuses has proven difficult because tracing cobalt in consumers products back to the mines involves global leaps — from Africa to China to world markets — and across many companies. Article Continued Below The Washington Post earlier this year published an investigation detailing abuses in Congo’s artisanal cobalt supply chain, showing how miners — including children — worked in dangerous, at times deadly conditions as they tunnelled hundreds of feet underground for dollars a day to reach this precious mineral. The article also showed the potential health effects, including birth defects, that medical researchers have begun to connect to the mining activity. The Post for the first time connected this troubling artisanal cobalt trade with the batteries used by some of the world’s largest technology companies, including Apple. Apple acknowledged that this cobalt has made its way into some of its batteries and said it was committed to working with its supplier to addressing underlying issues, such as extreme poverty, that result in harsh work conditions and child labour. The role of the Chinese business organization in the new initiative is considered a key advantage — the bulk of the supply chain runs through that country. Several companies with key roles in refining and packaging the mineral for batteries have joined the initiative, including Zhejiang Huayou, a Chinese company that buys cobalt from Congo miners. “The problem cannot be fixed by one company. So I think it’s great, surprising even, that so many companies have come together,” said Bryce Lee, Huayou’s new manager for responsible sourcing. The new initiative is “a very positive sign of change, “ said Tyler Gillard, project head for the OECD. “Such strong involvement of Chinese industry in particular is uncommon for these types of initiatives, and really exciting.” Collectively, the group is aiming to promote co-operation with the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Separately, a business group known as The Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition announced a new “Responsible Raw Materials Initiative.” The EICC said companies need to expand scrutiny of their supply chains beyond the traditional four “conflict” minerals covered by U.S. legislation — tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold. These minerals, when taken from the Congo region, receive extra attention because of potential ties to funding militias. The EICC said the decision to begin looking at other minerals was motivated by “a growing body of research” — including work by advocacy groups and The Post — that showed abuses occurred in the production of other minerals, too. Bob Mitchell, EICC vice president for social and environmental responsibility, said one of the minerals the initiative is considering is cobalt from Congo. The EICC announced its new “Responsible Raw Materials Initiative” last month, just before the start of a United Nations forum on business and human rights. Membership in the EICC includes Apple, Dell, Foxconn, Ford Motors and other companies, and at least 16 EICC-member companies have signed pledges to support the new initiative, Mitchell said. About 100,000 cobalt miners in Congo use hand tools to dig hundreds of feet underground with little oversight and few safety measures.  (Michael Robinson Chavez)   Exactly what to do about the artisanal mining of cobalt is a matter of heated debate. The practice is rife with dangers. On the other hand, it also helps desperately poor people to make a living, particularly in the rural areas of the DRC. Some long-standing critics of the cobalt supply chain view the Responsible Cobalt Initiative merely as a good first step. “Implementation is obviously what it’s all about,” said Mark Dummett, an Amnesty researcher who has studied the cobalt supply chains. “We’d now like to see the downstream companies like Apple and Samsung disclose the names of their cobalt smelters as well as disclose the risks they have identified in their supply chains.” Companies said a collective effort such as this is required to eradicate any abuses in the cobalt supply chain. “HP recognizes that in order to build leverage over supply chain actors that we do not have a direct business relationship with, we need to work with other companies and organizations to drive collective action,” Jay Celorie, HP Global Program Manager, Human Rights, Ethics and Compliance, said in a statement. Other companies, such as Tesla and LG Chem, said they are weighing membership in the Responsible Cobalt Initiative or undertaking other ways of ensuring that their supply chains are clean and humane. “We are evaluating a number of new international initiatives to address the issues in cobalt production and are working quickly to determine how Tesla can be most effectively involved,” a Tesla spokesperson said in a statement. Other industry groups are responding to complaints about the cobalt supply chain, too. Last week, Umicore, a large Brussels-based maker of battery parts and other cobalt products, announced that the auditing firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers had validated the safeguards it has in place to prevent the use of any cobalt arising from questionable environmental or labour practices. Among other things, the company seeks to be able to trace the origins of every bit of cobalt that goes into its products. Company officials said that seeking the third-party validation of their cobalt procedures should ease the concerns of the consumer companies that are their customers. “Our customers have valuable brands to protect,” said Marc Van Sande, executive vice-president of a company business unit said. This “approach provides comfort to customers about the provenance and the ethical nature of the cobalt used in the materials they source.” Read more about: Africa The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

The company isn't telling but a reported leak might. A user on Chinese site Sina Weibo leaked what's claimed to be two manufacturing documents for the iPhone 8. The documents, which reportedly come from Apple's supply chain, make reference to three models — D20, D21, and D22. As noted by AppleInsider, the person claims Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus came with the D10 and D20 moniker, however, so it's unclear why the company would use the same in the iPhone 8. Regardless, the leak contends the highest-end version is called "Ferrari," Twith the D20 and D21 versions delivering only modest upgrades and could be known as the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. MORE: iPhone 8 Rumors: What to Expect from the 10th Anniversary iPhone That means the big update for 2017 will come in the form of Ferrari. And according to the leaker, the manufacturing specs suggest the version will deliver an OLED screen and come with the long-rumored edge-to-edge design. Other high-end features planned for this Ferrari model include wireless charging and an invisible home button, which will likely move to under the display. All of these features have been floated in previous iPhone 8 rumors. Apple also apparently wants a new internal design for the phone that separates the logic board into separate units — one with the processor and storage, the other with the Wi-Fi and cellular parts. This drawing, reportedly from leaked iPhone 8 documentation shows how the phone's internal parts would be rearranged. (Image from Weibo.com)More This drawing, reportedly from leaked iPhone 8 documentation shows how the phone's internal parts would be rearranged. (Image from Weibo.com)This isn't the first time we've heard that the iPhone will come in three different models. KGI Securities analyst Ming-chi Kuo raised that idea last month. And this latest leak echos a rumor floated on Japanese site Macoctakara that Apple was planning to release modest iPhone 7s and 7s Plus updates alongside a more substantial iPhone model in 2017. Apple, of course, hasn't commented on its future plans and won't even say that another iPhone is coming next year. However, the 2017 iPhone will be the 10th anniversary of the company's handset and with the iPhone 7 replicating the design of 2015's iPhone 6s, speculation abounds that Apple has something big up its sleeve for next year.

Nokia's lawsuits, filed in courts in Dusseldorf, Mannheim and Munich, Germany, and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, cover patents for displays, user interfaces, software, antennas, chipsets and video coding. "Since agreeing a license covering some patents from the Nokia Technologies portfolio in 2011, Apple has declined subsequent offers made by Nokia to license other of its patented inventions which are used by many of Apple's products," Nokia said in a statement. Apple on Tuesday had taken legal action against Acacia Research Corp (ACTG.O) and Conversant Intellectual Property Management Inc [GEGGIM.UL], accusing them of colluding with Nokia to extract and extort exorbitant revenues unfairly from Apple. "We’ve always been willing to pay a fair price to secure the rights of patents covering technology in our products," said Apple spokesman Josh Rosenstock. "Unfortunately, Nokia has refused to license their patents on a fair basis and is now using the tactics of a patent troll to attempt to extort money from Apple by applying a royalty rate to Apple’s own inventions they had nothing to do with." Acacia and Conversant did not immediately respond to requests for comment, and Nokia was not immediately available to comment on the Apple lawsuit. The legal action by Nokia and Apple appear to mark a revival of the "smartphone patent wars" that began five years ago, when Apple filed a series of patent infringement cases against Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) around the world, with wins and losses on both sides. Apple's lawsuit against Acacia, Conversant and Nokia was filed only one day after Ottawa-based Conversant named Boris Teksler as its new chief executive. He had worked as Apple's director of patent licensing and strategy from 2009 to 2013, the latter half of his tenure overlapping with the lawsuits against Samsung. Acacia is a publicly traded patent licensing firm based in Newport Beach, California. One of its subsidiaries sued Apple for patent infringement and was awarded $22 million by a Texas jury in September. Similarly, Conversant, which claims to own thousands of patents, announced last week that a Silicon Valley jury had awarded one of its units a $7.3 million settlement in an infringement case against Apple involving two smartphone patents. Nokia, once the world's dominant cellphone maker, missed out on the transition to smartphones triggered by Apple's introduction of the iPhone in 2007. The Finnish company sold its handset business to Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) two years ago, leaving it with its telecom network equipment business and a bulging portfolio of mobile equipment patents. But this year, Microsoft sold its Nokia-feature phone business to a new company called HMD Global. Nokia agreed to a 10-year licensing deal with HMD, which continues to market low-cost Nokia phones and plans to introduce new Nokia smartphone models next year.

Nicole Lee, @nicole 12.21.16 in Mobile Comments 1553 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Reuters Nokia announced today that it has sued Apple for patent infringement in Germany and the US. According to the suit, Apple did agree to license a few Nokia patents in 2011, but has declined offers since then. "Through our sustained investment in research and development, Nokia has created or contributed to many of the fundamental technologies used in today's mobile devices, including Apple products," said Ilkka Rahnasto, Nokia's head of Patent Business, in a statement. The suit was filed in Regional Courts in Dusseldorf, Mannheim and Munich in Germany and the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. A total of 32 patents are involved and cover a range of technologies that include everything from the display and user interface to chipsets and video encoding. Apple is no stranger to patent infringement lawsuits. It paid $24.9 million in a Siri patent lawsuit earlier this year and $625 million in a Facetime patent lawsuit as well. Of course, it's had the occasional victory too, like when it sued Samsung for patent infringements and won.

Beta testers who have signed up for Apple's beta testing program will receive the 10.12.3 macOS Sierra beta through the Software Update mechanism in the Mac App Store. Those who want to be a part of Apple's beta testing program can sign up to participate through the beta testing website, which gives users access to both iOS and macOS Sierra betas. Betas should not be installed on a primary machine due to the potential for instability. According to Apple's release notes, the 10.12.3 update "improves the stability, compatibility, and security of your Mac." No specific changes, bug fixes, or feature additions were discovered in the first two developer betas.

Even if they changed the most minute of things, they still should list it. I don't wanna see that it improves system stability and fixes bugs. I wanna know what bugs it fixes and how it improves system security. It seems like I update my mac every week, and each time it takes like 20 minutes, and comes out the other side completely unchanged. What is the point of a beta program then? Rating: 2 Votes C DM 1 week ago When is it expected to be generally released? I'm hoping it fixes this issue on or before Jan 5. Otherwise, I will have consider returning my machine. //forums.macrumors.com/threads/2nd-mbp-ntb-with-display-issues-what-to-do.2021948/ No real expectations. That said, with it being the holiday season, more than likely nothing will happen as far as any final public releases before Jan. 5, and likely some weeks after that.
