That's a solid performance for a product line introduced less than two years ago. By any commercial standard it is a success. Rolex remains the leading watchmaker and is likely to stay on top for now. In Apple's recent Q1 financial report, Tim Cook said the Watch had its best ever quarter. He says Apple struggled to meet demand. The rest of the so-called 'smartwatch' market doesn't come close. Android Wear watchmakers have been slow to update their models. Lenovo abandoned the market. Pebble sold its watch business. There have been stories saying the smartwatch market is dead. Away from the Apple Watch that's a fair description. I stopped wearing the first Apple Watch after a traumatic introduction. More recently I've tried newer models; one with a nylon strap1 another with leather. Whenever I write about the Apple Watch I hear from people who love them or love other smartwatches. I'm not keen. For the most part I find them annoying and difficult to live with. They don't add anything to my productivity or make life more fun. Watch fans tell me they like the notifications. If anything they are what I like least of all. They are a distraction. They interrupt my concentration with constant incoming wrist taps or bleeps2. But that's me and how I work. You may feel otherwise. My other gripe is the frequent charging. A Watch lasts about a day. That means it needs recharging overnight. On a few occasions I found I placed on the charger in a way that meant there was no charge the next day. If I left the Watch at home, it didn't make a difference to me. The one area where the Apple Watch shines is fitness tracking. I found it useful when the Watch told to get off my chair every hour. Getting those activity bars all the way around the clock face became a daily goal. It made me walk more and be more aware of exercise. Despite that, I'm not going to buy a Watch. Much of the time I wear a scruffy old Swatch on my left wrist. It needs a new strap and does nothing other than let me know the time. Sure, I can get that from my phone which is never more than a metre or two away. But I've 50 years of muscle memory looking at the wrist. By a curious coincidence Mac NZ's Mark Webster has written a similar blog post. Apple Watch a winner but not for me was first posted at billbennett.co.nz. Apple calls them bands. You can, of course, disable notifications. It's possible to turn some or all off. Yet that undermines the point of a smartwatch. If you don't use notifications, what is the reason for having one? © Scoop Media Bill Bennett New Zealand technology news Bill Bennett publishes technology news and features that are directly relevant to New Zealand readers.

The report shows a major shift in the market, Apple has become the top global smartphone vendor after 8 years. The last time when Apple held this position was in Q4 2014, when its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus managed to generate massive sales for the company. It seems that the latest iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were the flagships that drove Apple’s market share up to 17.9%, compared to Samsung’s 17.8% in Q4 last year. Apple’s phones saw high demand in most mature markets like Korea, North America and Western Europe, where sales of Samsung devices were greatly affected by the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco. Apple managed to sell by just 256,000 units more than Samsung and it would be interesting to see if the Cupertino company will hold its leading position in this year’s last quarter after both companies ... » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Ingraham Media Group - Affiliate - 1 week ago< > Embed Apple Reclaims Smartphone Market 00:48 For the first time since 2011, Apple rose to the top of the smartphone industry — here's why.

Shows Good Morning America Good Morning America World News Tonight World News Tonight Nightline Nightline 20/20 20/20 This Week This Week Live Watch iPhone App Starts Your Car Remotely By KI MAE HEUSSNER NED POTTER LIAM BERKOWITZ Oct. 15, 2009 0 Shares Email Star Directed Electronics/ABC News Photo Illustration Like something out of a James Bond movie, a new iPhone application promises to remotely unlock, start and warm your car. 0 Shares Email Just when you thought developers had exhausted the iPhone's potential to impress, here comes another: An application that promises to remotely unlock, start and warm your car from almost anywhere in the world. Called Viper SmartStart, the app was launched earlier this week by Directed Electronics, a vehicle security and remote start systems designer, and can be downloaded for free from Apple's App store. Using an existing remote car starting system from Viper, with a tap of a few buttons on your iPhone, your car can be started, warmed up and humming, just waiting for you to hit the road. Although remote starting systems for cars usually have a limited line-of-sight range, Viper says its system has "virtually unlimited range" since your iPhone, not the original remote, communicates over cell networks with your car. "We think customers will find all sorts of unique and personal value in Viper SmartStart," Mike Simmons, EVP of Directed Electronics' parent company, DEI Holdings, said in a statement. "Whether helping out her husband, who's locked his keys in the car, or securely locking her keys and purse in the car while she takes a jog with some music on her iPhone, we expect to hear about some uses we never anticipated." Once the Viper SmartStart hardware is professionally installed in the car, the iPhone can also be used to defrost windows, cool down the vehicle in warmer weather, unlock the trunk or activate a panic alarm. But though the app is free, the hardware that will actually make it work with your car is quite pricey. The system will only work if paired with one of two Viper SmartStart systems that go for $499 (for those who don't already have a remote start system) and $299 (for those who do have remote start). The first year of service is free but, subsequently, service is $29.99 a year. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. There are thousands of applications -- from the silly to the serious -- for wireless handheld devices. Here is a sampling: App Turns iPhone Into 'Sleaze Detector' Sleaze ball or sweetheart? A new iPhone app claims it can help singles tell the difference. Launched in September by information commerce firm Intelius, Date Check lets users perform instant background checks on potential dates from their mobile phones. Once it's downloaded on an iPhone, the application only needs a name or cell phone number to search publicly available records. If you activate the app's Sleaze Detector, it scans criminal records to determine if anyone with that name has been charged with drug possession, assault and battery, sex crimes, DUI and other offenses. If you click Net Worth, it looks for information about home ownership and property value. It can also check social networking sites, such as LinkedIn to provide employment and education information. "Date Check is like having a private investigator in your purse," John Arnold, co-founder of Intelius and executive vice president of business development, said in a statement. "Letting a stranger into your life is a huge risk, and in the age of Internet anonymity, a simple online search isn't enough to tell you everything you need to know. " This application, the company said, "gives singles a safer way to mingle." But though the app itself is free, the services can cost up to $40, depending on the kind of searches that are selected. Date Check is available for download in Apple's App store and will be available soon in Android and BlackBerry versions. PUMA Index Tracks Stocks With Stripping Models You've probably heard of the Dow, the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ 100. But try this financial index on for size: The PUMA. To celebrate its new line of bodywear, sports clothing company PUMA launched an iPhone application earlier this month that tracks global stocks, but not in the way you might think. As stocks on the Dow Jones industrial average go up and down, so does one key element on the PUMA models: their clothes. "Think of it as an entertaining antidote to Wall Street woes," the company said in a statement. "So now if you lose your shirt, at least our models do too." Though the application might make Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke blush, the models only undress down to their new PUMA threads. As the Dow climbs, the clothes come back on. The PUMA application is free in Apple's App store, and the company says it can even help save consumers money. Showing the downloaded application to a PUMA sales associate can get you a 20 percent discount. That offer lasts until Nov. 8, 2009. App Find Medicinal Marijuana Providers Smoking marijuana is known to have an adverse effect on memory and concentration, but now, thanks to a new iPhone application, even the foggiest of users should be able to locate their connection -- make that medicinal marijuana provider -- with relative ease. Launched by AJNAG (Activists Justifying the Natural Agriculture of Ganja), a Web-based community advocating for medical marijuana, the Cannabis app takes those seeking medicinal marijuana through the entire process of obtaining it. The app is downloadable from Apple's store for $2.99. "Our goal is to put the power of cannabis change in your pocket while you enjoy the most sticky and potent iPhone application available!" the founders say in a statement on their Web site. Here's how it works. The application displays an interactive map dotted with doctors who can prescribe medicinal marijuana treatment for their patients. It also shows -- after, presumably, users have procured prescriptions -- the medicinal marijuana suppliers within the users' vicinity. And, what's more, the application includes a database of lawyers who specialize in marijuana-related cases, in should users encounter skeptical local authorities. To help with grassroots media campaigning, the developers also say they will donate 50 cents for every "Cannabis" purchase to a non-profit reform fund, which they say will be set up once the application reaches 1,000 subscriptions. Just remember -- Cannabis only works in states where marijuana has been legalized, so if you've scored tickets to a Grateful Dead show in, say, Alabama, don't expect Cannabis to help you score anything else. Craving Pizza? Just Download the App In a move sure to thrill its laziest customers, Pizza Hut unveiled recently its new iPhone application that allows users to order pizza without so much as dialing a number. Simply type in your order, then sit back and wait until it arrives. For those bored with the traditional methods of ordering pizza, the app also has some unconventional tools. If you want extra sauce on your wings, for instance, you shake the phone like a bottle. And, for those who find ordering pizza too sober a task, the app comes with a racing game named "Hut Racer." Pizza Hut hopes the app will appeal to customers who rely on their iPhones, said Brian Niccol, Pizza Hut's chief marketing officer. "As more of our customers are integrating the iPhone and iPod touch into their everyday lives, Pizza Hut wants to be right there with them," Niccol said in a statement. "As a longtime category leader in innovation, creating an App Store application is just one more way we are helping customers place orders in a way that best fits their mobile lifestyle." Hard of Hearing? Just Grab Your iPhone People don't normally equate the iPhone with medical innovation, but with the June release of an application that doubles as a hearing aid, they may have to reconsider. The application, which is called soundAMP, is made by Ginger Labs, a California-based software applications developer, and is available in the iTunes store for $9.99. Though it's not an actual hearing aid, soundAMP achieves a similar effect. Users just launch the application and then plug in a pair of earphones. The application takes in sound from a microphone (be it built-in, in a headset or from elsewhere) and then amplifies and filters it. Then you can adjust the volume to your liking with a slider on the touchscreen. You also can replay five or 30 seconds by tapping the appropriate button on the screen. Hearing aids often may be associated with the more mature, but soundAMP's developers insist their product is age neutral -- of equal value to the octogenarian hard of hearing and the college student stuck in the back of a large lecture class. (As a caveat, if you really are losing your hearing, you should probably visit a doctor -- soundAMP may be novel, but medically certified it is not.) RunPee Helps Moviegoers With Bathroom Breaks Soda. Coffee. Water. Next time to you go to the movies, chug 'em all down. As long as you have a new iPhone app by your side, you'll know when you can escape to the bathroom without missing the best parts. Approved by Apple's App store in early July, RunPee (yes, really) promises to be the small-bladdered moviegoer's best friend. The application features all the movies currently playing in theaters and tells users approximately how far into the movie each "pee time" begins, the cue line to listen for and even what they've missed. (When you're on your way back to your seat, you can hit a button to unscramble text that provides a short synopsis.) "The idea came from watching King Kong the re-make in 2005," said Dan Florio, RunPee's creator, referring to Peter Jackson's marathon three-hour blockbuster. Throughout much of the movie, he said, he was desperate to relieve himself. "I kept thinking, I wish they would just kill this ape so that I could get to the men's room," he said. Like a good fan, he waited until the end, but not without noting a good three-minute sequence he could have done without. "I just could have gone to the men's room during the scene and I could have enjoyed the end of the movie and the movie would have been better," the Orlando, Fla. developer said. When he walked out of the theater and saw the lines of people waiting to get into the theater, he wanted to share his secret. But being a bit bashful, he kept it to himself. The idea stayed in remission until August 2008, when he launched RunPee.com. He said he's watched about 80 percent of the movies to scout out the best "pee times," but added his family has helped. And anyone who's interested can submit ideas to the site. In January of this year, he partnered with brothers John and Sam Shahidi, and Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Jordan Palmer, to work on the iPhone app. Download figures aren't available yet, but Florio said traffic to the site has jumped from about 30 unique visitors a day last year to about 3,500 visitors a day. Although the app is only available for iPhone owners in the U.S., John Shahidi said the plan is to expand to India, China and Australia. Dunkin' Donuts Goes High-Tech Thanks to the iPhone, coffee runs are now easier than ever. In June, Dunkin' Donuts launched an application for the iPhone and Web that helps organize and automate group orders. Using their computers and mobile devices, customers can initiate orders through 'Dunkin' Run' and alert friends and colleagues that they are willing to be the "Runner." Each member of the group can add their order to the list and then the Runner can print the choices or use the iPhone to create a checklist so that when they get to the store, they don't miss anyone's order. The app doesn't yet transmit the order to the local donut shop. "We conceived of Dunkin' Run as a social application that helps hard-working Americans stay slightly more productive," said Baba Shetty, Hill Holliday's Chief Media Officer. "It's based on the idea of reciprocity -- I'll get your coffee today and hopefully you'll get mine tomorrow -- in a way that perfectly complements the 'we're in it together' ethos of the Dunkin' Donuts brand." Smart Phone Applications Keep You in Check Booty Caller So you're late again. You're a woman with a busy career but you're newly married and you have hopes for a family, too. You're trying to get to a meeting when you hear the familiar ping of your cell phone, telling you a text message has arrived. You open it: "Your fertile window opens today and lasts five more days," it says. "Stress can get in the way of conception, so relax and get a massage, meditate or take a yoga class." The text you just received is from -- yes, this is its real name -- Booty Caller. The app is free, offered by a parenting Web site called BabyCenter.com. Do you really want a text to remind you this might be a good time for sex? It may not be your idea of spontaneous fun, but its makers say it may well help you squeeze some fun -- and a new baby as well -- into an overscheduled life. "Booty Caller is definitely a sign of the times," Linda Murray, the editor-in-chief of BabyCenter.com, wrote in an e-mail. Her site, she said, "set out to create a tool that would provide fertility information as well as tips on getting pregnant in fun, digestible text messages." ScanLife Look around -- through magazines, at store displays, on kids' T-shirts -- and you may see small, square black-and-white patches that remind you of bar codes. They serve much the same purpose. The idea comes from Scanbuy, a New York firm that hopes the little so-called EZcodes will become ubiquitous. "We've been at it for a while," said Jonathan Bulkeley, the CEO of Scanbuy Inc., "and the idea's been the same: making it easier for you to navigate using the camera on your phone, instead of the keypad on your phone." Point your camera phone at, say, an ad for running shoes, and your phone's screen will quickly show you a Web site with specs and user reviews. Point the phone at the code on a kid's shirt, and you're directed straight to his or her Facebook page. Bulkeley said he can see countless other uses: How about a marker, for instance, on the wrapper for a head of lettuce that tells you how long ago it was picked from the field? He has even seen a code on a grave marker that lets you read about the life of the person to whom you're paying respects. Financer Picture yourself in the store, intrigued by the pair of running shoes you checked out via Scanbuy. But can you afford them? Financer is a portable electronic ledger, a way for you to keep track of your money, no matter where you are. "Financer is one of our most popular applications; and we've seen an increase in demand since the recession," said David Becker, CEO of its maker, dBelement. The screen of your iPhone takes on the look of a checkbook ledger, the same thing you used a generation ago, except that it does the math for you. Your account's a bit thin; maybe you'd better hold off on the shoes. And ... Here's to Your Health iFitness So you can't afford those Nikes? For $1.99 (a lot of these programs have similar prices at the Apple App Store), iFitness will suggest workout routines to keep you in shape. Flabby arms? Touch "arms" on the menu and find the best exercises. Worried about your abs? The program will suggest a routine. It will also keep you honest. You can keep a log of what you've done, get an idea of your progress and, if you don't like it, you can try Fit Phone. Or, if you're like so many of us when it comes to New Year's resolutions, you can stop and feel guilty. In which case, you may want to download ... Fast-Food Calorie Counter This is an app for those of us who choose to drown our sorrows with a burger and fries. Tap in any of 4,700 items from 41 chains and it will tell you the calorie count, amount of fat, number of carbs and everything else you need to know to go back and buy those running shoes. It's $2.99 via Apple from Concrete Software. And last but not least... Thousands of Apps Make Hectic Life a Whole Lot Easier Breath-Test Device for your iPod, iPhone Perhaps one of the more ambitious app/devices out there, iBreath is a breath-test device that attaches to your iPhone or iPod. Users blow into the iBreath and a readout of their blood-alcohol content appears on the phone's screen. "All kinds of people are using it," said developer Don Bassler, CEO of David Steele, the iBreath's manufacturer. "Parents of kids, college students, wives for husbands, boyfriends for girlfriends. The demographic starts dubiously as low as 16, but is basically the 18 to 50 crowd." The iBreath debuted at Christmas and, according to Bassler, the company has sold thousands of the $79.99 devices. Of course, even though we think these seven apps can go a long way in terms of making a hectic life a bit easier, mentioning these particular apps does not necessarily constitute an endorsement of them. Each has many competitors, and you're invited to weigh in with suggestions in our comments section. Many apps have features you will love or hate, and the only way to find out for sure is to try them for yourself.

Apple’s iPhone 8 to Ditch Home Button in Favor of Virtual Capacitive Buttons GO The next-generation iPhone will use virtual buttons Feb 16, 2017 08:19 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Apple is expected to make major design changes to its iPhone 8 or X, the phone that will mark the ten-year anniversary since the first iPhone was launched. A report by KGI Securities analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo reveals that Apple might go so far as to ditch the home button. The analyst believes that the 2017 iPhone will have an OLED 5.8-inch display with 5.15 inches of usable screen space, some of it will be reserved to virtual capacitive buttons, according to the report. This would mean that Apple plans to remove the home button completely, thus reducing the bezel size on the new phone. The Touch ID fingerprint recognition technology embedded in the home button will also be ditched, there are many rumors that say Apple will employ a new technology that places the fingerprint sensor into the display. The iPhone 8 will have the same display size the 5.5-inch iPhone The analyst also says that Apple’s iPhone 8 with OLED display will be similar in measurements as the 4.7-inch iPhone. This will reportedly be possible by eliminating the home button, usually placed on the front panel. The actual display will be similar in size to the 5.5-inch iPhone, but come in a 4.7-inch body. The analyst is confident that Apple will also launch a standard 4.7-inch and a 5.5-inch LED iPhone, but it remains to be seen what features they will hold. Previous report stated that the iPhone 8 will come with a glass body and wireless charging, while the two other iPhones to be launched this year won’t employ major improvements. Aside from the new fingerprint scanning technology, the iPhone 8 might also come with an iris scanner and facial recognition. Apple is also rumored to incorporate a stacked logic board design in the iPhone 8, one that would support a longer battery life and a bigger battery with a size comparable to the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus. Rumors say that the price of the new iPhone 8 might surpass $1,000. #Apple#iPhone 8#OLED display#Touch ID#iPhone 7 Plus subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Edges Out Samsung to Become Top Global Smartphone Vendor in Q4 Apple to Contract Chinese Supplier of Flexible OLED Displays for Upcoming iPhone Apple iPhone 8 to Feature Reinforced Glass Back, Stainless Steel Frame Apple iPhone 8 Could Feature a Fingerprint Sensor Embedded into the Display Apple Edges Out Samsung to Become Top Global Smartphone Vendor in Q4 Microsoft Extends Support for Original Windows 10 Version DebConf18 Will Be Hosted in Hsinchu, Taiwan, as First Debian Conference in Asia Moto G5 and G5 Plus Press Renders and Specs Revealed by Spanish Retailer Apple’s iPhone 8 to Ditch Home Button in Favor of Virtual Capacitive Buttons No New Windows 10 Cumulative Updates Coming This Month After All Apple Edges Out Samsung to Become Top Global Smartphone Vendor in Q4 Microsoft’s February Security Updates to Launch in March    iPhone 8 concept new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Apple to Contract Chinese Supplier of Flexible OLED Displays for Upcoming iPhone more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

By: Prajith Sabbani Published: Thursday, February 16, 2017, 13:15 [IST] If the latest report from Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, KGI Securities is anything to go by, the next iPhone aka the iPhone 8 will not have a home button. Instead, there will be "virtual buttons" at the bottom of the screen. As you may already know, the Apple iPhone 8 is rumored to come with a near bezel-less display curved on both the sides. To achieve this Apple could get rid of both the home button and Touch ID believes Kuo. He further adds that the iPhone 8 will come with a 5.8-inch OLED display. However, only 5.15-inches of the screen will be usable, and the rest called the "function area" will be reserved for the virtual buttons. SEE ALSO: Apple regains its top position after eight quarters: Gartner As per the Touch ID aka fingerprint scanner, Kuo believes that the next iPhone "will come with other biometric technologies that replace the current fingerprint recognition technology." However, it's not clear what "other technologies" refer to as of now. What's interesting though is that all of this will be included in a 4.7-inch footprint akin to the current iPhone 7. Also, the iPhone 8 is speculated to pack a better battery similar to what the current Plus variants pack. Apple has been recently granted a patent which allows the company to embed a Touch ID-enabled fingerprint scanner right into the display. It seems like Kuo's reports are going to be true, after all. So, how's the "function area" going to look like? Touch Bar? Perhaps!

It may need to address that, and soon. By Alex Webb and Alex Sherman. Added by Agency Staff on 16 February 2017. Saved under In-depth, Top Tags: Apple, Beats, Google, Larry Page, McLaren, McLaren Technology Group, Microsoft, Netflix, Nokia, Sergey Brin, Tim Cook Tweet Apple CEO Tim Cook “We are always looking at acquisitions,” Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts last month. “There’s not a size that we would not do.” It’s a message he’s increasingly stressed over the past year as investors question how the world’s most valuable technology company plans to use its US$246bn (R3,2 trillion) cash pile to meet ambitious sales targets and expand into new markets, such as transportation. But Apple has struggled for years to pull off bigger deals because of a series of quirks: an aversion to risk, reluctance to work with external advisers like investment banks, and inexperience in closing and integrating large takeovers, said people who have worked on acquisitions with the company. They asked not to be identified speaking about private merger and acquisition deliberations. “The first step in M&A is having some conviction about what it is you want to do,” said Eric Risley, managing partner at Architect Partners who has negotiated deals with Apple. “Apple probably more than most feels that they’re very capable of building things” rather than buying them, he added. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. Apple’s biggest deal in its 41-year history was the $3bn purchase Beats Electronics in 2014, followed by the $400m acquisition of NeXT Computer in 1996. In Facebook’s 13 years, it has made three acquisitions of at least $1bn, including its $22bn WhatsApp purchase. Google, founded in 1998, has done four such deals, while Microsoft has completed at least 10. Instead of closing big deals, Cook has so far focused on growing Apple’s services businesses, including Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud. That’s beginning to work, with the company recently forecasting that annual revenue from those operations will top $50bn by 2021. But even here, some analysts and investors argue for a big acquisition, especially in online video streaming. Apple has started distributing videos through the Music service, and pooling other providers’ video in its mobile TV app, but it has no service akin to Netflix or Amazon.com’s Prime Video. On Friday, Sanford C Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said Apple needs at least one big acquisition in online video. To reach its $50bn target, the company must find an extra $13bn in services revenue over the next four years — beyond what it can generate itself. Netflix ended 2016 with sales of less than $9bn, so even buying that business may not be enough, the analyst said. Other potential blockbuster Apple acquisition targets include Walt Disney and electric car maker Tesla, Baird analyst William Power wrote in a recent note to clients. “They’re going to have to pursue something bigger than a Beats-like acquisition,” said Erick Maronak, chief investment officer at Victory Capital Management, which holds Apple stock among its $55bn under management. The US presidency of Donald Trump may spark tax reforms that free up more Apple cash to spend on takeovers. But so far, the company has tiptoed around the edges of some of the biggest transactions reshaping the technology industry. There’s a swagger — you may call it arrogance — about the culture there. They’re used to being able to muscle their way in and get attractive economics. When AT&T agreed to purchase Time Warner for $85bn in October, the telecommunications company was concerned Apple might make a competing bid, people familiar with AT&T’s thinking said at the time. Apple had held tentative talks about a year earlier, but when the AT&T deal emerged, a person familiar with the technology giant’s thinking said it wouldn’t be able to pull together a competing proposal quickly enough. Last year, the company considered buying luxury car maker McLaren Technology Group, people familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg at the time. Apple also had takeover talks with chip designer Imagination Technologies Group, but said last year it wouldn’t make an offer. Apple’s deals team is composed of about a dozen people under former Goldman Sachs banker Adrian Perica, and most acquisitions take place at the behest of the company’s engineers. Product managers usually meet every month with Perica’s team members to identify targets with attractive technology or talented engineers, according to a person familiar with the process. Microsoft’s deals team is not significantly bigger, and it still hired investment bank Morgan Stanley for its $26bn acquisition of LinkedIn last year, beating rival bidders including Salesforce.com and Facebook. At Google, the corporate development team is led by Don Harrison and sometimes works on potential acquisitions with strategy experts working under chief business officer Philipp Schindler, not just technical staff. Other deals are carried out at the behest of founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Apple often refuses to work with investment bankers appointed by the seller, preferring to deal directly with company management, according to people who have been involved in such negotiations. Apple also dictates terms and tells targets to take it or leave it, betting that the promise of product development support later and the chance of appearing in future iPhones are alluring enough, the people said. The FBI wants in… That was the case when Apple acquired Metaio in 2015. Bankers appointed by the augmented-reality firm to negotiate weren’t allowed in the room, and while Metaio executives felt the offer was low, Apple’s vision for the technology convinced them to sell, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Apple’s current M&A strategy works well for acquiring start-ups developing new technology that can be added to existing Apple products. It bought 15 to 20 companies per year over the last four years. But buying larger companies presents a different challenge, particularly if there are rival bids. Bankers often diffuse tension between bidders and targets, but Apple’s approach can make that process difficult. “There’s a swagger — you may call it arrogance — about the culture there,” said Risley of Architect Partners. “They’re used to being able to muscle their way in and get attractive economics.” For Apple’s acquisition of Beats, neither party used an investment bank. Apple struggled to integrate the team, and when the initial Apple Music offering emerged from the combination, it got lukewarm reviews. Later versions of the service improved. However, Apple’s lack of a successful track record integrating big acquisitions puts off sellers, according to a person who has negotiated with Apple’s deals team. There are certain opportunities that they should probably be pursuing and if they wait too long they risk ceding ground to the first movers Large acquisitions can also go wrong in big ways. After buying Nokia’s handset business for $9,5bn, Microsoft had to write down $7,6bn of that value in 2015. Failures like that helped forge Apple’s caution on larger deals, according to one of the people familiar with its thinking. That attitude may need to change, according to some investors. After the AT&T-Time Warner deal, analysts’ focus shifted to Netflix as the next target, even as the video streaming service says it’s not up for sale. However, that company’s shares are up about 60% in the past year, giving it a market value of more than $60bn — 20 times the cost of Apple’s biggest deal. “There are certain opportunities that they should probably be pursuing and if they wait too long they risk ceding ground to the first movers,” Victory Capital’s Maronak said.  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 26‘Please call me’ man hits back at Vodacom 10Big four banks’ dominance must end: Zuma 8Set-top box dispute goes to arbitration 7This is how we’re going to fix ICT 7Liquid Telecom’s big plans for Neotel Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

Apple Edges Out Samsung to Become Top Global Smartphone Vendor in Q4 GO But Samsung sold more smartphones in the whole 2016 year Feb 16, 2017 07:39 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Research and advisory firm, Gartner has just released a report on smartphone sales and mobile OS market share for Q4 2016. The report shows a major shift in the market, Apple has become the top global smartphone vendor after 8 years. The last time when Apple held this position was in Q4 2014, when its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus managed to generate massive sales for the company. It seems that the latest iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were the flagships that drove Apple’s market share up to 17.9%, compared to Samsung’s 17.8% in Q4 last year. Apple sold the most smartphones in Q4/2016 Apple’s phones saw high demand in most mature markets like Korea, North America and Western Europe, where sales of Samsung devices were greatly affected by the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco. Apple managed to sell by just 256,000 units more than Samsung and it would be interesting to see if the Cupertino company will hold its leading position in this year’s last quarter after both companies will have launched new flagships. Android OS still holds more than 80% of the market 432 million smartphones were sold globally in Q4 2016, by 7% more compared to the same quarter of 2015. For the whole year of 2016, 1.5 billion phones were sold to end users, up 5% compared to the previous year. Samsung still sold more phones during the whole 2016 year, compared to Apple, but the company has started to face some difficulties. Samsung still sold the most phones during 2016 overall Samsung sales started to drop in the third quarter and continued their decline to an 8% rate in the fourth, while its market share dropped by 2.9% year-on-year. In the premium segment, Samsung was greatly affected by the discontinuation of its Galaxy Note 7 flagship, while mid-range and entry-level Samsung phones saw fierce competition from Huawei, Oppo and BlackBerry, which holds the fifth position globally. Android continues to be the top mobile OS When it comes to mobile operating systems, Google’s Android held 82% of the market in Q4 2016, while its share grew by 3.2% to 84.8% during last year. It was the only mobile OS to grow its market share year-on-year. Apple’s iOS is second on the market with 17.9% in the last quarter of 2016, Windows is third with 0.3%, while BlackBerry’s OS dropped 0.2% to 0.0% of the market in Q4 2016.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (4 Images) #Apple#Samsung#Huawei#Android#iOS subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Garner's smartphone sales report (4 Images) 01 02 03 04 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Reportedly Paid Samsung $4.3 Billion for More iPhone OLED Displays Apple Dominated the Smartphone Market in the US and GB in 2016 Apple Sees Its First Annual Shipment Drop in China Apple Wants to Sell Used iPhones in India Despite Building New Phones Locally Apple Edges Out Samsung to Become Top Global Smartphone Vendor in Q4 Microsoft Extends Support for Original Windows 10 Version DebConf18 Will Be Hosted in Hsinchu, Taiwan, as First Debian Conference in Asia Moto G5 and G5 Plus Press Renders and Specs Revealed by Spanish Retailer Apple’s iPhone 8 to Ditch Home Button in Favor of Virtual Capacitive Buttons No New Windows 10 Cumulative Updates Coming This Month After All Apple Edges Out Samsung to Become Top Global Smartphone Vendor in Q4 Microsoft’s February Security Updates to Launch in March 4 photos    Apple iPhone 7 Plus New Mac Apps Dripcap: Packet analyzer tool that offers you the option to capture and analyze your network traffic or simply open and review the content of PCAP files Big Business: Provides a complete and multi-platform solution for managing various details related to your business, customers, inventory and more Refly Editor: Word editor designed for content creators that integrates search engine optimization tools and can help you publish posts on multiple accounts Flock: A small and straightforward cross-platform application that enables you to chat with your team mates or co-workers via a stylish GUI Swift: Open Source programming language developed and maintained by Apple that aims to provide a cleaner syntax that is easier write and read Head Basketball: Man to man basketball game that features intuitive controls and allows you to play against your friends on the same machine, or in multiplayer mode Gpass: Password management solution that includes support for storing various types of records and syncs the data to all devices by using the associated cloud service Reader comments Apple to Contract Chinese Supplier of Flexible OLED Displays for Upcoming iPhone more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

A survey by investment bank Baird found that US consumers want Apple to focus its resources on making a car, while a Baird analyst says acquiring electric-car maker Tesla (TSLA) is another, albeit unlikely, option, Investors.com reports. Baird asked 3,000 US respondents in an online poll what they would like to see Apple develop over the next five years. The largest percentage (21.6%) said they want Apple to make a car. Apple has been rumored for several years to be working on a car or technologies for self-driving vehicles. Coming in a close second in the poll (19.5%) was for Apple to develop a Netflix-like streaming video service, with a Baird analyst again suggesting that an acquisition of Netflix also remains an option. The third-largest group (16.1%) want Apple to make a virtual reality headset, followed closely (16%) by a more advanced health care wearable. Further down the list were a smart home device like the Amazon Echo (11.7%) and a live internet video cable TV replacement (9.9%).

Rumoured to feature a curved screen December 20th 2016 2 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ Expert claims there will be three different models of iPhone and they will all come with the cool new charging technology. Jasper Hamill and Guy BirchallThe Sun APPLE’S iPhone 8 is definitely set to feature wireless charging, a top analyst has claimed. Ming-Chi Kuo has said the upcoming iPhone will come in three different forms, but every one of them will let users charge their phone without having to plug it in. In a briefing note obtained by Mac Rumours, he said the phones would use a sheet of graphite to stop them overheating while charging wirelessly. He wrote: “While we don’t expect general users to notice any difference, lamination of an additional graphite sheet is needed for better thermal control and, thus, steady operation.” It has also been rumoured that the smartphone will feature an edge to edge display in the top of the range model alongside two standard versions. Foxconn Technology in Taiwan is making wireless modules to go with their next model according to Nikkei.com. An industry source told the Asian publication: “Whether the feature can eventually make it into Apple’s updated devices will depend on whether Foxconn can boost the yield rate to a satisfactory level later on.” It is currently not obvious whether the California firm would offer a wireless charging plate, similar to Samsung’s offering or something different. But one of the patents filed by Apple in the US shows images of a charger similar to that used by the Apple Watch. The patent itself is mainly focused on a metal brushing technique but also refers to and “inductive charging station”. This patent appears to show a wireless charging plate, which will charge the phone up when it’s placed on top.Source:Supplied According to Mac Rumours: “In describing how the tools would work, the application includes multiple illustrations of a charging station used to provide electrical current to another device via inductive power transmission. “An inductive transmitter coil wraps around a metal core and is designed to pair with a receiver coil and charge the battery in the electronic device.” It was also revealed last year that Apple had a patent for a foldable version of the iconic handset. Sketches in the patent application show a iPhone with a fold down the middle of the screen, with carbon nanotubes giving strength to the structure. In the patent application, Apple says the housing for the phone could be aluminium, glass, ceramic or even plastic for the bendable screen. Apple is granted about 2000 patents a year, and just because it patents something it does not mean that it will result in a product. But chief design officer Jony Ive gave an insight into the time involved in going from an idea to implementation last week in an interview about the new MacBook Pro Touch Bar, saying the design of the Touch Bar came after two years of trying a range of designs. Apple is expected to majorly revamp the iPhone design next year although if it does develop a fordable iPhone that is likely to be something several years down the track.

DailyCaller The DC Home Politics US World Entertainment Sports Business Opinion Guns and Gear Deals Issues Blogs Send a Tip Columnists Ann Coulter Ask Matt Labash Matt Lewis The Mirror DC Trawler Ginni Thomas           DailyCaller   Search:     Home Politics US World Entertainment Sports Business Opinion Guns and Gear Deals Daily Dealer Wine Club Issues Defense Education Energy Blogs The Mirror DC Trawler Send a Tip Tech ‘First Billionaire In Hip Hop’ Dr. Dre Celebrates Beats Headphones Sale To Apple [VIDEO] Giuseppe Macri Tech Editor Giuseppe Macri12:20 PM 05/09/2014      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 4183535 After news broke late Thursday that Apple is working on a $3.2 billion deal to buy Beats Electronics, the developer behind the popular headphones of the same name, company co-founder and hip hop producer Dr. Dre, appeared in a video online and declared himself “the first billionaire in hip hop.” Actor Tyrese Gibson was apparently celebrating with Dre in the producer’s studio following the reports, and posted the video to his Facebook page. “They need to update the Forbes list,” Gibson said in the video referencing the magazine’s list of the world’s richest people, and described Dre as having joined the “billionaire boys club.” “In a big way — understand that,” Dre followed up. “The first billionaire in hip hop.” Though the expletive-rich video appears to show Dre celebrating the deal, he doesn’t explicitly reference or confirm the news. The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 16 February 2017 | MYT 1:19 PM Apple struggles to make big deals, hampering strategy shifts by alex webbandalex sherman Unique challenges: Apple has struggled for years to pull off bigger deals because of a series of quirks: an aversion to risk, reluctance to work with external advisers like investment banks and inexperience in closing and integrating large takeovers, said people who have worked on acquisitions with the company. — Reuters “We are always looking at acquisitions,” Apple Inc chief executive officer Tim Cook told analysts last month. “There’s not a size that we would not do.”  It’s a message he’s increasingly stressed over the past year as investors question how the world’s most valuable technology company plans to use its US$246bil (RM1.09tril) cash pile to meet ambitions sales targets and expand into new markets, such as transportation.  But Apple has struggled for years to pull off bigger deals because of a series of quirks: an aversion to risk, reluctance to work with external advisers like investment banks and inexperience in closing and integrating large takeovers, said people who have worked on acquisitions with the company. They asked not to be identified speaking about private merger and acquisition deliberations.  “The first step in M&A is having some conviction about what it is you want to do,” said Eric Risley, managing partner at Architect Partners LLC who has negotiated deals with Apple. “Apple probably more than most feels that they’re very capable of building things” rather than buying them, he added. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.  Apple’s biggest deal in its 41-year history was the US$3bil (RM13.37bil) purchase Beats Electronics in 2014, followed by the US$400mil (RM1.78bil) acquisition of NeXT Computer in 1996. In Facebook Inc’s 13 years, it has made three acquisitions of at least US$1bil (RM4.44bil), including its US$22bil (RM98.05bil) WhatsApp purchase. Google, founded in 1998, has done four such deals, while Microsoft Corp has completed at least 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Instead of closing big deals, Cook has so far focused on growing Apple’s services businesses, including Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud. That’s beginning to work, with the company recently forecasting that annual revenue from those operations will top US$50bil (RM222.85bil) by 2021.  But even here, some analysts and investors argue for a big acquisition, especially in online video streaming. Apple has started distributing videos through the Music service, and pooling other providers’ video in its mobile TV app, but it has no service akin to Netflix or Amazon.com Inc’s Prime Video.  On Friday, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said Apple needs at least one big acquisition in online video. To reach its US$50bil (RM222.85bil) target, the company must find an extra US$13bil (RM57.94bil) in services revenue over the next four years – beyond what it can generate itself. Netflix Inc ended 2016 with sales of less than US$9bil (RM40.11bil), so even buying that business may not be enough, the analyst said.  Other potential blockbuster Apple acquisition targets include Walt Disney Co and electric carmaker Tesla Inc, Baird analyst William Power wrote in a recent note to clients.  “They’re going to have to pursue something bigger than a Beats-like acquisition,” said Erick Maronak, chief investment officer at Victory Capital Management, which holds Apple stock among its US$55bil (RM245.13bil) under management.  The presidency of Donald Trump may spark tax reforms that free up more Apple cash to spend on takeovers. But so far, the company has tip-toed around the edges of some of the biggest transactions re-shaping the technology industry.   When AT&T Inc agreed to purchase Time Warner Inc for US$85bil (RM378.84bil) in October, the telecom company was concerned Apple might make a competing bid, people familiar with AT&T’s thinking said at the time. Apple had held tentative talks about a year earlier, but when the AT&T deal emerged, a person familiar with the technology giant’s thinking said it wouldn’t be able to pull together a competing proposal quickly enough.  Last year, the company considered buying luxury carmaker McLaren Technology Group Ltd, people familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg at the time. Apple also had takeover talks with chip designer Imagination Technologies Group Plc, but said last year it wouldn’t make an offer.  Apple’s deals team is composed of about a dozen people under former Goldman Sachs banker Adrian Perica, and most acquisitions take place at the behest of the company’s engineers. Product managers usually meet every month with Perica’s team members to identify targets with attractive technology or talented engineers, according to a person familiar with the process.  Microsoft’s deals team is not significantly bigger, and it still hired investment bank Morgan Stanley for its US$26bil (RM115.88bil) acquisition of LinkedIn last year, beating rival bidders including Salesforce.com Inc and Facebook.  At Google, the corporate development team is led by Don Harrison and sometimes works on potential acquisitions with strategy experts working under chief business officer Philipp Schindler, not just technical staff. Other deals are carried out at the behest of founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.  Apple often refuses to work with investment bankers appointed by the seller, preferring to deal directly with company management, according to people who have been involved in such negotiations. Apple also dictates terms and tells targets to take it or leave it, betting that the promise of product development support later and the chance of appearing in future iPhones are alluring enough, the people said.  That was the case when Apple acquired Metaio GmbH in 2015. Bankers appointed by the augmented-reality firm to negotiate weren’t allowed in the room, and while Metaio executives felt the offer was low, Apple’s vision for the technology convinced them to sell, according to a person familiar with the discussions.  Apple’s current M&A strategy works well for acquiring startups developing new technology that can be added to existing Apple products. It bought 15 to 20 companies per year over the last four years. But buying larger companies presents a different challenge, particularly if there are rival bids. Bankers often diffuse tension between bidders and targets, but Apple’s approach can make that process difficult.  “There’s a swagger – you may call it arrogance – about the culture there,” said Risley of Architect Partners. “They’re used to being able to muscle their way in and get attractive economics.”  For Apple’s acquisition of Beats, neither party used an investment bank. Apple struggled to integrate the team, and when the initial Apple Music offering emerged from the combination, it got lukewarm reviews. Later versions of the service improved. However, Apple’s lack of a successful track record integrating big acquisitions puts off sellers, according to a person who has negotiated with Apple’s deals team.  Large acquisitions can also go wrong in big ways. After buying Nokia Oyj’s handset business for US$9.5bil (RM42.34bil), Microsoft had to write down US$7.6bil (RM33.87bil) of that value in 2015. Failures like that helped forge Apple’s caution on larger deals, according to one of the people familiar with its thinking.  That attitude may need to change, according to some investors. After the AT&T-Time Warner deal, analysts’ focus shifted to Netflix as the next target, even as the video streaming service says it’s not up for sale. However, that company’s shares are up about 60% in the past year, giving it a market value of more than US$60bil (RM267.42bil) – 20 times the cost of Apple’s biggest deal.  ”There are certain opportunities that they should probably be pursuing and if they wait too long they risk ceding ground to the first movers,” Victory Capital’s Maronak said. — Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: M&A , Foreign News , Corporate News , Analyst Reports , Technology Related Stories You May Be Interested Brazil judge rules Uber drivers are employees, deserve benefits Clash of Clans maker profit up despite Pokemon challenge Stand up to cancer Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra ‘Zelda: Breath of the Wild’ introduces series-first Season Pass Gartner: Spend your limited IT budget wisely Others Also Read No soft-pedalling from Team NZ in radical yacht design South Korea's military on high level of readiness after news of Kim Jong Nam's death Najib: New KL ATCC will enable improved air traffic control facilities advertisement Latest News DBS profit slumps to two-year low on oil and gas bad debts Maybank Indonesia posts record earnings in FY16 Ukraine says Russian state hackers using new viruses for attacks Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Pokémon Go: The universe expands Most Viewed in Tech Pokémon Go: The universe expands Nokia 3310 on the comeback trail: report Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra Stand up to cancer Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Huawei said to plan its own voice assistant for smartphones Lenovo’s profit misses estimates after PC rivals erode lead Smartphone maker Huawei catching up on Samsung, Apple: study China’s Huawei, Philippine telco join forces in 5G deal Yahoo notifies users of sophisticated breach methods Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Kuo also believes the iPhone 8 will use a 5.8-inch OLED display of which 5.15 inches will be used for screen content while the rest is being reserved for a “function area” at the bottom that will house virtual buttons. Kuo also added that Apple is working on an alternative for Touch ID with new biometric technologies. A separate report yesterday said that Apple will ditch the home button and the fingerprint reader will be built into iPhone display. iPhone debuted in 2007 with the iconic home button which was simply used to get back to the home screen in iOS. However in 2013, Apple unveiled Touch ID fingerprint sensor that was used to unlock the device and authenticate mobile payments via Apple Pay. As per previous reports, the next generation iPhones will sport edge-to-edge to display with narrow bezels thereby offering more screen space. The new iPhones are expected to feature iris scanner, wireless charging and come with other major changes as it is Apple’s 10th Anniversary Via Author: Sneha Bokil Sneha Bokil is a tech enthusiast and is currently using Nexus 5X but she still treasures her Nokia N70 (M).

By: Tech Desk | Updated: February 16, 2017 11:19 am The patent uses LuxVue technology, a company Apple acquired in 2014. The next-generation of iPhone could have no home button and a screen that scans the fingerprints, a newly published patent has revealed. A newly granted patent, first discovered by Apple Insider, reveals Apple is working on a new technique to embed a fingerprint scanner beneath the screen of the iPhone. The patent uses LuxVue technology, a company Apple acquired in 2014. The patent details how the smartphone could use infrared emitters and sensors placed alongside the RGB LEDs to scan and detect the position of the finger on the screen. Such light emitters can be integrated inside the touch display, reducing the overall dimensions of the device. However, there is no guarantee whether Apple will develop the technology and if it will introduce it in the next iPhone. Watch all our videos from Express Technology Apple’s  iPhones have continued to have large symmetrical bezels at the bottom and top of the screens, with a fingerprint scanner integrated into the home button. Due to the large bezels, the current-generation iPhones look relatively large compared to the likes of the Galaxy S7 edge and LG G5. Also read: Apple patent hints a foldable, bendable iPhone: Report At present, the technology for fingerprint requires users to touch the ring to proceed. The timing of the patent, however, shouldn’t be seen as a mere coincidence. There have been reports in the past which claim Apple would remove the home button from next iPhone. The iPhone 8 or “iPhone X” will mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. The smartphone is said to come with major design changes, tiny bezels, and even a curved OLED display. The latest research note from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claims the upcoming iPhone 8 will have a 5-inch display that fits into a body with roughly the dimensions of the 4.7-inch iPhone 7. If Apple is planning to redesign the iPhone, then this new technology will help the company to deliver the best experience on a mobile device. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: Apple iPhone 8 Election 2017 Live updates: PM Modi to address rallies at Hardoi, Barabanki today Uttar Pradesh elections: For Aparna Yadav, Netaji and Congress come together Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections 2017: Campaign and contrast Best of Express Tamil Nadu crisis LIVE updates: Palanisami gets invite to form govt, Panneerselvam camp to move EC EntertainmentPhillauri song Dum Dum: Anushka Sharma, Diljit Dosanjh song celebrates innocent love, watch video EntertainmentKareena, Saif's son Taimur rings in Randhir's 70th birthday.

Reply Jan June 24, 2009 at 11:55 am I am pretty sure you don`t have any invites left, but do you know anyway to get an invite without going through their invite page? I am new to the Mac world, so i do not meet their requirements.. Thanks a lot Reply mike tyson June 2, 2009 at 2:56 pm The PirateBay said: were going to do a video streaming site. Its true. Its in the works being done right now and as usual we put a bit of Pirate Bay mentality behind every project we do.

Reply Jackson January 20, 2009 at 6:45 am Please see comments above regarding BrokenStones. Thank you Reply Bryan January 13, 2009 at 7:58 pm This is exactly the type of list you'd expect from someone who "switched to the Mac a couple years ago." There are a few good choices (joyoftech, osxhints, macrumors), but the rest (like TUAW) exist mainly to hawk accessories and bland, uninformative analysis. That Daring Fireball didn't make this list is criminal. Anyone who's serious about Macs or Apple reads Daring Fireball. In fact, just scratch this entire list and replace it with John Gruber's Linked List. Seriously, once you start reading all the high-class content that he covers, TUAW pieces seem like amateurish drivel.

I've overlooked a rule in BrokenStones about mentioning their site on a public space and also regarding invitation protocol. As a result, my invites have been revoked and they have requested that I remove BS from this list of websites. The problem is, even if the mention of BS is removed, the cat is already out of the bag. And because this is an error on my part, I will respectfully accept any action taken unto my BS account. The hardest part is disappointing the MUO readers here expecting an invite. My most sincere apologies. Reply Jash Sayani January 13, 2009 at 10:23 am Thats ok! BTW, I dont understand why everyone is after a Broken stones invite... What does the community offer??

The grandaddy, the must-see, the gloriously 1997 Mac website of all is macsurfer.com. Your site, brokenstones, and several others on the list are absolutely definitely not on the top 20 Mac sites "every fan must bookmark." Reply Jackson January 12, 2009 at 8:55 am Hi John, AAMOF, I am a recent Switcher, you caught me. I would appreciate any advice and direction you Mac gurus out there have to offer. Reply Bobby January 12, 2009 at 12:16 am I would really enjoy an invite to the brokenstones website. Why? No reason, really... I'm just your average, normal, everyday Mac user. I'm not the greatest, but I'm not the least, either! Do I really deserve it? I don't know - that's for you to decide! If it were up to me, I'd certainly give myself an invite to brokenstones.me. But, if it were up to me, I also wouldn't be typing here, right now. I'd have already invited myself and be on to some other thing, having taken care of said invite. But, then, I wouldn't be here, typing away with the rest of the fine people here, so I'm glad in at least one way, that it's up to you, and not up to me. If I do wind up with an invite, I will indeed use it to advance to good, and not evil - or something like that... OK, well, I best go, so you can go decide who's worthy of such an invite. May you have a lovely day. Thank You. Reply Jackson Chung January 12, 2009 at 12:24 am You forgot to leave your email address, Bobby. Reply Mike Rose January 11, 2009 at 11:20 pm Thanks for including TUAW -- and I agree, you really need to add TidBITS to the list.

I would like an invite to brokenstones. Unfortunately I don't have an account on any of the other sites linked from the invite site. So here is why you should give me the invite: I've only just switched to a Mac (purchased an iMac), so I'm wanting to explore all that's on offer :-) Also, if you're interested in British TV, I can swap an invite to thebox.bz. My e-mail address is perros - at - gmail.

Reply dan January 11, 2009 at 2:59 pm Nice article, but you didn't actually explain what brokenstones is or why anyone would want to jump through the hoops to get an account... Reply Jackson January 12, 2009 at 8:43 am Sorry. I didn't actually get into the details of explaining it because it's kind of a gray area. You see, BrokenStones is a ratio-controlled Mac torrent community. I'd say it's the best place for all your Mac software needs. And right now, invites are required for new user registration.

The update makes Ticketmaster one of the few apps to take advantage of the Apple Music API. Once the update is downloaded, users can allow the app to scan their Apple Music library for their favorite artists. Users will then receive ticket alerts when those artists announce new concerts. If users enable notifications and location services, the app can also notify a user when and where they can watch an artist perform. Apple introduced the Apple Music API with iOS 9.3, and soon began promoting the API in April 2016. Two of the most well known apps to take advantage of the API are Nike and Shazam. Nike's Run Club app allows users to import Apple Music playlists while Shazam allows users to add identified songs to their library. Unlike Nike and Shazam's apps, which is focused on directly impacting someone's music library, the primary goal of Ticketmaster's utilization is to use Apple Music user data to improve its app experience.

Now, a new report seems to put more credence to the earlier rumours that the iPhone 8 will indeed have a facial recognition feature. According to JP Morgan, Apple could be using a LIDAR sensor for the iPhone 8’s facial recognition feature. In addition to this, the same sensor can be used not only for facial recognition but also for augmented reality. What is LIDAR? LIDAR is an acronym for Light Detection and Ranging. Basically, LIDAR is the optical version to the well known navigation tool, the RADAR. Instead of using radio signals, LIDAR uses laser light to detect obstacles along its radiation path. At the moment, LIDAR is mainly used in mapping and laser guidance. However, new advancements in technology made it possible to make use of LIDAR in a number of different applications. iPhone 8 and LIDAR Current LIDAR sensors are extremely bulky as they are used on more rugged applications like satellites and laser guided missiles. However, advancement in miniaturization has made it possible to produce sensors that are small enough for mobile applications. Example of a LIDAR sensor (via sparkfun.com) Back in 2013, Apple acquired PrimeSense, an Israeli company that specializes in 3D sensing. It would seem that the same company will be one spearheading the facial recognition and AR features of the iPhone 8. Apart from facial recognition and AR, the iPhone 8 is also rumored to finally sport an OLED display. In fact, there are reports that the Cupertino tech giant has already placed an order for around 150 million OLED panel from Samsung Display. Additionally, Apple is looking into sourcing OLED panels from China as it sees the requirements for the iPhone 8 will be quite substantial. Right now, these reports are mere speculations of what the iPhone 8 features would be. There is no solid evidence that Apple would apply this technology on its next flagship phone. Nevertheless,  these acquisitions are not done on a whim. Instead, they are a product of careful planning and strategizing. Whether or not Apple chose to use 3D facial recognition or AR on the iPhone 8, it is still too soon to tell. For more updates in the iPhone 8, be sure to check us out on TheBitbag.

Banks accept this in most countries. But not in Australia and, by extension, New Zealand.1 Wrangling over the issue slowed Apple Pay's progress in both countries. Three of Australia's four big banks asked that country's regulator for permission to negotiate with Apple as a group.2 The fourth bank, ANZ, has its own agreement with Apple. On Monday Westpac, Commonwealth Bank and National Australia Bank took fees off the table. In return they want Apple to open up the NFC chip in iPhone. That will allow them to run their digital wallets in direct competition to Apple Pay. The dispute is almost academic. Digital wallet take-up rates are miniscule. For now digital wallets are a rounding error in transaction statistics. Yet everyone involved thinks they will soon be huge. The Australian reports ANZ completed 10 million Apple Pay transactions since launching nine months ago. This compares to seven billion credit and debit card transactions in a year. Banks and phone makers expect digital wallets to take off when they add other features. Driver's licences, loyalty cards and membership schemes are at the front of the list. So are public transport cards. Both Apple and the Australian banks hope people will one day no longer carry conventional wallets. Both want the game to play out their way. The key to understanding the dispute is that both sides are big, powerful semi-monopolies. Both want control and both want to clip the ticket on every transaction. It can mean rivers of gold. The Australian banks argue that opening up the iPhone NFC chip will allow innovation to flourish. Apple argues customers will get a better digital wallet experience if it retains control. Among other things it means customers can run cards issued by different banks from a single app. Banks elsewhere might be as uneasy with Apple Pay, but few banking markets are as tight-held as Australia and New Zealand. This gives the local big banks a clout that, say, US banks don't have. Customers want them all to get on with it. A handful of geeks have swapped to ANZ to use Apple Pay. If that trickle was a flood, the other banks would soon change their tune. That's because Australia's dominant big four banks are also New Zealand's largest banks. Good question. I'm glad you asked. In normal times it is illegal for competitors to collude with each other. Regulators fear this can lead to bad things for customers.

Over the year as a whole, the Chinese maker saw its sales leap by 26.7 per cent, while the South Korean and US rivals both saw their sales decline by 4.3 per cent, Gartner said in a study. As result, Huawei was able to increase its share of the smartphone sector to 8.9 per cent in 2016 from 7.3 per cent a year earlier, while Samsung saw its market share shrink by two full percentage points to 20.5 per cent and Apple’s contracted to 14.4 per cent from 15.9 per cent. “Chinese makers succeeded in winning market share over last year and Huawei now seems to be the main rival to the two giants, even if the gap remains large,” Annette Zimmermann, a Gartner analyst,  told AFP. Among the other Chinese smartphone makers are OPPO, BBK Communication Equipment (with its One Plus and Vivo brands), ZTE, Xiaomi and Lenovo. “We’re seeing a very real progression compared with earlier years, when the number three maker and the others had struggled to hold on to a market share of more than four per cent,” Zimmermann said. “Huawei looks likely to strengthen its position again this year,” she added. In the fourth quarter of 2016 alone, the launch of the iPhone 7 and Samsung’s difficulties with its Note 7 model enabled Apple to take top slot in the market with a share of 17.9 per cent or 77 million units sold. Samsung sold 76.8 million smartphones in the October to December period, giving it a market share of 17.8 per cent, while Huawei sold 40.8 million phones or a market share of 9.5 per cent. “Preliminary data for the current quarter suggest that Samsung will overtake Apple again. But it’s remarkable that Apple can hold on to that sort of share of the market with a closed eco-system,” the analyst said. With regard to the different operating systems, Android, which is used by the large majority of smartphone makers, commands a market share of 81.7 per cent, while Apple’s iOS operating system of its iPhones and iPads accounts for 17.9 per cent of the market.

Twitter Apple smartphones outsold Samsung's in Q4 Apple outsold Samsung by the narrowest of margins in Q4, but both are pursued by a pack of determined Chinese manufacturers Peter Sayer (IDG News Service) 16 February, 2017 10:36 - - - - print email Comments Apple has overtaken Samsung Electronics in smartphone sales for the first time in two years -- but don't count on it staying ahead for long. Samsung sold 76.8 million smartphones in the fourth quarter, giving it a market share of 17.8 percent, but it was just beaten by Apple, which sold 77 million iPhones for a 17.9 percent share, according to figures from Gartner. The fourth quarter is usually a strong one for Apple, boosted by holiday sales of the new generation of iPhones it releases each September, said Anshul Gupta, a research director at Gartner. For Samsung, though, 2016 ended particularly badly, dominated by the fiasco around the recall of its incendiary Galaxy Note7. Super-phones like the Note7 could have accounted for 10 to 15 percent of Samsung's smartphone sales in the period before its recall, said Gupta, but Samsung lost more than that: There was also the damage to its brand. It could bounce back sooner rather than later, though, as it has a new flagship phone coming out at the end of March. Apple, meanwhile, is expected to wait until September before unveiling new iPhones. This year will mark the iPhone's 10th anniversary, and the next model is widely expected to be something special, so Apple fans may delay replacing phones until then, said Gupta. That would leave the way clear for Samsung to move back into the lead from this quarter. That pattern showed up last year too: Although it dominated the fourth quarter, Apple was a distant second over the full year, with market share of just 14.4 percent over the year, far behind Samsung's 20.5 percent, and the situation was similar the previous year. While the giants slug it out, a more interesting battle is going on just beneath them, as the next three companies in the fourth-quarter smartphone rankings are all Chinese. Huawei Technologies is in third place with a worldwide smartphone market share of 9.5 percent, with fourth and fifth taken by Oppo (6.2 percent) and BBK Communication Equipment (5.6 percent), two companies that many consider to be part of the same conglomerate. Gartner treats them separately because, whatever their shareholding structure, they operate independently, each with their own product team, Gupta said. BBK, almost unknown in the West, is now the number one smartphone brand in China, he said. A year ago, though, that honor went to Oppo, and the year before that, Huawei. Previous years saw the Chinese market topped by Xiaomi and Samsung. These Chinese companies have pushed Apple and Samsung aside in their home market, and are expanding across South Asia. "Even in their current expansion, Oppo is not focusing just on emerging markets, but also on developed markets like Australia," said Gupta, so we may soon see them climbing up the rankings in Europe and the U.S too. The key ingredients for that are already in their products, he said. "Oppo and BBK make great phones in terms of feature set. They have integrated high-end features like dual cameras and fast charge." Join the TechWorld newsletter! Join Error: Please check your email address.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 16 February 2017 | MYT 10:30 AM One bot to rule them all? Not likely, with Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft virtual assistants by ethan baron No dominant player yet: Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft are all jostling for the biggest piece of the virtual assistant pie. — Bay Area News Group/TNS It's no wonder titans of tech are locked in an epic battle of the bots, racing furiously to produce the best virtual assistant.  Their respective help-bots – Apple's Siri, Google's Assistant, Amazon's Alexa and Microsoft's Cortana – promise consumers one of the most valuable commodities in the world: free time.  Thanks to the sudden acceleration of artificial intelligence and advancements in speech recognition and big-data storage, the technology behind virtual assistants is rapidly spreading from phones to cars and homes, and the truly useful helper is approaching fast. The four giants are fighting for the biggest share of a market expected to grow to US$12bil (RM53.38bil) by 2024.  "There's a tremendous amount of promise for these agents to help and assist with many different tasks that we face every day," said Ross Rubin, principal analyst at Reticle Research. "The more the agent can help you with, the more value it holds."  The ultimate goal is our own personal genie in a bottle that awakens with a word or touch to liberate us from all our mundane tasks, organize our days and nights, and free us from the stress of lives that have become so terribly busy. But that's not going to happen quite yet.  Today, the aid these virtual assistants provide remains limited. Most users of Google Home and Amazon Echo devices – which host Assistant and Alexa, respectively – stream music, play audio books, and control smart-home devices, according to surveys by San Francisco analytics firm VoiceLabs.  Still, the virtual agent's foundation in AI means the more it learns about a user's preferences and behaviours, the better job it can do. So while experts predict a handful of firms will dominate in this field – most agree Apple, Google and Amazon will be major players, with Microsoft in a lesser role – they're split on whether consumers will be served best by one bot, or more.  "People want one assistant, they don't want two," said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research in San Jose. "You want one assistant, to be very readily available wherever you are."  However, the various assistants will likely end up somewhat specialized in their expertise, with Google's Assistant, for example, excelling in providing knowledge and managing schedules, and Microsoft's Cortana leading on gaming, said VoiceLabs CEO Adam Marchick. In a few years, many people will use two or three different assistants, Marchick predicted.  The industry stands at a critical moment, because the first highly effective help-bot to get a foothold in a consumer's home, phone or car will likely stay, creating a barrier to competitors, Marchick said.  In order for a virtual helpmate to run your life, it needs to engage with the providers of all the services you rely on, from your calendar app to your Uber ride. Those providers must either partner with the company operating the assistant, or design their app to integrate with the assistant. So Spotify will stream music upon request via Alexa, and Honeywell's smart-home thermostat, via Assistant, will bump up the temperature 15 minutes before Grandma's expected arrival.  For providers, "if there is a competitive advantage to be gained, then absolutely they will do it," said Brett Sappington, senior director of research at market research firm Parks Associates.  For all the major players, virtual assistants provide important data that fuels the AI that powers and improves them, making both the assistants and the products they live in ever more marketable. For Amazon, Alexa is an enthusiastic purchasing agent for the e-commerce that drives the firm. For Google, Assistant is a turbocharged vacuum for the data the company collects to sell ads targeted directly at users.  Underlying the projected expansion of virtual assistants is the "voice first" approach to personal technology, said Brian Roemmele, a Los Angeles tech entrepreneur and expert in voice computing. Voice operation keeps hands free and it's faster, he noted, because speaking conveys information more quickly than typing.  So far, both Google and Amazon have focused largely on home-based assistants. Google's new Pixel phones host Assistant, but it has an uphill battle because Apple has far more phones equipped with Siri on the market, said Tim Bajarin, an analyst with San Jose market research firm Creative Strategies.  The popularity of Amazon's Echo and Alexa notwithstanding – the company has sold more than 8 million Echo devices since rolling them out in late 2014, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners – most people want their virtual assistant on their phones, Bajarin said.  "When you're driving, that's critical, or if your hands are busy," Bajarin said. "The phone will continue to dominate as the vehicle for delivering the virtual assistant."  Putting these robo-helpers into cars' onboard systems has become a priority for major firms, including Microsoft, which seeks to extend the reach of its PC-based Cortana through the "connected-vehicle" platform it announced this year.  In January, Nissan announced it would integrate Microsoft's platform into its cars. Siri already can be used in a car via a phone or Apple's CarPlay system, or in cars sold with Siri integration built in. Hyundai is bringing Alexa and Google's Assistant into some of its cars so, for example, an owner could start their car from their living room.  While building the supreme help-bot is clearly a priority for many major tech firms, experts say the software today lacks the knowledge base to take the next big leap: to enable virtual assistants that can predict our needs to serve us better.  "Some of it is just raw amounts of data and understanding about how the world works and what humans expect," Reticle's Rubin said.  Which companies rise to dominance depends both on the capability of their bots and the draw of the gadgets that house them.  "The story has not been written on what success is going to be in this space," Sappington said. — The Mercury News/Tribune News Service Related Stories You May Be Interested Apple struggles to make big deals, hampering strategy shifts Clash of Clans maker profit up despite Pokemon challenge Stand up to cancer Apple hunts for the app stars of the future with new show Spotify expands with World Trade Centre move Yahoo notifies users of sophisticated breach methods Others Also Read Embassy tight-lipped on death of Jong-nam Only hard work can save Foxes from drop, says Pearson advertisement Latest News Ukraine says Russian state hackers using new viruses for attacks Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Pokémon Go: The universe expands Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra Huawei said to plan its own voice assistant for smartphones Most Viewed in Tech Pokémon Go: The universe expands Nokia 3310 on the comeback trail: report Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra Stand up to cancer Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Huawei said to plan its own voice assistant for smartphones Lenovo’s profit misses estimates after PC rivals erode lead Smartphone maker Huawei catching up on Samsung, Apple: study Apple struggles to make big deals, hampering strategy shifts China’s Huawei, Philippine telco join forces in 5G deal Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

The update pushes the app 1.10.2 and makes it significantly easier to quickly know when an artist you love is touring. Once you’ve downloaded the latest version of Ticketmaster from the App Store, you’ll be prompted to give the app access to your Apple Music library. If you choose to do so, Ticketmaster will scan your library for artists: Be the first to know about upcoming events: Import your favorites and your music library and we’ll find events for you. Ticketmaster explains that once you give the app access, you can receive push notifications about when your favorite artists tour. If you choose to go a step farther and give Ticketmaster access to location services, you’ll get more details such as where your favorite artists will be stopping on their tour, as well. The full change log for the update is below: Integration with Apple Music! Scan your Apple music library and receive ticket alerts about your favorite artists. And when you enable notification and location services we can give you details – like where you can see them play next. Integration with Apple Music is a notable update for Ticketmaster as it makes it easier for users to know when their favorite artists are touring. Ticketmaster isn’t the first app to add Apple Music integration, though. Nike+ Run Club, for instance gained Apple Music integration last October, while Shazam sports integration for easily adding identified songs to your library. To allow apps to integrate Apple Music, Apple released official Apple Music API documentation last spring highlighting what developers could do with the service. This API is what’s used by apps like Ticketmaster, Shazam, and Nike+ Run Club. The latest version of Ticketmaster is available on the App Store now.

Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook told analysts last month. “There’s not a size that we would not do." It’s a message he’s increasingly stressed over the past year as investors question how the world’s most valuable technology company plans to use its $246 billion cash pile to meet ambitions sales targets and expand into new markets, such as transportation. But Apple has struggled for years to pull off bigger deals because of a series of quirks: an aversion to risk, reluctance to work with external advisers like investment banks and inexperience in closing and integrating large takeovers, said people who have worked on acquisitions with the company. They asked not to be identified speaking about private merger and acquisition deliberations. “The first step in M&A is having some conviction about what it is you want to do,” said Eric Risley, managing partner at Architect Partners LLC who has negotiated deals with Apple. “Apple probably more than most feels that they’re very capable of building things" rather than buying them, he added. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. Apple’s biggest deal in its 41-year history was the $3 billion purchase Beats Electronics in 2014, followed by the $400 million acquisition of NeXT Computer in 1996. In Facebook Inc.’s 13 years, it has made three acquisitions of at least $1 billion, including its $22 billion WhatsApp purchase. Google, founded in 1998, has done four such deals, while Microsoft Corp. has completed at least 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Instead of closing big deals, Cook has so far focused on growing Apple’s services businesses, including Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud. That’s beginning to work, with the company recently forecasting that annual revenue from those operations will top $50 billion by 2021. But even here, some analysts and investors argue for a big acquisition, especially in online video streaming. Apple has started distributing videos through the Music service, and pooling other providers’ video in its mobile TV app, but it has no service akin to Netflix or Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime Video. On Friday, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said Apple needs at least one big acquisition in online video. To reach its $50 billion target, the company must find an extra $13 billion in services revenue over the next four years -- beyond what it can generate itself. Netflix Inc. ended 2016 with sales of less than $9 billion, so even buying that business may not be enough, the analyst said. Other potential blockbuster Apple acquisition targets include Walt Disney Co. and electric carmaker Tesla Inc., Baird analyst William Power wrote in a recent note to clients. “They’re going to have to pursue something bigger than a Beats-like acquisition," said Erick Maronak, chief investment officer at Victory Capital Management, which holds Apple stock among its $55 billion under management. The presidency of Donald Trump may spark tax reforms that free up more Apple cash to spend on takeovers. But so far, the company has tip-toed around the edges of some of the biggest transactions re-shaping the technology industry.  When AT&T Inc. agreed to purchase Time Warner Inc. for $85 billion in October, the telecom company was concerned Apple might make a competing bid, people familiar with AT&T’s thinking said at the time. Apple had held tentative talks about a year earlier, but when the AT&T deal emerged, a person familiar with the technology giant’s thinking said it wouldn’t be able to pull together a competing proposal quickly enough. Last year, the company considered buying luxury carmaker McLaren Technology Group Ltd., people familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg at the time. Apple also had takeover talks with chip designer Imagination Technologies Group Plc, but said last year it wouldn’t make an offer. Apple’s deals team is composed of about a dozen people under former Goldman Sachs banker Adrian Perica, and most acquisitions take place at the behest of the company’s engineers. Product managers usually meet every month with Perica’s team members to identify targets with attractive technology or talented engineers, according to a person familiar with the process. Microsoft’s deals team is not significantly bigger, and it still hired investment bank Morgan Stanley for its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn last year, beating rival bidders including Salesforce.com Inc. and Facebook. At Google, the corporate development team is led by Don Harrison and sometimes works on potential acquisitions with strategy experts working under Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler, not just technical staff. Other deals are carried out at the behest of founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Apple often refuses to work with investment bankers appointed by the seller, preferring to deal directly with company management, according to people who have been involved in such negotiations. Apple also dictates terms and tells targets to take it or leave it, betting that the promise of product development support later and the chance of appearing in future iPhones are alluring enough, the people said. That was the case when Apple acquired Metaio GmbH in 2015. Bankers appointed by the augmented-reality firm to negotiate weren’t allowed in the room, and while Metaio executives felt the offer was low, Apple’s vision for the technology convinced them to sell, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Apple’s current M&A strategy works well for acquiring startups developing new technology that can be added to existing Apple products. It bought 15 to 20 companies per year over the last four years. But buying larger companies presents a different challenge, particularly if there are rival bids. Bankers often diffuse tension between bidders and targets, but Apple’s approach can make that process difficult. “There’s a swagger -- you may call it arrogance -- about the culture there,” said Risley of  Architect Partners. “They’re used to being able to muscle their way in and get attractive economics.” For Apple’s acquisition of Beats, neither party used an investment bank. Apple struggled to integrate the team, and when the initial Apple Music offering emerged from the combination, it got lukewarm reviews. Later versions of the service improved. However, Apple’s lack of a successful track record integrating big acquisitions puts off sellers, according to a person who has negotiated with Apple’s deals team. Large acquisitions can also go wrong in big ways. After buying Nokia Oyj’s handset business for $9.5 billion, Microsoft had to write down $7.6 billion of that value in 2015. Failures like that helped forge Apple’s caution on larger deals, according to one of the people familiar with its thinking. That attitude may need to change, according to some investors. After the AT&T-Time Warner deal, analysts’ focus shifted to Netflix as the next target, even as the video streaming service says it’s not up for sale. However, that company’s shares are up about 60 percent in the past year, giving it a market value of more than $60 billion -- 20 times the cost of Apple’s biggest deal.

Courtney raved about Sam being a great babysitter, and she was right! From the moment Sam texted Stacy and asked if she should bring her own (paleo) food or if there was enough in the house for her to cook for the children, we knew it was going to work out! When Stacy & Matt got home to find a clean kitchen as well as a house full of well-fed and happy boys we wondered how we could convince Sam to hang around more often. When she started PaleoSitter.com the opportunity for Sam to learn more about cooking, blogging, book writing and more came up and we’re thrilled to have her as our Local Assistant interning to learn more about how to turn your passion into a business! So often we get the question, “If I can’t feed my paleo toddler Cheerios or rice puffs, what on earth can I feed them for a snack?” Who better to answer this question than a Paleo Baby Sitter? Sam has put together an awesome round-up with 20 ideas for how to feed a paleo toddler. Take it away Sam!  ♥♥♥ Hi guys! PaleoSitter here! Or my legal name Samantha. I have received questions on my blog about what I give the toddlers I babysit as snacks. These are things that have worked for me. I view toddlers as being 1-3 years old, but many of these things work for older kids as well. NOTE: Not all kids I babysit eat paleo. 1. Apple squeezes, they have apple sauce and apple juice in a pouch. I personally love these! 2. Grapes! If you are concerned about these being a choking hazard, just cut the grapes in half. 3. Eggs, hard-boiled eggs are an easy on the go snack. You can add sesame seed eyes and a carrot nose to turn them into fun chicks! Check out this post from Nom Nom Paleo for the perfect boiled egg.   4. Lara Bars, I have found the blueberry muffin is popular, or my recipe for Sam Bars. Need an inexpensive nut-free version? Try Toasted (Not) PB & J Katybars. Paleo Parents also have recipes for Nut Free Blueberry Muffin LaraBar Wannabes, Mango Snack Balls, and Banana Bread Balls (vegan, paleo and AIP friendly!)   5. Fruit Kabobs: put different chunks of fruit on a Popsicle stick (no sharp points!), perfect for on the go. 6. Pudding! What kiddo doesn’t like pudding? I will be uploading a paleo friendly chocolate pudding recipe soon, but in the mean time, The Paleo Parents have a great recipe for Cinnamon Raisin (not) Rice Pudding by their oldest son, Cole! 7. Avocados, remember once you cut them, put a little lime/lemon juice on them to prevent them from turning brown. 8. Pure Wraps, for sandwich replacement we use these. You can put almond butter with bananas, lunch meats, chicken salad with paleo mayo or whatever you like! They’re not terrific by themselves, but delicious when filled with things. 9. Apple Gate Farms  deli meat, they are a little expensive, but delicious! We buy them in bulk at BJ’s Whole Club but you can find them at Trader Joe’s too. 10. Fruit with almond butter. These pouches work very well for car rides. They also come with different flavors, the honey and maple syrup flavors are my personal favorites. 11. Banana bread! We use the book Against All Grain for our recipe. Our last two loafs lasted a day. There is also a great recipe in Eat Like a Dinosaur. 12. Blueberry muffins, I use this recipe. It has the consistency of a normal muffin. I add double the amount of blueberries. 13. Pork rinds. (Probably a bit controversial but my family loves them.) US Wellness Meats has great quality pork rinds that are made from pastured pork and fried in their own lard! Their seasonings also don’t have any yucky stuff (chemicals, sugar, MSG) – yay! 14. Paleo Girl Scout cookies. I found multiple AMAZING recipes. Tagalongs, Samoas, and Thin Mints. (Elana Amsterdam from Elana’s Pantry is the bomb! She wrote the forward to Eat Like a Dinosaur for Matt and Stacy!)   On Thursday, we asked our Facebook followers for their favorite things to feed paleo toddlers, and we got some great responses! Our last six suggestions come straight from those paleo mommies who answered:  15. TONS of you suggested OLIVES! We agree – Olives are packed with healthy fats, and great for little ones to practice their “pincer” skills. Just like grapes, you can cut these in half too! The best part about olives is that they are easily portable and mess free! Just make sure you get ones that are pitted, of course! 16. Tricia H. had a WONDERFUL suggestion: She buys these “Little Green Pouches” (which, by the way, are reusable, dishwasher/freezer safe AND BPA, PVC, and phythalate free!) – she makes her own blends of cooked veggies and fruits. Tricia says, ” I make 8 pouches at a time and freeze a few. His favorite is a sweet potato, apple, carrot with cinnamon!”  GREAT idea Tricia! Thanks for sharing this adorable picture of your son!   17. Pretty in Paleo commented and said, “Mine loves a mixture of Cashews, Raisins, Unsweetened Coconut Flakes and Enjoy Life Chocolate Chips” – we love this idea too, and in fact we have an area in our pantry that has the different ingredients for paleo trail mix in jars where they can reach them so they can make their own mixes for themselves! (see more about Our Paleo Pantry here) 18. SUPERFOOD ideas: Canned wild caught Sardines, salmon, and tuna. While it may seem weird to you to feed a toddler a can of sardines, don’t let your preconceptions about these foods transfer to your little ones! Lots of our Facebook followers commented that their toddlers love sardines, and even The Paleo Mom has said many times before how her youngest daughter loves them! They are incredibly nutrient dense, and just what little ones need to grow strong. If you are worried about them choking on the bones, you can always buy them boneless and skinless. Don’t knock it ’til you try it! Your toddler may surprise you. Toddlers and babies are also known to LOVE liver, and a great easy option is US Wellness Meats liverwurst. It’s soft and delicious, and incredibly nutrient dense.   19. Gelatin Snacks – lots of you suggested this one, and we TOTALLY agree! We love gelatin snacks – so much so that we did a MEGA round up with 60+ recipes using grassfed gelatin. Photo by Against All Grain 20. Last but not least, lots of you suggested organic fruit leathers! Danielle, from Against All Grain has a great recipe for Homemade Fruit by the Foot that her own toddler, Asher, just loves! Isn’t he adorable? We hope these 20 ideas help with your toddler, and we are so glad that you got to meet our PaleoSitter, Sam. We are looking forward to working with her on the weekends as she interns for us, and also mentoring her in her blogging skills. Do you have any more great suggestions for Paleo Toddler Snacks? Leave a comment and let us know!    All about Sam: Hello! I am Sam. I am the newest and youngest member of the Paleo Parents team. Before eating paleo, I had skin allergies, acid reflux, acne, frequent bronchitis, and I was overweight. My Stepmom and I are avid CrossFitters, and both hit a plateau with weight loss. When our family decided to switch to paleo, it changed our lives. We have collectively lost 99 pounds. Not only did I lose weight, all of my medical issues disappeared. I am a full time college student, a government contractor, and trying to become an avid blogger. I love to cook and bake. Oh, yeah, and eat. I have been cooking ever since I can remember. What really encouraged me to cook more, was when my Dad sent me to a cooking boot camp. I have transformed my cooking to paleo, with an abundance of trial and error. I am very excited to be working with Paleo Parents and their team! Connect with Sam on Facebook!

First off, processed fruit and fruit juice has very little nutritional value, and second, what a waste of packaging. Food packaged in plastic, especially acidic foods, causes the plastic to leach into the food. Make your own applesauce or buy it in a large glass jar that you can reuse or recycle. Stacy & Matt Bre, I would you suggest you check out the linked post. Although probably filled with the best of intentions, your tone comes across very judgmental and harsh – which can turn off those people who are interested in making better choices for their families. Certainly homemade is best (see our recipe on the blog and our book Eat Like a Dinosaur for a recipe), the items linked are better alternatives for busy families who can’t always do so. Try to remember everyone is at different phases of their paleo journey and we were all just starting once… http://balancedbites.com/2012/06/paleo-perfectionism.html Cheryl I get these types of things (#1) for my kids occasionally for those days when my fresh fruit/veggies have already been eaten for the week and(or) I need something quick and easy to send to school for a snack. We couldn’t afford to eat them every day/all the time but for snack 1-2 times a week its a lifesaver! I also buy applesauce in large jars at Costco but for an on the go snack it doesn’t work well. I love all the ideas posted here!!!! Sometimes I just need to be reminded of some other options!!! Joe Walsh Yes I does not I so agree with you bre Michelle These are really helpful suggestions! I will check out your blog! My three year old has multiple food sensitivities (gi and skin related). We did a very basic paleo diet with him for two weeks, and he was so much happier, more energetic, and problems started dismissing. As we added back in more food to see if he can handle some gluten free packaged snacks (concerned for the emotional aspect), he has really resisted real food.:(. He snacks a lot, he is borderline anemic. We are trying very hard to do mostly primal, slowly adding foods to check for sensitivities (although gi wise no symptoms with hard cheese/yogurt, skin is always flaring). He is often hungry within 15 min of a meal. We get frustrated…and for a solid hour before bed he eats and eats. :(. I want him mostly off grains, but my husband isn’t there yet although supportive. My big question is about getting kids to eat real meals–real food…do you use the no thank you portion concept??? Or do you just set out meals and not push..let them eat what he naturally goes for (with a good quality meal?). I am starting to give him a salad like ours at lunch, and let him pick out what he’ll eat, hoping he’ll eventually improve. He resists that so majorly, it can become a true battle. The old fashioned “clean your plate” my husband grew up with doesn’t work at all, and doesn’t fit us. I do not want food to become such a negative….Looking for any posts or ideas! I follow your work and Sarah’s, starting on AIP myself. God bless you both…and my son LOVES your kids story in eat like a dinosaur. Your podcasts I want him to hear your little jingle too! :). I am hoping to turn us both around in positive ways! Stacy & Matt It sounds like you might need to focus on trying to add more healthy fats to your little one’s diet to help keep him full. Fats keep you satiated longer than any other food, and especially grains. Grains act like sugar in the body, and are metabolized quickly, leaving you hungry. We like to add coconut milk to our kids fruit smoothies (like this one: http://paleoparents.com/2011/blueberry-coconut-milk-smoothie/ and this one: http://paleoparents.com/featured/coles-mango-madness/ ) because it helps keep them full for longer. You can also make smoothies and add avocado to them like this one: http://againstallgrain.com/2012/07/24/creamy-chocolate-avocado-smoothie/ – usually if a child is continually hungry, the fat is what they are missing. When trying to get little ones to eat veggies, cook them in a healthy dose of fat too, like lard, grassfed ghee, or butter if he tolerates dairy ok. Keep presenting the foods and keep trying. It usually takes a person (child or adult) to have a food presented 10 times before they will even try it. It will happen over time, and get easier, but you just have to be patient. You might also want to check out our ebook, 3 Phase Paleo for tips on transitioning your family to a paleo lifestyle if they are hesitant at first. http://3phasepaleo.com – it took us two years to fully transition, and this is how we did it. <3 best of luck ~ The Paleo Parents Michelle Thank you so much for your prompt reply Stacy, I think you hit a very key concept for his diet, and those are awesome suggestions. I’m excited to implement them and will check out your book when finances allow, keep up the awesome work, you and your husband are an inspiration! Anne Thank you for this post! I have been Paleo for 3 years and trying to slowly (very slowly) transition my kids ( 5 and 3) to paleo (they are GF). I am going to give the wraps a try because my oldest loves his sandwiches and he hates roll up made with lettuce. Thanks for the ideas! Esp the “rice” pudding. Joe Walsh I loved the blue berry muffins I ate them here with my 2 year old daughter Sharon Oaks Our grandson is almost 6 and has been brought up with horrible eating habits. These snack ideas are wonderful and I can’t wait to begin trying many of them out on him! Coby This is such a helpful post. I’m trying to move my family to a more whole foods lifestyle approach – fewer Goldfish and more, well, real fish! We’re expecting our second so anything that I can do to be proactive with our health is definitely welcome. Grab me and kiss me I’m paleo but I don’t count nuts as paleo. I think they are just as bad as grains. If you feed nuts atleast make sure they’re soaked in water for a few hours first (like beans), then drain and rinse. Even so I’d still worry that it would cause too much inflammation in their delicate digestive system. Gelatin: what a great tip! So tasty and good for their digestion. For dairy-eating paleos, try custards. You could even freeze them in ice cube trays and pop a couple of them before going out. I use a lot more egg yolks than recipes usually ask for. Oh and cheesecake bites! It’s tasty even without sugar and you can freeze it too. Danielle F I absolutely love these ideas! We are new to the paleo lifestyle and struggle with our children ages 4,3, and 1 and finding good snack variety. I like the idea of creating their own trail mix. I’m definitely going to stock up on ingredients and then give them little muffin liners to fill with their choice of ingredients! Amanda Do you know of a place I can find some recipes for making my own food pouches? My 15 month old son is not a big eater but he will eat from the pouches occasionally. I have reusable ones with cute little animals on it, but I don’t really know what to put in them and how to maximize the calories (and I struggle to do much of anything without a recipe or instructions!) Amanda Oh, and as a response to people who might say how terrible it is to serve a child something in plastic, until you have a child that literally will starve themselves, you have no idea. You will let your child eat anything they want.Ice cream for dinner? OK. Food in a pouch? Yes! It’s that or a feeding tube and we really don’t want to go down that road if it can be avoided. Stacy & Matt While we have never personally tested, there are a number of sites that offer some suggestions (like this one http://www.littlegreenpouch.com/pages/paleo-food-pouch-recipes). If you son can tolerate coconut milk and/or yogurt, I am thinking that would be a good base for a number of creations, with broth making for an excellent base for other meals. Good luck! Nancy D.

Samsung sold 76.8 million smartphones in the fourth quarter, giving it a market share of 17.8 percent, but it was just beaten by Apple, which sold 77 million iPhones for a 17.9 percent share, according to figures from Gartner. The fourth quarter is usually a strong one for Apple, boosted by holiday sales of the new generation of iPhones it releases each September, said Anshul Gupta, a research director at Gartner. For Samsung, though, 2016 ended particularly badly, dominated by the fiasco around the recall of its incendiary Galaxy Note7. Super-phones like the Note7 could have accounted for 10 to 15 percent of Samsung's smartphone sales in the period before its recall, said Gupta, but Samsung lost more than that: There was also the damage to its brand. It could bounce back sooner rather than later, though, as it has a new flagship phone coming out at the end of March. Apple, meanwhile, is expected to wait until September before unveiling new iPhones. This year will mark the iPhone's 10th anniversary, and the next model is widely expected to be something special, so Apple fans may delay replacing phones until then, said Gupta. That would leave the way clear for Samsung to move back into the lead from this quarter. That pattern showed up last year too: Although it dominated the fourth quarter, Apple was a distant second over the full year, with market share of just 14.4 percent over the year, far behind Samsung's 20.5 percent, and the situation was similar the previous year. While the giants slug it out, a more interesting battle is going on just beneath them, as the next three companies in the fourth-quarter smartphone rankings are all Chinese. Huawei Technologies is in third place with a worldwide smartphone market share of 9.5 percent, with fourth and fifth taken by Oppo (6.2 percent) and BBK Communication Equipment (5.6 percent), two companies that many consider to be part of the same conglomerate. Gartner treats them separately because, whatever their shareholding structure, they operate independently, each with their own product team, Gupta said. BBK, almost unknown in the West, is now the number one smartphone brand in China, he said. A year ago, though, that honor went to Oppo, and the year before that, Huawei. Previous years saw the Chinese market topped by Xiaomi and Samsung. These Chinese companies have pushed Apple and Samsung aside in their home market, and are expanding across South Asia. "Even in their current expansion, Oppo is not focusing just on emerging markets, but also on developed markets like Australia," said Gupta, so we may soon see them climbing up the rankings in Europe and the U.S too. The key ingredients for that are already in their products, he said. "Oppo and BBK make great phones in terms of feature set. They have integrated high-end features like dual cameras and fast charge." We’re Hooked on Our Devices, But Can We Handle the Eye Strain?

Opinion | 06 Feb 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (41) What Apple Can Learn from Airwalk by Josh Centers When I was a teenager in the 1990s, Airwalk shoes were all the rage. They were a mandatory accessory for grunge-oriented youths, along with plaid shirts and corduroy pants. The company was founded in 1986, and in its heyday in the 1990s, it had grown to be the third-largest sneaker brand, behind only Nike and Adidas. Today’s teens have undoubtedly never even heard of Airwalk sneakers, which are now found on the bargain rack at Payless Shoesource. What happened? Wait, this is TidBITS, not a fashion magazine, so why am I talking about shoes? Keep reading. I’m about to tell you a story that may sound chillingly familiar. Airwalk began as a niche shoe for professional skateboarders. Skating legend Tony Hawk (who starred in an eponymous video game that ran on the Mac, along with many other platforms) was one of their first customers, and actually suggested the name. Much of Airwalk’s early popularity was due to getting input from skaters to create superior skateboarding shoes that wouldn’t cause blisters or crashes. Airwalk had a healthy business, but it didn’t hit the big time until it hired advertising firm Lambesis to run an ultra-chic, counter-cultural ad campaign. As Malcolm Gladwell wrote in “The Tipping Point,” Airwalk was a $16 million company in 1993. In 1994, it was a $44 million company. In 1995, it was a $150 million company. To satisfy the vast influx of teenage customers while keeping skateboarders and boutique shops happy, Airwalk developed a two-tier strategy. It sold cheaper, consumer-grade shoes to mainstream retailers like Footlocker while continuing to provide pricier, professional-grade shoes to boutique shops. But Airwalk’s success didn’t last. The company’s troubles began in 1997 as production problems led to limited back-to-school supplies. Meanwhile, its lineup had become stale, with few new models. Worst of all, Airwalk abandoned its professional line of shoes. Serious skaters dropped Airwalk, causing the brand to lose its cachet with teens, and it wasn’t long before Airwalk’s time in the sun was over. A smallish company exploding due to quality products and a hip ad campaign. A product line that split into both consumer and professional tiers to provide different price points and features. A company that was later plagued by production problems, stagnant product designs, and ignoring its professional market. Does that sound like another company you can think of? Airwalk might have skated along for a while with its old designs and made peace with retailers, but abandoning its key market of hardcore skaters was what drove it into market irrelevance. In terms of managing supply chains and industrial design, Apple has a pair of superstars in Tim Cook and Jony Ive (to the extent Ive is still involved in product design, anyway). And Apple no longer worries about disappointing retailers, having opened hundreds of its own stores. More concerning is how Apple is treating its professional users. Let’s itemize a few of the ways Apple has moved away from the professional market over the past five years: Killing the Xserve Dumbing down Final Cut Pro with Final Cut Pro X Replacing the pro app Aperture with the consumer-level Photos Increasing burdensome restrictions on Mac App Store apps Releasing a new Mac Pro without internal expandability Failing to update that Mac Pro for over 3 years Delaying updates to the MacBook Pro line for nearly 18 months Releasing a new MacBook Pro that has drawn criticism from professionals Showing a lack of support for automation by eliminating the position of Product Manager of Automation Technologies We’re not alone in saying that Apple is now the iPhone company (see “Understanding Apple’s Marginalization of the Mac,” 21 November 2016). That’s where most of its profit comes from, and so that’s where most of its resources go. Fair enough. But, here’s the thing: the Mac and the capabilities it provides to professionals are the foundation of that iPhone business. Die-hard Mac users kept Apple afloat in the dark years before the iPod and then iPhone. And even now, regardless of all other professional uses of the Mac, developers need Xcode on the Mac to create iOS apps. Apple still has many things in its favor: $241 billion in cash, massive profits every quarter, one of the most popular brands in the world, and nearly 500 successful retail stores. And it might seem odd to criticize Apple now, especially when the company just broke a quarterly record with the most iPhone and Mac sales ever (helped by new iPhone and MacBook Pro models, plus the holiday shopping season, see “Apple Sees Apparent Return to Growth with Q1 2017’s Record Results,” 31 January 2017). But as we saw with Airwalk, things could go downhill fast if professional users were to leave the platform, taking with them all the people and organizations they currently keep loyal to Apple products. I don’t want to be too hard on Apple. The company is still incredibly strong and is doing better in some areas where it has been weak. By many accounts, Final Cut Pro X has improved greatly since its initial release, and some professional movie makers are giving it a chance. App Store review times are plummeting, and Apple is planning to allow developers to respond directly to App Store reviews. Swift is an exciting new programming language with a bright future, and it’s suitable for both compiled apps and scripts. You might argue that Apple and Airwalk aren’t comparable. For instance, although it may have gotten its start providing athletic shoes, Airwalk ultimately became a fashion company. But isn’t Apple similar in many respects? Apple opened its doors with the Apple I hobby kit, and by the mid-2000s, the iPod and its white earbuds were fashion mainstays. The Apple Watch is clearly intended to be a fashion item today. Even the MacBook, with its prominent usage in coffee shops, airports, and other public places, makes its own fashion statement. Despite these similarities, Apple is a much, much larger company than Airwalk ever was. Plus, Apple is making so much money and has so much cash that it can afford many more missteps than a plucky young footwear company. Perhaps most important, Apple can learn from the example of companies like Airwalk that fell from grace after losing sight of their most influential users. Here’s hoping Apple realizes the danger of diverting too much attention away from the Mac and its professional users.   Smile makes tools so you can have a productive day.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Peter Meyer  2017-02-06 10:37 Josh, I was thinking about this over the weekend, but came to a different conclusion. Relying on fashion is not the winning strategy for a company that is this large. Nor is relying on what used to sell - gizmos. I am an Apple computer/phone/watch/TV user. I'll probably buy AirPods. But as a stock holder, I don't want Apple to stay there. I want Apple to move into healthcare and financial services and be willing to abandon computer power users along the way. Shoes are a great analogy, they move to a diminishing market. I want Apple to thrive, and I think it is time to move out of the diminishing phone and computers business and into services. If I could delegate Apple resources, I'd put some of the best folks they have on healthcare and finance. What does that make the phone and Mac? Loss leaders in 2020. Important to have but not the future of the company. So I guess that I am hoping Apple does the reverse of your last paragraph. Thanks for letting me think aloud, Peter Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-06 13:46 There's a lot to be said for Apple and services, but it's a matter of convincing the right people to write up their thoughts for us. :-) I think Apple is making some smart moves in the healthcare and IT spaces, especially with its IBM partnership. But as someone who uses Apple computers professionally, I don't want to see Apple become like IBM, moving entirely out of the end-user market to focus on back-end stuff. The iPhone is still by far Apple's largest revenue source, and the Mac users who create things for it are the backbone of that market. Reply David   2017-02-06 10:38 The day that a teen puts a poster of Marco Arment on the wall of their bedroom is the day that I will believe that the professionals you're talking about with regards to Apple are comparable to Tony Hawk. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-06 13:46 Ha! Teens may not idolize developers, but they certainly enjoy the apps they produce, including maybe some of Marco's. You could argue that Snapchat today is what skateboarding was 20+ years ago, though that's sort of a lousy analogy. Another way to think about this is: imagine walking into a coffee shop and instead of MacBooks, everyone was working on Surface Pro tablets. Given enough scale, that'd certainly have a network effect. Something Gladwell describes in his book, which I didn't go into in the article, is how trends develop. You first have what he calls innovators, oddballs who do new things. Then you have other groups who translate those things for the masses, like mavens and connectors. My point is, to put it in Gladwell speak, if those innovators drop Apple for another platform, over time that could trickle down to the masses and quickly eat away Apple's bottom line. Reply David   2017-02-06 17:54 They may enjoy the apps, but I doubt that 1 in 100 of them know the name of the developer who wrote it. And that breaks the link between "I have to wear what Tony Hawk is wearing" and "I have to code on what Marco Arment is coding on." I can equally imagine -- in the coffee shop analogy -- the teens being horrified that the "old people" are using the same thing they are, and fleeing Apple en masse. Finally, I don't find Gladwell's arguments particularly convincing. He seems to me to regularly take a small part of a social science finding (10,000 hours of practice, eg) and blow it up into a much larger and simpler conclusion, one that makes a good pop-sci headline but doesn't really tells us much about the real world. The narrative at the moment seems to be that Apple is neglecting pros and that's going to cost them, but what I've mostly seen is a range of strained arguments about why it's going to cost them, ranging from possibly plausible to pretty outlandish. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:34 I agree about Gladwell, which is why I didn't go too much into his theories in the article. However, outside of the linked interview, his book was the best source for the Airwalk story. The problem with arguments in favor of the professional markets is that there are a lot of intangibles there. In the case of Airwalk, it likely made total sense to dump the pro skater market for consumers — I'm sure they made far, far more money from Foot Locker than local skate shops. However, that turned out to be an enormous mistake, one that wouldn't appear on any spreadsheet. Reply David   2017-02-07 10:44 I think I'd like to see more than an anecdote before I buy into a narrative that is highly convenient for the people telling and reading it. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 22:44 One might say the same thing about your arguments. There's a whole truckload of wishful thinking there. Just from a local perspective, the predominant healthcare provider in my area, Palo Alto Medical Foundation, has excellent computerized records and services. They work on Windows PCs, not Macs. Other medical professionals use tablets, though they're not iPads, because they have to link with their non-Apple computer systems. Which is to say, without a Mac backbone, medical providers are not going to be using Apple products and services. Sure there are some highly visible Macs on some popular medical TV shows, but again, those are the Macs you so blithely dismiss. Great product placement, by the way. As Josh says, Macs are at the core of Apple's business. Without the Mac, the iPhone is just another gadget, here today, gone tomorrow. You know, like the iPad. And without the Mac, there will be no Apple products in medicine. As for financial whatever, all Apple does now is provide an access point via Apple Pay for consumers to the real financial service providers. They don't actually provide any of those financial services, nor are they likely to do so. Though they make a tidy profit with every Apple Pay transaction. You want to buy a Mac on credit through Apple you'll be using a Barclaycard, one of the highest interest rate charge cards on the planet, to whom Apple is only an intermediate business. In other words, I don't think your ambitions for Apple growth are grounded in anything like reality. As for shoes being a diminishing market, what planet are you living on? As large third-world countries like China, Mexico and India grow more prosperous, shoes will continue to be a growth industry. Just like iPhones. Which is why Apple is working so hard to break into the Indian market with lower price, recycled iPhones. That's where the growth is for them—and for Nike. The iPhone is the primary driver for the App Store, Apple's most prosperous service niche. And the App Store sells apps. And apps for the App Store are developed on Macs. Without the Mac there would be no apps and no App Store and, for all practical purposes, no iPhone. And no Apple. While Microsoft's Surface PCs are not yet a dominant product, Microsoft is clearly thinking long term, hence their huge investment in product placement in the NFL. The Surface Studio is coming out this year and will eventually, I presume to predict, make a significant dent in Apple's base among design professionals. Unless, as Josh hopes, Apple begins to take their professional base seriously once again. If I were twenty years younger I would certainly take the Surface Pro seriously. I share Josh's hope, but I don't share his optimism. If the new MacBook Pro is Apple's idea of a professional computer, with only 16GB of RAM, they've lost their way big time. They've taken their obsession with thin well past the point of diminishing returns. In the meantime, Tim Cook is good at blowing smoke at financial analysts, but as has been pointed out elsewhere in this issue of TidBITS, Apple's record first quarter was a week longer than the same quarter last year. In other words, Cook is using accounting gimmicks to draw a false equivalency between the two. Adjusted for that extra week, Apple's sales and profits are far less rosy than Cook would have us believe. At best they are flat, year over year. Is Apple making lots of money right now? Sure. Even with no growth they're still a rich company with money to burn. But they don't appear to be burning any of it on serious R&D. Like, perhaps, a touch interface for the macOS that can compete with Microsoft. iOS does touch just fine. But Cook refuses to acknowledge the need for it in OS X. Apple is riding high right now. But there's an old expression, what goes up must come down. Put another way, in business if you're not growing, you're dying. Implicit in Josh's argument is the proposition that Apple may have reached the peak of it's growth and success. They won't fail overnight, but that doesn't mean they're not failing. If Tim Cook is not aware of that, as he seems not to be, then Apple will be going downhill from now on. There may be a blip of success here and there, but that won't halt the downward momentum. Tim Cook is a nice guy and Steve Jobs was a jerk. Still, some might say the biggest difference between them is the vision thing. Steve had it. Tim does not. But I think the biggest difference between them is that Steve Jobs would not tolerate mediocrity. Time Cook seems to tolerate it all to well. Thanks David for giving me a jumping off point for my rant. I would have made it anyway, but you gave me a convenient place to start. I agree with Josh's premise, but I'm more skeptical than he is. Josh is politely suggesting that Apple needs to return it's attention to the Mac and the wide range of professional users who depend on it. Unlike Josh, however, I feel no need to be polite. Tim Cook needs to wake the f*ck up. Reply David   2017-02-07 22:37 You're certainly welcome. None of what you said was in response to my actual points, enough that I was wondering if there was another David in the thread. Apparently not. If you'd like to engage with my actual arguments, you're welcome to do that, too. Reply Nicholas Croft  2017-02-14 02:50 The PC 'enthusiast' market (broad term, basically power users of yore) is the only growth/margin market in the PC business. Apple are leaving money on the table by not addressing the enthusiast. and... they are not mutually exclusive. But Timmah! has other priorities... Reply Zac Imboden   2017-02-06 15:06 What a thoughtful and well-written analysis. Regarding Peter Meyer's comments, I understand that Apple has it's own unique needs. What I would add is that what may be good for Apple (i.e. corporate expansion, diversification) may not be good for end users, specifically Mac users. I wish Apple to succeed as a company only as far as it concerns how they can continue to meet my needs and not theirs, my needs, not as a content revenue stream, an iPhone user, an iPad user, but as a MAC user. It appears to me that there is no longer any strong financial incentive for Apple to support and innovate their computer hardware and software as that segment continues to shrink in comparison to phone and content revenue. Continuing to complain about ridiculous mistakes in design and implementation and continuing to beg Apple to innovate and improve in the areas which matter the most to Mac users are losing propositions in the long run. If Apple wanted to do a great service to its various "niches", in my un-expert opinion, it would spin off the Mac and its system software and core apps into a separate company and let that company focus and innovate to meet the needs of its "niche" of Mac computer users at its own pace and peril. I'm not a investment guru, so I leave the financial merits of spin-offs for others. From an end-user endpoint, it seems to be the only way to get someone to pay closer attention to the very specific needs of computer users. Reply Travis Butler  2017-02-06 18:39 I think that would be courting the death of the Mac, honestly. As I argued in my other comment, the halo effect runs the other way - more people are buying Macs because they have used and liked Apple's consumer products. I think the main reason Macs have been bucking the overall decline in the computer industry is because they have Apple's strength in the consumer market to support them. If you cut the link there, you cut the main driving force for Mac market growth. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:19 Thanks for the kind words, Zac. However, I disagree with Apple spinning off the Mac. Tight integration with other Apple devices is still one of the Mac's strengths, and a spin-off would threaten that. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:20 I agree that the popularity of the iPhone and other Apple products helps drive Mac adoption. No argument there, and I think that's also still an important market for Apple. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 22:49 If Apple could value the Mac well enough to spin it off, they could value it enough to develop it internally. The problem is Apple doesn't seem to care one way or the other. Reply Derek Roff   2017-02-06 18:17 While Peter's suggestion that Apple get out of the hardware business strikes fear into my heart, I think it also misses Josh's key message. Why should a prudent investor like Peter assume that Apple can compete effectively in Services? This is an area where Apple has no particular expertise, and no intrinsic advantages. There are dozens of companies who understand Services better than Apple, and have both a deeper background and more agility. Airwalk survived as a fashion company, barely, and Apple might survive as an also-ran Services company, but as Josh indicates, this looks like the path to obscurity. Apple is a significant force in Services at the moment, because they are rich from hardware sales, and incredibly well known, from their integrated hardware, software, and lifestyle sales. Tossing all that out is, as Josh says, a losing strategy. Apple will not make its investors richer by proclaiming, "Think Conventionally". Reply Travis Butler  2017-02-06 18:30 Sigh. Another day, another 'Apple is doomed because they aren't catering to Important Users Like Me' article. The glaring flaw in this example is that it argues that people are drawn to Apple's consumer products because of the popularity of their computers among the elite - the halo effect. But if anything, the halo effect has run in the opposite direction, and has since the heyday of the iPod. People are buying Apple's consumer products, like the experience, and buying Macs to go with them. I've argued this before: Apple has, from the very first Apple ][, *always* catered to the ordinary user above the elite. When 'personal' computers were bulky S100 boxes that needed a separate dumb terminal and the arcane C/PM OS, Apple released a cute, streamlined all-in-one that hooked to a TV and booted into BASIC. When IBM introduced the designed-for-cubicles PC, Apple introduced the novice-user-friendly Mac. When smartphones were geeky tools, Apple released the iPhone. That's who they are. Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-06 18:44 So you're saying that none of your less-technical family, friends, or clients buy Apple hardware because of your recommendations? In my experience, most people who know they don't have the technical chops to make an informed decision buy based on social influence. Reply David   2017-02-06 21:27 Are his family & friends a sufficient sample to generalize? Reply Travis Butler  2017-02-07 04:51 Actually, seriously, yes. I've been asked for advice on *which* Mac to buy, but everyone I know who bought Mac in the last year decided to go that route on their own. Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-07 10:11 This is a discussion, not a research study. :-) Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-07 10:10 I obviously don't know the specifics, but unless you're well known for being platform agnostic, I doubt people would ask you for advice on other platforms. Your social influence to recommend Apple products is likely well known. Lots of people ask me for my opinions about what to buy, but they're always aware that I know Apple technology. But the article's point is that if you'd said, "Apple's hardware is stagnating and you'd be throwing money away if you didn't look at an Android phone or Windows PC" would those people ignore you and still buy Apple gear? In other words, if you as a tech influencer switched away from Apple gear, how many people would go with you eventually, purely because of your influence? Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:22 I'm not arguing that Apple is doomed. I can't count how many times I've written here something to the effect of "Apple is far from doomed." However, I do think shirking the professional market is an enormous mistake. Nor would I want Apple to drop or lose focus of its massively successful consumer line. The professional and consumer sides of Apple help build its strong ecosystem. Reply David   2017-02-07 10:50 2 people would go with me. Which would reduce Apple customers for the last quarter from 96 million people to 95,999,998. Even if there were 50,000 tech influencers who took 2 people with them, it would reduce Apple's customers from 96 million to 95,900,000 last quarter. (all numbers either approximate (customer numbers, people I influence) or made up (number of tech influencers)). Math done badly and on the fly. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 23:26 I'm not arguing that Apple is doomed, either, though I'm more cynical on the subject that Josh is. For one thing, doomed is a vague and melodramatic term. If Apple fails to innovate and improve the Mac, then their base of support will be eroded over time because, as I said before, the Mac is the core of Apple's business. Without it Apple's other business interests would fail to flourish. And that's putting it mildly. In my opinion, without the Mac there is no Apple. But I don't see Apple killing the Mac. After all, it's still making money. What I see happening, as Josh points out in more polite terms, is that the Mac appears to be declining in importance for Apple. This doesn't spell doom, but it does spell stagnation. Meanwhile, Apple competitors continue to innovate. As an artist, the Surface Studio is the first Windows PC that has ever piqued my interest. If Apple continues to rest on it's laurels Microsoft is going to eat their lunch. Now that they are making good hardware, Microsoft is playing in the same ballpark with Apple. And, like macOS X 10.12.x, Windows 10 is a solid and accessible OS. And there are areas, like cloud services, where Microsoft far exceeds Apple's success. So do Google and Amazon. Services aren't going to save Apple's bacon. The Mac is the only thing that can do that, not because it makes the most money, but because it's central to the success of every other Apple venture. What I don't understand is why Tim Cook doesn't seem to know this. His desultory remarks about the future of the Mac are not encouraging. Another incremental update to the iMac or the Mac mini isn't going to get the job done. Nor are incremental improvements to the macOS. As I've said before, at the top of my wish list is a touch screen interface for the macOS. Without this it's very hard to see how Apple is going to keep up with the competition. Reply has  2017-02-14 17:15 So glad I'm not the *only* [25-year Mac] user who can see this! HALF-A-BILLION people bought iPhones because they *wanted iPhones*! Not because some Mac fan told them to. The entire world's Macs could be raptured to silicon heaven tonight, and 95% of iPhone users wouldn't even notice the difference tomorrow. It is astonishingly egotistical, not to mention excruciatingly self-deluding/dishonest, for Mac fanboys to say that they and their beloved Macs are what sell iPhones, not the other way around. Next to such folks, even Toddler-in-Chief "The Donald" looks like Buddha by comparison. Reply Christian Kaatmann   2017-02-06 19:21 The thing that Apple is certainly doing right now - seen from a user perspective - is that _all_ of their systems are much more reliable now than they used to be. I very rarely have to reboot, if one app crashes the rest of the system carries on unperturbed, I can go seamlessly from my Mac to my iPhone to iCloud on a windows machine without ever loosing a comma in the text I'm working on. It's like magic compared to not so many years ago. And Apple has got us all happily hooked on its services with iCloud at the centre. And I mean happily, thinking of the days back with Excel 1.04, swapping disks on my Mac SE or more recently trying to keep my iMac from crashing every time I switched from Mail to Word to Excel to ... Apple keeps a lot of customers happy and deeply dependent. Reply Peter Meyer  2017-02-06 19:31 That is a great point. Thank you! Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:23 Apple does enjoy tremendous lock-in, which certainly gives it staying power. iCloud is one of the weaker service bundles, but it's bolstered by the popularity of the hardware, which in turn benefits from iCloud lock-in. Not to mention dependence on iMessage. Reply Peter Meyer  2017-02-06 19:30 A quick addition if you don't mind. I am going to express my opinion, not fact. I don't think that Apple will abandon the larger Mac and phone and iPod markets (or TV or iPads.) I am looking at these devices as critically important. Not important as computing devices, but highly valuable as data devices. What is the difference? Computing takes place in a small fairly closed environment. Data is fed by and then feeds a larger system. (I think of the Mac Pro as being about computing, the iPad and Apple TV as being about data.) If I look at this as an investor, I see that data system as services with end point devices. The devices are either commodity products or are really sophisticated at handling data to and from the user. That data is the core of the future services. (Again, this is me as businessman, not as the guy who is really enjoying this MBP right now). Apple should, absolutely should, stay in the end point market and make exceptionally exciting devices like an iPhone so light that you need a lanyard to hold it in place. Those devices are data portals, and the real economic engine for what might be the most valuable company on the planet will be the data services. They actually might subsidize the hardware experiments that many of us love. For those hardware experiments, my credit card vibrates in anticipation. My business mind is looking for services in healthcare and automobiles. The hardware is what we know, the services that we do not yet know will be our future, just as the pocket computer once was. So much for me being quick. Josh, Adam, thank you! Reply Herb Bowie  2017-02-06 20:16 The analogy seems a bit contrived, and the conclusions a bit overblown. Part of what we have always loved and respected about Apple is its intent and ability to skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it is. If we think about these issues from that perspective, we might make the following observations: 1. As device buses get increasingly powerful, and as the pace of technology change quickens, and as the desire for smaller computers increases, it will make sense for users to do "upgrades" by adding or swapping out peripherals, not through changes to the internals of their computers. 2. As SSD, memory, networks and microprocessors all get faster, the simple desire for ever bigger numbers -- faster chips, more RAM, etc. -- becomes less and less relevant for most users. 3. While Apple needs to provide core apps and services to make the average consumer happy, Apple's primary contribution to the larger app ecosystem is to make better tools for developers, not to make "Pro" level applications themselves. 4. As security becomes more and more of an issue, tight controls on the App store become increasingly important; however, third-party software suppliers still have the ability to deliver apps to their customers outside of the App store, so customers can have the best of both worlds. 5. As it becomes easier and easier to develop Mac applications, and as the Mac development tools grow stronger, and as the number of specialized apps continues to grow, it becomes ever harder to see why the Mac would need a special department for "Automation Technologies" for those few users who cannot find already developed solutions to their problems, yet who are also unable to develop new solutions themselves. So, yes, in all these cases, there are some short-term bumps in the road for many of us, and some more difficult issues for a few of us, but isn't this what we've always expected from Apple? Reply mike sanders  2017-02-06 21:53 Excellent response and a much more focussed overview, great respect to Josh but like so many "old" Apple users you still expect them to be a computer company which they no longer are. I have been a user since 1987 and an investor since the 2000s and have to say I am completely satisfied on both accounts. A very well run company which clearly knows where it is going just that it doesn't share it with us until the time is right. Have you seen the stock price today? Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:25 Per your point on automation — I think Apple sees Swift as eventually overtaking AppleScript. That's fine with me, but Apple also needs to continue to create automation tools for professionals who aren't programmers. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-07 23:47 I agree. Unfortunately, Apple has a habit of dropping the ball on good ideas and technologies. For example, iWeb was overtaken by the competition because Apple lost interest in developing it. The same goes for Aperture. Now Apple Script and Automator are threatened with extinction, with no accessible replacement in sight. Apple Script and Automator enable the user to plug right into the OS and their applications. They are essentially programmable apps. Swift, on the other hand, is a programming language not an application. It's hard to imagine a third party developing a program with Swift that will have the broad capabilities of Apple's native apps. If history is any guide, apprehension is called for. Reply has  2017-02-14 16:48 No, Apple sees *Siri* as the future of Automation for the billions of users who aren't programmers. The problem with this is that Siri-based Automation will be limited only to those capabilities Apple and App developers add to Siri. Which means that instead of a BILLION USERS adding their own Siri vocabulary for doing what what they want to do, there's only a million programmers adding what they *think* we users should have. Yet we ALREADY KNOW programmers can't be trusted to add everything we need—else we wouldn't have to learn Automation just to work around the endless limitations and stupidities in the Apps those programmers gave us in the first place! … All that said, AppleScript is just as *utterly useless* as Swift at making Automation accessible to the TWO BILLION users in the world today. So it's a failed design too. But at least it's one from which Apple could learn huge lessons in order to create NEW languages that finally do deliver TRUE USER AUTOMATION FOR ALL. Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-02-07 00:35 You forgot bonehead moves like killing Apple Displays, AirPort, and now it looks like the iPad lines will be next. Possibly even the desktop Macs. Tim Cook needs to be canned. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-07 10:26 Indeed, I should have mentioned the loss of Apple displays and the apparent abandonment of AirPort routers. The latter is a thorn in my side at the moment, since my Express is on its last legs, and I'm distrustful of others on the market. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-08 01:06 Right you are. Both Apple Displays and Airport routers have been overtaken by the competition because Apple has apparently lost interest in supporting and improving them. This has the look of a tradition at Apple. Or a disability, like ADD. There was a time when third-party routers did not support the Mac with decent setup software. Airport routers solved that problem, though they tended to be less capable than the competition. They had the virtue of being simple. That time is past. Though various routers handle the matter differently, their setup software has improved. For instance, I can get into a Comcast router's built-in setup software with a simple URL, as I did with Linksys routers in the past. AT&T has always bumped me to a web site where I entered the appropriate information and the web site passed it to the router. This was particularly useful in the old days when routers and modem settings often got corrupted. If something went wrong, pop, there I was at the AT&T setup page. Nowadays routers are more reliable and such problems are rare—though not unheard of. Apple eventually improved the simple Airport Base Station by including a hard drive that interfaced easily with Time Machine—the Airport Time Capsule, an appropriate name at the time. And the Time Capsule has improved over the years with a space saving tower configuration and larger hard drives. Though you can still get the Airport Extreme which is a simple router without the hard drive. It's comparably priced with similar routers, except that you still need an external modem, which might be a disadvantage, unless you're used to setting up modems. That said, I don't know why Apple is apparently dropping their WiFi product line. They work perfectly well. Perhaps sales have declined as service providers now so often provide their own routers and independent modems are less common. Airport routers still require an external modem, which puts them behind the curve. I used to like a separate modem because they tended to fail more often that routers. But now I rent my router from Comcast and if it fails for any reason I just pop down to the Xfinity store and get a replacement. The same goes for AT&T. I haven't had occasion to set up an Airport router in years. Still, I don't think it's a good reason not to get a replacement Airport Express if your Airport Extreme orTime Capsule is still working OK. Current models have the fastest WiFi, 802.11ac, and they are still for sale on the Apple web site, as is the Airport Express. Replacing the Express seems to me to be simpler than regigering your entire system with a new router and a new repeater. But then if your router is also having issues, there are less expensive alternatives to the Airport, depending on your setup. Reply Jean-Pierre SMITH  2017-02-07 04:37 Great analogy and thinking, for the Mac platform. I liked the idea the combination of (1) techical brilliance, as seen by the recognised "experts" and (2) some hype (better call it "intelligent design") is a key factor of success for the Mac. Remove one of the two pillars and the structure collapses. To remember, I still have on my LC-475's screen saver (not used any more) the picture of a snail carrying on its back a rival PC's Intel CISC processor. These old macs used Motorola RISC processors, deemed faster by the "experts". You may have called to the bar Michelin, whose tyres for trucks (trucking fleets are the tyre equivalent to the Mac's "expert" users) are in demand for their durability (mileage), while car drivers don't measure mileage but simply benefit from it without knowing. Car tyres benefit directly from R&D invested in truck tyres just as the Mac for me [ordinary Joe] directly benefits from the Mac used, misused and challenged by its professional users (the "experts"). I am not so sure, though, the above analogy works for the iPhone, iPad and iWatch lines (is it still true that the iPhone for the Presidents is called "Blackberry"?). Thanks for the brain teaser. Reply Nicholas Croft  2017-02-12 23:04 The PC 'enthusiast' (segment of the PC) market stands alone with growth and high margins. As Apple are, effectively out of the pro market... Why not... Sell the macOS for $500 - restricted to 6 core+ (ie X99) motherboards, only from (a few) vetted vendors. This is NOT suggesting that 'clones' get in. Its a way for Pro's to Roll Their Own - yeah, its similar (to clones) but not quite the same. Upsides: No manufacturing costs. Pure profit once initial outlay of programming is covered. This is a very different time to when Apple ONLY made good money on their desktop lines ie the Scully/Spindler/Amelio years. Reply has  2017-02-14 16:13 "Die-hard Mac users kept Apple afloat in the dark years" This is such a non-justification, it's embarrassing. SO WHAT? Apple owes all those die-hard Mac users ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. If Apple can win new 1Bn-user iDevice markets by dumping its old 10M-user Mac market, that's exactly what it *should do*. A small company chases chickenfeed markets because that's the MOST it can hope to win. If it wants to become a large company, it uses that initial income to expand the company to the point it can now tackle big markets. Big markets provide economies of scale, and in e.g. personal computing generates massive network effects too—which in turn creates more sales, more revenue, more profits. To then squander significant time and manpower by still chasing all those little old chickenfood markets is HOW NOT TO DO BUSINESS! It's a free invitation to all their more focused, less sentimental, competitors to steal those big markets for themselves. Just as Google and Amazon are now doing!

Samsung sold 76.8 million smartphones in the fourth quarter, giving it a market share of 17.8 percent, but it was just beaten by Apple, which sold 77 million iPhones for a 17.9 percent share, according to figures from Gartner. The fourth quarter is usually a strong one for Apple, boosted by holiday sales of the new generation of iPhones it releases each September, said Anshul Gupta, a research director at Gartner. For Samsung, though, 2016 ended particularly badly, dominated by the fiasco around the recall of its incendiary Galaxy Note7. Super-phones like the Note7 could have accounted for 10 to 15 percent of Samsung's smartphone sales in the period before its recall, said Gupta, but Samsung lost more than that: There was also the damage to its brand. It could bounce back sooner rather than later, though, as it has a new flagship phone coming out at the end of March. Apple, meanwhile, is expected to wait until September before unveiling new iPhones. This year will mark the iPhone's 10th anniversary, and the next model is widely expected to be something special, so Apple fans may delay replacing phones until then, said Gupta. That would leave the way clear for Samsung to move back into the lead from this quarter. That pattern showed up last year too: Although it dominated the fourth quarter, Apple was a distant second over the full year, with market share of just 14.4 percent over the year, far behind Samsung's 20.5 percent, and the situation was similar the previous year. While the giants slug it out, a more interesting battle is going on just beneath them, as the next three companies in the fourth-quarter smartphone rankings are all Chinese. Huawei Technologies is in third place with a worldwide smartphone market share of 9.5 percent, with fourth and fifth taken by Oppo (6.2 percent) and BBK Communication Equipment (5.6 percent), two companies that many consider to be part of the same conglomerate. Gartner treats them separately because, whatever their shareholding structure, they operate independently, each with their own product team, Gupta said. BBK, almost unknown in the West, is now the number one smartphone brand in China, he said. A year ago, though, that honor went to Oppo, and the year before that, Huawei. Previous years saw the Chinese market topped by Xiaomi and Samsung. These Chinese companies have pushed Apple and Samsung aside in their home market, and are expanding across South Asia. "Even in their current expansion, Oppo is not focusing just on emerging markets, but also on developed markets like Australia," said Gupta, so we may soon see them climbing up the rankings in Europe and the U.S too. The key ingredients for that are already in their products, he said. "Oppo and BBK make great phones in terms of feature set. They have integrated high-end features like dual cameras and fast charge."

In light of the rise of emerging technologies, partners that can add unique layers of value are gaining greater prominence. Whether vertical or technology specific, forward-thinking partners now realise that staying vanilla seldom brings success, as customers place a premium on niche experts. Yet in parallel to the changing role of the partner, new influencers of IT are emerging across the business, with 72 per cent of IT buying decisions now made outside of the IT department. This exclusive ARN roundtable, in association with Telstra, discussed the changing dynamics of the channel in 2017, outlining how partners can specialise in a digital world, while attracting a new breed of buyer.

 A $20 billion investment firm dumped its huge trade in Apple — and bet on Alphabet and Microsoft Rachael Levy Feb. 14, 2017, 4:02 PM 11,093 facebook linkedin twitter email print Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Getty Images/Stephen Brashear Billionaire Chase Coleman's Tiger Global exited its big Apple bet last quarter while making a $148 million bet on Alphabet and investing $132 million in Microsoft. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the firm made a $1.1 billion bet on Apple, and over the course of 2016 started shedding the shares, regulatory filings show. Tiger dropped $407 million in remaining shares of Apple in the fourth quarter of last year, filings show. According to the 13F, Tiger made the following moves during the fourth quarter: It increased its stake in Priceline by 36%, holding a $1.84 billion stake at the end of the quarter It increased its stake in JD.com by 37%, holding a stake worth $1.16 billion It took a new position in Fiat valued at $481 million It took a new position in Alphabet valued at $147.5 million It took a new position in Microsoft valued at $131.6 million Bloomberg analyzed the data based off of a regulatory filing that the $20 billion investment firm filed February 14. The quarterly filing, called a 13F, lists the long stock positions of investment firms. The positions are current as of 45 days prior, so it is possible that Tiger Global has since changed its positions.  Tiger Global Management invests in private and public markets and manages about $20 billion firmwide. The firm managed $5.9 billion in hedge fund assets as of mid-year 2016, according to the Hedge Fund Intelligence Billion Dollar Club ranking.  SEE ALSO: A partner at $20 billion investment firm Tiger Global has left NOW WATCH: This behavior could kill your chances in a Goldman Sachs interview Loading video...

Break♦ing 9♦1♦1 (noun): Newly Received Information About an Event That Is Currently Occurring or Developing. Home contact us News Tips Video Viral news Politics Entertainment Crime Tech Weather Terrorism HOME CONTACT US NEWS TIPS February 15, 2017 | 10:30 PM Apple said to mull China supplier for next-gen iPhone screen February 15, 2017 | 10:30 PM Home » politics » Apple said to mull China supplier for next-gen iPhone screen Tech, U.S. February 15, 2017 Apple is in discussions with China’s BOE Technology Group Co. to supply next-generation displays for future iPhones, a key component that’s being provided by a Samsung Electronics Co. unit, people familiar with the matter said. Apple’s been testing BOE’s active-matrix organic light-emitting diode screens for months but hasn’t decided if it’ll add the Chinese company to its roster of suppliers, one of the people said, asking not to be named talking about private negotiations. BOE, one of the country’s largest screen makers, is spending close to 100 billion yuan ($14.5 billion) building two AMOLED plants in the southwestern province of Sichuan in anticipation of future business. Talks are at an early stage and it’s unlikely to supply the next iPhone, but BOE is banking on outfitting the one in 2018 or later, the person said. If BOE is selected for OLED, it will become the first known future supplier of the next-generation screens to Apple outside of South Korea and Japan — a triumph for a Beijing-based company best known for computer and TV displays. The U.S. company is exploring alternatives to address a global shortage of OLED displays as it prepares to adopt the sharper, more power-efficient technology for its next iPhones, catching up with rivals such as Samsung and Huawei Technologies Co. Apple declined to comment, and BOE declined to comment on talks with customers. The display is one of the most expensive components of a smartphone. OLED screens are more difficult to produce, making Apple beholden to suppliers still working to manufacture the displays in mass quantities. The world’s four biggest suppliers of smartphone displays — Samsung Display Co., Sharp Corp., LG Display Co. and Japan Display Inc. — are said to have insufficient capacity to equip all new iPhones this year, a constraint that may persist into 2018. That means Apple may be forced to adopt OLED in just a single version of its device this year, the 10th anniversary of the smartphone’s debut. “It’s an opportunity for BOE as Apple is known to seek multiple suppliers for one component,” said James Yan, research director for Counterpoint Research in Beijing. “But it’s unlikely to challenge Samsung because it is able to roll out high-quality screens at a steady capacity.” BOE’s shares had climbed 1.3 percent in Shenzhen by midday, outperforming a mostly unchanged benchmark A-share index. Universal Display Corp., which licenses and sells technology to makers of OLED screens, rose as much as 9.7 percent, the most since November. Founded in 1993 after employees took over an ailing producer of electron tubes, Beijing-based BOE is the world’s largest manufacturer of LCD panels by market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. BOE, which started out as Beijing Orient and enjoyed the support of a government keen to champion local technology players, is now building a 46.5 billion-yuan flexible AMOLED plant in Chengdu. While it’s ramping up capacity, it’s likely to miss the next iPhone. That sixth-generation factory won’t crank out a single screen till the summer, while new iPhones typically go on sale in the fall. When that plant is up to full capacity, it’ll be able to put out 48,000 glass substrates a month, BOE said in an e-mailed statement, referring to the thin surfaces from which screens are carved out. Another plant in Mianyang with the same capacity and investment is expected to start production only about two years later. The company currently operates only a small OLED factory in remote Inner Mongolia. Eventually, when its two plants are up and running, it expects to be able to manufacture 1.6 million square-meters of flexible AMOLED glass substrates a year, slightly more than researcher IHS’ estimate for total global production in 2016. Apple typically introduces new technologies for its iPhones across all models when they’re unveiled, usually in September, as it did with 3D Touch and Apple Pay. Using different core, user-facing technology in the same iPhone generation would be an unusual step. All iPhone 7 models have liquid-crystal display screens. The U.S. company and Samsung have an exclusive OLED supply deal covering 2017, people with knowledge of the agreement have said. Yet that doesn’t guarantee the South Korean technology giant can make enough displays to sate iPhone demand, particularly given Samsung needs to outfit its own slate of upcoming gadgets. Some analysts estimate that Apple could sell as many as 90 million iPhones in the last three months of 2017 alone.

You can fix a frozen iPhone in 10 seconds without a computer or any other accessories so that you can get back with your day. You can also use this to fix a frozen iPad. Advertisement Sometimes a frozen iPhone will not let you do any type of activity, and often you are stuck on-screen in an app or on a home screen. This can also help if your iPhone is stuck off and won’t turn on, but mainly you will use this when the iPhone is stuck on with an app or something on-screen. This is a hard-reboot, but some people will call it a hard-reset. Don’t worry about the reset part of this name. You are not resetting the iPhone like you would with a factory reset that wipes all the data clean. Fix your frozen iPhone in seconds. This may not solve all of your problems. If the iPhone freezes regularly you may need to remove an app or perform an actual factory reset on your iPhone and start from scratch. It’s normal for an iPhone to freeze once or twice in a year after you install a bad app or run into a problem. If things continue to freeze or go bad, there may be a hardware problem that requires a trip to an Apple Store. Advertisement Fix a Frozen iPhone in 10 Seconds You can fix a frozen iPhone in about ten seconds by pressing and holding the power and home button at the same time until the iPhone restarts. Once the iPhone screen changes from the frozen state to showing an Apple logo or just a blank screen you can let go. This is a hard reboot. By pressing and holding the home button and power button you force the iPhone to restart. This is similar to holding the power button on a Macbook or laptop or just unplugging a device from power. You’ll see this screen when you fix a frozen iPhone. You don’t need to hold the power buttons after the phone restarts. You should not lose any data doing this, but if you were typing a message, document or working on something inside of an app you may lose that small bit of work depending on when it saved. You don’t need to be plugged in to power or connected to a computer to use this method of fixing a frozen iPhone. If the battery is low, it may help to plug-in to power, but otherwise you are good to do this anytime the iPhone is frozen. Advertisement This works on any iPhone, iPad or iPod touch on any version of Apple’s software including iOS 5, iOS 6, iOS 7, iOS 8, iOS 9 and the upcoming iOS 10. Read: iOS 9 Tips and Tricks For users who consistently have this problem, it may be good to uninstall a problem app or make sure it is up to date. If you never restart your iPhone or iPad and you have this happen once or twice a year you can often avoid it by restarting you iPhone once every other week. If this is a continual problem you should consider backing up the iPhone to iCloud or your computer and then performing a factory reset. This takes longer to complete, but it can resolve problems. If you choose to to restore from an iPhone backup and the problem continues you may need to hard reset the iPhone and then set it up as a new device.

Carpool Karaoke: The Series, based on the popular segment from The Late Late Show with James Corden, will feature 16 celebrity pairings "riding along in a car together as they sing tunes from their personal playlists" and "surprise fans who don't expect to see big stars belting out tunes one lane over." Apple said the series will feature James Corden, Will Smith, Billy Eichner, Metallica, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Ariana Grande, Seth MacFarlane, Chelsea Handler, Blake Shelton, Michael Strahan, John Cena, Shaquille O’Neal, and many more. The series is expected to have a different host every episode. Apple purchased the rights to Carpool Karaoke, produced by James Corden, Ben Winston, and Eric Pankowski, in July 2016 in an effort to drive users towards Apple Music. The series will consist of 16 half-hour episodes, and Apple's version will reportedly feature a format "that is more of an interview series."Tags: Apple Music, Carpool Karaoke Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: ETonline - 2 days ago< > Embed 'Carpool Karaoke: The Series' Gets Its First Trailer -- Your First Look at the Celeb Pairings! 00:59 'Carpool Karaoke: The Series' is Apple Music's first show, and it's is jam-packed with stars.

By Zack Whittaker for London Calling | July 4, 2012 -- 14:03 GMT (07:03 PDT) | Topic: Apple HTC has won a U.K. High Court case after a judge said that the Taiwanese smartphone maker has not infringed four of Apple's European-held patents. However, Judge Christopher Floyd said that three of the four patents were invalid, according to Bloomberg.  The only patent that was ruled to be valid relates to Apple's photo-management software, but HTC did not infringe on it. The other three invalid patents relate to Apple's multi-touch software, alphabet-changing software, and the iPhone and iPad's slide-to-unlock feature. The same four patents are to be tested in a German court later this year.  Apple is fighting HTC, and Korea-based Samsung on four continents in more than a dozen countries, including the United States. As The Verge reports, the U.K. High Court ruling does not have any direct affect any other ongoing case outside the country.  The ruling comes on an ordinary working day in Britain, despite our American cousins enjoying a day off to celebrate more than 230 years away from the cruel, heartless rule of the British monarchy. It also comes only a few days after Apple saw an emergency request to U.S. International Trade Commission, which has the power to ban the import of phones to the country, to seek a U.S. Customs ban on HTC smartphones. A HTC spokesperson said: "We remain disappointed that Apple continues to favour competition in the courtroom over competition in the marketplace," but was pleased with the ruling. Apple had no additional statement beyond: "We think competition is healthy, but competitors should create their own original technology, not steal ours." Apple did not say whether or not it would appeal the decision at the U.K. Court of Appeal.

According to the data, global sales of smartphones to users totaled 432 million units during the quarter, an increase of 7 percent compared to the year before. Perhaps most notably, Q4 2016 saw Apple leapfrog Samsung to become the number 1 global smartphone vendor…. In Q4 2016, Apple sold roughly 77 million iPhones, up from 71.5 million compared to the year before. That growth pushed Apple to 17.9 percent of the smartphone market, a 2 percent increase year-over-year. Samsung, on the other hand, saw shipments fall from 83.4 million to 76.7 million, thus causing its market share to slide from 20.7 percent to 17.8 percent. It has taken eight quarters for Apple to regain the No. 1 global smartphone vendor ranking, but the positions of the two leaders have never been so close, with only 256,000 units difference. “The last time Apple was in the leading position was in the fourth quarter of 2014, when its sales were driven by its first ever large-screen iPhone 6 and 6 Plus,” said Anshul Gupta, research director at Gartner. With that in mind, here’s how the smartphone industry looks in terms of Q4 2016 market share: Apple – 17.9 percent Samsung – 17.8 percent Huawei – 9.5 percent Oppo – 6.2 percent BBK Communication Equipment – 5.6 percent For 2016 as a whole, smartphone sales totaled nearly 1.5 billion, up around 5 percent from the year before. In terms of vendors, however, Samsung reigned supreme. The company shipped 306.4 million smartphones, giving it 20.5 percent of the market. Apple shipped 216.06 million smartphones for 14.4 percent of the market. Samsung’s share is down 2 percent year-over-year, while its shipments were down roughly 14 million. Apple saw its share fall from 15.9 percent to 14.4 percent, while shipments were down 9 million units. Samsung and Apple both lost market share to up and coming Chinese manufacturers such as Huawei and Oppo, both of which saw an increase in their share year-over-year. This is a trend that has taking shape for several recent quarters. Finally, as far as operating systems are concerned, Android obviously has the lead here. Google’s operating system holds 81.7 percent of the market, down 1 percent year-over-year. iOS, however, holds 17.9 percent, which is up .2 percent compared to the year before. Read the full report below: Gartner Says Worldwide Sales of Smartphones Grew 7 Percent in the Fourth Quarter of 2016 Fierce Battle Between Apple and Samsung to Hold the No. 1 Global Smartphone Ranking Global sales of smartphones to end users totaled 432 million units in the fourth quarter of 2016, a 7 percent increase over the fourth quarter of 2015, according to Gartner, Inc. The fourth quarter of 2016 saw Apple leapfrog past Samsung to secure the No. 1 global smartphone vendor position (see Table 1). In 2016 overall, smartphone sales to end users totaled nearly 1.5 billion units, an increase of 5 percent from 2015 (see Table 2). “This is the second consecutive quarter in which Samsung has delivered falling quarterly smartphone sales,” said Anshul Gupta, research director at Gartner. “Samsung’s smartphone sales declined 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 and its share dropped by 2.9 percentage points year on year.” “Samsung’s smartphone sales started to drop in the third quarter of 2016, and the decision to discontinue the Galaxy Note 7 slowed down sales of its smartphone portfolio in the fourth quarter,” added Mr. Gupta. “The withdrawal of the Galaxy Note 7 left a gap in its large-screen phone range.” Samsung also faced growing competition in the midtier and entry-level smartphone segments from Huawei, Oppo, BBK and Gionee, which all grew their sales each quarter. Closest Quarter Ever Between Samsung and Apple It has taken eight quarters for Apple to regain the No. 1 global smartphone vendor ranking, but the positions of the two leaders have never been so close, with only 256,000 units difference. “The last time Apple was in the leading position was in the fourth quarter of 2014, when its sales were driven by its first ever large-screen iPhone 6 and 6 Plus,” said Mr. Gupta. “This time it achieved it thanks to strong sales of its flagship phones — the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus; it also benefited from the weakened demand for Samsung’s smartphones in mature markets such as North America and Western Europe, and in some mature markets in Asia such as Australia and South Korea.

Huawei’s premium smartphone offering has helped it to reduce the gap with Samsung during the fourth quarter of 2016, with a difference of 36 million units. In the same period last year, the gap between the two vendors was more than 50 million units. “Huawei is poised to reduce the gap further with the No. 2 global smartphone vendor,” said Mr. Gupta. “Mate 9 with Alexa will start shipping into the U.S. in the first quarter of 2017.” Offering high-performance, front-facing cameras and fast charging smartphones led Oppo to maintain the No. 1 positon in China during the fourth quarter of 2016. Its strong position in China and continued growth of sales in the markets outside China have helped Oppo position itself as the No. 4 smartphone vendor worldwide. BBK’s focus on quality, design and strong branding initiatives has positioned it as a strong mobile phone brand in China and India. BBK continued its hold on the No. 2 position in China and was marginally ahead of Huawei during the fourth quarter of 2016. BBK’s strong performance in India, where its sales grew by 278 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, and more than 363 percent in 2016 overall, allowed it to emerge as the No. 5 smartphone vendor worldwide. Top Chinese brands such as Oppo, BBK, Huawei, ZTE, Xiaomi and Lenovo are aggressively expanding into markets outside China, where they will continue to disrupt the top smartphone players in 2017. “Samsung needs to successfully launch the next Galaxy flagship phone in order to continue the momentum Galaxy S7 generated, and win back lost customers by launching a new large screen and stylus-equipped smartphone,” said Mr. Gupta.

In 2016 overall, Android also grew its market share by 3.2 percentage points to reach an 84.8 percent share, and was the only OS to grow market share year on year. “The entry of Google’s Pixel phone has made the premium Android smartphone offering more competitive, while the re-entry of HMD (Nokia) in the basic (midtier) smartphone category, is set to further increase the competition in emerging markets,” said Mr. Gupta.

Trump seems keen on bullying Tim Cook to open a factory in the USA without actually detailing specifics, and while Apple has stayed out of the fray so far, new comments from Apple CFO Luca Maestri indicate that Apple won’t be shutting up shop in China any time soon. Don't Miss: T-Mobile just fixed the worst problem with its unlimited plans As The Verge spotted, Maestri was speaking to a Goldman Sachs conference yesterday when he answered a question about overseas manufacturing: “One of the points that we are making in Washington is the fact that we have been a very large contributor to the US economy during the last decade,” Maestri said. “We made billions of investments in the United States. In the last 10 years, we created about 2 million jobs in this country — in the developer community in our retail stores in our call centers and through the supplier chain.” Maestri went on to talk more about Apple’s US-located call centers, and how it is “very, very difficult to speculate” on Apple’s manufacturing plans given that Trump has outlined no specific policies yet. He did, however, point out that a border tax on imported goods “would end up burdening the end consumer.” Reading between the lines, it looks like another attempt by Apple to take iPhone manufacturing off the table for discussions with Trump. Apple seems willing to move ancillary services, like support centers, back to the US, but moving the entire iPhone supply chain would be orders of magnitude more difficult. This is far from the first time that iPhone manufacturing has been in the news. Shortly after Trump’s electoral victory, Apple reportedly asked its subsidiaries to examine the feasibility of iPhone manufacturing — which caused Breitbart to run with the (untrue) story “Silicon Valley Bows to Trump: Apple to Build iPhones in America.” Trending right now: Pioneer’s new headphones solve the iPhone 7’s dumbest problem The biggest caveats in Verizon’s new ‘unlimited’ plan This tiny box lets Alexa control anything that plugs into a wall See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next The LG G6 might beat the Galaxy S8 where it matters most BGR News Make The Switch Now SpectrumSponsored Wristband monitors your blood alcohol content while you drink Yahoo Tech You should be excited about the iPhone 8 even if you hate the iPhone BGR News Astronomers just found a piping hot ‘Super Earth’ BGR News A Jaw-Dropping 21-Month 0% APR Card Is Here NextAdvisorSponsored Unlimited plans: Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T and Sprint, compared CNET Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo Finance

Q. Is it possible to talk with Siri on non-Apple devices? The short answer is no, Siri is a feature only available from Apple. It is the voice-controlled Intelligent Personal Assistant installed on Apple devices. Controlling devices with voice commands are hot right now, and Apple Siri has plenty of company. Microsoft has Cortana. Google has Google Voice. Samsung has Viv. Amazon has Alexa. Each has a common set of abilities, along with capabilities unique to that assistant. For example, any of them can tell you the weather, but only Siri can play content on AppleTV, and only Alexa can order products from Amazon. There is also a wide variety of devices to support these assistants. In addition to laptops, tablets, and phones, a new category of desktop device has appeared in the last year. The only one so far to get much traction is Amazon Echo, which is a line of devices ranging from $50 to $150. We are still in the early-adopter stage of desktop voice assistants, but there is an abundance of interesting developments to explore. Note that while Siri is Apple-only, most of the other assistants are available on multiple models via an app. Q. I have a small room inside my house where the light switch is in an inconvenient place. I have to awkwardly fumble around to reach it. Can home automation help? Because you mentioned “home automation,” I need to start with a warning. Home automation is a loosely defined term that includes a mix of products and services. Many of them show great promise, but they are not fully baked yet. There are incompatible standards, a device from company A is unlikely to work with a device from company B. Some vendors have gone out of business, stranding users. Often a device will solve one problem only to create two new problems. I will write about home automation in the coming months, but at the moment, my advice is to steer clear. Wait until the products mature. Now back to your light switch. When I was very young, my grandmother fell down the cellar steps because the switch inside the cellar door was in an odd place. Fortunately, she escaped with only a few bruises. It may seem like overkill for some, but I think switch placement is about safety as much as convenience, especially in homes built before modern electrical codes. I had a similar safety issue in my garage, and I solved it with the help of a licensed electrician and a wall switch with a built-in occupancy sensor. These switches sense movement in the room and turn on the power when needed. Better models include two sensors, one for motion and one for ambient light, so the light only turns on when the room is both occupied and dark. In the right situation, sensor switches are a worthwhile investment. Q. My phone’s battery no long-er lasts an entire day. The battery seems to go from 20% to empty very quickly. What can I do besides replace the phone? Try restarting the phone. A simple off-on cycle never hurts and often helps. If the problem remains, the next step is to look for an app that consumes too much power. Newer phones have a Battery Setting screen that lists which apps use the most power. With this information, you may be able to put your phone’s power consumption on a diet. When these software fixes do not work, it is time to look at hardware. Is the phone still under warranty? If the phone is old enough to be out of warranty, the battery is probably near the end of its life. Generally when a battery ages, the battery meter becomes less dependable. There are apps that reveal a phone’s battery cycle count, which is a good indicator to determine if the battery has developed a fault, or has merely been used up . If you work though the steps above and still do not have enough power, the solution is to add a bigger battery. Mophie (mophie.com) makes a line of “Juice Pack” phone cases that incorporate a battery. They come in different sizes, everything from small enough to add just a few hours to very large multi-day workhorses. A good battery case will add a few hours of usability each day, and it will add many months to the overall lifetime of the phone itself.

More videos James Packer returns to Crown board A management shake-up at Crown Resorts, after a horror run in 2016, could leave investors a little confused. Crown Resorts shares slumped 14 per cent in a single day last October when it emerged 18 of its employees were detained in a police sting covering several Chinese cities targeting allegedly illegal marketing of gambling junkets. It later revealed that VIP turnover had plunged by 45 per cent over the first 23 weeks of the December half.  The Star managed to post an incredibly strong result for the December half year, but only because it got lucky against the VIP high rollers that did show up to its gaming tables.  Related Content Packer returns to Crown board after company's horror year James Packer's annus horribilis is now complete with Crown's global retreat The Star boss, Matt Bekier, spoke of how the gaming operator went from a "freakishly bad" win rate against its high rollers previous to year to a freakishly good one last year. But after normalising its financial performance - to remove the effect of its good luck against its gambling clients - revenue and earnings were both down. This includes gambling volumes from its VIP business "following the detention of Crown Resorts employees in China in October 2016." Advertisement Bekier said it is driving the group strategy to diversify its client base away from the North Asia market.  "We are executing against our strategy of diversifying our international revenues, including the south-east Asia VIP and Asian premium mass (market). We continue to assess the north Asian VIP business as the China situation develops," said Bekier.  SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Matt Bekier, spoke of how the gaming operator went from a "freakishly bad" win rate against its high rollers previous to year to a freakishly good one last year. Photo: Dan Peled He emphasised to analysts how careful the company has become when it comes to the Chinese high rollers.  "We obviously want to be cautious because we don't have all the facts on the table now."  SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link James Packer would not have been pleased with The Star's results.  Photo: Justin Chin "At this point we are not taking any risks" and said the casino operator is "not responding to customers we don't know."  The stock rose after the market warmed to the strong top line numbers and another increase in its dividend. Group revenue increased 11 per cent to $1.23 billion, and statutory net profit was up more than 135 per cent to $141.8 million, driven largely by a near doubling in The Star's win rate against its VIP gamblers from 0.88 per cent to 1.62 per cent. It's not the sort of luck which will hold, but Bekier assured analysts the results so far this year indicate the "satisfactory growth" so far this year despite continuing disruption from its multi billion dollar refurbishment and development pipeline in Sydney and Queensland.  And while volumes from its VIP business continue to be impacted from the "trends" from late last year, the company said, but gross revenue from the remaining business increased by double digit levels compared to the prior December half.  Follow CBD on Twitter.

It also kicked off a trend which saw many OEMs start to introduce similar security features as well. However it seems that Touch ID could soon be replaced on the iPhone, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. According to the latest investor note from Kuo, he claims that Apple will remove Touch ID from the bottom part of the iPhone 8. Instead Apple is expected to replace it with what he is calling a “Function area”. It is unclear as to what this function area will be for, but it has been speculated that maybe it could end up being similar to the Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pros. As to what could replace Touch ID, Kuo suggested that biometric security will still be present, but he did not detail what it could be. However previously we have heard rumors that facial/iris scanning tech could be a possibility, but do take it with a grain of salt for now. According to Kuo, the removal of Touch ID and the inclusion of the function area is expected to give the phone about 5.15-inches of usable display real estate, but the overall face of the device is apparently 5.8-inches. Kuo also claims that the iPhone 8 will pack a larger battery thanks to Apple adopting a stacked “substrate-like” PCB mainboard. Kuo has been pretty accurate with his predictions in the past, but this does seem like a pretty huge departure for Apple in terms of function and design, so like we said maybe it’s a good idea to take it with a grain of salt for now.

Reuters/Beck Diefenbach Apple MacBook Pro 2016 buyers were more or less happy with the device’s performance. However, when it came to battery performance, they were thoroughly disappointed. Consumer reports even suspended its recommendation after testing the device. The MacBook Pro 2017 device is expected to get major upgrades to its battery. Apple is said to be making a proprietary chip that can take away some of the load off the device’s Intel processor. Moreover, the macOS Sierra 10.12.3 has reportedly removes bugs that drain the battery away. According to Tech Times, there are certain MacBook Pro 2016 tips and tricks that can significantly enhance the device’s battery life. Users should use Safari, instead of any other browser, even Chrome. This is because Safari performs the best for the MacBook Pro 2016 when it comes to power usage as the program has been designed specifically to not use the AMD graphics processor. Thus, even when a user is using graphics-heavy pages such as Google Maps, it won’t drain much of the battery. Most people already know that background applications drain away a lot of battery. Background has to be cleaned at intervals to remove apps that are not being used currently. All browser tabs must be closed when not in use. If users want to extract 45-60 minutes extra usage from their Apple MacBook Pro 2016, they should watch videos only in full screen mode and also deactivate the closed captioning. Within this state, the laptop draws significantly less power. While these are the main tips to decrease Apple MacBook Pro 2016 battery drainage, CNET has also advised users to dim the screen even though the new screens are 30 percent more power efficient. Apple has shrunk the battery size from 95.5 watt-hours of capacity for the 2015 15-inch MacBook Pro to 76 watt-hours for the 2016 15-inch MacBook Pro. Users must also be aware of the USB devices they are using. These devices fire up the laptop’s communication system that otherwise snooze in a low-power state. Apple MacBook Pro 2016 users should always unplug dongles once they are done with their work. The new USB-C ports are amazing only when one has the right cables and peripherals. The Apple MacBook Pro 2017 is a highly-anticipated device that may come with an Intel Kaby Lake processor and QHD+ Display that may significantly improve battery life.

"Facebook could easily become the world's largest entertainment company, one that is worthy of a far higher multiple than it gets," the "Mad Money" host said. The same goes for Apple, Cramer said. Analysts who tell the story of Apple are looking at it as if it is some sort of dead end of innovation. Yet they are forgetting that the iPhone device has a steady built-in stream of revenue that continues to grow. Cramer found this to be reminiscent of Gillette, with users paying a fortune for razors over the span of their lifetime. Hence, Trian, the investment firm run by Nelson Peltz, announced a hefty stake in Proctor & Gamble. "If we looked at Apple through the same lens as Gillette, it might very well be the best stock a man can get," Cramer said. Rafael Marchante | Reuters Cramer is sick and tired of investors doubting that the stock market could really power higher. It is the real deal, he said, and he decided to prove it. "It is one of the oldest theories when it comes to stocks that the transports have to confirm the strength in the Dow industrials before you can trust a rally … that is exactly what is happening," Cramer said. The theory of transports pertains to the notion that the transports group must make a new high at the same time as the Dow for the market to have solid grounding. Copper is often used as a barometer for the health of the global economy. Naturally, Jim Cramer's interest was naturally piqued when the red metal made a big breakout to the upside recently. "Copper's strength is part of the traditional metrics that define economic growth and it can be a part of the rational justification for what so many believe is an irrational rally," Cramer said. When demand for copper increases, that means industrial activity is on the rise because copper is used to make a wide array of things from new factories, to new houses and automobiles. However, Cramer did note that he doesn't know if demand has increased because there have been major production cuts, which could signal the jump is supply driven rather than due to stronger demand. Most investors probably don't associate General Electric with technology, but CEO Jeff Immelt is now wagering a bet that it can become a top 10 software company by 2020. "The proof of the pudding is reality. Our orders are growing 25 percent a year. We are kind of first among equals in the industrial internet. We can play. We can do this," Immelt said. When GE began investing in technology, Immelt said he didn't do so with the notion that it had to become a software company. Instead, the industrial assets that the company sells are surrounded by sensors and produce a massive amount of data. It was simply an investment to protect its installed base. Cramer also got the take of the future of digital from Adobe Systems' CEO Shantanu Narayen. Adobe is the leading maker of digital media and marketing software. Adobe has steadily transformed itself in the last few years into more of a cloud computing play. The company also made strides to enter the red-hot field of artificial intelligence with Sensei, its AI platform that uses machine learning to help computers match images and understand both the meaning and sentiment of documents. Narayen told Cramer that the future of video also could mean more monetization of the content. "There is more content that is out there than there has ever been before, and this revival of content when coupled with the appropriate advertising — that is going to be the business model that evolves on the web," Narayan said.

The 3D sensor that’s expected to be on the iPhone 8 may actually be for facial scanning, not augmented reality. By Emily Bary Feb. 15, 2017 5:31 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large When the iPhone 8 comes out in the fall, TouchID may go the way of the headphone jack. Illustration: Getty Images Apple shares keep heading higher, and that’s brought the iPhone rumor mill out in full force. The buzz lately is that Apple will make augmented reality the big selling point of its next iPhone. But one analyst thinks the masses have been misinterpreting signs from supply channels -- the collection of companies that make parts for the iPhone. The rationale behind the AR theory is that supplier hubbub indicates Apple will introduce 3D laser scanning on one or more of its upcoming phones. 3D sensing can be used to enable AR, a technology that allows people to overlay virtual items over their real-life surroundings. That might be the goal for Apple down the line, but JPMorgan’s Rod Hall thinks 3D sensing will serve an arguably less exciting role in the iPhone 8: facial recognition. The new iPhone is expected to have an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen from edge to edge, meaning there would be no place for the current TouchID home button. Instead, you’d unlock your phone just by looking at it, he predicts. More from Barron’s Next Apple Takes a Page from Amazon’s Playbook What’s Apple to Do with $246 Billion in Cash? Under Armour’s Worst Days Could Be Behind It When to Buy Airline Tickets to Get The Cheapest Fare Facial recognition would make it easier to unlock your phone in the rain, since TouchID fails with wet fingers. And it might get more people to use Apple Pay, Hall wrote in a research note Tuesday. (It’s not clear to us, though, that security or ease of use are really what’s holding people back from using Apple Pay). While CEO Tim Cook spoke exuberantly about the merits of AR earlier this week, he did say that the technology has a bit of a ways to go before it’s ready for everyone. While there’s some speculation that not all of Apple’s new phones will have every new feature, Hall thinks that facial scanning could come to everyone. Many analysts predict that Apple will come out with three iPhones this fall: slightly better versions of the current 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models, plus a fancier phone that’s even larger. That supersized phone may be the only one to feature an OLED screen, but the facial scanning could get broader use. Hall wrote that “supplier indications suggest more unit volume than inclusion on just the 5.85-inch OLED phone.” Big Picture: While AR is rumored to be the big new iPhone feature this year, one analyst says we may get facial recognition instead.

From regulations, to taxation policy, to international posturing, to the fact that Apple is worth almost US$700 billion, Apple can’t avoid politics. More importantly, the broader tech world itself that it increasingly intersects with tech. I think I spewed off about getting older and struggling to understand Millennials, too.

Fretting that the general public will explode themselves by puncturing batteries is ridiculous. This is about greed and forcing customers to buy new hardware. Even if right to repair is enacted, anyone who wants to can still take their broken device to an Apple Store and have it done right – assuming the device is supported. All right to repair will do is allow alternatives to people who may not live within 15 minutes of an Apple store. If others might wish to try the repair themselves or take the device to a different tech, what business is it of yours? None. Thanks for looking out for our safety, but we all already have a mommy. Apple would probably sell the parts at a price so inflated that repair will be impractical. February 15, 2017 at 7:15 EST PM Hagen February 15, 2017 Apple would seem rather peripheral to this fight, since the core appears to be the American Farm Bureau Federation vs. John Deere over the right to repair farm tractors and harvesters. It’s true, though, that such legislation would likely sweep across many different sectors, including cars, phones, computers, and other consumer items. If Apple (and others) end up being required to supply parts and service manuals, will there also be requirements that they be sold at a fair price?

Photo: Bob Finnan, Associated Press Business News Roundup, Feb. 16 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Apple looks for iPhone supplier Apple is in discussions with China’s BOE Technology Group Co. to supply next-generation displays for iPhones, a key component that has been provided by a Samsung Electronics Co. unit, people familiar with the matter said. Apple has been testing BOE’s active-matrix organic light-emitting diode screens for months but hasn’t decided if it will add the Chinese company to its roster of suppliers, one of the people said, asking not to be named talking about private negotiations. BOE, one of the country’s largest screen makers, is spending close to $14.5 billion building two plants in the southwestern province of Sichuan in anticipation of future business. Talks are at an early stage and it’s unlikely to supply the next iPhone, but BOE is banking on outfitting the one in 2018 or later, the person said. If BOE is selected for OLED, it will become the first known future supplier of the next-generation screens to Apple outside of South Korea and Japan — a triumph for a Beijing company best known for computer and TV displays. The U.S. company is exploring alternatives to address a global shortage of OLED displays as it prepares to adopt the sharper, more power-efficient technology for its next iPhones, catching up with rivals such as Samsung and Huawei Technologies. Apple declined to comment, and BOE declined to comment on talks with customers. The display is one of the most expensive components of a smartphone. OLED screens are more difficult to produce, making Apple beholden to suppliers still working to manufacture the displays in mass quantities. The world’s four biggest suppliers of smartphone displays — Samsung Display Co., Sharp Corp., LG Display Co. and Japan Display Inc. — are said to have insufficient capacity to equip all new iPhones this year, a constraint that may persist into 2018. That means Apple may be forced to adopt OLED in just a single version of its device this year, the 10th anniversary of the phone’s debut.

The cash deal was announced Wednesday. Walmart says Moosejaw, which is largely online and sells more than 400 brands, will keep operating its site and stores. Its 350-plus employees will stay in Michigan. Walmart, which is trying to better compete with Amazon.com, says buying Moosejaw gives it the experience of another well-established e-commerce company with strong industry relationships. Walmart also purchased marketplace Jet.com last year for $3 billion in cash plus $300 million in stock. Walmart’s online sales had been slowing over the past two years but notably accelerated during last year’s third quarter. It reports its fourth-quarter results next week. Economy Consumer prices jump U.S. consumer prices rose in January at the fastest pace in nearly four years, strengthening the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. The Labor Department said Wednesday that consumer prices rose 0.6 percent last month, the most since February 2013 and twice what economists were expecting. A 7.8 percent jump in gasoline prices accounted for almost half the increase. Stripping out volatile food and energy prices, consumer inflation rose 0.3 percent. Food prices rose in January for the first time in seven months. Grocery prices were unchanged, but the cost of eating out rose 0.4 percent. The price of clothing, new cars, auto insurance and air fares all rose by 0.8 percent or more in January. Overall, consumer prices rose 2.5 percent from a year earlier, the most since March 2012. Core inflation rose 2.3 percent over the last 12 months. Construction Home builders less confident Home builders are feeling a bit less confident this month, reflecting a dimmer outlook on sales in the months ahead and fewer would-be buyers dropping by builders’ sales offices. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo builder sentiment index released Wednesday fell to 65 this month. That’s down two points from a revised reading of 67 in January. Readings above 50 indicate more builders view sales conditions as good rather than poor. The index has been above 60 since September and reached the highest level in 11 years in December.

This feature is possible due to the near bezel-less design of the iPhone 8 and subsequent bump in screen size to 5.8-inch. The function area is said to be located in the same area as the current Home button and will thus replace Touch ID. Kuo notes, however, that Apple plans to make up for the lack of Touch ID with new biometric technologies that will be able to securely offer similar functionalities as Touch ID. While Kuo doesn’t dive into specifics, features such as facial recognition have been rumored before. Kuo’s latest report also offers more details on size. With the new function area housing virtual buttons and other actions, Kuo says that the usable display real estate will be around 5.15-inches. The overall face of the device is expected to be 5.8-inches, though. It’s unclear what exact will be housed in the “function area,” but it is likely that it will be some sort of virtual buttons and quick actions, perhaps similar to the Touch Bar on the MacBook Pro. The most apparent change of the OLED iPhone will be a full-screen design, along with the elimination of the Home button and current fingerprint recognition technology. Of particular note is that we expect the OLED iPhone will adopt a 5.8” physical OLED panel. But the actual display area will be around 5.15”, and the rest will be an area for functions (e.g. allocation of virtual buttons). Earlier this week, Kuo issued a note claiming that the 5.8-inch OLED iPhone 8 would be similar in size to the current 4.7-inch model, while also including a much bigger battery. From our report on Monday: KGI says the dramatic increase in battery capacity is made possible by Apple adopting a stacked ‘substrate-like’ PCB mainboard. By making the board smaller, more space inside the device is available for battery chemistry. This is shown by the larger blue area in the diagram, provided by KGI research. It has been rumored that the iPhone 8 will cost as much as $1000, a price that is higher than the current top of the line iPhone 7 Plus, but isn’t as crazy as it may sound on the surface. Other rumored features include an all-glass design, ‘wireless’ charging, and much more. In another report today, KGI also explained that the iPhone 8 will be “the only bright spot among the new iPhone lineup” this year. Kuo predicts that momentum form the refresh will continue into Chinese New Year of 2018. For all of the details concerning the new iPhone 8, head to our continuously updated guide.

Exactly how Apple plans on implementing the technology into their products still remains something of a mystery, although recent rumors have suggested that it could find its way into the iPhone 8. Now thanks to Rod Hall from investment firm J.P. Morgan, he is backing up those rumors with a report of his own. According to Hall, he claims that Apple is expected to introduce a 3D laser scanning module to the iPhone 8. This module is expected to be used for facial scanning, as well possible AR use in the future. The 3D laser scanner is said to possibly replace Touch ID as a security tool for logging into one’s iPhone. Touch ID at the moment is said to have a 1 in 50,000 error rate, but apparently this laser scanning module will be far more accurate even at its earliest implementations. This is actually not the first time that we’ve heard that Apple could be looking to replace Touch ID with a different security tool, although previously we had heard that it might be an iris scanner, not a facial scanner. In any case take it with a grain of salt for now, but this year’s iPhone rumors are certainly all over the place, more so than usual. It’s hard to tell which will be the real deal and which are simply guesses/predictions, so maybe try not to get your hopes up just yet. Filed in Apple >Cellphones >Rumors.

 The activist shareholder trying to make Apple more diverse is a 'diehard' Trump supporter Kif Leswing Feb. 15, 2017, 6:09 PM 2,574 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple Last year, an Apple shareholder introduced a diversity resolution that would require Apple to "increase the diversity of senior management and its board of directors." Apple shareholders voted down the resolution 94.9% to 5.1%.  But the person who introduced the resolution, investor Tony Maldonado, reintroduced a version of the resolution again this year, and he even recruited up a "socially responsible" investment firm, Zvin Asset Management, to cosign the resolution. In an interview with The Verge, Maldonado explained why he's pressing to change Apple's recruitment practices, especially with respect to diversity. It turns out, Maldonado is not your typical diversity advocate. In fact, he's a President Trump supporter.  From The Verge: "Maldonado, who is Hispanic, makes a pure business case for diversity. He identifies as a "fiscally conservative, socially moderate person," clarifies that he doesn't want this turned into "a social justice warrior issue," and says he's simply "looking at things in black and white in terms of money." He’s also a “diehard” Trump supporter, who ends many of his tweets with “#MAGA” and says he both donated to and volunteered for the campaign. "I know it sounds as if it's socially progressive, but it's not a socially progressive issue," he says. "Money talks, okay?"" But despite his political views, Maldonado still sees the lack of diversity on Apple's leadership team to be "racism, plan and simple." Ultimately, he says, this racism will make Apple a less successful business.  In Apple's most recent diversity report, it said 68% of its global employees are male, and 56% are white. Black and Hispanic Apple employees make up 21% of its workforce, although that includes Apple's retail operation, which offers lower salaries than Apple corporate.  The resolution is unlikely to pass. It will need to receive 6% of the vote to be resubmitted next year, according to Maldonado. Apple will hold its shareholder's meeting on February 28.  Apple opposes the proposal. "Apple believes it is better to focus our efforts on actively supporting our communities than to divert time and resources to the preparation of a report that would have limited value to shareholders," it wrote.  Read the entire interview over at the Verge. Below is the entire shareholder proposal:  Shareholders request that the Board of Directors adopt an accelerated recruitment policy requiring Apple Inc. (the “Company”) to increase the diversity of senior management and its board of directors, two bodies that presently fail to adequately represent diversity and inclusion (particularly Hispanic, African American, Native American and other people of color). Stockholder Supporting Statement The tech industry is characterized by the persistent and pervasive underrepresentation of minorities and women in senior positions as detailed in a 2014 U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission report. According to a USA Today analysis of 2014 Computing Research Association data, “[t]op universities turn out black and Hispanic computer science and computer engineering graduates at twice the rate that leading technology companies hire them.”1 The Company is at an advantageous position to be a leader in promoting diversity in senior management and its board of directors, based on its size, breadth and position as one of the largest companies in the world. Shareholders are concerned that low levels of diversity at the Company’s senior management and board level, as well as painstakingly slow improvements, are a business risk. According to the Company’s website, “Diversity is critical to innovation and it is essential to Apple’s future.”2 Further, the Company has stated in multiple Proxy Statements that it is “committed to actively seeking out highly qualified women and individuals from minority groups to include in the pool from which board nominees are chosen.” Shareholders believe that companies with comprehensive diversity programs, and strong commitment to implementation, enhance their long-term value, reducing the Company’s potential legal and reputational risks associated with workplace discrimination and building a reputation as a fair employer. Equally, shareholders believe the varied perspectives of a diverse senior management and board of directors would provide a competitive advantage in terms of creativity, innovation, productivity and morale, while eliminating the limitations of “groupthink”, as it would recognize the uniqueness of experience, strength, culture and thought contributed by each; strengthening its reputation and business. This is confirmed by McKinsey & Company, which found companies with highly diverse executive teams had higher returns on equity and earnings performance than those with low diversity, and a May 2014 study found gender diverse teams were better at driving “radical innovation”. “Diversity helps companies react more effectively to market shifts and new customer needs.” SEE ALSO: Apple’s 'vision' for its next big thing convinced a big company to sell itself for cheap More: Apple Diversity shareholder proposals facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru The activist shareholder trying to make Apple more diverse is a 'diehard' Trump supporter The activist shareholder trying to make Apple more diverse is a 'diehard' Trump supporter Last year, an Apple shareholder introduced...

Heres the thing about Apple Pay and banks Posted on 16-Feb-2017 12:27 by Bill Bennett | Filed under: News : Bill Bennett Apple insists banks don’t pass on Apple Pay charges to customers. Banks accept this in most countries. But not in Australia and, by extension, New Zealand.1 Wrangling over the issue slowed Apple Pay’s progress in both countries. Three of Australia’s four big banks asked that country’s regulator for permission to negotiate with Apple as a group.2 The fourth bank, ANZ, has its own agreement with Apple. On Monday Westpac, Commonwealth Bank and National Australia Bank took fees off the table. In return they want Apple to open up the NFC chip in iPhone. That will allow them to run their digital wallets in direct competition to Apple Pay. The dispute is almost academic. Digital wallet take-up rates are miniscule. For now digital wallets are a rounding error in transaction statistics. Yet everyone involved thinks they will soon be huge. The Australian reports ANZ completed 10 million Apple Pay transactions since launching nine months ago. This compares to seven billion credit and debit card transactions in a year. Banks and phone makers expect digital wallets to take off when they add other features. Driver’s licences, loyalty cards and membership schemes are at the front of the list. So are public transport cards. Both Apple and the Australian banks hope people will one day no longer carry conventional wallets. Both want the game to play out their way. The key to understanding the dispute is that both sides are big, powerful semi-monopolies. Both want control and both want to clip the ticket on every transaction. It can mean rivers of gold. The Australian banks argue that opening up the iPhone NFC chip will allow innovation to flourish. Apple argues customers will get a better digital wallet experience if it retains control. Among other things it means customers can run cards issued by different banks from a single app. Banks elsewhere might be as uneasy with Apple Pay, but few banking markets are as tight-held as Australia and New Zealand. This gives the local big banks a clout that, say, US banks don’t have. Customers want them all to get on with it. A handful of geeks have swapped to ANZ to use Apple Pay. If that trickle was a flood, the other banks would soon change their tune. That’s because Australia’s dominant big four banks are also New Zealand’s largest banks. ?? Good question. I’m glad you asked. In normal times it is illegal for competitors to collude with each other. Regulators fear this can lead to bad things for customers. ??Here’s the thing about Apple Pay and banks was first posted at billbennett.co.nz.

Easy enough for your iTunes movies, not so straightforward if your content's on a Windows laptop or an Android tablet. Here's how to get almost anything streamed to your Apple TV. Image: Gizmodo We won't take you step-by-step through getting iTunes content up on your Apple TV as you can no doubt figure it out yourself — try the built-in TV shows or Movies apps if you're stuck. In fact, getting anything from another Apple device is super straightforward because your Apple TV acts as a big AirPlay receiver. If you're not using Apple hardware or buying from Apple's store then the key is to pick the right app. With limited access to the tvOS file system (thanks, Apple), third-party apps are the key to getting your content up on the big screen, and these are the best ones for the job. YouTube Image: Screenshot We'll start with an easy one: YouTube. If you just can't figure out any other way to get your videos to an Apple TV, upload them to YouTube and watch them that way (you can keep clips private to your own account if you don't want them seen by the whole world). There's more though — the YouTube app for Apple TV gives you access to any TV show or movie you've bought through Google Play Movies & TV. There's no official Google Movies & TV app for Apple TV, but you can find all your purchased content in the YouTube app: go to My YouTube using the top menu then scroll down to Purchases to find your shows and films. Alternatively use the Google Play Movies & TV app on an iPhone or iPad and AirPlay your purchased content over that way. Plex Image: Screenshot We're huge fans of Plex and once again the app can work wonders when it comes to getting your music, movies, photos and everything else from a non-Apple device to an Apple TV. Sign up for a free or premium account, build a library of content on your machine (it works for Mac, Windows, and Linux), and the Plex app will stream it to your Apple TV for free — as long as you leave the computer on. Alternatively pay up for a Plex Pass and you can store all your shows and movies in the cloud rather than on a local machine. The Plex app for Apple TV is slick and straightforward and works a lot like your personal Netflix. Anything you've added on the server side at the other end will show up and can be streamed straight to your Apple box. AllCast Image: Screenshot If you fork out for the premium version of AllCast on your Android device then you can beam pretty much anything from your Google-powered phone or tablet to an AirPlay device — in this case the Apple TV. Besides videos you can get your music and your photos up on the big screen (there's no Google Photos app for Apple TV as yet), and if you want to test the waters first then try the free version of the app, which comes with a five-minute playback limit. The best part of AllCast versus other options is that there are no technical menus to wade through and you can be up and running in minutes. You don't need anything installed on your Apple TV either. It just pops up as an option when you launch the AllCast Android app. Once the connection is made you can beam over anything stored locally on your device as well as content from linked services like Google Drive or Dropbox. AirParrot 2 Image: Screenshot If you're interested in getting content from a Windows computer on an Apple TV without dealing with a server installation as you would with Plex, then AirParrot 2 is definitely worth a look — it will set you back $US12.99 ($17), but there's a free trial available if you want to see if it suits you first. Again there's little in the way of setup. Once it's running on Windows, choose the local Apple TV as a receiver, then choose a media file from disk, and it's streamed straight to the Apple device. You can adjust quality settings in the program preferences but we didn't notice any glitches in our testing. The application can also do a straight mirror of your screen, so an exact copy of your Windows display shows up on the Apple TV. There's a version for macOS as well, plus an extension you can use on Chrome OS. Meanwhile the accompanying iOS app lets you use your iPhone as a remote control for whatever you're watching on your TV. VLC Media Player Image: Screenshot VLC Media Player for the Apple TV — like the versions for every other platform — does a great job of playing audio and video content in pretty much any format in existence. It supports a whole host of network protocols, including Windows shares, UPnP and FTP, so wherever your movies and TV shows happen to be stored, chances are that VLC can get at them. It also works with Plex if you need it to. As with the desktop clients, there's support for multiple audio tracks and subtitles, and you can also stream any video link you can get ahold of the URL for. VLC is the most finnicky of the bunch as it takes a little bit of technical know-how to get videos up and running on it, but it's not particularly difficult to do, there's plenty of documentation on VLC's site to get you started, and once your files are in place then using VLC is a breeze. You can also use a connected web interface on an iOS device or a desktop browser and just drag and drop the files you want to play. Comments Bob Dobbs Guest Feb 16, 2017, 12:05pm Airparriot 2 is in the current humble bundle so you can get it for as little as 1 dollar right now. Reply 0 Lammie Guest Feb 16, 2017, 2:00pm Infuse Pro is great for video—plays pretty much any format locally off the ATV — so no need to transcode on the fly—which is the downside to Plex. You can stream all your files straight from a NAS or computer. It can source subtitles directly from Opensubtitles.org and the interface is almost as slick as Plex (and it also downloads metadata for all your files such as cover art, synopsis, etc).

Name: Subject: Message: What would a return to China mean for the Google Play Store? Newsby Andrew Grush9 hours ago 2 159 4 “Google Play is coming to China” – we’ve all heard that line before. Ever since it first pulled out of the Chinese market back in 2010, there have been occasional rumors stating its possible return. With China’s smartphone market exploding, and Chinese OEMs slowly gaining global power, many suggest it’s only a matter of time before a return. I’ll admit I’ve written about this subject twice now. First I wrote a detailed feature in 2014, then in 2015 I wrote a short news piece on the matter. In 2016 other members of our team also covered similar new claims about Google’s moves towards returning to China. It’s hard not to be a little skeptical after all this time, but could 2017 finally be the year that this long rumored return actually happens? First, let’s break down the latest rumor. So this time around The Information reports that Google is in talks with NetEase to bring Google Play, and potentially other Google services, to China. To their source’s knowledge, no deal has been inked yet. It’s just talks. That’s pretty much the rumor in its entirety. Obviously, that means that even if a deal is reached, it could be awhile before Google Play gets released in China. It also means that the chances of it happening are currently 50/50 at best. That said, NetEase does have a history of working with western markets to bring apps and services to China, including StarCraft II, Diablo 3, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and Minecraft. All of these services are games though, and partnering with Google for an app store would certainly have its own unique challenges. Would China even allow Google back? While Google technically was the one that left China, the breakup was kind of mutual, and so would the Chinese government even support a deal to bring back the Google Play store? It’s hard to say for sure, but the good news is that they don’t even need to sign off on the arrangement necessarily. As long as Google plays by Chinese rules when it comes to censorship and other net practices, Google doesn’t need express permission to return. The fact they are working with a local Chinese internet company would make it even easier for Google to get past any barriers keeping them out. As long as Google plays by Chinese rules when it comes to censorship and other net practices, Google doesn’t need express permission to return. Of course, Google would have to bend to China’s philosophies, which go completely against what the company typically stands for. As they say though, money talks. If Google wanted to ease up on censorship? It would have to strike a pretty impressive offer to get the Chinese government onboard, and honestly we don’t see that happening. So for Google, it’s choice is to continue losing out in China or to yield to the Chinese government. What would a Chinese Play Store look like? Aside from obvious language localization, the Chinese Google Play store would likely look quite similar to what we get in other markets, at least on the surface. A good precedent to turn to is the Apple AppStore. The Chinese version of the Apple AppStore still functions essentially the same as it would elsewhere, other than Apple is even stricter when it comes to the app approval process, ensuring that they closely follow all Chinese rules and regulations. The result of this is that Apple regularly removes apps at the behest of the Chinese government, with a higher profile example being the New York Times app back in 2015. Apple even removed some of its own services for movies, books, and the Apple News app that was introduced in iOS 9. The Chinese Google Play store would require a much deeper level of moderation than Google currently employs. The idea of Apple controlling app approvals and removals tightly is nothing new, but Google has historically had a much more lax hand. While they have turned to slightly tighter procedures in recent years, the Chinese Google Play store would require a much deeper level of moderation than Google currently employs. It is hard to say whether this would be handled by Google, NetEase, or both. It would require some pretty big changes though from Google Play’s normal operations. China is also notorious for malware, and so Google would have to greatly improve its approval processes to ensure that its store doesn’t become yet another malware-infested Chinese app store. Hell, even Apple has had some malware drama in China, and typically malware isn’t as much an issue for Apple.  As for the kind of apps you’d find? Again using Apple as an example, you’d find a healthy dose of both Chinese language and English language releases. That includes a number of higher profile apps and games that are currently not available officially in China. How Google and its partners would benefit from a Chinese Play store release The smartphone market has largely reached a point of saturation in many western markets. Sure, there’s still money to be made, but growth is much slower than it was in years past. In contrast, the Asian markets are booming and while Google is actively involved in India, China is a key piece of the profit puzzle and one that they are currently missing. According to a January report from Accenture, nearly three out of four Chinese consumers polled said they would buy new smartphones in 2017, up from 61% in 2016. Considering how large of a population is represented by China, this presents a huge opportunity for both OEMs and for Google itself. The more new phone owners out there, the more app interest. A highly controlled Google Play experience would also raise the quality of apps and services available for Android in China. For Google, it’s pretty obvious the money is there, if they can pull off creating a quality app store experience in China that stands apart from the competition. A highly controlled Google Play experience would also raise the quality of apps and services available for Android in China. This in turn would improve Android’s reputation in the country, giving Google and its OEMs an opportunity to steal further thunder away from Apple. According to IDC, Apple shipped 14.9 million units in Q4 2016, making it the 4th most successful vendor in China. A large part of the reason for Apple’s success in China is its position as a status symbol. That said, its reputation for greater security is an equally important motivator for Chinese buyers that fear the malware-ridden world of China’s Android app stores. Granted, not all of China’s Android app stores are unsafe, but it’s hard to deny that many of these storefronts have pretty mixed reputations. Considering Google already has partnerships with many Chinese OEMs like ZTE, Huawei, and OPPO, it would make sense that Google would attempt to extend this relationship into China. And by having Google Play’s (hopefully) more secure app store bundled out of the box, these OEMs would likely receive a boost when it comes to perceived security. This could help set these OEMs apart from Chinese smartphone makers that don’t play ball with Google, and could also eat away a little of Apple’s market share potentially. For app developers, Google Play’s presence in China also represents a huge opportunity. It is no secret that there are tons of app stores in China that are playgrounds to pirated apps. Consumers turn to these for a few reasons. First, it is sometimes the only way to get certain apps in China. Second, Chinese consumers tend to prefer free (or free to play apps), and so many of them will head to these seedier stores in order to get premium apps for free. If Google Play was in the equation, however? Knowing there was a safer, secure location to get these apps would possibly be enough to get Chinese consumers to buy them from official sources. Google could also work with these app developers to make specialized versions for China that either are cheaper or perhaps rely on in-app purchases instead. Obviously this is all speculation, but the point is that having a more official Android app store would have positive effects for developers that originate outside of China. The same goes for Chinese developers, as they’d had a more secure playground to place their apps. How would a Chinese Play store affect the Android ecosystem as a whole? The effects of having Google Play in China depend largely on how connected (or disconnected) the Chinese store and its developers are to the rest of the world. For example, this change could potentially give smaller Chinese developers the opportunity to release versions of their apps localized for other markets outside of China via Google Play, bringing new apps and experiences to those in the western world. Beyond that? If the Google Play store caught on in popularity, it could help to reduce the amount of malware floating around the web as lesser app stores shut down under the increased pressure from Google and the other more trusted Chinese app stores. This in turn would positively affect Android’s reputation globally as well. Additionally, smartphone manufacturers that partner with Google in China could enjoy a small boost in support or trust from global buyers, which would be especially important to companies like ZTE and Huawei, both of which are trying very hard to break into the western market in a big way. But is there even room for another app store in China? There are over 200 app stores in China. In the top ten positions you’ll find Myapp (Tencent), 360 Mobile Assistant, Baidu Mobile Assistant, MIUI App Store (Xiaomi), Huawei App Store, Oppo Store, Vivo, Wandoujia, HiMarket, and Anzhi Market. So can Google Play even stand out? It all comes down to the partnerships it is capable of forming. On one hand, OEMs like Huawei, ZTE, and OPPO have a history of working closely with Google. On the other hand, most major OEMs already have their own store front, and Huawei and Oppo’s stores are both among the top ten most popular. Would they really sacrifice advertising and promoting their own stores in favor of Google? It depends largely on what Google would offer them in return. Would OEMs really sacrifice advertising and promoting their own stores in favor of Google? It depends largely on what Google would offer them in return. First, if Google could brand their store as the most secure and carefully curated “Android app store” in China, there’s the potential reputation boost as already mentioned. Beyond that, Google could offer these OEMs perks that affect their operations outside of China like helping promote them to western markets or offering lower licensing fees for Google services in markets like the US. If Google Play could also serve as a stepping stone to eventually delivering other quality Google services (Drive, Gmail, etc), these drivers could also help Google stand out. Ultimately, we have our doubts that Google would be able to establish itself as king of the Android app stores anytime soon — if ever. The good news is that Google doesn’t need to. Even if Google merely established themselves in the top 25 within a few years, they’d be opening a massive market that currently they have limited interaction with. They’d also be opening the doors for tons of developers who currently don’t have relationships with any existing Chinese app stores. What do you think, should Google return to China?

New patent shows designated button on smart keyboard  'Emoji' key appears beneath the Tab button on the smart keyboard Would bring up a library of the pictographs to share in posts and messages A 'Share' key is shown in the image that activates social media sites and email By Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.com Published: 18:22 EST, 15 February 2017 | Updated: 18:26 EST, 15 February 2017 e-mail 2 View comments Emojis debuted in the late 1990s and have turned into a popular way for the world to communicate. Now, Apple wants to make it easier to share the pictographs while using a laptop and could add a designated button to a smart keyboard. The Cupertino firm has received a new patent that shows an 'Emoji' key below the 'Tab' function that would pull up a library of the colorful icons and let users share them in messages or posts. Scroll down for video  Apple has received a new patent that shows an 'Emoji' key below the Tab function that would pull up a library of the colorful icons and let users share them in messages or posts. There is also a Share key that would activate a window with social media sites and email APPLE'S NEW PATENT  Apple's latest patent was filed in August 2015 and illustrates a smart keyboard unlike anything the firm has ever produced. The application shows an image of a smart keyboard with a designated 'Emoji' by placed just beneath the Tab key. This suggests users could press the button and pull up a complete library of the icons to share in messages and posts. The keyboard also has a Share button.  And when pushed, it brings up different social media sites, such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, and email could also appear in a designated window.  Apple's latest patent, entitled 'Users interface for a touch screen device in communication with a physical keyboard', was filed in August 2015, which illustrates a smart keyboard unlike anything the firm has ever produced. And the patent was first spotted by MacRumors.   Although the pages make no mention to the Emoji button, the drawings make it very clear that the firm has the idea to add it to the futuristic keyboard. The firm's current smart keyboard does offer a globe key in the bottom left corner that activates an on-screen Emoji keyboard, but the patent images appear to have thrown it out of the design. In addition to an Emoji key, the patent suggests that Apple could add a Share function to the keyboard as well. To the right of the space bar, in the drawing, sits a button labeled 'Share'. And when pushed, it brings up different social media sites, such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, and email could also appear in a designated window. 'There is a need for electronic devices that provide efficient methods and interfaces for using a keyboard to view, create, edit, and share content.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next The robot bee that could pollinate the Earth's plants:...

Although the pages make no mention to the Emoji button, the drawings make it very clear that the firm has the idea to add it to the futuristic keyboard (pictured is a concept drawing of what the smart keyboard could resemble) Apple unveiled a radical overhaul to its MacBook in October, which tossed out the traditional USB ports and functions keys replacing them with smaller USB-C ports and a smart touchscreen - and it came just weeks after the firm killed off the headphone socket in the iPhone 7.  Different buttons appears depending on the app being used, and it even doubles as a fingerprint sensor. 'We haven't been using them for a long time, so we mapped other functions to them,' said Apple's Phil Schiller. THE BIRTH OF EMOJIS  Shigetaka Kurita invented Emoji in 1998 while working for DoCoMo, a large Japanese mobile communication company.  Emojis debuted in the late 1990s and have turned into a popular way for the world to communicate The goal was to develop a way for mobile phone users to send pictures back and forth without using much data.  It all started in Japan, when users started to send pictures as a way to communicate.  This was a time when mobile phones were young, so providers were already struggling to to support 80 million users.  The idea was to create a one character 'code' that would display as an icon on the other person's device. DoKoMo i-mode, a mobile provider in Japan, was the first firm to allow users to add pictures of common used emoticons to their text messages. Source: CityMac  'Now, we are replacing them with the touch bar'. The touch bar is a small touchscreen, which changes depending on the app being used. Apple unveiled a radical overhaul to its MacBook in October and it included an Emoji bar across the top of the keyboard that users can select the icons by simply pressing them It also has a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the power button. And it included an Emoji bar across the top of the keyboard that users can select the icons by simply pressing them. However, if the patent is true, adding a designated button on the keyboard would give users access to the entire library of Emojis.    Read more: The History of Emoji | CityMac United States Patent Application: 0170038856 Apple Explores Smart Keyboard With Siri, Share, and Emoji Keys - Mac Rumors Share or comment on this article e-mail Most watched News videos Moment ISIS suicide attacker detonates bomb near Syrian rebels Dog CRIES after being told off for chewing sofa into pieces Redback spider catches brown snake in it's web and attacks it Terrifying moment deadly Chicago ambush captured on Facebook live Shocking moment a model poses on the ledge of very tall skyscraper Final moments of radio broadcast before Dominican Rep DJ shot dead Social Experiment: Would you breastfeed a stranger's baby?

Read more about the stories in today's news: Oracle Revives Java Copyright Infringement Dispute With Google Apple to Mark Smartphone Anniversary With 'iPhone X' Premium Handset RSA Conference Panelists Split on Question of Paying Data Ransoms Microsoft Enhances Security on Windows, Office and Azure Cloud       Here are your top news stories from eWEEK. Today's topics include Oracle’s revival of a copyright infringement lawsuit with Google, market speculation that Apple is planning to introduce three new iPhone models in 2017, the cyber-security recommendations of a panel of experts to defend against ransomware attacks and Microsoft’s security enhancements to its Windows, Office and Azure Cloud applications. Oracle has revived its long-standing Java copyright dispute with Google in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In a massive 155-page appeal on Feb. 10, Oracle alleged that the U.S. District Court of Appeals for the Northern District of California repeatedly undermined its side of the story during a jury trial last year. The jury in that trial had concluded that Google’s Android operating system did not violate Java copyright. According to Oracle, the jury only reached that verdict because Oracle was prevented from presenting evidence at the trial showing all the markets where Android and Java overlapped. Apple is preparing to release three new iPhone models this fall, including a premium device designed to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, according to a leading mobile industry analyst. Apple will release two updates to the iPhone 7 and a new phone which may be called the iPhone 8 or it may be called the iPhone X, according to the leading analyst for Apple products, Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities. The iPhone X is expected to be a new premium phone that comes with a lot of innovations, including wireless charging, according to Kuo. The other two models are expected to be the typical second year updates of the features included in the iPhone 7 under the brand names iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. Ransomware will continue to cause pain for companies in 2017, but there continues to be no single successful strategy to prevent or reduce the damage caused by this disruptive malware, according to a panel of security experts at the RSA Conference in San Francisco. For many companies, backups will provide a reliable fall-back measure if the company’s data is encrypted via ransomware. Yet, recovering data from backups is expensive and not always successful, panel members asserted. There is no single measure to prevent a ransomware attack and no single product at the conference that will save a company from a ransomware infection, Gal Shpantzer, CEO of Security Outliers, told attendees. The IT industry's attention is laser focused on security this week as the RSA Conference 2017 conference gets underway this week in San Francisco. Just before the event kicked off, Microsoft announced on Feb. 10 several new offerings and product updates aimed at helping its customers fend off hackers and keep their data safe. Examples include the forthcoming addition of Windows Hello, the biometric login technology in Windows 10, to environments that take an on-premises Active Directory (AD) only approach to user identity and access management. Microsoft also offers Azure AD for cloud-based and hybrid-cloud implementations. The forthcoming Windows 10 Creators Update will also feature a Dynamic Lock function that automatically locks a user's PC when they step away from it. Customers seeking to secure their Azure hybrid cloud environments will soon have new Azure Security Center and Operations Management Suite options. Thanks for watching.

CEO Steve Mollenkopf. Less than a month after being served a $1 billion lawsuit from Apple, Qualcomm CEO Steven Mollenkopf says he wouldn't want to have to argue the iPhone maker's side of the case. Apple claimed in January that Qualcomm is receiving royalties for mobile technologies that "they have nothing to do with." One-third of Qualcomm's revenue comes from licensing its communications standards to other companies, smartphone makers in particular. Mollenkopf said on Wednesday that Qualcomm has 300-plus licenses, including 120 signed in China in the last two years. "It's tough to come in and say that this is not a solid business," Mollenkopf said at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference in San Francisco. "I'd hate to be on the other side of that argument." Qualcomm has been through this in the past. Mollenkopf highlighted a similar dispute with Nokia a decade ago. The big difference with Apple is that it's a much bigger and more dominant company than Nokia ever was. However, so is Qualcomm, which in addition to being a key component in practically every smartphone, is making a play for the broader world of connected devices and Internet of Things. show chapters Qualcomm tanks on Apple suit    Monday, 23 Jan 2017 | 5:41 PM ET | 03:01 "It's pretty difficult to look at Qualcomm and say I don't want to work with them some time in the future," Mollenkopf said. In the end, Mollenkopf said he prefers that the matter be settled out of court, as was the case with Nokia, and he expects that's what will happen. He also said we shouldn't expect to read too much about the case as it develops, at least not from the Qualcomm side. "You're probably not going to see us argue this out in press," he said.

One year later, there's still no clear winner. James Martin/CNET The Loch Ness Monster. Roswell, New Mexico. And the Apple-FBI dispute. All unsolved mysteries, but we're only talking about the last one on today's podcast. It's been a year since Apple's dispute with the Federal Bureau of Investigation over unlocking the San Bernardino terrorists' iPhone. The fight ended thanks to a third-party firm that offered to hack the phone instead. Because the battle is shelved, there's still no clear answer on whether or not Apple is legally obligated to undermine privacy in the name of national security. Also on the podcast, we chat about HTC's launch into mobile VR sets, and what it's like to go rock climbing enhanced with augmented reality.

Smart Home by Shara Tibken February 15, 2017 11:37 AM PST @sharatibken D-Link's new security camera integrates with Apple's HomeKit software. D-Link You can finally get your hands on an Apple HomeKit-compatible security camera. D-Link on Wednesday unveiled its new Omna 180 Cam HD (DSH-C10) camera that lets users monitor their homes when they're away. The device is the first HomeKit-enabled device from D-Link's Omna line and the first HomeKit-compatible security camera in the market at all. The camera, with its 180-degree wide angle lens, costs $199.95 and is for sale immediately on Apple's online store. It will be available in Apple's physical stores around the world later this month. See also CNET's roundup of smart home product compatibility Apple's Home app makes it easy to control your home from your phone. Finally Apple CEO Tim Cook shares his HomeKit routine "Omna's HomeKit integration allows users to be 'always home' and includes advanced security features with end-to-end encryption and authentication between the camera and an iPhone or iPad," D-Link said. When the camera detects activity, it sends a notice to the owner's lock screen (delivered via the Apple Home app) and shows a live feed from the camera. Users can access the camera remotely to see what's happening in their homes in real time. The home is viewed by many as the next big battlefront for tech companies. Apple first talked about HomeKit at its developer conference in 2014. The feature allows developers to integrate controls for door locking, light dimming, and other home automation gadgets and features in iOS apps for the iPhone and iPad. That means users can control various connected devices from one spot -- even using Apple's digital voice assistant, Siri -- rather than switching back and forth between different apps. Apple was early to talk about smart-home technology, but rival Amazon, with its Alexa voice assistant, has lately dominated the market. The number of Alexa-compatible devices outnumber HomeKit products, and fewer HomeKit devices have been released than expected.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple How Apple’s arrogance impacts its ability to acquire new companies Yoni Heisler BGR NewsFebruary 15, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share A new report from Bloomberg sheds some interesting light on the hazy underpinnings of Apple’s acquisition strategy. Famously, Apple’s tends to shy away from large corporate acquisitions, with the company’s $3 billion purchase of Beats a few years ago standing as a lone exception. That notwithstanding, the report relays that Apple’s own arrogance and “take it or leave it” attitude might be precluding it from successfully inking similar large-scale acquisitions. Don't Miss: The biggest caveats in Verizon’s new ‘unlimited’ plan Per the report, many of Apple’s acquisitions are spearheaded by engineers who routinely meet with Apple’s M&A guru Adrian Perica to discuss attractive new technologies and companies that might help advance the company’s product roadmap. So while identifying potential acquisition targets isn’t a problem, Apple’s penchant for believing that a) it can do everything on its own and that b) companies should be flattered to be swallowed up by Apple has sometimes led to a few standstills. As a quick example, Apple clearly bit off a lot more than it could chew when it decided to explore researching and developing its own electric car many months ago. This is arguably problematic because by the time Apple realizes it can’t do something, potential acquisition targets may become too expensive to pick up. Using Tesla as an example, the company’s $44 billion market cap all but makes an Apple acquisition a non-starter. However, Apple could have picked up the company at a bargain back in 2013 when shares of Tesla were trading in the low $30 range. Even when Apple isn’t intent on going it alone, their hubris can sometimes leave potential targets uneasy. Apple also dictates terms and tells targets to take it or leave it, betting that the promise of product development support later and the chance of appearing in future iPhones are alluring enough, the people said. That was the case when Apple acquired Metaio GmbH in 2015. Bankers appointed by the augmented-reality firm to negotiate weren’t allowed in the room, and while Metaio executives felt the offer was low, Apple’s vision for the technology convinced them to sell, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Interestingly, there’s a famous story detailing how Apple was very close to acquiring Dropbox. As the story goes, Steve Jobs called Dropbox a “feature, not a product” and made a relatively low-ball offer for the company. When Dropbox CEO Drew Houston said no, Jobs insinuated that Houston might want to reconsider because Apple was going to go after the company’s user base with a rival service. Of course, as it all played out, Apple’s own iCloud offering hasn’t exactly done much of anything to stymie Dropbox’s growth. While the allure of working under the Apple umbrella certainly works sometimes, that’s not always the case. Indeed, the cowboy-esque manner in which Apple tends to carry itself in negotiations isn’t exactly suited for large-scale acquisitions, something which some analysts believe Apple needs to be more open to in the future. All that said, Tim Cook is on record as saying that Apple is “open to acquisitions of any size”, an interesting take given previous indications that Apple last year explored picking up Time Warner.

As a bonus, it will also expand our capacity to teach normal home and office users how to make better use of their Macs, iPhones, and iPads. We call it the TidBITS Content Network, or TCN for short. We designed TCN to provide content that Apple pros can use to stay in touch with their clients. Consulting — and business in general — is often as much about maintaining relationships as it is about providing a service. But in today’s hectic world, the best way to maintain contact is with practical, helpful information. Each month, TCN provides professionally written, edited, and illustrated tips and articles that its members can use to update their blogs, create a vibrant social media presence, and power email newsletters that people will actually read. To be specific, TCN publishes four short tips and four 400- to 600-word articles each month, complete with featured image photos, carefully composed screenshots, and Facebook and Twitter teasers for each article. Everything we write for TCN is targeted to the everyday Apple user and focused on providing useful guidance. The key to TCN is that it’s syndicated content, so everyone who subscribes to TCN gets the same tips and articles. That works because almost no consultants have overlapping audiences. If a TCN member sends an email newsletter with one of our articles to her clients in Boise, there’s little chance that people who work with another TCN-subscribing consultant in Tampa would ever see the same article. It’s like the Doonesbury comic strip — it’s the same in every newspaper, but few readers ever see it in multiple places. Unlike Doonesbury, though, TCN members are welcome to modify the tips and articles however they wish to add a personal touch. Or, if they want, they can publish them unchanged as a guest post. If you work in a field where you’d benefit from publishing Apple-specific tips and articles for your clients or customers, check out the TidBITS Content Network site, which has pricing details, sample content, frequently asked questions, and an introductory video. And if you’re more on the user end of things but know any Apple consultants, resellers, or techs who could use TCN content, I’d appreciate you passing on the news. After all, if your consultant subscribes to TCN and publishes our content, you’ll get to read it! Thanks!   READERS LIKE YOU! Support TidBITS by becoming a member today!

I hope it doesn't detract any further from the attention you devote to TidBITS, which has seemed a bit lean in recent years as more of everyone's time has gone into your Take Control books. As a paid subscriber to TidBITS I hope it doesn't become any more vestigial than it already is. Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-14 12:16 Sorry if you've had that perception, but it just isn't borne out by reality, as you can see in this chart of TidBITS issue sizes over time. I can't see any way to call what we're publishing in TidBITS each week "vestigial." http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/574336/TidBITS-Sizes.png Plus, apart from me, the people who work on Take Control are largely unrelated to TidBITS, so it's again not true that Take Control has taken significant time away from TidBITS for anyone but me. Regardless, the fact is that we need to earn a living. As much as TidBITS memberships have enabled us to be able to afford to continue publishing TidBITS, with fewer than 15% of subscribers supporting us, revenues basically pay for Josh as managing editor, Agen's work on the TidBITS Watchlist, articles from external authors like Julio, and a small amount for my time. If we had 85% of our current readership contributing, things might be different, but as it stands, Take Control Books and the TidBITS Content Network are what we live on. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-14 15:15 Given that I spend the majority of my week finding, editing, and writing content for TidBITS, I disagree that it's vestigial. :-) However, we do stay highly focused on technology. Just about every other tech publication has a few "hobbies" — pop culture, coffee, design, politics, sports, or whatever — that fill in the gap when tech news is slow. We have a pretty good sense of what our readers want from TidBITS and we try to stay laser-focused on that. But we're always open to suggestions.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 16 February 2017 | MYT 6:00 AM Smartphone maker Huawei catching up on Samsung, Apple: study Gaining ground: Huawei was able to increase its share of the smartphone sector to 8.9% in 2016 from 7.3% a year earlier, while Samsung saw its market share shrink by two full percentage points to 20.5% and Apple’s contracted to 14.4% from 15.9%. — AFP PARIS: Chinese smartphone maker Huawei managed to gain ground on Samsung and Apple in terms of market share last year, following the problems encountered by the two sector giants, the Gartner consultancy group said.  Over the year as a whole, the Chinese maker saw its sales leap by 26.7%, while the South Korean and US rivals both saw their sales decline by 4.3%, Gartner said in a study.  As result, Huawei was able to increase its share of the smartphone sector to 8.9% in 2016 from 7.3% a year earlier, while Samsung saw its market share shrink by two full percentage points to 20.5% and Apple’s contracted to 14.4% from 15.9%.  ”Chinese makers succeeded in winning market share over last year and Huawei now seems to be the main rival to the two giants, even if the gap remains large,” Gartner analyst Annette Zimmermann told AFP.   Among the other Chinese smartphone makers are OPPO, BBK Communication Equipment (with its One Plus and Vivo brands), ZTE, Xiaomi and Lenovo.  ”We’re seeing a very real progression compared with earlier years, when the number three maker and the others had struggled to hold on to a market share of more than four percent,” Zimmermann said.  ”Huawei looks likely to strengthen its position again this year,” she added.  In the fourth quarter of 2016 alone, the launch of the iPhone 7 and Samsung’s difficulties with its Note 7 model enabled Apple to take top slot in the market with a share of 17.9% or 77 million units sold.   Samsung sold 76.8 million smartphones in the October-December period, giving it a market share of 17.8%, while Huawei sold 40.8 million phones or a market share of 9.5%.  ”Preliminary data for the current quarter suggest that Samsung will overtake Apple again. But it’s remarkable that Apple can hold on to that sort of share of the market with a closed eco-system,” the analyst said.  With regard to the different operating systems, Android, which is used by the large majority of smartphone makers, commands a market share of 81.7%, while Apple’s iOS operating system of its iPhones and iPads accounts for 17.9% of the market. — AFP Related Stories You May Be Interested Apple struggles to make big deals, hampering strategy shifts Clash of Clans maker profit up despite Pokemon challenge Stand up to cancer Apple hunts for the app stars of the future with new show Spotify expands with World Trade Centre move Yahoo notifies users of sophisticated breach methods Others Also Read Embassy tight-lipped on death of Jong-nam Only hard work can save Foxes from drop, says Pearson advertisement Latest News Ukraine says Russian state hackers using new viruses for attacks Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Pokémon Go: The universe expands Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra Huawei said to plan its own voice assistant for smartphones Most Viewed in Tech Pokémon Go: The universe expands Nokia 3310 on the comeback trail: report Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra Stand up to cancer Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Huawei said to plan its own voice assistant for smartphones Lenovo’s profit misses estimates after PC rivals erode lead Apple struggles to make big deals, hampering strategy shifts China’s Huawei, Philippine telco join forces in 5G deal Yahoo notifies users of sophisticated breach methods Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

The patent application, titled User Interface for a Touch Screen Device in Communication with a Physical Keyboard, primarily concerns itself with “user interfaces for viewing, creating, editing, and sharing content on an electronic device” in relation to accepting multiple inputs — both on the touchscreen surface, as well as in conjunction with a physical keyboard. Much of the information outlined in the patent application reflects techniques already in use by Apple, such as finger gestures, focus selectors, and use of cursor keys and key combinations. However, the patent notably outlines new keys, such as a dedicated Share key that would bring up the iOS share sheet, an Emoji key that would presumably activate the on-screen emoji keyboard, and a magnifying glass key that could be used to bring up the Spotlight search window and/or activate Siri. As with most Apple patent applications, of course, it’s unclear whether any of the new features illustrated here will ever come to fruition.

The 86-year-old, worth an estimated £60bn, nearly quadrupled his stake in Apple late last year, raising his company’s holding from 15.2m shares to 57.4m. The iPhone maker’s shares hit a record high yesterday of $136.27 (£109.49) making his stake worth £6.3bn. Planning ahead: Warren Buffett, worth an estimated £60bn, nearly quadrupled his stake in Apple His firm Berkshire Hathaway also offloaded £723m of Walmart stock – a shift some will view as an admission the industry is in decline. The American dubbed the Sage of Omaha has focused on the threat from online retailers such as Amazon. Buffett told shareholders in Omaha last year: ‘It’s a big force and it has already disrupted plenty of people and it will disrupt more.’ The tycoon also upped his stakes in airline companies, including £1.7bn in each of American Airlines Group, Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines and United Continental Holdings.

Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 135.51 +0.49 +0.36% Samsung Electronics Co Ltd SSNLF ▲ 1,500.00 +100.00 +7.14% BOE Technology Group Co Ltd 000725 ▲ 3.27 +0.02 +0.62% Sharp Corp SHCAF ▼ 2.92 -0.01 -0.34% Apple’s been testing BOE’s active-matrix organic light-emitting diode screens for months but hasn’t decided if it’ll add the Chinese company to its roster of suppliers, one of the people said, asking not to be named talking about private negotiations. BOE, one of the country’s largest screen makers, is spending close to 100 billion yuan ($14.5 billion) building two AMOLED plants in the southwestern province of Sichuan in anticipation of future business. Talks are at an early stage and it’s unlikely to supply the next iPhone, but BOE is banking on outfitting the one in 2018 or later, the person said. If BOE is selected for OLED, it will become the first known future supplier of the next-generation screens to Apple outside of South Korea and Japan -- a triumph for a Beijing-based company best known for computer and TV displays. The U.S. company is exploring alternatives to address a global shortage of OLED displays as it prepares to adopt the sharper, more power-efficient technology for its next iPhones, catching up with rivals such as Samsung and Huawei Technologies Co. Apple declined to comment, and BOE declined to comment on talks with customers. The display is one of the most expensive components of a smartphone. OLED screens are more difficult to produce, making Apple beholden to suppliers still working to manufacture the displays in mass quantities. The world’s four biggest suppliers of smartphone displays -- Samsung Display Co., Sharp Corp., LG Display Co. and Japan Display Inc. -- are said to have insufficient capacity to equip all new iPhones this year, a constraint that may persist into 2018. That means Apple may be forced to adopt OLED in just a single version of its device this year, the 10th anniversary of the smartphone’s debut. “It’s an opportunity for BOE as Apple is known to seek multiple suppliers for one component,” said James Yan, research director for Counterpoint Research in Beijing. “But it’s unlikely to challenge Samsung because it is able to roll out high-quality screens at a steady capacity.” BOE’s shares had climbed 1.3 percent in Shenzhen by midday, outperforming a mostly unchanged benchmark A-share index. Universal Display Corp., which licenses and sells technology to makers of OLED screens, rose as much as 9.7 percent, the most since November. Founded in 1993 after employees took over an ailing producer of electron tubes, Beijing-based BOE is the world’s largest manufacturer of LCD panels by market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. BOE, which started out as Beijing Orient and enjoyed the support of a government keen to champion local technology players, is now building a 46.5 billion-yuan flexible AMOLED plant in Chengdu.  While it’s ramping up capacity, it’s likely to miss the next iPhone. That sixth-generation factory won’t crank out a single screen till the summer, while new iPhones typically go on sale in the fall. When that plant is up to full capacity, it’ll be able to put out 48,000 glass substrates a month, BOE said in an e-mailed statement, referring to the thin surfaces from which screens are carved out. Another plant in Mianyang with the same capacity and investment is expected to start production only about two years later. The company currently operates only a small OLED factory in remote Inner Mongolia. Eventually, when its two plants are up and running, it expects to be able to manufacture 1.6 million square-meters of flexible AMOLED glass substrates a year, slightly more than researcher IHS’ estimate for total global production in 2016. Apple typically introduces new technologies for its iPhones across all models when they’re unveiled, usually in September, as it did with 3D Touch and Apple Pay. Using different core, user-facing technology in the same iPhone generation would be an unusual step. All iPhone 7 models have liquid-crystal display screens.  The U.S. company and Samsung have an exclusive OLED supply deal covering 2017, people with knowledge of the agreement have said. Yet that doesn’t guarantee the South Korean technology giant can make enough displays to sate iPhone demand, particularly given Samsung needs to outfit its own slate of upcoming gadgets. Some analysts estimate that Apple could sell as many as 90 million iPhones in the last three months of 2017 alone.

"Just roll with it. If there's a little danger, what the hell, you're not going to live forever anyway."Munger, 93, spoke for nearly two hours to investors and students on a wide range of issues.He has been Buffett's right-hand man for decades, helping the 86-year-old build Berkshire into a roughly $410 billion conglomerate with more than 90 companies including insurers, utilities, food producers and a railroad.Berkshire also has large investments in dozens of stocks, including iPhone maker Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and the four biggest U.S. carriers: American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N).On Tuesday, Berkshire revealed multi-billion-dollar stakes in all five companies, marking a reversal of its longstanding aversion to the technology sector and antipathy to the "joke" that Munger said airlines once were. Berkshire is now Apple's fifth-largest investor, and the largest or second largest investor in the four airlines."The nice thing about the game we're in is that we can keep learning," Munger said."He's changed when he's buying airlines, and he's changed when he's buying Apple," he said of Buffett."I don't think we've gone crazy," Munger added. "I think we're adapting." Munger downplayed the impact of the recent scandal afflicting Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), in which Berkshire is the largest investor with a roughly 10 percent stake.Wells Fargo was caught flat-footed by the public outcry after it settled regulatory charges that workers created as many as 2 million sham customer accounts to meet sales goals. The scandal cost longtime Chief Executive John Stumpf his job.Munger said the bigger problem for Wells Fargo was not its sales culture, but how it reacted. "The mistake there was that when the bad news came, they didn't recognize it," Munger said. "I don't think that impairs the future of Wells Fargo."He was less definitive about the outlook of another big Berkshire holding, American Express Co (AXP.N), saying people would be in a "state of delusion" for thinking they could project the state of the payments system in a decade.Munger also defended his earlier faulting of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc's (VRX.TO) business practices, including the Canadian drug company's model of acquiring rights to drugs and driving prices higher.Criticism and regulatory probes have caused Valeant's growth plan to unravel, and its share price to plunge more than 93 percent in a year-and-a-half."It was really interesting how many high-grade people that took in," Munger said. "It was too good to be true."

We want to be able to deliver lower taxes so we can strengthen growth and create more jobs but we do need to get the budget back into surplus." Mr Turnbull said "we do not support the Labor Party's plans to increase capital gains tax or indeed their plans to outlaw negative gearing". SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Treasurer Scott Morrison during question time. Photo: Andrew Meares One change flagged to the capital gains tax would see the concession reduced from 50 per cent to 25 per cent, or a similar amount. An alternative model would see the concession increase the longer the property is owned, reaching 50 per cent after several years. In recent days, the government has threatened that tax hikes could be necessary to bring the budget into balance and fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme if $13 billion worth of spending cuts continue to be blocked in Parliament. Treasurer Scott Morrison told Fairfax Media the government would "exhaust every option we have to deal with the expenditure problem we have" and then finalise the 2017 budget measures. The priority is to reduce the deficit and hang onto to Australia's AAA credit rating.  According to the Grattan Institute, halving the CGT concession would bring in $3.7 billion a year and have a small impact on house prices.  Labor frontbencher Tony Burke said the opposition would look at the proposal "if it's a step in the right direction" and accused the government of hypocrisy and a "scare campaign". "Be in no doubt you cannot allow the situation to continue where the government is giving more help to somebody buying their tenth home than to a first home buyer," Mr Burke told Sky News. "Labor has been arguing this now for more than a year. If the government's getting closer to the mark, that's good, but no one should pretend that Scott Morrison emerged with any credibility."

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

Ogg February 15, 2017 10:40 am EST Print Email Tweet Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A) has released its public equity holdings as of December 31, 2016. While the stock picks and holdings of Warren Buffett and his portfolio managers are always followed closely, the number of changes for the 2017 portfolio was massive. 24/7 Wall St. has tracked Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway’s investments for years now, and the top issue here is that the changes actually look larger than they have ever been in any quarterly report. Buffett and his team of portfolio managers had public equity holdings of $147.9 billion at the end of 2016. This was up almost $20 billion from the $128.8 billion counted at the end of the third quarter of 2016, and it is even higher than the $115.46 billion counted as of December 31, 2015. Buffett is considered to be the ultimate “whale watch” by investors who like seeing what hedge funds and activist investors are buying and selling. After all, he is considered to be the best investor of modern times. One key issue to consider here is that Ted Weschler and Todd Combs obviously have been given an expanded role in running the Berkshire Hathaway stocks. 24/7 Wall St. has shown the full Buffett holdings, and the reality is that there are 13 major changes that need to be considered by investors. Again, the total volume of changes looks larger than anything ever seen from Buffett and his team on a quarterly basis. While Buffett doesn’t care about analyst reports and price targets, the consensus analyst price targets from Thomson Reuters have been included so investors can see how these match up against the current share prices. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has become a much larger holding for Team Buffett, and it was selected by one of the Buffett portfolio managers in 2016. The new Apple stake at the end of 2016 was 57,359,652 shares, up from just 15.227 million in the prior quarter. It seems quite fortunate for Berkshire Hathaway that Apple shares just hit a new all-time high on the same day that this higher stake was revealed. Does it seem odd for Buffett’s team to be buying up Apple shares when Buffett is good friends with Bill Gates, and considering that Buffett has pledged his estate to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation? If Berkshire Hathaway’s stake remained static, it was worth $7.7 billion in mid-February. Didn’t Buffett hate airlines for many years? His portfolio managers feel the opposite way now as they have grown their stakes to a sector bet worth over $9 billion. Maybe they now have a good model for the likes of Buffett. They have a wider moat to defend their business with fewer legacy carriers to compete against. Airlines also get to gouge their customers with any fees they can think of, and airline prices now have pricing power. Some airlines are even paying dividends. American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL) was a new stake at the end of September, and the portfolio managers more than doubled the stake. Berkshire Hathaway’s end-of-year stake in American Airlines was 45.54 million shares, up from 21.77 million shares just a quarter earlier. That stake would be worth some $2.1 billion in current terms, and with shares above $47, the consensus analyst price target of $54.33 would still indicate upside ahead. United Continental Holdings Inc. (NYSE: UAL) was a much larger stake of 28.95 million shares at the end of 2016. This had been listed as a new stake of 4.533 million shares at the end of September. If this stake has remained the same, it was worth more than $2.1 billion as of mid-February. At $75.50, United Continental shares have a 52-week range of $37.41 to $76.80, and they also have a consensus analyst price target of $85.44. Delta Air Lines Inc. (NYSE: DAL) was listed as a new stake of 60.02 million shares, up sharply from the prior stake of 6.333 million shares. With Delta’s stock at almost $51 after the filing was disclosed, this stake would be worth some $3.06 billion at current share prices. Delta’s 52-week range is $32.60 to $52.76. Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE: LUV) was also an airline stake that was taken at the end of the third quarter, but Buffett told CNBC that he bought this one after his portfolio managers bought the other big three airlines. The actual stake was not known when Buffett made that announcement a quarter earlier, but the new size of the stake was just over 43.2 million shares. Southwest’s post-filing share price was last seen at $56.50, in a 52-week range of $35.42 to $56.91, and with a consensus price target of $62.07. This Southwest Airlines stake would be worth more than $2.4 billion at current prices.

Thankfully, the circus has been saved—it found a buyer, and will come back in time for its 40th anniversary next fall. An NYC institution since 1977, the Big Apple Circus began struggling financially around the economic downturn in 2008, and suffered even more in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. Last summer, they tried to scrape up $2 million for fundraising to stay open, but fell over $1 million short of their goal, scrapping their 2016-17 season. But yesterday the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York okayed a $1.3 million auction bid from Big Top Works, which is an affiliate of a Florida-based investment firm. THEY'RE BACK, BABY. Big Top Works will have to maintain the Big Apple Circus's various programs and special performances for low income and special needs children, as part of the court-ordered action. It's unclear whether they'll hold next season at Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, as it has done for the last few decades. The Big Apple Circus won't have the same competition when it returns—the Ringling Bros. circus will shut down after May thanks to a massive drop in revenue.

What was created, however, was a market for inexpensive wireless headphones that don't cost hundreds of dollars. Even Apple's own offerings, both through its Beats brand and under the Apple name, are over $150. While I still think the Apple AirPods are some of the best tech I've used in years (they truly do "just work"), I've been using the IFROGZ Impulse Wireless headphones off and of for a few weeks, and you know what? At $60, I don't think you can find a better wireless experience. Specs Drivers: 40mm Resistance 32hms Sensitivity: 120dB +/- 3dB Frequency: 20Hz - 20KHz Listening time: 12 hours Standby: 58 hours Charge time: 2.5 hours via microUSB Connectivity: Bluetooth and 3.5mm headphone jack In the box, set up Jason Cipriani/ZDNet In the box you'll find the headphones, a microUSB charging cable, and a 3.5mm cable. Unfortunately, a small travel bag or carrying case isn't included. Latest review Battle of the Android flagships: HTC 10, LG G5, and Samsung Galaxy S7 All three of these phones are outstanding and are priced lower than a comparable iPhone 6s or 6s Plus. Read More Before you use the headphones with a Bluetooth device, be it your Mac, iOS device, Android device, or PC, you will need go through the pairing process. To put the Impulse Wireless headphones into pairing mode, you hold in the power button for roughly five seconds, and then connect to the headphones through the pairing menu on your phone, tablet or computer. Top ZDNET Reviews Dell Latitude 11 5000 7.9 Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9.3 Amazon Echo 9.0 Google Pixel XL Phone 8.0 A moment later, you'll hear a tone in the headphones and the pairing process is complete. Design Jason Cipriani/ZDNet The Impulse Wireless headphones are available in black with red highlights, or white with tan highlights. The majority of the housing is made of plastic that doesn't necessarily evoke thoughts of high quality, but it doesn't feel extremely cheap made either. A pair of "AreoFoam" pads rest against your ears, providing comfort during long listening periods. I found my ears would begin to hurt around the four-hour mark, but after a short break, I was able to continue listening. As someone who hasn't worn on-ear headphones in awhile, the discomfort isn't necessarily this particular pair of headphone's fault. The same type of foam is used to line the top band that rest against your head, again providing comfort. IFROGZ claims the pads also work as a means for passive noise cancellation. I found that claim to be true, but only for every day environmental sounds (example: typing on a keyboard, someone walking down the hall, etc). I wouldn't expect the passive noise cancellation to block out a screaming child or a chatty traveler in the row behind you during a flight. Jason Cipriani/ZDNet On the left side is where you'll find a 3.5mm jack, for use when the battery is dead, and the power button. On top of the right side is a volume rocker, with a play/pause button found on the bottom next to the microUSB charging port. Each side of the headphones fold into the middle of the footprint, decreasing their overall size and making it a breeze to throw in a backpack or purse when traveling. Battery life One of the biggest drawbacks to any Bluetooth device is battery life. Apple's AirPods, for example, can last five hours before they have to go back into the charging case. Samsung's Gear IconX last under two hours. IFROGZ touts the Impulse Wireless headphones as having a battery life of 12 hours. I wasn't unable to test these headphones for 12 hours straight, but I did keep track of various listening sessions, and I feel confident in saying the IFROGZ estimate is possible. That's what's so appealing to me about Impulse Wireless. As someone who frequently travels for work, walking through airports, sitting on a plane, and waiting for an Uber all while listening to music, battery life is of the utmost importance. Sound quality Jason Cipriani/ZDNet When it comes to headphones under the $100 mark, you usually have to make concessions on battery life, sound quality, or both. With the Impulse Wireless headphones, battery life isn't one such concession. However, sound quality isn't necessarily one either. I would put the sound quality of Impulse Wireless just below that of Apple's AirPods, yet above the included wired headphones Apple puts in each iPhone box. Unless you're an audiophile accustomed to hearing everything high, low, mid, and in-between, there's little to complain about in regard to sound quality with the Impulse Wireless headphones. Conclusion After a few days of use, I told my wife when it comes time to buy our children wireless headphones, they are getting Impulse Wireless headphones. Not only does the battery keep going, but they are comfortable and sound quality is a non-issue for my kids. Oh, and the $59 price tag makes it a bit easier to deal with the inevitable stolen or broken pair of headphones. If you want wireless headphones without spending a fortune, the Impulse Wireless headphones should be near the top of your list.

Samsung sold 76.8 million smartphones in the fourth quarter, giving it a market share of 17.8 percent, but it was just beaten by Apple, which sold 77 million iPhones for a 17.9 percent share, according to figures from Gartner. The fourth quarter is usually a strong one for Apple, boosted by holiday sales of the new generation of iPhones it releases each September, said Anshul Gupta, a research director at Gartner. For Samsung, though, 2016 ended particularly badly, dominated by the fiasco around the recall of its incendiary Galaxy Note7.

It's been two years since Apple topped the global smartphone vendor ranking but its lead is small with only 256,000 units difference. "The last time Apple was in the leading position was in the fourth quarter of 2014, when its sales were driven by its first ever large-screen iPhone 6 and 6 Plus," said Anshul Gupta, research director at Gartner. "This time it achieved it thanks to strong sales of its flagship phones — the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus; it also benefited from the weakened demand for Samsung's smartphones in mature markets such as North America and Western Europe, and in some mature markets in Asia such as Australia and South Korea." Another notable tidbit from Gartner's report is the decline of BlackBerry's market share. The company captured 0.0% of the smartphone market in 4Q16 as it turns its focus towards software. At the time of the iPhone's launch 10 years ago, BlackBerry was a dominate force in smartphone arena. Notably, TCL recently acquired the rights to design, manufacturer, and sell BlackBerry branded devices. Can the BlackBerry brand make a comeback?

First impression, we can say it yes Samsung did sh*t and those users flipped to iPhone, but usually the normal long time users are not anymore switchers, one good reason is the Operating System, once they are connected with one platfform they will stick on it. lets just admit that both iOS and Android are good OS systems, we buy our Apps and if we migrate to the other OS, mostly we loose the Apps and we have to buy them again :( if you look careful to the sold quantities, you see big increase from the Chinese branches (Huawei and Oppo), there are the flippers, they can use the same OS as before and get the same level of Phones for much lower price. Those Phones are selling like chipps all over the world for such cheap prices (supermarket promotions), even the Chinese are not buying them.

And then it all came crashing down. He had revolutionized personal computing and created an iconic brand – only to be forced out of the company he had built into a billion-dollar colossus. "I was out -- and very publicly out," he recalled in a commencement speech at Stanford University. "What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating." He added, "I was a very public failure." History is filled with trailblazers who stumbled before finding success. But Steve Jobs' career followed a different arc: a meteoric rise, a humbling fall, and then one amazing comeback, perhaps the most spectacular second act of all time. PHOTOS: Steve Jobs Through The Years "He co-founds Apple Computer when he is 21, and by the time he is 23 he's a millionaire. He becomes legendary. And then, at 30, he has this humiliating defeat," said Alan Deutschman, author of "Change or Die, The Second Coming of Steve Jobs." "But he persists, he has this incredible tenacity. He holds on and he comes back with triumph after triumph, driving this company to new heights, creating the greatest corporate success of our time. It's a unique story." Steve Jobs 'Devastated' When Fired By Apple The founding of Apple Computer is by now legendary. After dropping out of Reed College, Jobs and his buddy Steve Wozniak launched the company from his family's suburban California garage in 1976. In 1981, Apple Computer went public. Just two years later, Apple cracked the Fortune 500 and Jobs recruited John Sculley, the head of Pepsi-Cola, to be its new chief executive. "Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?" Jobs famously said. Jobs was Apple's chief visionary, a role that put him in charge of the team developing Apple's next revolutionary product, the Macintosh computer. The Mac debuted in 1984 to rave reviews but disappointing sales, putting a financial strain on the company -– and fraying Jobs' relationship with Sculley. "Jobs basically created his own team to create his own product, the Macintosh. His team actually had its own building. He even flew the pirate flag there. He said, 'It is better to be a pirate, than to be in the navy.' He had this company-within-a-company that became pitted against other parts of the company that actually made money," Deutschman said. The Jobs-Sculley relationship was further strained by complaints from workers on the Mac team about their demanding boss, according to William Simon, co-author of "iCon: Steve Jobs, the Greatest Second Act in the History of Business." Jobs "demanded so much from the people who worked for him. That was part of his greatness," Simon said. "But he drove people too hard. … being gentle and polite was not part of his demeanor." A power struggle erupted between Sculley and Jobs. In the spring of 1985 Apple's board sided with the CEO, removing Jobs from his command of the Macintosh group.

Well, someone like Steve Jobs could not sit in Siberia," Deutschman said. "Jobs told his closest friends and colleagues that it was a betrayal." Jobs left Apple and spent the summer of 1985 in a "midlife crisis, deciding what he wanted to do with his life and flirting with all kinds of possibilities" from entering politics to becoming an astronaut, Deutschman said. Steve Jobs Firing Was Best Thing That Happened to Him In his famous 2005 Stanford speech, Jobs admitted he "really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down, that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me." He added, "I even thought about running away from (Silicon) Valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me. I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. And so I decided to start over." The day after Labor Day, 1985, Jobs dialed up a former colleague and together they launched a new computer company, NeXT. Jobs also launched Pixar Animation Studios. "I think he wanted to prove his early success at Apple wasn't a fluke, that he wasn't a kid who got lucky and was in the right place at the right time," Deutschman said. "He still had a lot to prove. He still had a chip on his shoulder." In 1996, Apple Computer, by now struggling, acquired NeXT, returning Jobs to the company he helped to create. And the following year Jobs became Apple's CEO, driving the company to its greatest successes, from the iPod to the iPhone to the iPad. "The conventional wisdom was that Steve Jobs was a great visionary but not a good businessman," Deutschman said. "But in his second time at Apple he wasn't just a visionary. He made a point of learning how to be a great businessman." Jobs put it this way in his speech to Stanford graduates: "I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter into one of the most creative periods of my life," he said. "I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love." 0 Shares Email Star Comments When Steve Jobs Got Fired +Steve Jobs' Health: A Timeline +Steve Jobs: The World Reacts " House Republicans seek investigation into potential illegal DOJ leaks " Trump's secretary of labor pick Puzder withdraws nomination " Guilty plea expected involving San Bernardino terror attack Democrats and some Republicans want to stop Trump from lifting Russia sanctions " Teen girls found dead on hike investigated as double homicide " Cluster of rat-related disease discovered in Bronx section of New York, 1 dead Trump urges Venezuela to release 'political prisoner' Lopez " Trump's secretary of state on the spot on 1st foreign trip " NYPD investigates after video purportedly shows officer using stun gun on pregnant teen " Pope Francis: Native people have rights over their lands " China awards Trump valuable new trademark " Officials: CIA chief meets Palestinian leader in West Bank " Russian spy ship 30 miles from US Navy sub base " Former Dairy Queen manager charged with manslaughter in bullied teen's suicide " Woman chained in container says captor bragged about killing " Meet USA Curling's most improbable honorary captain: NFL star Vernon Davis " India launches more than 100 satellites into orbit " Ashton Kutcher blows a kiss to Sen.

Those states include Nebraska, Minnesota, New York, Massachusetts, Kansas, and Wyoming. But manufacturers and carriers like Apple and AT&T don’t think it’s such a good idea. According to a report from Motherboard, Apple representatives plan to be on hand in Nebraska to tell them that repairing your phone is dangerous. Meanwhile, lawmarkers in other states like Illinois and Tennessee are actively considering similar legislation that would allow smartphone owners and third-party repair shops access to parts in order to repair their own smartphones. An Apple lobbyist will be on hand to testify against the bill at a hearing in Lincoln starting March 9. AT&T was also reported to have been a part of arguing against this bill, but an AT&T representative reached out to state they are aware of the law but won’t be pursuing it. “The source told me that at least one of the companies plans to say that consumers who repair their own phones could cause lithium batteries to catch fire. Motherboard is protecting the identity of the source because they are not authorized to speak to the press.” This isn’t the first time that a manufacturer has opposed a Right to Repair bill, either. Lobbyists have said broken glass could cause cut fingers when a similar law was put forward in Minnesota last year. local_offer    Apple   Right to Repair   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (13) stars Further Reading Google and others team together to fight the immigration ban Samsung takes a backseat to Apple in smartwatch shipments Samsung's marketshare drops below 20%, first time in 4 years Demand for smartphone components increases The Apple v Samsung patent saga will continue stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertGet a free pizza from T-Mobile and Papa John's closeGet some free pizza courtesy of Papa John’s and T-Mobile Tuesdays Starting on February 14th, and lasting for 4 weeks, T-Mobile has partnered with Papa John’s to give T-Mobile Tuesday users a free large pizza and 25% off regular menu orders. 2 more_vertThe Moto G5 Plus has been leaked in its entirety closeThe Moto G5 Plus has been confirmed after showing up via an online retailer The upcoming Moto G5 Plus has been leaked in its entirely after the device was published through an online retailer.

Wednesday, February 15, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] Swift and Objective-C Forever? Jeff Johnson (Hacker News): When Swift became public in 2014, its creator Chris Lattner seemed to claim that Swift and Objective-C would coexist indefinitely. […] The problem is that nobody believes this. And of course Lattner has now left Apple, so he won’t be there to take the criticism is his claim turns out to be false. The consensus among developers is that Apple will eventually deprecate Objective-C, and Swift will become the sole first class language for Cocoa app development. […] You only have to review the history of Apple developer relations to see the long string of deprecations, disappointments, suffering, and broken promises. Objective-C garbage collection, 64-bit Carbon, the Cocoa-Java bridge, Yellow Box for Windows, Dylan. Need I go on? I could go on. Apple evangelists will tell you that Swift is the best programming language ever and then turn around and tell you that we’ve always been at war with Swift. […] The people who think Apple will deprecate Objective-C, how do they think Apple can handle it? Some people suggest that Apple will deprecate Objective-C externally, but they will continue Objective-C development internally and indefinitely. However, I think these people underestimate the problem. Given the amount of Objective-C code Apple has, and the constraints they’re working under, taking the slow road internally to a Swift future would be a very slow road indeed. I don’t see Apple dropping Swift. The technology seems to be sound, and Apple has really put its reputation on the line in a way that it didn’t with the other canceled projects. Plus, unlike those, Swift already has massive adoption outside of Apple. That said, I expect that Objective-C, while not being deprecated, will decline in popularity the same way that Carbon—also officially a first-class coexister—did. I don’t think that Apple will maintain sample code parity for much longer. Johnson is right that there are many open questions about how Apple will manage this transition—if that’s what it is—both internally and externally. It will affect the OS itself, Apple’s apps, the public APIs, and Apple’s own staffing. It’s got to be difficult for Apple to hire and retain WebObjects programers for its internal services, and it could face similar issues, to a lesser extent, if developers continue to switch to Swift.

Apple is currently doing opposite, pushing back against shareholders who are calling for the company to accelerate its efforts. A small group of shareholders led by investor Tony Maldonado have submitted a proposal to Apple asking the company to “adopt an accelerated recruitment policy...to increase the diversity of senior management and its board of directors." If the proposal is approved, it would require Apple to make diversity a priority when hiring at the top levels of the company. The timeline and initiatives put in place would be up to Apple, the proposal would just get the ball moving a bit faster. Maldonado has suggested tying executive pay to diversity goals—a move that Intel and Microsoft have made—or adopting a policy that would require the company to regularly search for potential new board members from diverse backgrounds. According to the company’s 2016 report, 87 of its 107 executive or senior official positions are held by men, and 88 of those seats are occupied by a white person. It is the second year that Maldonado has submitted his suggestion to increase diversity, though he has additional support in his effort this year thanks to backing from Zevin Asset Management, an investment firm that emphasizes what it calls “socially responsible investing.” Related Stories Tech Industry Trails Behind When It Comes To Diversity, New Report Shows Apple Planning To Fight ‘Right To Repair’ Bill Despite the support, Maldonado’s suggestion is unlikely to pass, thanks in large part to opposition from Apple. The company has advised shareholders to vote against the proposal, according to a filing from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Apple told shareholders in the letter that it is already exploring diversity efforts across its workforce and has made progress in attracting “more women and underrepresented minorities.” According to Apple, Maldonado’s proposal is “not necessary or appropriate because we have already demonstrated our commitment to a holistic view of inclusion and diversity." Apple has made strides in its diversity efforts. The company has reportedly removed pay disparities among its employees and has made some progress in its diversity hires. However, much of the changes have happened at the retail and non-tech parts of the company. Maldonado may not get the policy passed this year, but he doesn’t need the full support of shareholders to continue pushing his initiative. Last year the proposal got just over five percent support among shareholders, which was above the three percent threshold required to allow him to submit the idea again this year. He’ll need six percent support to be able to submit again in 2018. Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Apple, the richest company in technology, is finally moving into original video content. Apple said at a conference this week that it would introduce its first two television-style video series on Apple Music, its subscription music-streaming service, in the spring. Other original videos, including scripted dramas, are planned over the next year as the Cupertino company tries to build Apple Music into a cultural platform, said Jimmy Iovine, who heads the $10-a-month service. “There are a bunch of projects. We’re in it. This is what Apple Music is going to be,” Iovine said in an interview. “Apple Music will have video and other things that I can’t talk about. We’re going to be aggressive about it.” Most Popular 1 Concrete wall threatening to fall from SF high-rise stabilized 2 United’s 4-hour flight to nowhere 3 2,000-pound concrete slab threatening to fall from SF building Apple is still primarily a smartphone company. And despite sitting on $246 billion in cash and marketable securities, it insists it has no short-term plans to directly challenge streaming-video giants like Netflix and Amazon, which are increasingly commissioning high-quality original shows to attract and retain subscribers. “We’re not out to buy a bunch of shows,” Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president for software and services, said during an onstage interview at the Code Media technology conference in Southern California. But Apple does intend to use original video to help distinguish Apple Music, which began in June 2015 and has attracted than 20 million subscribers, from competitors like Spotify. “We’re trying to do things that are unique and cultural,” Cue said. Much like MTV did in its heyday, that means going beyond music. Apple aired a trailer for the first show, “Carpool Karaoke,” at the Grammy Awards on Sunday. The series, a spinoff of James Corden’s running sketch on “The Late Late Show,” will be available to Apple Music subscribers in April. The second program, “Planet of the Apps,” is a reality TV series about iPhone app developers competing to build the next great app. In the show, developers will make 60-second pitches, receive mentoring from musician Will.i.am, actresses Jessica Alba or Gwyneth Paltrow, or social media entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk to develop their ideas, then try to persuade a venture capital fund, Lightspeed Venture Partners, to invest in them. The winners will get prime billing in Apple’s App Store. “What does it take to be an app developer? Who are they?” Cue said, showing a trailer of the show with Ben Silverman, the veteran TV producer who brought the project to Apple. “Customers are going to love it.” Iovine said that Apple Music was also working on other video projects that are “so opposite” to the first two. “We’re doing dramas,” he said. “They just take much longer.” Also under consideration, he said, is a way for musicians to interact with their audiences. “We’re still experimenting,” he said. Iovine was a successful record producer before joining Apple in 2014 when he and musician Dr. Dre sold headphone-maker Beats Electronics to Apple for $3 billion. At Beats, Iovine said, “I didn’t see a stand-alone model that was going to work.” Apple, by contrast, had vast resources to invest in building a music service. Discussing Apple’s broader video ambitions, Cue said that the company was currently focused on two problems: how to make it easier to discover already-available content, and how to make it easier for video creators to innovate. He dismissed suggestions, however, that Apple wanted to compete with cable and satellite companies by bundling a group of video channels and selling subscriptions to its users. “We are happy doing the things we are doing today,” he said. “Where it goes, we don’t know.” Vindu Goel is a New York Times writer.

The Privacy Enthusiast's Guide To Using An iPhone Thorin Klosowski Feb 16, 2017, 7:00am ⋅ Filed to:  apple editor's picks ios ios 10 ipad iphone iphone downloads Share Your privacy is important, and now more than ever, it seems like everyone is trying to put eyes on your personal data. That might include advertisers, governments or some weird voyeur in your life. The good news is you can do a few things to your iPhone to make it more secure and privacy friendly without ruining the experience. Illustration by Jim Cooke. First things first: This is an Apple device and it's a smartphone, so you'll never hide yourself completely, but you can do a few things to shore up holes to make sure you're not making it easy for someone to collect your private information. We don't want to give you a false sense of impenetrable privacy here, but the below tips and various apps will at least lock down information as much as possible without disrupting your daily activities. The System Settings You Want to Change for Privacy First, you'll want to go through your general system settings and change a few things. Here's what we recommend, but pick and choose whichever features matter most to you: Set a strong, alphanumeric passcode: Head to Settings > Touch ID & Passcode and make sure you have a passcode. An alphanumeric passcode that includes both numbers and letters is usually seen as more secure than a numeric one. Don't use Touch ID: Touch ID is great for convenience, but it's a mess when it comes to privacy. Laws are still unclear about this, but right now in the US, police can force you to use your fingerprint to unlock your phone, but they can't make you cough up a passcode. To turn Touch ID off, head to Settings > Touch ID & Passcode, and disable the toggle for iPhone Unlock. Delete any widgets that display personal info: iOS 10 introduced lockscreen widgets, which are great, but they also potentially display all kinds of information you might not want easily accessible. Swipe to the right on the lock screen, then tap Edit to remove any widgets you have installed that display private data you don't want a stranger seeing. Disable certain home screen features: Head to Settings > Touch ID & Passcode and look for "Lock screen access". Remove anything that gives someone access to your personal info, like the Today View, Siri and Wallet. You might also want to disable Reply with Message here, since someone could reply to an incoming message without unlocking your phone. Disable tracking: Head to Settings > Privacy > Location Services > System Services and turn off Frequent Locations. This is a Maps feature that tracks where you go often under the guise of improving search. Turn off contact, photo, email, calendar or location access in apps that don't need it: Head to Settings > Privacy. Here, you'll see a list of a bunch of different system services, including location and contacts. These are the iPhone services you can grant apps access to. There might be some apps in here you don't remember authorising or you just don't want any more. Tap a service, then go through and disable any app you don't want to access that service. Remove notification previews: Chances are you don't want to disable notifications completely, but you might want to hide what those notifications display on the lockscreen. Head to Settings > Notifications and then disable previews for Mail and Messages. Turn on two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication is the best way to lock down your accounts so a stranger can't access it, even if they know your password. You can set it up for your Apple ID here. You should use two-factor authentication for all your other accounts as well. Enable Find My iPhone: Find My iPhone is a bit confusing from a privacy standpoint, but most people will benefit more from using it then not. With Find My iPhone enabled, you can track a lost phone using iCloud, and you can wipe your phone remotely. Apple will have access to the same information, so it boils down to whether you want to keep the data out of Apple's hands (in which case you shouldn't use an iPhone at all) or out of a thief's hands. Turn off iCloud backups for select apps: iCloud backup is insanely helpful, and while an extreme privacy nut would disable them in order to keep that data off of Apple's servers, an easier solution is to just turn off certain apps. If you head to Settings > iCloud > Storage > Manage Storage > Backups, you can choose which apps back up to iCloud and which don't. Disable any apps that hold sensitive data. Tweaking a few settings on your iPhone is part of the process. The apps you choose to use are important too. The Productivity Apps That Protect Your Privacy Most productivity apps completely disregard your privacy for the sake of convenience. This isn't a bad thing, as cloud syncing and smart organisation features are exactly the features you want from productivity apps. Still, you might not want all your data to somehow end up public, which is where these security-focused apps come in handy. Some, like a web browser or password manager, are useful all the time, and others, like an encrypted notes app or VPN, are only useful for certain things. None of these apps will keep your data private if you have a corporate managed iPhone with Mobile Device Management set up. If that's the case, get a separate phone and do not use your work phone for anything other than work. Web Browser: Brave or Firefox Focus You'll find a ton of different web browsers in the App Store that claim to protect your privacy, but the two we like the most are Brave and Firefox Focus. By default, Brave uses HTTPS Everywhere. It also blocks scripts, cookies, phishing and pop-ups. You can turn any of those features off and back on again on a per-site basis, which makes it easy to troubleshoot any problems or whitelist sites. Brave's desktop apps have an odd payment system to pay out publishers, but it doesn't seem to be in place on mobile. Brave can be a replacement to Safari, and has the features you need in a browser, like bookmarks, history and password manager support. Firefox Focus is very similar to Brave, but goes a step further. It blocks trackers, social media and cookies. Firefox Focus also makes it easy to wipe your browser history with a couple of taps, remove all passwords and delete any cookies. Firefox Focus doesn't feature tabbed browsing, so Firefox Focus is best as a supplement to Safari when you want to keep your browsing off the record. HTTPS Everywhere Updates To Keep You Secure On Thousands More Sites Chrome/Firefox/Opera. Using HTTPS is essential for keeping your personal information safe, especially when browsing on public Wi-Fi. Free extension HTTPS Everywhere recently updated with thousands more rules, ensuring HTTPS is enabled on as many sites as possible. Read more Email: ProtonMail or Gmail Email is a little harder to tackle from a privacy angle and what you do here depends on why you're concerned about privacy. If you don't want anyone looking at the emails you're sending, then you'll want to set up an email address with ProtonMail. You cannot use the ProtonMail iOS app without a ProtonMail account, but it is the most secure and private app out there. ProtonMail encrypts every message you send, which means the company can't even read your emails. If you send messages between two ProtonMail accounts, this happens automatically. If you send an email to someone not on ProtonMail, they will get a link to the message that needs a password in order to read it. If you need to keep email messages private and secure, ProtonMail is the app you want to use. For everything else, keep on using the Gmail account you've always used. Despite Google's data mining, the Gmail app does a good job of keeping your private data out of the hands of anyone else. Every email is over SSL, Gmail encrypts email from sender to receiver and two-factor authentication can secure your email in case you lose your device. Of course, Google has its eyes in there, but if you're concerned about some random person finding your phone then Gmail is a solid bet. Aside from a service like ProtonMail or running your own server, there's no great way to keep email private, at least on your phone. In that case, Gmail's at least a secure option. Messaging: Signal or WhatsApp When it comes to secure and private messaging, you have two popular choices in Signal and WhatsApp. Both feature end-to-end encryption, neither stores messages on their servers after they're delivered, both have voice-calling as well as messaging and both are super easy to use. Which app is better for you depends on where your contacts are, because both parties in a chat need to use the same app. Signal does have a few added security features over WhatsApp. Signal doesn't store metadata, but WhatsApp does. This means while WhatsApp doesn't know the contents of a message, it does know who the messages are between and records the data, which it could then hand over to law enforcement with a warrant. Signal does not store any of this. If you back up your iPhone using iCloud, Signal will not store your messages in the backup, but WhatsApp will. Your iCloud backups are encrypted so this shouldn't matter, but you'd typically want to keep this data local when possible. None of this matters to most of us, but it's all worth noting nonetheless. Password Manager: LastPass or 1Password The best way to keep someone out of your various online accounts is to have a good, strong password. The best passwords are too complicated for most of us to remember them, which is why you should use a password manager. We like LastPass and 1Password. Your password manager generates random passwords for all your sites, which makes it pretty hard for anyone to get into your accounts to snoop around. This has the dual benefit of security and privacy, since you won't know the passwords to your accounts, making it harder for anyone else to get to them. LastPass is free and syncs data across platforms. 1Password is $5.99/month if you want syncing, but can also store your password vault locally if you don't want that data on a server. Lifehacker Faceoff: The Best Password Managers, Compared You have lots of options for password managers, and when it comes to your security, you want the best possible tool for the job. Let's take a look at some of the most popular password managers and compare them side-by-side so you can pick the one that's right for you. Read more VPN: Hideman, Tunnelbear or NordVPN A VPN is an easy way to secure and encrypt your basic web usage. When you connect to a VPN, all your traffic is secure, which is most useful when you're on public networks. When you're at a cafe and on their Wi-Fi, you can connect to your VPN, then secure your traffic on a public network. This way, nobody can snoop on your traffic. You have a ton of options for good VPNs, but when it comes to basic usability, we like Hideman, NordVPN and Tunnelbear on iOS. All three require a monthly fee if you use a lot of data, but they also give you some free data, which is plenty for the occasional public web browsing at a coffee shop, hotel or airport. Why You Need A VPN (And How To Choose One) You might know what a virtual private network (VPN) is, but the odds of you actually using one are low. You really should be using a VPN — ultimately, you may end up seeing it as just as vital as your internet connection. We'll tell you why, explain how to choose a VPN provider and list five that are worth considering. Read more Notes: Keeply To be clear here, if you have sensitive data you want private forever, you shouldn't keep it on your phone. You also should not store it on a cloud service like Dropbox or Evernote, since no cloud storage is completely secure unless you go through and encrypt all your data ahead of time. If you have some stupid photos or notes you just want away from prying eyes, then Keeply is a good app to protect your data. Keeply gives you the option to link it up with Dropbox or keep data on your phone and lets you set up a special PIN to lock the app. Keeply stores notes, photos, passwords and credit cards. I'd stick to only using it for notes and photos personally, but alongside the PIN protection is also encrypts all data, so it should be pretty safe. What matters here is the data in Keeply never leaves your phone (unless you turn on Dropbox sync), so there's no chance it will end up online. Cloud Storage: SpiderOak Cloud storage is a bit tough to do securely and privately, but your best bet is SpiderOak. SpiderOak's "zero knowledge" privacy policy makes it so encryption takes place locally, so they have no idea what you're storing with them. The service doesn't have free tier like Dropbox or Google Drive, but the service is priced to compete, with $US5 ($7)/month getting you 100GB of storage. The Best Cloud Storage Services That Protect Your Privacy Cloud storage is easy to come by. Dozens of services shovel lots of free space to you just for signing up. But which of those services are looking at the files you upload, and which services encrypt your personal data? Let's take a look. Read more The iPhone app isn't nearly as robust as something like Dropbox, but it does maintain SpiderOak's level of security. If you need a secure online storage option to sync files up and make them accessible from your phone, SpiderOak is your best bet. With that, your normal iPhone usage should be generally private and secure from people both online and who access to your phone. There are often ways around all this, but at least you won't be making it easy for people to track you. Comments Jamie @jamie_parris Feb 16, 2017, 8:40am Turn off iCloud backups for select apps Not really privacy related, but it is also worth turning off apps here to save some space in iCloud. Having read this article, I noticed I only had a small amount of space left in iCloud due to iPhone and iPad backups. Most apps these days have their own login e.g Your Optus/Telstra Usage App, Various Shopping Site Apps, Betting Apps, Your Bank Account Apps... why do they need to be backed up? Answer is they don't. At most you might loose an app preference on restoring from backup. Reply 0 Daniel McCormack @reaidstar Feb 16, 2017, 9:02am Ensure that when you Turn On Two-Factor Authentication that you keep your Trusted Phone Number up to date, and Trusted Devices on hand. Apple has no control over Resetting your Password if you've forgotten it, and leaves it to an Automated System to Verify your Identity and Recover your Password if you don't have any of the requirements to Reset the Password, that can take a minimum of 3 business days, with no specific deadline for Recovery Also note, the GPS for allowing or disallowing a sign-in can be drastically inaccurate, and is usually based on where your Reception Tower, or Wi-Fi Exchange is coming from.

Chris Jager 16 Feb 2017 11:30 AM Back in 2013, an irate motorist in Adelaide attempted to pay his traffic fine with nothing but loose change. The video of the incident went viral and online debate raged over whether the council was entitled to refuse the payment. As we explained at the time, there are legal restrictions when it comes to paying for goods and services with coins - but how many is too many? This video has the answer.

By Emily Bary Feb. 15, 2017 1:39 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large PayPal turned Visa and Mastercard into its partners, instead of its “frenemies.” Illustration: Getty Images PayPal has a strong track record of diffusing threats within the payments industry, and that has one analyst feeling optimistic that mobile wallets like Apple Pay won’t be a problem for the company. More from Barron’s Next Under Armour’s Worst Days Could Be Behind It Why a T-Mobile Merger With Sprint Looks Less Likely Today When to Buy Airline Tickets to Get The Cheapest Fare Merchants can now add buttons for Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and other digital wallets to their sites, but it’s hard to get people to change their behaviors. PayPal has been around since the late 1990s, much longer than all of the newcomers, and it has about 200 million users who already store payment information with the service. “There’s a difference between competition and disruption,” Jefferies analyst Jason Kupferberg tells Barron’s Next. “None of these competing solutions have brought compelling enough value propositions to get consumers to switch.” The company’s latest quarterly results didn’t show any indication of Apple Pay hurting its business, even as Apple itself touted strong growth for Apple Pay. PayPal likely doesn’t have to worry about Visa or Mastercard either, he says. In the beginning, the company tried to get users to pay in ways that bypassed the credit-card networks, but it’s since changed its tune. PayPal and the card companies went from being “frenemies with undertones of real resentment” to partners. That’s key, says Kupferberg, because it means Visa and Mastercard aren’t waking up every day trying to destroy PayPal. It also means less friction on the consumer end, making people more willing to use the service. Another thing working in PayPal’s favor: its Braintree payment-processing platform. Even when consumers do choose to use Apple Pay, their payment may go through Braintree. That doesn’t bring the company as much money as having someone pay directly with PayPal, but it’s something. Kupferberg called PayPal’s $800 million purchase of Braintree in 2013 “one of the best acquisitions in modern payments history.” It’s probably worth far more today, given that smaller rival Stripe is now worth $9 billion. Braintree powers payments for major startups like Uber and Airbnb. With 70% to 80% of global transactions still done in cash, there’s a big opportunity for digital-payments companies to gain traction. Looking ahead, as far as winners in the industry, Kupferberg told us PayPal “is at the top of the list.” He thinks shares can hit $52, 25% above a recent $41.70. Big Picture: The overwhelming majority of transactions are still made via cash, and PayPal is still poised to benefit from a shift toward more digital payments.

Joe Mullin - Feb 15, 2017 8:01 pm UTC Enlarge / Various versions of the Apple Watch are displayed at a December 2016 press conference in an Apple store in Saint-Germain, Paris. Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images reader comments 30 Share this story A patent troll that has sued more than 80 companies by laying broad claims to Internet-connected "wearables" may be nearing the end of its road. The patent appeals board at the US Patent and Trademark Office has agreed to reconsider 16 patent claims owned by Sportbrain Holdings, LLC. The Patent Office's decision comes just three days after Sportbrain filed a lawsuit against Apple (PDF). Taking on its highest-profile target yet, Sportbrain claims that the Apple Watch violates US Patent No. 7,454,002, titled "Integrating personal data capturing functionality into a portable computing device and a wireless communication device." Further ReadingUnified Patents files legal challenges against top three patent trolls of 2016In dozens of lawsuits, Sportbrain's lawyers have argued that its patent entitles it to collect royalties on a huge range of devices and software products that gather user fitness information. Beginning in January 2016, Sportbrain unleashed a torrent of lawsuits against companies with connected watches and other wearables, like Garmin, Fitbit, Pebble, and Nike (PDF). It also sued tech companies like Apple, Samsung, and HP, and watchmakers including Timex, Tag Heuer, and Nixon. It has sued over software, too, filing cases against popular fitness apps like Strava and even Aetna (PDF). Sportbrain argues that the health insurance company infringes its patent with its "Get Active" online platform. “We will slingshot our IP at the offenders” Sportbrain Holdings, LLC follows a familiar track for patent-holding companies—a demise after the first dot-com bust and then a reincarnation more than a decade later as a patent enforcement company. In the year 2000, SportBrain Inc. launched a kind of early wearable, a smart pedometer called the SportBrain tracker that connected to a computer via a special "SportPort." "We believe the SportBrain personal fitness assistant (PFA) should become an essential part of everyone's lives," said Andreas Bibl, SportBrain CEO and cofounder, in a press release sent out that year. "As a nation, we need to get moving." SportBrain's website in 2011 advertised a kind of smart pedometer. Today, the company has shut down and turned to patent enforcement. www.sportbrain.com via archive.orgBy 2001, Bibl's company, which filed the '002 patent application, was out of business. After an apparent change in ownership, the reformulated SportBrain Inc. released the iStep X1 pedometer at the end of 2004. There's no apparent press coverage after 2005, however, and there's no evidence that the SportBrain pedometer made any inroads in the smartphone era. The owner of the second incarnation of SportBrain appears to be a man named Harry Heslop, who's a co-defendant in the inter partes review just instituted at the Patent Office. Patent Office records show that Heslop moved the patents from SportBrain Inc. into Sportbrain Holdings LLC in January of 2016, when the campaign of lawsuits began. Heslop couldn't be reached for this story, and the attorney for SportBrain Holdings didn't respond to a request for comment. The lead inventor of the '002 patent, Deane Gardner, also didn't respond to a call requesting comment. "As one of the first to market, successfully traded for 10 years, and then [to be] squeezed out by a plethora of Goliaths was unquestionably devastating," Heslop told Law360 when his litigation began last year. "As the 'David' in this story, we will slingshot our IP at all the offenders and unleash the full extent of the law until justice is served." The “Anti-Troll” A petition for inter partes review (IPR) against the '002 patent was filed last year by Unified Patents, a defense-oriented patent company that bills itself as "The Anti-Troll." It was part of Unified's campaign to challenge the "three most prolific patent trolls" of 2016: Sportbrain, Shipping and Transit, and Uniloc USA. The case against Sportbrain Holdings has passed a key hurdle, with the Patent Office agreeing last week to institute an investigation over all 16 of the claims in the '002 patent. In its decision (PDF), the Patent Office finds that it's likely that two earlier patents teach "collecting, storing, and compiling performance data at a web server." A Nike patent filed in 1999 by designer Albert Shum, now at Microsoft, describes collecting use information for a product, "such as an article of footwear," and offering "rewards" based on the level of use. In 1998, a company called Liquid Spark filed for a patent on a GPS-based performance monitor. IPR proceedings, created as part of the 2011 America Invents Act, have proven effective at knocking out patents at lower costs than traditional court proceedings. Most IPRs that are instituted by the Patent Office result in some or all of the patent claims being thrown out. "This is a great example of a patent that we believe is invalid, and never should have issued in the first place," said Unified Patents CEO Kevin Jakel in an interview with Ars. "We're happy the USPTO instituted the IPR, and the patent is well on its way to ultimately being canceled."   Joe Mullin Joe has covered the intersection of law and technology, including the world's biggest copyright and patent battles, since 2007.

At a Goldman Sachs conference yesterday, Apple’s chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, responded to a question on manufacturing by indicated that Apple’s focus is on creating jobs in other sectors. “One of the points that we are making in Washington is the fact that we have been a very large contributor to the US economy during the last decade,” Maestri said. “We made billions of investments in the United States. In the last 10 years, we created about 2 million jobs in this country — in the developer community in our retail stores in our call centers and through the supplier chain.” “It’s very, very difficult to speculate at this point.” Maestri says that “it’s very, very difficult to speculate” on Apple’s actions given that the Trump administration is yet to implement any changes that would encourage US manufacturing. But his comments still suggest that Apple is hoping to discourage talk of shifting manufacturing operations to the United States, which would be a difficult and expensive change. Though Trump hasn’t brought it up since taking office, he’s been calling out Apple for building products outside the US even since before he stepped onto the campaign trail. In November, after the election, Trump said he spoke with Apple CEO Tim Cook about the issue. He mentioned the issue up again, briefly, in January, just days before his inauguration. “I'm going to get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China,” Trump said during a speech last March. “How does it help us when they make it in China?” There’s been some indication that Apple is at least looking into bringing more manufacturing to the US, though nothing firm so far. Apple has also been assembling its Mac Pro computers in the US since 2013. This is a subject Apple has addressed and deflected for a long time. Steve Jobs is said to have once told President Obama that that manufacturing jobs “aren’t coming back.” And Tim Cook has said that the US just doesn’t have enough specialized workers. “You can take every tool and die maker in the United States and probably put them in a room that we’re currently sitting in,” he told 60 Minutes in 2015. “In China, you would have to have multiple football fields.” Asked for comment, Apple directed The Verge to a New York Times article about US jobs it’s created. That article contains a statement similar to Maestri’s remarks, saying that Apple has created 2 million US jobs since the launch of the iPhone. The company also said it made “the unique decision to keep and expand” its call centers in the US. “We plan to continue to invest and grow across the US,” the statement concluded. Maestri confirms that Apple is a fan of lower taxes At the conference, Maestri was also asked about another favorite subject of Apple’s: bringing foreign cash back to the US. Maestri repeated a position we’ve heard from Apple again and again, that it believes taxes are too high. “Hopefully, there is a good chance that something is going to happen this year,” he said. Maestri also discussed Apple’s view on a potential border tax, which is something that’s been floated by the Trump administration. Noting that it was hard to comment without seeing any legislation, Maestri said that “it is very hard for us to imagine that a border tax would be good for the US economy because it is a tax that would end up burdening the end consumer.” More From The Verge The Hawai’ian volcano that created a spectacular firehose of lava just collapsed Apple, Facebook, Google, and 94 others file opposition to Trump's immigration ban Google’s Super Bowl ad accidentally set off a lot of Google Homes Lady Gaga opened her Super Bowl performance with a protest anthem Trump is turning Elon Musk into a crony capitalist Why the sounds of eating make some people so angry Now Trending I've been doing Windows screenshots wrong this whole time Exclusive: The Caavo streaming box is built on game-changing machine vision for TV Nokia’s legendary 3310 rumored to return at MWC This Article has a component height of 15.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Shutterstock Tim Cook: Augmented Reality is as big of a technology as the smartphone Yoni Heisler @edibleapple February 12th, 2017 at 1:30 PM Share Tweet While Apple is typically very cautious when discussing upcoming products and technologies, the company’s interest in augmented reality is hardly a well-kept secret. In addition to some notable hires in the AR space, Tim Cook seems to wax poetic about the potential of AR every single time the topic comes up. While it remains to be seen if Apple’s interest in AR will ultimately manifest in a pair of AR-powered glasses or perhaps an iPhone with some intriguing built-in AR capabilities, it’s probably only a matter of time before we see what Apple’s engineers and researchers have been cooking up over at 1 Inifinte Loop. Underscoring the degree to which Apple views AR as an incredibly important and powerful technology, Tim Cook, during a recent interview with The Independent, boldly claimed that AR is as big of an idea as the smartphone was way back when. “I’m excited about Augmented Reality because unlike Virtual Reality which closes the world out,” Cook explained, “AR allows individuals to be present in the world but hopefully allows an improvement on what’s happening presently. Most people don’t want to lock themselves out from the world for a long period of time and today you can’t do that because you get sick from it. With AR you can, not be engrossed in something, but have it be a part of your world, of your conversation. That has resonance.” Notably, this isn’t the first time that Cook has championed AR at the expense of VR. This is particularly interesting given some calls for Apple to enter the VR space, especially now that other high-tech companies like Facebook, Samsung, Google and others have entered the space. Incidentally, we’ve seen a handful of reports claiming that Apple will release a pair of AR-powered glasses by 2018. Articulating why he believes that AR is as big of an idea as the smartphone, Cook’s enthusiasm was hard to miss: “The smartphone is for everyone,” Cook added, “we don’t have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it’s for everyone. I think AR is that big, it’s huge. I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives. And be entertaining. I view AR like I view the silicon here in my iPhone, it’s not a product per se, it’s a core technology. But there are things to discover before that technology is good enough for the mainstream. I do think there can be a lot of things that really help people out in daily life, real-life things, that’s why I get so excited about it.” All in all, it’s starting to look like the next two years may include a few watershed moments for Apple. Aside from Apple’s ongoing interest in AR, the upcoming 2017 iPhone 8 is starting to look like it will be worth every bit of the $1,000 that Apple will reportedly price it at.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Beyond the 160 Million OLED Displays already Secured with Samsung, Apple is now in Talks with China's BOE | Main | Apple Set to Fight 'Right to Repair' Legislation in Nebraska » February 15, 2017 Apple's Need for Slave Labor Clearly Overrides their Argument that a U.S. Plant is Impossible due to Supply Chain Issues   There have been many articles written about Apple's iPhone slave labor camps in China over the years and at the bottom of today's report I've listed a few in a random list. The BBC had announced on December 15, 2015 that they had created a documentary called "Apple's Broken Promises." You could review the full BBC documentary here. Below is just a snippet of that documentary.   Patently Apple wrote a damning report against the BBC report titled "The BBC Report About Apple is Motivated by Politics and Unions." At the end of that report I listed a series of other reports that I had written on the matter to that date – all pro Apple.   At one point I had read in a report (which is verified in one of the reports listed below) that Apple's CEO Tim Cook actually made the argument that making iPhones in China had nothing to do with slave labor but rather the fact that there was a sophisticated supply chain in China that couldn't be reproduced in the United States. No supply chain, no plant. Great argument. Two thumbs up.   But that myth was obliterated with Apple's decision to open a plant with Wistron in India. The battle royale with the Indian governement to date has been centered on a series of concessions with the leading one being that Apple will make iPhones in India but be allowed to import parts from China without penalty because there's no supply chain to speak of India and there won't be one for well over a decade, if ever.   To make this point crystal clear, this very subject just happened to come up again yesterday when Apple's CFO Luca Maestri spoke at Goldman Sachs investor conference. The Financial Times reporter stated in his report that Maestri suggested that it would be difficult for Apple to increase its manufacturing base in the US, which is one of President Donald Trump's key policies. Maestri stated that "Essentially the supply chain for the tech industry is not in the US today." Apple's propaganda continues.   So why is Apple racing to open a plant in India and fight it every inch of the way in the U.S. even with all-new tax breaks for Apple by the Trump administration. If it's not really about a supply chain as proven in India, then what's the hold back? One of the main reasons is the need to tap into slave labor just as the Chinese unions have been arguing for years.   By refusing to open an iPhone plant in the U.S. Apple knows all too well that the iPhone is likely to be hit with a huge import tax that Trump has promised. On that subject Apple's CFO Maestri stated yesterday that "It is very hard for us to imagine that a border tax would be good for the US economy. It is a tax that would end up burdening the end consumer."   Well, it'll only be a burden Mr. Maestri because Apple refuses to open a U.S. plant. So whine away Mr. Maestri, because Apple can't have their cake and eat it too.   It's hard for me to believe that Apple is openly willing to play political games on this issue leaving U.S. Apple fans to eat the penalty tax. Of course Cook will make it Trump's fault, but we know better.  I love Apple the company, but I won't pay a 40% tax on an iPhone over politics and I suspect millions will feel the same way. Who knew that Apple's CEO was a fan of Russian Roulette and willing to play with consumer and Wall Street loyalty like that? That's a game Mr. Cook may surprisingly not win.   If anything, their stubborn stance could open a huge door for a competitor like Microsoft to open. Not all iPhone users are purists and cultists. For many young fans its about the 'cool factor' and it's not going to be cool to get hit with a huge consumer tax courtesy of Apple's CEO. A local company making a quality smartphone could be a big winner here.   In the end I'll continue to cheer Apple on as always, applaud their patented ideas and laugh at Samsung and their competition whenever possible. But after years of swallowing Apple's take on slave labor, I give up. China's unions may have had it right all along and I was defending the undefendable. It seems to be more about slave labor than I could have ever imagined. The supply chain argument sure sounded good, didn't it? But recent moves by Apple have proven it all to be a myth. And you can't put the Genie back in the bottle once you see a lie for what it is.   Will Apple's CEO surprise us all with news of a U.S. Plant later this year or did Apple's CFO just take the wind out of that balloon? I suspect it's the latter.    About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

While Apple has been hard at work putting the finishing touches on the campus, which is slated to open later this year, Minecraft player Alex Westerlund has been building a Minecraft version of Apple's second campus. According to Westerlund, building the campus in Minecraft took him 232 hours over the course of a year. He used construction plans along with topographical maps to create an accurate rendition of the campus, down to the land it's built on. As can be seen in the video, the ring-shaped main building has been faithfully recreated, with its curved glass windows, massive doors, solar panels, window awnings, and more. Westerlund says the main building is "absolutely massive" at 469 blocks across, with every hill, path, and orchard placed according to construction plans. The courtyard of the building includes trails, two cafes, a cafeteria patio, cherry trees, a fitness center, and a fountain, while the interior features atriums and a huge cafeteria built to match a publicly released rendering. Apple's real second campus is nearing completion. According to the latest drone video, construction crews are hard at work on landscaping and are wrapping up work on solar panels and a nearby research and development facility. The campus is expected to be finished in 2017, but exactly when employees will move in remains unclear. Westerlund tells MacRumors that as Apple continues work on its campus, he'll continue to flesh out his virtual version, putting in up to four hours of active building time per day.

 These ‘smart’ headphones let you listen to music and charge your iPhone 7 at the same time Jeff Dunn Feb. 15, 2017, 2:01 PM 3,497 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Pioneer Rayz Plus earphones. Pioneer It’s been five months since Apple omitted the 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone 7, and if Apple’s latest sales figures are any indication, the world seems to have gotten over it. That doesn’t make its removal any less annoying, though. Case in point: On its own, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus do not allow you to charge your phone and listen to music simultaneously. If you’re, say, on the go, and your phone is running out of juice, you can’t plug the device into a portable battery and listen to your playlist at the same time. There are ways around the conundrum today: You can either buy a pair of wireless headphones — and Apple has plenty to sell you — or pay for an appropriate dock or dongle. Apple sells one of the former for $50, though there are third-party options that go for less. Either way, it’s an extra step. With its new Rayz Plus earphones, though, electronics maker Pioneer is building one of those dongles directly into a pair of headphones. They still connect to an iPhone via a Lightning connector, but toward the end of their cable is a small adapter with its own Lightning port, into which you can plug a charging cable and pass power through to the iPhone itself. The pass-through charging is only available with the $150 Rayz Plus, but Pioneer is selling a $100 Rayz model too. There’s a handful of fairly smart features on both, including a programmable “smart button” that lets you open select apps, noise cancelling tech that’s supposed to adjust to your ears and environment, a “HearThru” mode that lets in ambient noise as your music is playing (a la the Bragi Headphone and others), and an AirPods-like feature that automatically pauses what's playing once you remove an earbud from your ears. Pioneer says it’s able to do all of this thanks to a new chip from Oregon-based semiconductor company Avnera that is said to conserve more power than usual. This would get at the big concern with Lightning headphones: All the tricks that a digital connection like Lightning can provide still need power. If you don’t want to bulk up a headphone with a separate battery pack, then that power needs to come from the phone, which can then deplete the phone’s battery life. Exactly how much power the Rayz chews up from the iPhone, and whether or not its smart features are even worth it, will be unclear until we’re able to test the device further. None of this gets at how good the earphones actually sound, either. And the fact that "charging while listening" is now a problem that needs solving is still strange. But if nothing else, they may address one of the more irritating side effects of Apple’s decision to kill the headphone jack. Pioneer has not specified a release date for either model just yet.  SEE ALSO: The 11 best wireless headphones you can buy NOW WATCH: 7 hidden iPhone tricks that only power users know about Loading video...

Apple will amaze us one again this September with an iPhone like never before. The iPhone 8 is expected to consist of various updated features, technical improvements, and will celebrate Apple’s 10th anniversary. Though the new features may be rumors because nothing is concrete yet, the expected features will include an OLED (light emitting diode) display, a glass body and a faster A11 processor. It will also have an edge-to-edge display, no home button and wireless charging. These features are dissimilar to the past iPhones and demonstrate the uniqueness and pronounced upgrade of the new phone. This iPhone is specifically distinguished from the iPhone 7 because it may lack aluminum and will instead be stainless steal. The design of this iPhone is also dissimilar from the past iPhones considering it will be touch ID and the camera might be built directly into the display. With that being said, there will be no home button and it might appear as a mere piece of glass. Additionally, the flexible plastic OLED will make for a thinner device and fortunately, consume less battery power. Other exciting features may include more water resistance, long-range wireless charging like we’ve never seen before and even a dual lens camera. Furthermore, the iPhone 8 is expected to consist of biometric additions like iris, facial, or gesture recognition. Clearly, this 5-inch premium model is going to go viral with these distinctive features if the rumors are true. Though many of these features may be rumors, Apple’s iPhones hardly ever disappoint and we are excited to see what’s in store at the Apple Store this fall.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) rumor mill today is a patent for a new smart keyboard. Today, we’ll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Wednesday. Smart Keyboard: Apple has filed a patent for a new smart keyboard, reports MacRumors. The new smart keyboard that appears in the patent seems to be designed with social media in mind. The patent shows that it includes “Share” and “Emoji” buttons. The smart keyboard also includes a “Magnifying Glass” key that could serve multiple functions. This includes a short press for searches, two short presses for shortcuts and holding it to bring up Siri. South Korea: An Apple Pay launch in South Korea is still in its early stages, AppleInsider notes. While the tech company has met with some officials in the country to explain how the system works, it hasn’t been taking part in detailed discussions, yet. A recent report also claims that it still hasn’t set up a schedule for any meetings of this nature. A card company in South Korea has confirmed that this is the case and says that it has only had early talks with AAPL. Right to Repair: A new report claims that Apple is planning to fight “right to repair” legislation, reports Motherboard. Nebraska state legislature is considering the bill and an inside source claims that AAPL will step up against it. The legislation would make it so that customers would have access to repair parts and service manuals for the company’s devices. AAPL has fought against similar bills in the past. There are currently eight states that are considering right to repair legislation.

The Right to Repair movement is gaining momentum, lobbying companies to let consumers fix their own devices. Right to Repair legislation has recently been drafted in the state of Nebraska. If it becomes law, Apple and its rivals would need to supply repair manuals and official parts to customers and third-party repair shops. Consumers with the necessary technical expertise would be able to repair their own devices, without having to return them to the manufacturer. Electronics teardown specialists like iFixit have been helping people to mend their own gadgets for years. Recently, companies including Apple have made it harder to dismantle products though, using screw types that cannot easily be removed. Internal connectors have also become more complex, making it difficult to correctly reassemble devices. The right to repair movement argues consumers shouldn't have to pay retail prices to fix broken devices. Led by Repair.org, a body of independent repair shops, supporters are vocally critical of tech companies who make it difficult to mend new products. Manufacturers are lobbying lawmakers with counterarguments though, including claims that customers could hurt themselves while repairing devices. Last year, lobbyists in Minnesota suggested users may cut their fingers on broken glass if attempting a smartphone screen replacement. Motherboard reports that one of the U.S. phone companies plans to contest the new legislation in Nebraska by implying repairs could cause batteries to ignite. Apple plans to attend the same hearing, according to the news site's sources. The company will send a representative or lobbyist to testify against the bill, likely also working along the lines of personal injury and trade secrets. Manufacturers have expressed concern that service manuals could detail the inner workings of their products, despite teardowns being widely available online. More than anything, the right to repair movement represents consumers demanding more control over the products they buy. The days are now gone of being able to mend anything and everything with a basic set of tools. Apple and other industry leaders are quick to suggest the best repairs are done in-house but often the same work can be done a lot cheaper elsewhere. Nebraska is now one of eight American states where right to repair bills are being drafted. Last month, Minnesota, New York, Massachusetts, Kansas and Wyoming announced similar legislation that could force companies, in and outside of tech, to open their products to customers. Repair.org is intending to push bills in as many states as possible, making it harder for manufacturers to simply knock down the lobbyists.

The patent, purchased by Apple as part of its acquisition of a display company called LuxVue in 2014, details a system of using LEDs mounted underneath a display to both detect finger’s position and scan its surface to be able to read a fingerprint. Apple said in the newly reassigned patent : “When the fingerprint is placed upon the transparent substrate, the sensing IR diodes within the display panel sense patterned IR light reflected off grooves of the fingerprint surface. “This patterned IR light is relayed to the output processor as a bitmap where it is processed to determine the fingerprint surface’s unique pattern. Because the display panel can sense IR light, the display panel is able to perform surface profile determination when the display panel is not emitting visible light.” The LuxVue-developed technology concentrates on using tiny LEDs under the display to replicate the ability to detect the presence of a finger or other interacting element against the glass of a screen. The majority of mobile devices use capacitive touchscreen layers, which detect a change in capacitance when a finger or other conductive element touches the screen. The technology is also used in many fingerprint sensors and other devices, but has drawbacks particularly in cold weather -- they do not work very well when a finger is covered in a glove unless that glove has conductive surface. The patent describes the use of the array of LED sensors under the display to replicate the functions of both a traditional capacitive touchscreen and a fingerprint scanner, replicating the function of Apple’s Touch ID home button. Apple states: “The ability to detect an object’s surface profile while the display panel is not emitting visible light enables the display panel to detect a user’s fingerprint to unlock a mobile device such as a cellphone when the display panel appears to be off. “Accordingly, the display panel need not emit visible light to detect a surface profile of an object, nor does the display panel require a separate sensor to detect the surface profile of an object.” Apple is not the only company working on new technologies to allow components necessary to the function of a modern smartphone to be moved under the display. Sensors such as ambient light detectors, which provide information to adjust the display’s brightness in line with current light levels, presence sensors that turn off the screen when you put the phone to your ear, the earpiece speaker and the selfie camera are all currently mounted above or around the screen in separate panels. The placement of those components is one of the biggest hurdles standing in the way of all-screen smartphones, where the unnecessary bezels around the screen are removed in favour of a display that reaches to the very edges and top and bottom of the phone. Progress is being made to reduce the need for bezels around the display. Some smartphone manufacturers, including Huawei, Google and LG have moved the fingerprint scanner to the back of the device. LG’s latest Android Wear smartwatches have a new ambient light sensor that can operate from beneath a screen, while Sharp and Xiaomi have both released smartphones that use bone-conduction systems built into the screens to remove the need for a separate earpiece speaker at the top of the device. At the same time, Apple’s iPhones have continued to have large symmetrical bezels at the top and bottom of the their screens, with the home button and integrated Touch ID fingerprint scanner mounted within the bottom bezel and the speaker grille, sensors and selfie camera in the top bezel. These large bezels have made the body of company’s smartphones relatively large compared to competitors, despite having smaller display areas. Samsung’s highly anticipated Galaxy S8 smartphone is expected to have an edge-to-edge “infinity display” with thin top and bottom bezels that do not even have room for the company’s logo. It should give the Galaxy S8 one of the highest screen-to-body ratios of any smartphone, but even then it will not be truly all-screen.

Trump's Android Phone a Hack Risk? Next Article > Encrypted Messaging Service 'Signal' Introduces Video Calling in Beta By Shirley Siluk / NewsFactor Business Report PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 15 2017 Users of the Signal encrypted messaging and voice calling service, famously employed by National Security Agency (NSA) contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden, can now also use the app for encrypted video chats. Open Whisper Systems, the software company that developed Signal, announced new public beta support for encrypted video calling yesterday. The release for both Android and iOS is built on "an entirely new calling infrastructure" that should also improve the voice call quality of the service, the company said. First released in 2014, the Signal app is based on the Signal cryptographic protocol, which is also used for secure messaging by Google Allo, Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. Such encrypted services are often used to provide secure communications for news tips and conversations between sources and journalists, among other purposes. 'Entirely New Calling Infrastructure' Being rolled out in stages to enable feedback about its performance, the latest version of Signal also brings together what were once two different Open Whisper Systems applications, one to support texting and one designed to enable real-time voice calls, company founder Moxie Marlinspike wrote yesterday in a blog post. "This represents an entirely new calling infrastructure for Signal, and should increase voice call quality as well," Marlinspike said. "We think it's a big improvement, but we're rolling it out in stages to collect feedback from people with different devices, networks, and regions in order to ensure there are no surprises when it's enabled for everyone by default." The new encrypted video calling will only work between two Signal users who have both enabled the beta application. iPhone users will also be able to take advantage of new capabilities introduced with last year's iOS 10 update so they can answer incoming Signal calls with one touch directly from the lock screen. Encryption Controversies Back in the News Media organizations, including The New York Times, use Signal to encourage encrypted news tips from readers and other sources. The application has also been endorsed by Snowden, who in 2013 provided journalists with a large cache of classified documents detailing the widespread use of surveillance by the NSA. The mainstream use of encryption to protect electronically transmitted information has long been a source of frustration for many in the intelligence, law enforcement and political communities. FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director James Woolsey are among officials who have pushed for security backdoors that would allow intelligence agencies to bypass encryption protections. Controversies about encrypted communications have also erupted again in the news recently. For example, BuzzFeed reported yesterday that two Republicans in Congress have called for an investigation on the Environmental Protection Agency's use of encryption. Meanwhile, other news outlets reported this week that some White House staffers have been using an encrypted chat app called Confide that automatically deletes messages after they are received and read.

BOE would be the first display manufacturer outside of Japan and South Korea to supply displays for an iPhone, and they’re also working on a flexible AMOLED display. The report states that Apple is looking for “next-generation displays for future iPhones” from BOE and is currently testing the displays. Apple is reportedly testing OLED panels with BOE as it struggles to source the tech for the upcoming iPhone 8. Though, it’s highly likely that BOE will miss the launch of the iPhone 8 this year, but will continue to work with Apple for the 2018 iPhone. BOE is currently in the process of building out two OLED display factories in Sichuan, according to today’s report. The company reportedly spent $14.5 billion in order to build out these factories.

Motherboard reports that Nebraska will have a hearing next month with Apple formally opposing the bill. According to the source, an Apple representative, staffer, or lobbyist will testify against the bill at a hearing in Lincoln on March 9. AT&T will also argue against the bill, the source said. The source told me that at least one of the companies plans to say that consumers who repair their own phones could cause lithium batteries to catch fire … It’s unknown what arguments Apple will be using, whether it’s safety concerns or the complexity of their devices in recent years. Nebraska is reportedly one of the eight states in the U.S. that are considering passing this bill. However, Apple has successfully lobbied against this bill in New York in the past. Gay Gordon-Byrne, executive director of Repair.org, says that safety concerns is something that lobbyists have used in the past and that she plans on poking fun at the idea during the hearing. Last year, industry lobbyists told lawmakers in Minnesota that broken glass could cut the fingers of consumers who try to repair their screens, according to Gordon-Byrne. Byrne said she will also testify at the Nebraska hearing and “plans to bring band aids.” Repair.org believes that if one state is able to pass the bill, manufacturers will just give in to the idea, citing similar outcomes in the car industry years ago. In 2012, a Massachusetts law guaranteeing the right to repair automobiles became de-facto national legislation after car manufacturers decided to comply with the law nationwide rather than continue to fight burgeoning legislation in other states.

But the lead is razor thin. Apple shipped about 77.04 million smartphones in the fourth quarter, Gartner estimated, just ahead of the 76.78 million shipped by Samsung. That means Apple has 17.9 percent of the global smartphone market share, narrowly above Samsung's 17.8 percent. It's the smallest difference Gartner has recorded. This time last year, Samsung had nearly 21 percent of the market — but the massive global recall of its Galaxy Note 7 device slowed down sales in the third and fourth quarters, said Gartner research director Anshul Gupta. Samsung, unlike Apple, has a wide range of high- and low-end phones and has used that variety to dominate the global market. Now that Apple has had better-than-expected sales of the high-end iPhone 7 Plus, the companies are closer than ever, separated by 256,000 units, according to Gartner. The data square with research from other firms that track the industry, like Counterpoint Research. Tweet: Huawei, Oppo & Vivo (HOV) registered stellar growth in 2016 together shipping 300 million+ smartphones Apple and Samsung face mounting competition from Chinese smartphone brands Huawei, Oppo and BBK, which grew their collective share by 7 percentage points in the fourth quarter, according to Gartner. "Huawei is poised to reduce the gap further with the No. 2 global smartphone vendor," Gupta said. Huawei shipped about 40.8 million phones in the fourth quarter, according to Gartner, and announced a U.S. launch in January. Huawei hopes the launch will propel it to No. 2 within two years, Richard Yu, director and CEO of Huawei's consumer business group, has said.

 Apple’s 'vision' for its next big thing convinced a big company to sell itself for cheap Kif Leswing Feb. 15, 2017, 1:18 PM 5,443 facebook linkedin twitter email print Reuters Apple CEO Tim Cook said last week that augmented reality can be as big as the iPhone.  It's not the first time that Cook has talked up Apple's plans in AR, a technology that integrates computer graphics and internet information with the real world — think of a next-generation Google Glass or "Pokémon Go," or the fun face filters on Snapchat.  Whatever Apple ends up doing in AR, it's likely to include Metaio technology. Apple bought the company in 2015, as one of the first AR companies it purchased in a mini-run of AR acquisitions.  In fact, Apple may have gotten a deal on Metaio because of its vision for the technology, Bloomberg reports in a longer story about Apple's M&A strategy.  From Bloomberg: That was the case when Apple acquired Metaio in 2015. Bankers appointed by the augmented-reality firm to negotiate weren’t allowed in the room, and while Metaio executives felt the offer was low, Apple’s vision for the technology convinced them to sell, according to a person familiar with the discussions. This raises the question: What's Apple's vision for the technology, and why did it allow them to get a good price for a company that had been around for over a decade and had active clients, including major companies? A German document confirming Apple's purchase of the company suggests that Apple paid a euro per share, or roughly 30 million Euros for the company, although that may only have encompassed part of the price of the company. There are other signs that Metaio could be critical to Apple's AR products or strategy. Metaio's former CEO, Thomas Alt, changed his job title last summer to "Director of Procurement, Strategic Deals Team" at Apple.  Since the Metaio deal closed, Apple has bought other AR startups including Flyby Media and Indoor.io. Apple has also looked at other AR technologies, but no other deals have yet surfaced.  Here's a video of what Metaio technology was capable of before it was purchased. What's Apple's vision for this technology? Did you work for Metaio? Know anything about Apple and AR?

Image:  MARCIO JOSE SANCHEZ/ASSOCIATED PRESS By Kerry Flynn2017-02-15 18:11:33 UTC Apple should be working faster. Not on building the next iPhone, or even creating the next hit TV show, but rather, on increasing the diversity at the company.  That's what a small group of shareholders, led by vocal investor Tony Maldonado, have been pushing. Later this month, Apple shareholders will vote on a proposal to increase the racial diversity of executives and board members through an "accelerated recruitment policy."  Apple's advised shareholders to vote against the new proposal, stating that it has programs to address the issue throughout the company.  But one point that Apple doesn't emphasize—and one reason for its current lack of racial diversity at the top—is how hiring works within Apple. To become a senior-level VP or a C-suite exec at Apple, you most likely have worked at the company for decades. And decades ago, diversity hiring practices weren't nearly as important or scrutinized as they are right now. Therefore, if you have seniority at Apple, odds are, you're a white male. Image: apple And Maldonado's specific accusation is, uh, spot-on: Apple's senior leadership? All-white.  To be sure, Apple's diversity numbers overall are actually some of the best in the tech industry, especially when you look at the percent of new hires who are women and underrepresented minorities. The proposal specifically addresses racial diversity in senior leadership, but Apple also has unique cred in diversity: Tim Cook was the first openly gay CEO of a Fortune 500 company.  It isn't the first time the call for racial diversity at the top has been made. A similar proposal was considered at Apple's 2016 shareholders' meeting, and received 5.1 percent of the vote—not enough to be accepted but enough to be reconsidered.  "Tim Cook was very defensive, and he presented the two black people on their leadership—but not senior leadership—as a sign of their diversity," Maldonado told The Verge. "Personally, I took it as an insult. They were put on the spotlight as 'here's tokenism,' and he didn't seem to accept that." Out of the 11 people who in a C-level position or a senior vice president, all are white, and there's only one woman.  Apple's board of directors has eight members. Two are female. One of those women is Asian, and the other's white. One member, James A. Bell, is a black man. The other five members, or 62.5 percent, are white men.  "Apple has rarely ever had many people of ethnic or racial diversity within their board or senior leadership," he told The Verge. For a 40-year-old company “that’s laughable. That's racism plain and simple. That's all it is. There has to be plenty of people with sufficient qualifications.” Maldonado does have point. There are definitely people in this world with sufficient qualifications who could serve on Apple's leadership. But a reason for why diversity is low among those top ranks relates how Apple's senior hiring process works.  The vast majority of Apple's senior leadership positions are made via promotions at the company, rather than external hires. Let's look deeper:  Tim Cook, CEO* — 1998, joined as SVP of operations Angela Ahrendts* — 2014, joined as SVP of retail Eddy Cue — 1989, content stores  Craig Federigh — 1996, from NeXt  Jonathan Ive — 1992, designer  Luca Maestri — 2013, control controller and vice president of finance   Dan Riccio — 1998, VP of product design  Philip W. Schiller — 1987, marketing  Bruce Sewell* — 2009, joined as general counsel  Johny Srouji — 2008, senior director of handheld chips Jeff Williams — 1998, head of worldwide procurement  So, three of Apple's 11 members of senior leadership joined at that level.  Things look slightly better when you take a step down the ladder: Image: apple Apple's seven VPs include two women, both of whom also bring underrepresented minority representation to the team.  If Apple sticks to its habit of promoting from within, the diversity picture at the top of the company might soon start shaping up.  Apple reported 32 percent of its current employees are women, 9 percent are black and 12 percent are Hispanic and over the last year 54 percent of new hires are minorities: Image: apple Meanwhile, there are other tech companies that refuse to release any data on diversity, whether it be hires or current employee count.  Snapchat soon to become a publicly-traded company has not shared any diversity statistics about its 1,859 employees. Uber has more than 9,000 office employees and has not met diversity advocate Jesse Jackson's request for a report by mid-February.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Feb 15, 2017 at 11:19AM It's been three full months since reports that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would be adding organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays to only one of its three new iPhone 8 models sent shares of OLED specialist Universal Display (NASDAQ:OLED) stock tumbling 5% in a day. But this week, the momentum is reversing. On Tuesday, news broke that Apple has gone ahead and signed a licensing deal with Samsung to order OLED displays for its iPhones. While the rumor doesn't extend to whether Apple will be putting OLED displays in all models of the iPhone 8 or just one, investors are taking the bait either way. Yesterday, Apple stock hit a new all-time intraday high of $135.09 -- and it's pulling Universal Display stock up alongside it. Here are three things you need to know about that. OLED screens -- and OLED stock -- are in focus today. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Susquehanna hails the news It's well-known that Universal Display is a supplier of OLED technology and OLED materials to Samsung -- which we now know will in turn supply OLED screens to Apple. So naturally, Universal Display shares shot 3.6% higher in Tuesday trading, and were up a further 4% on Wednesday morning. Helping to keep the momentum train moving was a new initiation of coverage on the stock from Susquehanna. As reported on StreetInsider.com around about midnight last night, Susquehanna has initiated coverage of Universal Display stock with a "positive" rating and a big, round price target of $100. 2. Stay tuned for more news Susquehanna's new rating implies a one-year profit potential of nearly 50% on Universal Display stock, which currently sells for just $67 and change. That's a big return for just one year's investment, and we'll get our first clue as to whether it's a realistic hope next week. On Thursday, Feb. 23, Universal Display plans to release its financial results for fiscal Q4 and full-year 2016. 3. What analysts predict Here's what Wall Street analysts are telling investors to expect from that report: Profit growth of 8%, from $0.39 per share earned a year ago to $0.42 in profits for Q4 2016. And sales growth of only 10%, with $68.6 million in quarterly sales expected. If these modest numbers seem like pretty slim reeds to be supporting Susquehanna's expectation of a 50% surge in stock price at Universal Display -- well, they may be. Based on its most recent reported results, Universal Display stock currently sells for nearly 79 times trailing earnings, and 46 times trailing free cash flow. But these numbers could be shrinking soon, as Universal Display's sales (and earnings) increase to meet the new demand for OLED smartphone screens. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, analysts are looking for Universal Display stock to earn only $0.88 for fiscal 2016 as a whole. But that number is expected to jump 40% to $1.23 in fiscal 2017, then rise to $2.08 in 2018, and $2.80 in 2019. Put it all together, and forecasts currently call for a compound annual earnings growth rate of 47%. What it means for investors And I think you'll agree -- if Universal Display can hit the numbers Wall Street is laying out for it, then 47% annualized growth should be sufficient to support a stock selling for 46 times trailing free cash flow. Whether Universal Display stock can hit and maintain Susquehanna's new $100 target price though, and the even richer valuation that implies, is anybody's guess. It probably depends a lot on whether Universal Display can both achieve the growth rates Wall Street is already expecting -- and then keep those rates growing further.

Should Apple and other tech companies have a responsibility to play a more active role in filtering out fake news from their platforms? Or should it be solely left up to the reader? If you ask Apple CEO Tim Cook, tech companies do have a responsibility, and executives from the company also hinted this week that Apple is already working on it with its Apple News platform. When asked about the fake news problem during an interview last week, Cook said “all of us in technology and services own a responsibility for it. We don’t have all the answers by any means. We need to work on it.” And Apple’s Eddy Cue echoed those comments in a separate interview this week, hinting that Apple is already working on it with its approval system for Apple News allowing it to “vet and be sure that the Apple News providers are legitimate.” But another camp, from which many voiced their opinion in the comment section on Ben’s piece earlier this week, would say that it crosses a fine line into possible censorship and that it should instead be the reader’s responsibility to discern real news from fake news. Where does that leave satire sites that walk a grey area between what might be considered fake news to some and comedy to others? Should platforms that deliver content be responsible for making sure the reader knows they are reading a parody or determining what qualifies as fake news? You had a lot to say earlier, so we are continuing the conversation in today’s poll… Are you behind Apple’s view that tech companies should do more to combat fake news?

Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies TV Politics Business MWC 2017     Apple-Shaped People At Higher Risk Of Diabetes Posted: Feb 15 2017, 10:47am CST | by Sumayah Aamir, in News | Latest Science News   Getty Images Apple-Like Fat on Belly and Chest could increase Chances of Becoming a Diabetic   It is a hard fact of science that apple-like fat on the belly and chest could increase chances of becoming a diabetic for many individuals. Research proves that having an apple-shaped body (instead of a pear-shaped one) could predispose people to cardiac disease and type 2 diabetes. Thus one’s genetic code may determine the onset of such degenerative diseases of civilization. Don't Miss: The Funniest Super Bowl 2017 Commercials The areas on the human body where fat is stored may include the belly or the hips and thighs. The risk for apple-shaped individuals was definitely there as far as type 2 diabetes and heart disease were concerned.  While previous studies also looked into this matter, they fell short of reaching conclusions or offering recommendations. Half a dozen studies from 2007 to 2015 were examined by the experts. A grand total of 400,000 participants were involved in these studies. Their genomes were gauged with scrupulosity. In erstwhile times, over 48 gene variants were identified that were associated with waist-to-hip ratio. Thus the genetic risk score was pretty high for apple-shaped individuals. Those with higher waist-to-hip ratio had high lipid levels, insulin resistance, excess of glucose in the bloodstream and partial hypertension. Besides these, the risk of contracting cardiac disease and type 2 diabetes was high as well. Abdominal adipose tissue has an effect on the metabolic and cardiovascular systems. The extraneous factors of a bad diet and smoking were accounted for. So it is the excess fat on the tummy that is in particular dangerous for individuals. Maybe in the future, some precision-based drugs could be made to counter this tendency of fat accumulation around the middle which is the scourge of so many middle-aged men.   Comments The Author Sumayah Aamir Sumayah Aamir (Google+) has deep experience in analyzing the latest trends.     Advertisement Latest News Harvard and MIT Win CRISPR Gene-Editing Patent Fight Against UC Berkeley 5 minutes ago UAE Plans to Build First City on Mars by 2117 57 minutes ago January 2017 Is third-hottest on Record: NASA 2 hours ago Invasive Species are on the Rise Worlwide, Study Finds 11 hours ago, 2:46pm CST Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition 2017: Bianca Balti is Rookie of the Year 41 minutes ago Facebook new Video App for Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV and Samsung Smart TV Announced 2 hours ago BlackBerry now has virtually No Market hare 2 hours ago Agatha Christie's Disappearance and the Mandela Effect - Did She Ever Return? 2 hours ago 2017 Toyota TS050 Hybrid LMP1 Endurance Racer Teased 5 hours ago Aston Martin AM-RB 001 Will Have a Cosworth V112 and Ricardo Gearbox 5 hours ago Citroen SpaceTourer 4X4 E Concept Revealed 5 hours ago NES Classic Reseller Prices on the Rise on Rumors That Nintendo Stops NES Production 11 hours ago, 3:13pm CST NES Classic In Stock Updates: Amazon, Target, Walmart, Best Buy, ToysRUs and GameStop 11 hours ago, 3:13pm CST Ford Focus Production Model Spied 13 hours ago, 1:01pm CST Lamborghini Recalls 12 Venenos Supercars along with 5900 Aventadors 13 hours ago, 12:58pm CST Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Featured News Nintendo Switch Pre-order and Launch Day Sales Updates NES Classic Reseller Prices on Amazon in Free Fall   NES Classic In Stock Updates: Amazon, Target, Walmart, Best Buy, ToysRUs and GameStop Sports Illustrated Swimsuit 2017 Cover Model is Kate Upton Latest Science News Harvard and MIT Win CRISPR Gene-Editing Patent Fight Against UC Berkeley 5 minutes ago UAE Plans to Build First City on Mars by 2117 57 minutes ago January 2017 Is third-hottest on Record: NASA 2 hours ago Invasive Species are on the Rise Worlwide, Study Finds 11 hours ago, 2:46pm CST More Latest Science News Stories Latest News Harvard and MIT Win CRISPR Gene-Editing Patent Fight Against UC Berkeley 5 minutes ago Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition 2017: Bianca Balti is Rookie of the Year 41 minutes ago UAE Plans to Build First City on Mars by 2117 57 minutes ago Facebook new Video App for Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV and Samsung Smart TV Announced 2 hours ago More Latest News Your Deals on Amazon The Latest ...

Her latest one-off vocal adventure came via a pair of covers she dropped on Valentine's Day of Frankie Valli and Stevie Wonder songs recorded with an Instagram-famous senior citizen. And not just any 69-year-old Instagrammer, but Lili Hayes, the streetwise, Supreme-loving mother of artist/director Kevin Hayes, who has racked up more than 33,000 followers thanks to her hilariously hip posts. Following on the heels of her President Trump-bashed originals and a recent take on a classic SWV hit, Apple hooked up with Hayes for a cover of Valli's 1967 hit "Can't Take My Eyes Off You" and Wonder's 1984 gem "I Just Called To Say I Love You."

(NYSE: BRK-A) can now claim to be a top 10 Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) shareholder. Buffett, who has characteristically shied away from tech investments, reported a relatively small stake (at least by Buffett's standards) in Apple of around $1 billion last year. Buffett's Apple holdings more than tripled in the fourth quarter alone to 57.4 million shares worth just shy of $8 billion. However, the investor that earned his fame for value plays didn't get much value this time around, according to Gadfly's Shira Ovide. Related Link: Apple Investment Strategies: As Icahn Sells, Buffett And Einhorn Load Up Ovide noted when Buffett's firm first made its Apple purchase, the stock was trading at a forward earnings ratio of 10.4, notably below its five-year average of 12. Maybe at that point Buffett got a good deal, but fast forward to the final three months of 2016 -- the time period when Buffett was most active in accumulating shares -- the stock was trading at an average price-to-forward earnings ratio of 12.4, now above the five-year average. Today the stock is trading at around 14.4 times its estimated forward earnings, which is an even steeper price to pay if Buffett's firm continues to hit the buy button. Apple's valuation on its forward earnings peaked at 15.1 in late 2014. On the other hand, Buffett does deserve some recognition. After all, he first started buying Apple's stock when it was south of $100 and for an investor that's known for not trying to time the market, he's doing just fine.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Apple May Replace iPhone Home Button with Fingerprint-Scanning Screen By Samuel Gibbs PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 15 2017 Apple is working on fitting fingerprint scanners beneath the screen of its iPhone, removing the need for a separate home button, a newly published patent has revealed. The patent, purchased by Apple as part of its acquisition of a display company called LuxVue in 2014, details a system of using LEDs mounted underneath a display to both detect finger’s position and scan its surface to be able to read a fingerprint. Apple said in the newly reassigned patent : “When the fingerprint is placed upon the transparent substrate, the sensing IR diodes within the display panel sense patterned IR light reflected off grooves of the fingerprint surface. “This patterned IR light is relayed to the output processor as a bitmap where it is processed to determine the fingerprint surface’s unique pattern. Because the display panel can sense IR light, the display panel is able to perform surface profile determination when the display panel is not emitting visible light.” The LuxVue-developed technology concentrates on using tiny LEDs under the display to replicate the ability to detect the presence of a finger or other interacting element against the glass of a screen. The majority of mobile devices use capacitive touchscreen layers, which detect a change in capacitance when a finger or other conductive element touches the screen. The technology is also used in many fingerprint sensors and other devices, but has drawbacks particularly in cold weather -- they do not work very well when a finger is covered in a glove unless that glove has conductive surface. The patent describes the use of the array of LED sensors under the display to replicate the functions of both a traditional capacitive touchscreen and a fingerprint scanner, replicating the function of Apple’s Touch ID home button. Apple states: “The ability to detect an object’s surface profile while the display panel is not emitting visible light enables the display panel to detect a user’s fingerprint to unlock a mobile device such as a cellphone when the display panel appears to be off. “Accordingly, the display panel need not emit visible light to detect a surface profile of an object, nor does the display panel require a separate sensor to detect the surface profile of an object.” Apple is not the only company working on new technologies to allow components necessary to the function of a modern smartphone to be moved under the display. Sensors such as ambient light detectors, which provide information to adjust the display’s brightness in line with current light levels, presence sensors that turn off the screen when you put the phone to your ear, the earpiece speaker and the selfie camera are all currently mounted above or around the screen in separate panels. The placement of those components is one of the biggest hurdles standing in the way of all-screen smartphones, where the unnecessary bezels around the screen are removed in favour of a display that reaches to the very edges and top and bottom of the phone. Progress is being made to reduce the need for bezels around the display. Some smartphone manufacturers, including Huawei, Google and LG have moved the fingerprint scanner to the back of the device. LG’s latest Android Wear smartwatches have a new ambient light sensor that can operate from beneath a screen, while Sharp and Xiaomi have both released smartphones that use bone-conduction systems built into the screens to remove the need for a separate earpiece speaker at the top of the device. At the same time, Apple’s iPhones have continued to have large symmetrical bezels at the top and bottom of the their screens, with the home button and integrated Touch ID fingerprint scanner mounted within the bottom bezel and the speaker grille, sensors and selfie camera in the top bezel. These large bezels have made the body of company’s smartphones relatively large compared to competitors, despite having smaller display areas. Samsung’s highly anticipated Galaxy S8 smartphone is expected to have an edge-to-edge “infinity display” with thin top and bottom bezels that do not even have room for the company’s logo. It should give the Galaxy S8 one of the highest screen-to-body ratios of any smartphone, but even then it will not be truly all-screen.

Trump's Android Phone a Hack Risk? Next Article > Encrypted Messaging Service 'Signal' Introduces Video Calling in Beta By Shirley Siluk / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 15 2017 Users of the Signal encrypted messaging and voice calling service, famously employed by National Security Agency (NSA) contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden, can now also use the app for encrypted video chats. Open Whisper Systems, the software company that developed Signal, announced new public beta support for encrypted video calling yesterday. The release for both Android and iOS is built on "an entirely new calling infrastructure" that should also improve the voice call quality of the service, the company said. First released in 2014, the Signal app is based on the Signal cryptographic protocol, which is also used for secure messaging by Google Allo, Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. Such encrypted services are often used to provide secure communications for news tips and conversations between sources and journalists, among other purposes. 'Entirely New Calling Infrastructure' Being rolled out in stages to enable feedback about its performance, the latest version of Signal also brings together what were once two different Open Whisper Systems applications, one to support texting and one designed to enable real-time voice calls, company founder Moxie Marlinspike wrote yesterday in a blog post. "This represents an entirely new calling infrastructure for Signal, and should increase voice call quality as well," Marlinspike said. "We think it's a big improvement, but we're rolling it out in stages to collect feedback from people with different devices, networks, and regions in order to ensure there are no surprises when it's enabled for everyone by default." The new encrypted video calling will only work between two Signal users who have both enabled the beta application. iPhone users will also be able to take advantage of new capabilities introduced with last year's iOS 10 update so they can answer incoming Signal calls with one touch directly from the lock screen. Encryption Controversies Back in the News Media organizations, including The New York Times, use Signal to encourage encrypted news tips from readers and other sources. The application has also been endorsed by Snowden, who in 2013 provided journalists with a large cache of classified documents detailing the widespread use of surveillance by the NSA. The mainstream use of encryption to protect electronically transmitted information has long been a source of frustration for many in the intelligence, law enforcement and political communities. FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director James Woolsey are among officials who have pushed for security backdoors that would allow intelligence agencies to bypass encryption protections. Controversies about encrypted communications have also erupted again in the news recently. For example, BuzzFeed reported yesterday that two Republicans in Congress have called for an investigation on the Environmental Protection Agency's use of encryption. Meanwhile, other news outlets reported this week that some White House staffers have been using an encrypted chat app called Confide that automatically deletes messages after they are received and read.

This Is Why Your Phone Shuts Down When It's Cold Outside By Nina Godlewski On 02/15/17 AT 12:38 PM Close Picture this: You’re out enjoying a walk in the snow, or a day on the slopes, and you take your phone out to snap a picture of your surroundings, you open the camera, and your phone promptly shuts off. Sound familiar? This was happening to me on a far too frequent basis for my liking so I decided to look into it. Related Stories Apple iOS 9 Extends iPhone Battery Life A quick search resulted in an Apple page that outlined the optimal conditions under which to use an iPhone (these rules also apply for iPods and iPads). The devices should be kept between 32 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit it said and warned that “Low- or high-temperature conditions might cause the device to change its behavior to regulate its temperature.” That change in behavior could mean anything from the screen dimming or going black, camera flash not working, or the device turning off completely. This made sense. The batteries used in iPhones, iPads, and iPods are all lithium-ion batteries. According to Apple, it uses these batteries because they charge faster, and last longer than other types of batteries. But with those perks come the downside of the battery being somewhat temperature sensitive. That’s why Apple recommends keeping your devices within that temperature range. Exposure to extreme heat, as well as charging the device in extreme heat can lead to permanent damage to the battery’s capacity. Next I turned to Apple Support to make sure there was nothing wrong with my battery. I used the chat function on the site to connect with a support representative who remotely ran a diagnostic test on my phone. The test showed that the battery in my two-year-old iPhone 6 is still functioning at full capacity. However, the rep told me that my battery is breaking down a bit since I’ve charged it over 625 times, and the average is usually only about 500 full charges. They also recommended that I update my software. However, they never mentioned the fact that lithium-ion batteries fail in the cold sometimes. So I turned to Reddit and Apple forums, I checked threads for anyone else having the same issues as me, within the temperature range recommended by Apple. Sure enough there were others like me. But after looking through most of the posts it seemed there was one clear answer, one user put it simply, “this isn’t iPhone problem...it’s just the nature of the Li-Ion battery chemistry. ” I never have the chance to check the precise temperature when my phone dies in the cold because, well, my phone is dead. But if I had to guess I’d say most times it’s been below 40 degrees, pretty close to that lower range of temperatures Apple recommends. A number of factors like duration in the cold, where the device is stored, and even what type of case is on it can impact the battery performance in these tricky temperatures. So next time your phone shuts off seemingly for no reason, note the temperature, and know you’re not the only one struggling to post that perfect pic to Snapchat on a snowy day.

report this ad / Cory Doctorow / 9:40 am Wed Feb 15, 2017 Source tells Motherboard that Apple will testify against Nebraska's "Right to Repair" law From the Boing Boing Shop See all deals Popular Posts Follow Us Twitter / Facebook / RSS Motherboard says a source told them that "an Apple representative, staffer, or lobbyist will testify" against the state's Right to Repair bill, which requires companies to make it easy for their customers to choose from a variety of repair options, from official channels to third parties to DIY. report this ad Apple has previously taken versions of this position before US government agencies (for example, it repeatedly objected to proposals before the US Copyright Office to let electronic owners unlock their devices without risking civil and criminal reprisals under Section 1201 of the 1998's Digital Millennium Copyright Act), so it's not a stretch to imagine that they would take this position in Nebraska, as well. Five states are pondering versions of Right the Repair legislation, but Nebraska is the only one holding public hearings on it. Manufacturers of motorcycles, ATVs and trikes have already weighed in on the Nebraska proposal, saying that bikers shouldn't be trusted to fix their own hogs. AT&T is also reputed to be testifying at the hearing (AT&T notoriously took the position that only equipment rented from the company could be connected to the phone network, banning modems, fax machines, answering machines, and even a tin can you put over the phone receiver to stop sound from leaking to eavesdroppers). They're joined by John Deere, the tractor maker who told the US Copyright Office in 2015 that farmers only licensed their tractors, and could never be said to truly own them, because of the presence of copyrighted software in them -- thus, farmers would have to comply with the license terms on the software and only get their tractors repaired by authorized John Deere agents. The idea that it's "unsafe" to repair your own devices is one that manufacturers have been promoting for years. Last year, industry lobbyists told lawmakers in Minnesota that broken glass could cut the fingers of consumers who try to repair their screens, according to Gay Gordon-Byrne, executive director of Repair.org. Byrne said she will also testify at the Nebraska hearing and "plans to bring band aids." "They should want to give people as much information about how to deal with a hazardous thing as they can," Gordon-Byrne said. "If they're concerned about exploding batteries, put warning labels on them and tell consumers how to replace them safely."

Register for an Exam Today> Apple May Replace iPhone Home Button with Fingerprint-Scanning Screen By Samuel Gibbs PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 15 2017 Apple is working on fitting fingerprint scanners beneath the screen of its iPhone, removing the need for a separate home button, a newly published patent has revealed. The patent, purchased by Apple as part of its acquisition of a display company called LuxVue in 2014, details a system of using LEDs mounted underneath a display to both detect finger’s position and scan its surface to be able to read a fingerprint. Apple said in the newly reassigned patent : “When the fingerprint is placed upon the transparent substrate, the sensing IR diodes within the display panel sense patterned IR light reflected off grooves of the fingerprint surface. “This patterned IR light is relayed to the output processor as a bitmap where it is processed to determine the fingerprint surface’s unique pattern. Because the display panel can sense IR light, the display panel is able to perform surface profile determination when the display panel is not emitting visible light.” The LuxVue-developed technology concentrates on using tiny LEDs under the display to replicate the ability to detect the presence of a finger or other interacting element against the glass of a screen. The majority of mobile devices use capacitive touchscreen layers, which detect a change in capacitance when a finger or other conductive element touches the screen. The technology is also used in many fingerprint sensors and other devices, but has drawbacks particularly in cold weather -- they do not work very well when a finger is covered in a glove unless that glove has conductive surface. The patent describes the use of the array of LED sensors under the display to replicate the functions of both a traditional capacitive touchscreen and a fingerprint scanner, replicating the function of Apple’s Touch ID home button. Apple states: “The ability to detect an object’s surface profile while the display panel is not emitting visible light enables the display panel to detect a user’s fingerprint to unlock a mobile device such as a cellphone when the display panel appears to be off. “Accordingly, the display panel need not emit visible light to detect a surface profile of an object, nor does the display panel require a separate sensor to detect the surface profile of an object.” Apple is not the only company working on new technologies to allow components necessary to the function of a modern smartphone to be moved under the display. Sensors such as ambient light detectors, which provide information to adjust the display’s brightness in line with current light levels, presence sensors that turn off the screen when you put the phone to your ear, the earpiece speaker and the selfie camera are all currently mounted above or around the screen in separate panels. The placement of those components is one of the biggest hurdles standing in the way of all-screen smartphones, where the unnecessary bezels around the screen are removed in favour of a display that reaches to the very edges and top and bottom of the phone. Progress is being made to reduce the need for bezels around the display. Some smartphone manufacturers, including Huawei, Google and LG have moved the fingerprint scanner to the back of the device. LG’s latest Android Wear smartwatches have a new ambient light sensor that can operate from beneath a screen, while Sharp and Xiaomi have both released smartphones that use bone-conduction systems built into the screens to remove the need for a separate earpiece speaker at the top of the device. At the same time, Apple’s iPhones have continued to have large symmetrical bezels at the top and bottom of the their screens, with the home button and integrated Touch ID fingerprint scanner mounted within the bottom bezel and the speaker grille, sensors and selfie camera in the top bezel. These large bezels have made the body of company’s smartphones relatively large compared to competitors, despite having smaller display areas. Samsung’s highly anticipated Galaxy S8 smartphone is expected to have an edge-to-edge “infinity display” with thin top and bottom bezels that do not even have room for the company’s logo. It should give the Galaxy S8 one of the highest screen-to-body ratios of any smartphone, but even then it will not be truly all-screen.

Trump's Android Phone a Hack Risk? Next Article > Encrypted Messaging Service 'Signal' Introduces Video Calling in Beta By Shirley Siluk / Enterprise Security Today PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 15 2017 Users of the Signal encrypted messaging and voice calling service, famously employed by National Security Agency (NSA) contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden, can now also use the app for encrypted video chats. Open Whisper Systems, the software company that developed Signal, announced new public beta support for encrypted video calling yesterday. The release for both Android and iOS is built on "an entirely new calling infrastructure" that should also improve the voice call quality of the service, the company said. First released in 2014, the Signal app is based on the Signal cryptographic protocol, which is also used for secure messaging by Google Allo, Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. Such encrypted services are often used to provide secure communications for news tips and conversations between sources and journalists, among other purposes. 'Entirely New Calling Infrastructure' Being rolled out in stages to enable feedback about its performance, the latest version of Signal also brings together what were once two different Open Whisper Systems applications, one to support texting and one designed to enable real-time voice calls, company founder Moxie Marlinspike wrote yesterday in a blog post. "This represents an entirely new calling infrastructure for Signal, and should increase voice call quality as well," Marlinspike said. "We think it's a big improvement, but we're rolling it out in stages to collect feedback from people with different devices, networks, and regions in order to ensure there are no surprises when it's enabled for everyone by default." The new encrypted video calling will only work between two Signal users who have both enabled the beta application. iPhone users will also be able to take advantage of new capabilities introduced with last year's iOS 10 update so they can answer incoming Signal calls with one touch directly from the lock screen. Encryption Controversies Back in the News Media organizations, including The New York Times, use Signal to encourage encrypted news tips from readers and other sources. The application has also been endorsed by Snowden, who in 2013 provided journalists with a large cache of classified documents detailing the widespread use of surveillance by the NSA. The mainstream use of encryption to protect electronically transmitted information has long been a source of frustration for many in the intelligence, law enforcement and political communities. FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director James Woolsey are among officials who have pushed for security backdoors that would allow intelligence agencies to bypass encryption protections. Controversies about encrypted communications have also erupted again in the news recently. For example, BuzzFeed reported yesterday that two Republicans in Congress have called for an investigation on the Environmental Protection Agency's use of encryption. Meanwhile, other news outlets reported this week that some White House staffers have been using an encrypted chat app called Confide that automatically deletes messages after they are received and read.

 Here's a giant image of Putin caressing a pregnant Trump projected on a New York Apple store Avery Hartmans Feb. 15, 2017, 12:10 PM 203,929 facebook linkedin twitter email print Anyone visiting the Apple store in New York's Chelsea neighborhood got an unusual surprise on Tuesday night: a giant projection of Russian President Vladimir Putin caressing a very pregnant Donald Trump. Hater The image was projected on the side of building on the corner of 15th Street and Ninth Avenue, which is the location of Apple's Chelsea retail store. The Valentine's Day stunt was coordinated by the app Hater — a Tinder-style dating app that matches you with other users based on things you both hate. The illustration of Trump and Putin appeared next to Hater's upside-down-heart logo and a hashtag with the company's tagline, "Love Through Hate." As it turns out, nearly 80% of Hater's more than 200,000 current users say they "hate" Trump. "There's a lot of tension out there, regardless of which side you're on," Brendan Alper, Hater's founder and CEO, told Business Insider in an emailed statement. "We're just trying to make people laugh. Through humor, hate can turn into love." The Chelsea projection wasn't the only one — Hater projected the same image elsewhere in New York City. Another appeared at 14th Street and Eighth Avenue, on the side of a CVS right next to a subway stop. Hater A third was displayed at North Sixth Street and Wythe Avenue in Brooklyn's Williamsburg neighborhood.

During the last three months alone, Apple’s share price has shot up by 26%, reaching a new all-time closing high in the process. And just today, Apple shares reached an all-time intraday high after trading at $135.58 earlier this morning. Don't Miss: The biggest caveats in Verizon’s new ‘unlimited’ plan While some big name investors such as Carl Icahn have abandoned Apple in recent months, other prominent investors have actually increased their holdings in the company. Most notably, Warren Buffett, widely regarded as the world’s most successful investor, almost quadrupled his stake in Apple last quarter. In a filing made with the SEC this week, it was revealed Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway fund picked up more than 40 million shares of Apple, increasing its overall stake to 57.4 million shares overall. As a result, Buffett’s iconic Berkshire Hathaway is now one of the top 10 biggest stakeholders in Apple. While some investors like to get in and out, Buffett is unique insofar as he tends to buy stocks for the long haul. That said, Buffett’s increased stake in Apple strongly suggests that the Oracle of Omaha believes Apple’s stock price will ascend even higher in the months and years ahead. Hardly a unique opinion, a number of analysts in recent weeks have come out with increased price targets for Apple shares. Earlier this week, for example, Goldman Sachs issued a research note raising its 12-month price target on Apple from $133 to $150. Meanwhile, UBS analyst Steven Milunovich issued a research note arguing that Apple’s services unit is severely undervalued and that Apple shares should easily be a good 10% higher.

Switch’s anchor tenant in Reno is eBay. The Las Vegas-based data center provider is known for building facilities at massive scale, using bold, flashy interior design and ex-military armed guards. Reno was its first expansion outside of Las Vegas, but sites in Michigan, Italy, and Thailand are now also under construction. True to form, its first Reno facility, dubbed Tahoe Reno 1, is 1.3 million square feet large and can support up to 130 MW of power. Switch’s design for the 2,000 acre campus calls for up to 7.2 million square feet and 650 MW of power total, the company said in a statement. Read more: Switch Claims Reno Site Will be World’s Largest Data Center While Reno has not historically been a major data center market, the Switch and Apple campuses may change that, as Switch customers and Apple continue expanding capacity. The location has strong data center market characteristics, such as availability of low-cost energy, low taxes, and proximity to Silicon Valley and San Francisco. Switch said it buys energy in bulk at about $0.05 per kWh and offers customers 10 Gbps connectivity at 4 millisecond latency between Reno and San Francisco Bay Area. Its customers in Reno — like its customers in Las Vegas — buy telco services through a purchasing cooperative the company has set up, which enables them to take advantage of bulk deals with more than 50 carriers. Read more: eBay May Build Reno Data Center Beside Leased Space at Switch The campus is fully powered by renewable energy, thanks to a recent deal Switch struck with the local utility and state utility regulators after years of legal battles, in which the company was fighting to be allowed to exit the utility’s near-monopoly and make power purchase deals with renewable energy producers independently. This year, Switch for the first time was mentioned in Greenpeace’s Clicking Clean report, which gave it the highest marks for renewable energy use and advocacy among data center providers. The company has committed to powering all of its data centers with renewable energy.

News RELATED STORIES Apple to build iPhone in India this year Westwood leads, McIlroy struggles Samsung to buy car tech firm Harman for $8bn Apple moves ahead with the new Macbook Pro Apple sued over unresponsive iPhone 6 touchscreens Pedestrians pass in front of an Apple store in New York. Apple’s current M&A strategy works well for acquiring startups developing new technology that can be added to existing Apple products. Text Size: A A A Bloomberg/San Francisco “We are always looking at acquisitions,” Apple chief executive officer Tim Cook told analysts last month. “There’s not a size that we would not do.” It’s a message he’s increasingly stressed over the past year as investors question how the world’s most valuable technology company plans to use its $246bn cash pile to meet ambitions sales targets and expand into new markets, such as transportation. But Apple has struggled for years to pull off bigger deals because of a series of quirks: an aversion to risk, reluctance to work with external advisers like investment banks and inexperience in closing and integrating large takeovers, said people who have worked on acquisitions with the company. They asked not to be identified speaking about private merger and acquisition deliberations. “The first step in M&A is having some conviction about what it is you want to do,” said Eric Risley, managing partner at Architect Partners who has negotiated deals with Apple. “Apple probably more than most feels that they’re very capable of building things” rather than buying them, he added. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. Apple’s biggest deal in its 41-year history was the $3bn purchase Beats Electronics in 2014, followed by the $400mn acquisition of NeXT Computer in 1996. In Facebook’s 13 years, it has made three acquisitions of at least $1bn, including its $22bn WhatsApp purchase. Google, founded in 1998, has done four such deals, while Microsoft Corp has completed at least 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Instead of closing big deals, Cook has so far focused on growing Apple’s services businesses, including Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud. That’s beginning to work, with the company recently forecasting that annual revenue from those operations will top $50bn by 2021. But even here, some analysts and investors argue for a big acquisition, especially in online video streaming. Apple has started distributing videos through the Music service, and pooling other providers’ video in its mobile TV app, but it has no service akin to Netflix or Amazon.com’s Prime Video. On Friday, Sanford C Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said Apple needs at least one big acquisition in online video. To reach its $50bn target, the company must find an extra $13bn in services revenue over the next four years – beyond what it can generate itself. Netflix ended 2016 with sales of less than $9bn, so even buying that business may not be enough, the analyst said. Other potential blockbuster Apple acquisition targets include Walt Disney Co and electric carmaker Tesla, Baird analyst William Power wrote in a recent note to clients. “They’re going to have to pursue something bigger than a Beats-like acquisition,” said Erick Maronak, chief investment officer at Victory Capital Management, which holds Apple stock among its $55bn under management. The presidency of Donald Trump may spark tax reforms that free up more Apple cash to spend on takeovers. But so far, the company has tip-toed around the edges of some of the biggest transactions re-shaping the technology industry. When AT&T agreed to purchase Time Warner for $85bn in October, the telecom company was concerned Apple might make a competing bid, people familiar with AT&T’s thinking said at the time. Apple had held tentative talks about a year earlier, but when the AT&T deal emerged, a person familiar with the technology giant’s thinking said it wouldn’t be able to pull together a competing proposal quickly enough. Last year, the company considered buying luxury carmaker McLaren Technology Group Ltd, people familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg at the time. Apple also had takeover talks with chip designer Imagination Technologies Group, but said last year it wouldn’t make an offer. Apple’s deals team is composed of about a dozen people under former Goldman Sachs banker Adrian Perica, and most acquisitions take place at the behest of the company’s engineers. Product managers usually meet every month with Perica’s team members to identify targets with attractive technology or talented engineers, according to a person familiar with the process. Microsoft’s deals team is not significantly bigger, and it still hired investment bank Morgan Stanley for its $26bn acquisition of LinkedIn last year, beating rival bidders including Salesforce.com and Facebook. At Google, the corporate development team often works on potential acquisitions with strategy experts working under Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler, not just technical staff. Other deals are carried out at the behest of founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Apple often refuses to work with investment bankers appointed by the seller, preferring to deal directly with company management, according to people who have been involved in such negotiations. Apple also dictates terms and tells targets to take it or leave it, betting that the promise of product development support later and the chance of appearing in future iPhones are alluring enough, the people said. That was the case when Apple acquired Metaio GmbH in 2015. Bankers appointed by the augmented-reality firm to negotiate weren’t allowed in the room, and while Metaio executives felt the offer was low, Apple’s vision for the technology convinced them to sell, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Apple’s current M&A strategy works well for acquiring startups developing new technology that can be added to existing Apple products. It bought 15 to 20 companies per year over the last four years. But buying larger companies presents a different challenge, particularly if there are rival bids. Bankers often diffuse tension between bidders and targets, but Apple’s approach can make that process difficult. “There’s a swagger – you may call it arrogance – about the culture there,” said Risley of Architect Partners. “They’re used to being able to muscle their way in and get attractive economics.” For Apple’s acquisition of Beats, neither party used an investment bank. Apple struggled to integrate the team, and when the initial Apple Music offering emerged from the combination, it got lukewarm reviews. Later versions of the service improved. However, Apple’s lack of a successful track record integrating big acquisitions puts off sellers, according to a person who has negotiated with Apple’s deals team. Large acquisitions can also go wrong in big ways. After buying Nokia Oyj’s handset business for $9.5bn, Microsoft had to write down $7.6bn of that value in 2015. Failures like that helped forge Apple’s caution on larger deals, according to one of the people familiar with its thinking. That attitude may need to change, according to some investors. After the AT&T-Time Warner deal, analysts’ focus shifted to Netflix as the next target, even as the video streaming service says it’s not up for sale. However, that company’s shares are up about 60% in the past year, giving it a market value of more than $60bn – 20 times the cost of Apple’s biggest deal. “There are certain opportunities that they should probably be pursuing and if they wait too long they risk ceding ground to the first movers,” Victory Capital’s Maronak said. 0 COMMENTS There are no comments.

Credit: Apple More like this 20 ways to hate Windows 10 less How to get rid of iCloud calendar spam How to fix iCloud sync in seconds Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell iCloud Drive is Apple’s essential connection between all your devices, Mac, iPhone, iPad, even your Windows PC. While it is expensive in comparison to other online storage services it works natively across all your devices, so you should know how to get the best out of it. How iCloud Drive works You can store documents, keep files and folders up-to-date across all your devices, work on items and access them from anywhere using iCloud Drive. Changes applied to a copy of a file on one device will automatically sync across all your other systems. iCloud Drive is a real file system, so you can create and save items to your own self-created folders, which useful if you work across multiple devices. (You must use a Mac to create your own folders). If you use iCloud Drive across multiple Macs then changes made to the Documents and Desktop files on both Macs will sync. The Mac you activate last will create its own folder for the contents of its Documents and Desktop, and this will also sync. Setup iCloud Drive iCloud Drive is automatically setup on any current Apple device running the latest operating system. (More information is available here). Apple’s macOS Sierra will automatically save files saved to your Desktop and Documents folders to iCloud, making all these files available across all your devices. That’s useful but will eat your online drive capacity, particularly as (at 5GB) Apple still doesn’t provide sufficient free drive space. You can buy more storage if you like, or disable the feature in System Preferences>iCloud>iCloud Drive Options – Uncheck Desktop & Documents folders at the top of the list. Hint: iCloud Drive will sync data using your mobile connection unless you tell it not to do so. That’s fine if you can afford the data, but (particularly) if you travel abroad you may want to disable this. To do so open Settings>iCloud> iCloud Drive and at the bottom of the next page toggle ‘Use Cellular Data’ to Off (it’s Green – On – by default). Online and on device If you use Desktop & Documents then you will find everything you file there on iCloud Drive on your Mac or iOS device. You can also access these files online through your account at www.icloud.com, which means these files can easily be edited on a Windows PC. Windows Apple also offers iCloud for Windows, which makes photos, videos, mail, files, and bookmarks are accessible on both your Windows PC and iOS devices. Any changes you make on any of these files on any device, online,  Windows or Mac, will be replicated across all your other devices. Files over 15GB in size are not supported. Hint: You can also access these files from a Mac that is not running macOS Sierra. Open a new Finder menu, click the Go menu item and select iCloud Drive. If you work on files don’t forget to manually save those changes to the iCloud Drive, as they will not save automatically as they do on macOS. iCloud Drive FAQs   Controlling apps Many third-party apps want to use iCloud Drive to store their own data. This is useful for some apps you plan to use across all your systems, but may not always be what you want. To control which apps can store data to your online drive: On iOS: Open Settings>iCloud>iCloud Drive and switch any app you don’t want accessing your drive off (toggle to white). On Mac: System Preferences>iCloud> choose iCloud Drive Options.. and uncheck the apps you don’t want to support. Time Zones If you notice that emails and calendar entries have begun showing the wrong time zones its possible your account settings are incorrect. To check, login to your account online at www.icloud.com and tap Settings. At the top of the next page you should see Time Zone/Region which should state where you are. If it does not you can change this and the time zone problem will be resolved across all your devices. Reclaim deleted files If you accidentally delete something stored on iCloud Drive you can easily get it back again from iCloud.com. All you need to do is login to the account, check Settings>Advanced and click Restore Files. Wait a few moments and you will be presented with a list of files that you have previously deleted in the Restore Files window. Tick the box beside the file(s) you want to restore and tap Done. Files are only available in this way for 30-days. Version conflict If you have files open on two devices at once modifications made on one device may be out of sync. iCloud Drive should warn you when this kind of version conflict takes place. When it does you can double-clock a version’s thumbnail to see its contents, and delete the other one. I do hope this report helps you get more out of using iCloud Drive on your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Windows PC.

You won't believe (we still can't believe) the piece of utter rubbish at number one in our list of the 17 most useless gadgets of all time. Expensive, poorly made, badly conceived (and that's just the article). Gadgets and gizmos that are just, well, shit By Matt Egan | 15 Feb 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments Products that are usefulness challenged All too often the latest gadget is a solution looking for a problem that doesn't exist. You won't believe (we still can't believe) the piece of utter rubbish at number one in our list of the most useless gadgets of all time. We've listed the products in only a rough order (although our #1 most useless product is an absolute belter), and we've given each a uselessnes score out of 5 in which 1 could be conceivably of some use, and 5 is a chocolate tea pot. And, yes, we are more than happy to say that the Apple Watch makes the list - you are of course entitled to disagree. Enjoy the list and let us know your thoughts in the comments below. Most useless products of all time #17: Gear 2 Face facts, Samsung fans. Samsung has a unique way of reacting when a new product category appears (or when Apple hints that it might make a new category device). It floods the market with products of various flavours, sees what works and then concentrates only on the winners. And so it is with smartwatches. The Gear 2 is a sound piece of engineering, well designed and built. It offers a decent feature set. But it is close to utterly useless. For one thing it runs the Tizen OS. Nothing intrinsically wrong with that, but now that Samsung has committed to making only Android Wear smartwatches, Tizen is unlikely to gain much in the way of apps or new features. And then there is the fact that the Gear 2 is fully compatible with only a couple of Samsung phones and tablets. So not only will you be shelling out £200 for the watch, you'll need a £600 phone to go with it, and the likelihood is that when you upgrade your phone you'll need to find a new smartwatch. It's not that it is bad, just expensive and extremely limited in terms of compatibility and software support. And that's useless. (See also: best smartwatches.) Uselessness rating: 1/5 Most useless products of all time #16: Amstrad E-mailer Next time you marvel at Sir Alan Sugar's business acumen as he fires another hapless apprentice, consider the fact that the company with which he made his name was responsible for some utter turkeys. The E-mailer (or [email protected] ' as Amstrad would have it), was chief Turkey. As with many useless gadgets, the principle was good. Execution and pricing, terrible. The [email protected] was a wired telephone with an LCD. As the name suggested it acted as an email messaging machine, as well as a dialup web browser. The idea of accessing email through a mobile phone was wildly exciting in 2000, so the concept of being able to browse electronic mail from the telephone table made some sense - even though it tied to a fixed point global internet messaging. The real problem was in the 'pay as you use' business model. It didn't cost much to buy the [email protected] , but it was hugely expensive to use. Internet and email access were made via a premium-line phone number that went through Amstrad's own email servers. Checking email was not only tied to one spot in the house, but the [email protected] made a free thing expensive. Oh, and just to top it off, you had to watch adverts on the LCD between your emails. It wasn't a great service, and the tech itself was horrible. We had one that caught fire in our test lab (insert your own 'You're fired' joke here). It looked cheap and nasty, and very far from the cutting edge tech it was meant to be. Indeed, so bad was the [email protected] that rumour suggested Amstrad CEO Bob Watkins fired himself rather than continue to labour to meet Sir Alan's vision. Too expensive to use. That's useless in our book. (See also: Amstrad - A British PC legend?) Uselessness rating: 4/5 Most useless products of all time #15: Xybernaut Poma Where do we start. The Poma, from troubled wearables maker Xbernaut, was a wearable PC. The equivalent of a low-spec 2002 PC distributed about your person - and it looked like it. When Xybernaut introduced the Poma wearable computer at the 2002 CES, it got an inexplicably good reaction. Running on the useless Windows CE, this utterly useless PC cost $1,500. It made you look like an idiot, did almost nothing of any use, and couldn't be worn outside in the rain. And remember, this is a long time before wireless internet was widely available. In fact, all it was good for was attending fancy dress parties where you weren't sure how much effort people were going to make. Expensive, rubbish, bad looking. Useless. Uselessness rating: 5/5 Most useless products of all time #14: Withings Hair Coach Designed in collaboration with cosmetics brands Kérastase and L'Oréal, the Withings Hair Coach is one of the ultimate examples of a solution to a non-existent problem.  Coming out in autumn 2017, this $200/£160 hair brush is billed as the "future of hair care," and provides a "holistic hair assessment," something I'm sure you'll agree we're all in dire need of. It boasts a microphone, gyroscope, and accelerometer among other sensors, so that it can observe your brush technique and even listen for split-ends, vibrating to warn you that you're brushing too hard. It then uses Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to sync to a dedicated smartphone app, from which it can give you an assessment of your hair health, track your brushing progress in a series of graphs, and recommend specific hair care routines for you. We're torn here. On the one hand, we're sure there's a market for this, and while £160 sounds like a lot for a hairbrush, it's not as eye-wateringly expensive as some of our other most useless gadgets (and we gave five stars to a £300 hair dryer, so we can't really talk). But still: smart hairbrush. Just say that to yourself a few times and try and pretend it's something you need. Uselessness rating: 1/5 Most useless products of all time #13: Nokia N-Gage Another one to consign to the pile of 'a good idea done wrong'. We now know that there is a market for portable gaming devices that are also smartphones. Nokia's mistake was to add phone capability to a games console, rather than gamifying a smartphone. The result was useless: pretend to make a phone call on your Wii and you will get the idea. The N-Gage cost £75 more than Nintendo's Game Boy, had few titles available to play on it, and looked awful both as a console and as a smartphone. Awful, and useless. (See also: Rethink for Nokia's N-Gage platform.) Uselessness rating: 4/5 Most useless products of all time #12: DivX Enhanced DVD Players An example of good tech ruined by bad policies. DivX means something benign these days, but back in 1998 the Digital Video Express moniker was originally appended to an effort to create 'disposable' time-limited DVDs that could stop DVD rental discs being pirated. DivX players may have had a chance if they were free, or at least cheaper than standard DVD players. But no, DivX 'enhanced' DVD players costs a lot more than standard DVD players, and required you to attach a telephone line in order to play a rental disc. This was enough to kill DivX at a time when most households needed their phone lines to make calls. What made it a fate worse than death was the early privacy concerns customers had about faceless corporations tracking what they watched. Why worry about that, huh? How would you describe something that costs more to hobble a standard product? One word: useless. Uselessness rating: 3/5 Most useless products of all time #11: Datawind PocketSurfer2 My personal favourite. And another idea poorly executed, and very badly timed. Picture the scene: it's mid-2007, and the internet is primarily a desktop affair. Plenty of people are still on dial-up, and even those with home broadband tend to be tied to a desktop via ethernet cables. And even getting a web connection to your home was a complicated and expensive business. Tech-savy mobile communicators tend to carry BlackBerries, and the mobile internet consists of scratching around for football scores and cinema listings via [shudders] WAP. The PocketSurfer2 offered a solution to these problems. A phone without the ability to make phonecalls, it was a mobile cellular internet device. A smartphone-sized pocket book with a qwerty keyboard that proported to offer the full internet on the go, as well as a dedicated email device. Websites were crunched through a special caching process that meant they required very little data to be pulled down. Better yet there were no contracts entered into, DataWind said. You simply paid a one-off fee, and accepted adverts when you booted and shut down your PocketSurfer2. In a world in which the mobile internet seemed positively futuristic, it was an impressive pitch, so what went wrong? Well for one thing the device failed to live up to expectation. I had one for a year and it was replaced – free of charge, I grant you – no fewer than three times. The third time it fell to pieces I chucked it in a drawer and forgot about it. I might have persisted, but there was another problem: in order for cellular connectivity to be free forever DataWind needed sufficient users of the devices to make the advertising model work. And, well, it didn't have them. So in order to keep pocket surfing I needed to shell out for a subscription. Frankly, the experience simply wasn't worth it. Anyone who used a PocketSurfer2 rapidly came to the conclusion that whatever it was - and it *was* a decent emailer - it was nothing like the full internet. What it was might have been enough, however, were it not for the timing issue. Because the PocketSurfer2 launched just after the iPhone. We forget now just how big a deal was the iPhone, so let me remind you. It may not have added much to the market in terms of pure technology, but the iPhone offered a great web browsing experience in a desirable, touchscreen device. If it ever could have, now a clunky device with a physical keyboard could not compete. And although it limped on for a year or two, the PocketSurfer2 was finished. A big promise unfulfiled. An iPhone rival that was anything but. Poorly made, awful to use. Useless. Uselessness rating: 1/5 Most useless products of all time #10: Umbrella Drone Look, we get it. Britain is a soggy place and everyone has, at some point in their life, gotten fed up with having to carry an umbrella round with them, taking up a valuable hand that could be used for carrying bags, smoking cigarettes, or clutching your smartphone. But has anyone ever been so bothered by that problem that they'd be willing to spend more than a thousand pounds to solve it? Announced at CES 2017, the umbrella drone received a mix of disbelief and adoration from tech pundits, though we can't imagine why anyone was excited about it. Currently priced at a whopping £1,299 - and that's with £200 off, mind - this must surely be one of the most expensive umbrellas ever produced, and it's not even gold-plated or studded with cheap diamonds (more on that later in this list).  What it does do is hover slightly above your head (you hope) and follow you around using GPS synced to your smartphone. That sounds great for about five seconds, until you start to think about all the ways it can (and will) go wrong. What about when you want to get on a bus or train? What about when some passer-by decides to grab it or swat it out of the sky? What about when it inevitably fails to track your GPS and just veers off on its own course, leaving you scrambling after it in a vain attempt to stay dry? Fortunately, because it doesn't have a camera the Umbrella Drone at least doesn't fall foul of UK drone laws, but good luck explaining that to every police officer you pass on your commute - if you ever dare bring this over-priced brolly into work. And the other good news is that it has a "long battery life" - a massive 30 minutes, so keep your walks short unless you want it to crash into your head, leaving you soaking wet, bruised, and clutching a broken piece of £1,299 tech. Brilliant. Uselessness rating: 2/5 Most useless products of all time #9: NEC Pro Mobile 200 The history of Microsoft and mobile is a peaon to the useless. Lest we forget Microsoft touted the tablet form factor long before the iPad was created, and it has been trying to get mobile Windows of the tarmac for a decade or more. The NEC Mobile Pro 200 was one of nearly two dozen Windows CE 1.0 devices launched in 1996. Not only did the NEC Mobile Pro 200 and its brethren not support Microsoft's newly released Outlook, they didn't work with any non-Microsoft PIM or email client. Win CE 1.0 handhelds were quickly rendered obsolete by Win CE 2.0 devices, which eventually turned into Pocket PCs and Windows Mobile phones. The NEC Mobile Pro 200 is one of many useless devices, but useless it was indeed. Uselessness rating: 3/5 Most useless products of all time #8: Microsoft Mira Sticking with Microsoft, here's its Mira wireless touchscreen display, which Microsoft unveiled with great fanfare at the 2002 Consumer Electronics Show. (Between the Xybernaut Poma and the Mira this must have been a great show). The idea may still come to fruition. Microsoft wanted consumers to mount these LCDs on the walls of their homes and use them to remotely access their computers. Not for the first time execution didn't match ambitious invention. The Mira cost $999. It also ran business Windows - an odd choice for a digital home product. And it looked awful. Overpriced and underwhelming. Useless. Uselessness rating: 2/5 Most useless products of all time #7: Denso Vacuum Cleaner Shoes In a sign that there may be a god after all, this is only a concept product that will almost certainly never see the light of day. But still: vacuum cleaner shoes.  We have Japanese auto parts manufacturer Denso to thank for this one, who should probably just go back to making car components to be honest. It's a prototype developed as part of a biannual company competition to allow employees to "foster their creative and innovative design concepts," and if this was one of the finalists, we dread to think what the losing entries looked like.  The 'Ecology Shoes' boast vacuum cleaners inside each over-sized sole, meaning you can hoover the floor as you walk. Each step powers the vacuum's motor, so at least you shouldn't have to worry about the battery dying, but you do have the new concern of having to empty the miniscule dust box out of your shoes. We can only imagine you also have to drag your feet around in a slightly awkward shuffle to get any effective cleaning done too, so that's your self-respect out of the window.  Speaking of, I've got to take a moment to talk about shoes' very particular aesthetic. The giant platform soles we understand - the vacuum cleaner has to fit in somewhere after all - but why the half-checkerboard upper? Or the pink and black laces? Who on earth is expected to ever actually wear these things out of choice? They're heavy, they're ugly, and we can't imagine they even work very well as hoovers. Useless. Uselessness rating: 3/5 Most useless products of all time #6: Sony Vaio Mouse Talk What were they thinking? Of all ill-conceived tech products, the Sony Mouse Talk is certainly one of the more memorable. It was launched back in the glory days of VoIP (that's Skype to you and me) when USB-connected "internet" phones were all the rage. Instead of using your desktop speakers and a microphone connected to your PC's sound card, you could pretend you were on a real, wired phone. Never mind that the call quality (as it was back in 2006) made it sound like the person on the other end was close to drowning a swimming pool. The Mouse Talk, however, took things a step too far, by combining a VoIP handset with a mouse. One minute you could be clicking around in Windows, the next on call with a relative in Australia. On paper, the VN-CX1/B sounded reasonably good. Sony said it would "control desk clutter while adding a touch of style and ingenuity to your workspace". But ingenious it was not, since the Mouse Talk could only perform one of its functions at a time. When on a call your mouse would be out of action, leaving you unable to check a website or look up a phone number to pass on the information to your caller. Either that or you had to lean your head sideways with your ear almost touching the desk and attempt to use the mouse by feel alone. Just as a smartphone with a built-in shaver would be a retail disaster, the Mouse Talk quietly disappeared from PC World's shelves. It was useless. Uselessness rating: 4/5 Most useless products of all time #5: Nintendo Virtual Boy This 'portable' 3D gaming system may have been the biggest disaster to come out of Japan since Godzilla. Virtual Boy fans had to press their eyes into the machine's goggles to get the 3D effect, while simultaneously holding the unit steady and manipulating the unit's six-button control pad. The Virtual Boy chewed through AA batteries like a hungry virtual goat, displayed monochrome images only, and offered a paltry 22 games (14 in the US) before getting pulled from the market a year later. And did we mention that using the Virtual Boy made some people ill? Nintendo advised users to take breaks every 15 to 30 minutes to avoid eyestrain, headaches, and nausea. Impossible to use, and nauseating. Useless. Uselessness rating: 3/5 Most useless products of all time #4: USB Finger Dance Mat With the USB Finger Dance Mat, you could have a party on your desk with everyone invited - though discretion might have counseled you to think twice about demonstrating the digital skills you developed over many painstaking hours of practice to, say, your boss. To use the device, you just plugged it into your PC, slipped your digits into the cardboard finger character (two choices: Disco dude or Flashdance chick), and tapped your fingers in time to the flashing lights on the 4x4in dance floor. It was fresh, it was funky, it was totally embarrassing if anyone ever caught you doing it. Which, apparently, few did, since the Dance Mat was discontinued shortly after it debuted. Still, it was a fun way to take a break between cleaning out your desk and picking up your P45. Job-losingly useless, but fun. Uselessness rating: 2/5 Most useless products of all time #3: King of Key King of Key arrived in the offices of our publisher IDG in 1999 – and its sheer brilliantly hilarious awfulness has stayed with us ever since. It manages to be crap in so many ways, it's almost a field guide for newbie reviewers on what makes a product terrible: its concept is ludicrous, its construction is tacky and it's pretending to be something it's not. The £80 King of Key was the laptop equivalent of a gold tooth from a West Ham dentist. It's a replacement for the then-cutting-edge Apple Powerbook G3's 'Home' key that's gold and has a diamond in the middle of it – a diamond that will bring you luck apparently *cough* bullshit *cough*. The gold turned out to be flaky paint, and the 24-carat diamond – which was accompanied by an authenticity certificate – was valued by a nearby Hatton Wall jeweller as being worth less than a tenner. Unfortunately the luck brought by the King of Key didn't rub off on the company who decided this is really what British Mac owners needed to own – MyGate went bust in 2001. Century Corporation, the Japanese company who made King of Key, went on to produce an iMac stand called 'Dance with i' that it promoted with the immortal words: "can be handled easily – even by a lady!!". Totally, utterly, useless. Uselessness rating: 6/5 Most useless products of all time #2: Apple Watch Okay. The Apple Watch is clearly not the most uselss product of all time. It has some uses. But it gains points for hype and cost. And the fact that otherwise sensible people (the editors of Macworld UK) are convinced that it is a good thing, when it is clearly a joke that has got out of hand. The problem is that our Samsung Gear 2 entry notwithstanding there are *some* things for which smartwatches are useful. It is good, for instance, to be able to view emails as they come in without pulling out your smartphone. And, you know, telling the time is a useful function. It's just that the Apple Watch is the culmination of all of those annoying things about Apple. There's the smug way in which the few Apple Watch users demonstrate features long available in Android Wear, and before that on the excellent Pebble. The true believers' habit of describing something that clearly looks like a piece of shit as a design classic. Seriously: look at the Moto 360 and tell me that you *love* the way the Apple Watch looks. More recently I have been told by more than one Apple Watch user that although it is at first tricky to use, over time it becomes - I quote - "intuitive." This failing to understand the meaning of the word intuitive. The Apple Watch is massively over-priced, coming in at least half as much again as a comparable Android watch. It is at its cheapest twice as expensive as the ugly but very-far-from useless Microsoft Band. That's right: Microsoft has made a more useful and reasonably priced smartwatch than has Apple. Microsoft, you say? The company that makes phones which iPhone users criticise for lack of apps. A problem criticial in the smartphone world, but not a problem at all for the very much app-challenged Apple Watch. (Why you would need an app for your watch defeats me, but you must do because Apple tells us you do.) Apple fans will never understand any of this. Nor will they care. Not least because Apple has strived to ensure that the Apple Watch is the only smartwatch with which you can reasonably pair an iPhone. So value becomes a moot point: Apple wilfully restricts the number of peripherals with which you can pair your iPhone, so at any point from 0 to 1,000 pounds the Apple Watch is the best deal you can get. Which may be just as well. Now that Google has managed to get an Android Wear app on to the iTunes App Store, the Apple Watch looks like a very poor deal indeed. And that in turn may start to chip away at the 'iPhone is best' mantra that hasn't been true since 2012. It isn't entirely useless. But when you ponder the gap between hype and reality, and look closely at exactly how much use you get for your money, Apple's smartwatch is fully deserving of a place on our list of infamy. Uselessness rating: 2/5 Most useless products of all time #1: NoPhone Zero The name might give you a clue as to the piece of total rubbish at number one in our list of the most useless gadgets in history. The NoPhone Zero is most definitely no phone, and it is zero good. It is in fact a rectangular block of plastic that does absolutely sod all. It's the same size as the iPhone 5, but with none of its features. Unbelievably, 130 people pledged a total of $1,239 to make NoPhone's Kickstarter dream a reality, and the Zero entered production and sold for $5 each. The theory behind the Zero is that it serves as a sort of comfort blanket for phone addicts - they'll feel that familiar weight in their pocket, shape in their hand or black device on the table in front of them, but they won't be tempted to pick it up and play with it because, well, they'd get bored pretty quickly.  NoPhone says: "The NoPhone Zero is a plastic rectangle that replaces the need for smart rectangle device interaction." Except it doesn't. Because for all the unneccessary number of times people pick up their phones to check their Facebook news feed or glance at the clock, there are also times that you actually need a phone that works, and NoPhone can't help you then. We don't know if we're more upset by the sheer utter ridiculousness of this product or the fact that it's not the first. The original NoPhone, which is still available at $10, and with bulk buy discounts for couples and families, comes with cutouts and grooves to simulate the feel of a real smartphone with home button, camera and screen. There's also a $15 NoPhone Selfie version, which has a mirror strapped to the front, and perhaps most astonishingly of all, a $5 NoPhone Air which is literally just an empty piece of packaging.

We round up all of the rumours about a new MacBook Air in 2017, including its likely UK release date and tech specs, as well as rumoured new features. Here's everything you need to know about the new MacBook Air in 2017 by Ashleigh Macro | 15 Feb 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents UK release date Will the MacBook Air be discontinued? When was the MacBook Air last updated? Price Dimensions  Specs & new features When will Apple release a new MacBook Air in 2017? What tech specs and new features will the new MacBook Air get? Is the 'Air' brand being killed off? Will the new MacBook Air get a Retina display at last? Apple did technically update the MacBook Air in 2016, but it was a minor and frankly disappointing update - merely including what had been an optional RAM upgrade in the standard package for the 13in model, and not touching the 11in model at all. Will 2017 see a proper update to the MacBook Air lineup? Or will the MacBook Air be killed off for good? In this article, we round up all the rumours, hints and clues about the new MacBook Air release for 2017, including the new MacBook Air's UK release date, tech specs, new features, design, along with speculation that Apple may be phasing out the 'Air' lineup completely. Read next: Best MacBook buying guide | Best Mac buying guide 2017 | Best cheap MacBook deals Last updated to include rumours that Apple is manufacturing more of its own chips for use in Mac laptops New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: UK release date Back in March 2016, MacBook Air fans were eagerly awaiting an update to their favourite laptop at Apple's special event; after all, the spring event represented one year since it was last updated. But instead, Apple used the event to show off the iPhone SE and the iPad Pro with 9.7in screen. We had to wait until 19 April for Apple to release new MacBooks and the updated MacBook Air. But the MacBook Air update was underwhelming, to say the least. While the MacBook got a power boost and a new Rose Gold colour option, the MacBook Air simply got a new 8GB onboard memory standard, and that was for the 13in model only. So when will we get a proper update to the MacBook Air line-up? If the lineup isn't getting the chop, we assume that Apple will stick to its yearly upgrade cycle and should release the new MacBook Air at some point in early 2017, possibly between March and May as has been the case in previous years. But it does seem likely that the MacBook Air line is being quietly wound down. See also: New MacBook Pro release | New MacBook release | New iMac release | New Mac Pro release | New Mac mini release New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Will the MacBook Air be discontinued? After the March event and its derisory MacBook Air update, and the subsequent Apple event that took place on 27 October 2016, it's unclear if the MacBook Air line will ever be updated again. No new MacBook Air was announced in October and the new MacBook Pro 2016 was compared in size, performance and weight to the MacBook Air. The new MacBook Pro is smaller in dimensions and is also thinner than the existing MacBook Air, which was launched with portability in mind. It should also be noted that the 11in MacBook Air has now been discontinued, with the 13in variant receiving a £100 price bump - taking the basic model from £849 up to £949 and the 256GB model up from £999 to £1,099. (This price increase is most likely due to Brexit.) Some have taken this as gentle way of bringing the Air product line to a close, as not many people will want a costly Air with more powerful, and thinner, Mac laptops available. Following the October 2016 Mac event, there are strong suggestions that the MacBook Air line will be completely discontinued. This does mean that the entry-level MacBooks are now a little more appealing, but does mean that an 11in MacBook Air will now be missed by some who were hoping for it to be replaced by a similar variant - we presume Apple didn't see a huge market for 11in laptops and thus decided to axe the product line. However, the 11in model may not be the only MacBook Air to be discontinued. We suspect that Apple is about to discontinue the MacBook Air line altogether. Tech Blogger Jack March claims to have spoken with a source close to the situation who says that Apple is about to ditch the Air brand completely, including the MacBook Air and iPad Air products in its lineup. Right now, we think Jack could be absolutely right. There are rumours that Apple won't release an iPad Air 3 now that the iPad Pro has a 9.7in option, and the MacBook Air doesn't seem to fit naturally in Apple's line-up now that the new MacBook is here and is thinner and lighter than ever. With the advent of the 12in MacBook and the 12.9in iPad Pro, it's no surprise that rumourmongers are starting to predict that at least the 11in MacBook Air, with a smaller screen than either of those devices, will be discontinued. The iPad Pro may indeed be viewed by Apple as a replacement for the 11in MacBook Air if Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments to the Telegraph are taken into account (published on 1 December 2015). Following the launch of the iPad Pro, Cook told the Telegraph: "I think if you're looking at a PC, why would you buy a PC anymore? No really, why would you buy one? "Yes, the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many, many people. They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones." However, should Apple discontinue the 11in MacBook Air, it does remove the lower price of entry from the line-up. But as mentioned, it may not just be the 11in MacBook Air that is discontinued. When the new MacBook launched on 9 March 2015, analysts began to suggest that the MacBook Air might not be around for much longer. "This wasn't the MacBook Air, but instead leapt past the Air," said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. "They kept the MacBook Air around just as they do with older iPhones, but the MacBook is now in the same position as the newest iPhone. That makes me wonder if the Air will go away over time." Carolina Milanesi, chief of research and head of US business for Kantar WorldPanel Comtech, also predicted a contraction of Apple's line-up. "All [notebooks] need to be more mobile, so something like the Air doesn't need to be branched out anymore," she said of the differentiation Apple made for the line since its introduction more than eight years ago. "And it's to Apple's benefit not to have so many 'families' of Macs." More recently, KGI Securities analyst and Apple guru Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that Apple is planning on launching a 13in MacBook to sit alongside the 12in MacBook, which would serve as a replacement to the MacBook Air going forward. In a note obtained by AppleInsider, the analyst foresees an end to the meaningful development of the MacBook Air. Apple won't remove the line from its stores just yet, though - it'll serve as an entry-level device for Apple adopters, much like it did with the original MacBook before it was discontinued in 2011. Over time, it seems likely that the MacBook Air range could be discontinued and eventually replaced by a Retina MacBook range at a lower price. In January 2017, DigiTimes cited Chinese site Economic Daily News and said Apple is going to drop the price of the non-Touch Bar 13in MacBook Pro and discontinue the MacBook Air, which only exists now in the 13in size. It added: "Apple is expected to unveil a new 12-inch MacBook in early second quarter with an additional memory option of 16GB" - this would all but render the Air unnecessary to Apple, even if consumers might lament the absence of its lower price point. We don't expect the 12in MacBook to drop in price. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: When was the MacBook Air last updated? We originally expected the MacBook Air to be updated with a Retina display back on 9 March 2015 at Apple's Spring Forward event. And were quite surprised when we got something else: a Retina MacBook, yes, but one with a 12in display and a USB-C port (and very few other ports), a new strand of products for Apple's MacBook laptop line-up. Less glamorously, Apple's MacBook Air did get an update at the same time, with new, faster processors, faster flash storage and better graphics, and was updated more recently in April 2016 with increased RAM, but the screen and overall design remained the same, with no Retina display for the Air line. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Price The last time that there was a Mac laptop that had more advanced specs than a more expensive model was the old MacBooks (aluminium, then white and black, and then eventually aluminium again). These older MacBook models were eventually discontinued and the price of the MacBook Air was reduced to make it the new entry level (when the MacBook Air initially launched it was quite overpriced for the specs, just like the current Retina MacBook). It seems likely that the same will happen with the new MacBook models eventually replacing the MacBook Airs, at a lower price, but for now that seems a long way off. The 11in MacBook Air started at £749, while the entry-level 13in model was £849 - this has now changed with the 11in axed - making the new 13in model, with a £100 price hike start at £949. If the 11in MacBook Air is removed from the line-up perhaps the cost of entry of the 13in model will reduce to the level that the 11in model is currently, with a rumoured 15in model coming in at a higher price at some point in the future. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Dimensions  If Apple does update the MacBook Air range, what dimensions should we expect? As mentioned above, rumours suggest that the 11in MacBook Air will be discontinued, after all, the 11in MacBook Air is both smaller than the MacBook and the new iPad Pro, and didn’t receive an update when the 13in model did. However, 9to5Mac points out that the new 13in and 15in MacBook Air models could be additional sizes to the MacBook range. That site predicts that sometime in 2017 we will have just two ranges of Mac laptops: the MacBook at the ultraportable level, and the more advanced MacBook Pro. Maybe the 17in MacBook Pro will make a comeback too, with a 4K display. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Specs & new features These new MacBook Air models are said to be thinner and lighter, with internal spec enhancements. Apparently, the new MacBook Air will feature new batteries, cooling modules, and chassis, according to the Economic Daily News. We also expect to see USB Type-C across the range, especially now that Intel has integrated Thunderbolt 3 into USB-C - more on that below. Processors The next-generation MacBook Air is likely to feature next-generation Intel processors, as well as graphics and RAM upgrades. Intel has started shipping its Kaby Lake processors - that's the generation of chips after Skylake, and offers support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. But here's a leftfield alternative. The Dutch-language site Techtastic has posted a reference in the kernel of macOS Sierra to "ARM HURRICANE", a chip family that is now supported. This isn't a chip that anyone has heard of, but it would make sense for this to be an Apple custom ARM chip, fitting in as it does with the company's previous naming conventions: the A7 (in the iPhone 5s) was codenamed Cyclone, the A8 Typhoon and the A9 Twister. Those are iPad/iPhone chips, of course, so does this mean Apple is going to let iDevices run macOS Sierra? Certainly not - but it might be about to put ARM chips in the MacBook Air. Image courtesy of Techtastic Update 08/02/2017: It's not just the CPU that's getting an upgrade either, as a recent Bloomberg report claims that Apple is working on a processor that's meant to improve the battery life of its laptop range. According to the report, the chip is said to handle basic tasks like checking for email and installing updates while the computer is asleep. Apple's current way of working relies on the MacBook's main processor to handle the tasks, but by implementing a dedicated low-power processor, Apple can further reduce battery consumption and provide a longer battery life.   Those with knowledge of the subject claim that the chip is similar to that used by Apple in the MacBook Pro to manage the Touch Bar, and that the new chip may make an appearance in the 2017 MacBook Pro, along with other laptops. It makes sense, as Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has been criticised since launch for its poor battery life. New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: E-ink keyboard Rumours are rife concerning Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro and, more specifically, its OLED touch bar. The OLED touch bar is rumoured to provide contextual shortcuts to the user based on the application that they're using at the time - but the most recent report suggests Apple isn't happy enough with the feature. 9to5Mac and TrustedReviews report that Apple has been in talks to use a laptop variant of Sonder Design's dynamic keyboard technology. Sonder Design is famous for developing an E-ink keyboard, using E-ink to change the key labels on the fly. This means that the entire keyboard is customisable, providing multiple languages as well as contextual shortcuts from a single keyboard. It allows users that are, for example, editing in Final Cut Pro to look down at the keyboard and see exactly which tool they need to use without having to memorise them before hand. What isn't clear is how Apple is planning on implementing the software, or which laptop it could be featured on, leading us to believe that it could possibly make an appearance on the 2017 MacBook Air. Sonder has confirmed that talks between Apple and the company has taken place, although it won't comment on whether or not it's a deal - it has only confirmed that it's "closing B2B procurement contracts" with three laptop makers. New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Retina display When Apple updated its MacBook Air in March of 2015, we had been convinced that the company was about to give the laptop a Retina display. Instead, it launched a brand-new MacBook line that's super-thin, super-light and does offer that high-resolution display, but does that mean Apple won't enhance the MacBook Air with a Retina display in the future? With the 2016 update only adding more RAM to the basic 13in model, it may be the case. The suggestion that the MacBook Air will feature a Retina display has been long running but those rumours were prior to the launch of the 12in Retina MacBook and the iPad Pro - suggesting the sightings of the Retina display some thought was destined for the MacBook Air was instead for these models. Does this mean that there will be no Retina display on the new MacBook Air when (or if) it launches? If Apple wants to keep the price down maybe not. Or perhaps the newly rumoured 15in Macbook Air will feature a Retina display, while the 13in model will lack the high-res display, but come in at a lower price, one similar to the older 11in MacBook Air. Read more: What is a Retina display? New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: MacBook Air to feature USB-C port While we assumed the next MacBook Air would feature USB-C ports, a recent report from Taiwanese website DigiTimes seems to confirm our theory - if believed, anyway. The publication claims that Apple is planning to release a MacBook Air with USB-C ports in future, but doesn't provide a launch timeframe for the upgraded laptop.  "Currently, Apple has decided to adopt the USB Type-C interface for its MacBook Air, while Asustek Computer and Hewlett-Packard (HP) are upgrading one of their notebooks' regular USB port to the Type-C. Lenovo, Acer and Dell are still evaluating the option." The issue with DigiTimes is that it isn't always accurate - the site has previously claimed that Apple would start shipping ultra-thin 13in and 15in MacBooks by the end of Q2 2016, which ended in June with no appearance, although the site's sources have proven reliable at times in the past. So, how accurate is this report? We're not 100 percent sure, but we imagine that if Apple wants to keep the MacBook Air alive, this is the road it'll be headed down.  However, Bloomberg reported in August 2016, one week before the reported iPhone 7 launch, that Apple is preparing a MacBook Air update "as soon as October". This might mean that the MacBooks are announced at the 7 September event, but won't ship until the following month. This seems a logical step; the MacBook has just one USB-C port and the rumoured new MacBook Pro will also feature this connection type. It would still represent a bold move overall for Apple however - it'd mean all of its laptops would no longer support standard USB-A connections, a move sure to annoy a few people, but ultimately shape the future of mobile computing.  New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Apple Pencil-enabled Trackpad While this isn't a new patent (it was originally filed back in 2014), a patent application has recently been granted that allows the Apple Pencil to work with Mac trackpads. What is most interesting about the patent is that it depicts a more sophisticated Apple Pencil than the one currently available, suggesting that the accessory is due to get an overhaul at some point in the future. It even goes as far to describe the Pencil being used as a general input device like a joystick or an 'air mouse'. "Inertial sensor input may be gathered when operating the stylus in one or more inertial sensor input modes such as an air mouse mode, a rotational controller mode, a joystick mode, and/or other inertial sensor input modes." What isn't clear is if the upgraded Apple Pencil will only work with certain trackpads - if this is the case, we imagine that the technology would make its way to the next-gen MacBook Air. However, Apple has a habit of applying for a patent and then doing nothing with it, so it isn't set in stone that we'll be seeing this featured on the next MacBook Air - but we can sure hope.  New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Touch ID and Force Touch We expect this feature to come on the Air model - if it isn't already discontinued!  There are also reports to suggest that it'll boast Touch ID within its Trackpad, which may also get the Force Touch upgrade that was given to the 13in MacBook Pro back in March 2015, and comes with the new MacBook. Touch ID is the fingerprint sensor that's built into the Home button of the iPhone 5S, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. It's also used to make Apple Pay more secure and with the recent announcement of Apple Pay coming to Mac as part of macOS Sierra, this rumour makes a lot of sense. According to an Independent report, Touch ID for the Mac line would require a dedicated chip to be built into the device. The rumour started with Taiwanese blog AppleCorner, which cited sources in the supply chain. Apparently, the Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad may get a biometric update too, enabling users to make Apple Pay payments on the web, but both those accessories were updated alongside the launch of a new 4K iMac so that seems unlikely to happen anytime soon.  We'll be updating this article as more information about the rumoured Retina MacBook Air emerges so check back from time to time for the latest news.

I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Apple is joining the likes of Netflix and Amazon and making its own TV shows for distribution on the Apple TV, and it is likely that you will be able to start streaming Apple's shows this spring, as long as you subscribe to Apple Music for £9.99 a month. Apple's head of internet software and services Eddy Cue unveiled two trailer for two shows at Recode's Code Media conference in February. You can watch these trailers below. The shows will be distributed via the £9.99 a month Apple Music subscription service. Apple Music head Jimmy Iovine confirmed that Apple has plans to offer original video content via its Apple Music service back in January 2017. Speaking at a Television Critics Association event, Irvine said that Apple is working towards creating "an entire cultural, pop cultural experience, and that happens to include audio and video," via the Apple Music service. What TV shows is Apple making? The Wall Street Journal reported in January that Apple has been talking to producers about creating premium programming and movies, but so far we know that the following programmes are being made for Apple's streaming service: Carpool Karaoke A popular spot on CBS's The Late Late Show and staring James Corden, 16 episodes of Carpool Karaoke will be available to stream via Apple Music. Apple head of internet software and services Eddy Cue unveiled a trailer for the show at Recode's Code Media conference in February. The show will start streaming in April. Planet of the Apps Hosted by Will.i.am this is a sort of Dragon's Den for App developers. It will feature celebrities including Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Alba mentoring app developers. App developers have the length of a escalator ride to pitch their apps. As yet a date hasn't been revealed but it is expected that the show may be made available in June coinciding with Apple's Worldwide Developers conference. Apple posted this trailer: Vital Signs Backed by Apple, Dr Dre's semi-autobiographical six-part series was rumoured to be in production in February 2016. However, little has been revealed about this show since those reports appeared regarding it. Will Apple's shows only be about music and apps? Apparently Apple doesn't intend to limit content. The programmes won't be limited to music or app themes, according to Apple Music head Jimmy Iovine. "If South Park walks into my office, I am not going to say you're not musicians, you know?" he said, as reported by the Hollywood Reporter. When will I be able to watch Apple's TV shows in the UK? We expect that the programmes will be available on Apple Music in the UK at the same time as they go live on Apple Music in the US, so expect to be able to watch Carpool Karaoke in April. How can I watch Apple's TV shows? The shows will be available for Apple Music subscribers for £9.99 a month. As of February 2017 there are 20 million paid subscribers to the service. Subscribers will be able to stream the shows on their Apple devices including the newest Apple TV model, the iPhone and iPad. Will Apple stream shows for free? It is thought that the shows will only be available to Apple Music subscribers, so it is unlikely that you will be able to watch the shows without paying for an Apple Music subscription. Apple is unlikely to offer an commercial based model in order to cut the cost to consumers, speaking at Recode in February, Apple's Eddy Cue said of such models: "I'm not saying we'll never do it.. I don't think it's the direction we should be going. I don't think that's what our customers are asking for." There is no indication that the shows will be made available to purchase separately on iTunes either. However if you don't yet have an Apple Music subscription you could take advantage of the three month free trial to watch the new shows when they come out. Is Apple trying to take on Netflix with an Apple Streaming service? There have been rumours for years that Apple planed to work with the networks to distribute content via its own streaming service. Back in 2015 Apple was said to be negotiating deals with networks. At the time, ESPN's boss John Skipper confirmed that he was working on a deal with Apple for its rumoured streaming service, but revealed that Apple was having more trouble convincing other networks to join in. However, it appears Apple hit a bit of a brick wall with the negotiations because by August 2015 talks with CBS, Fox, and NBC were said to have stalled. And then, in December 2015 it was claimed that Apple was putting its plans for the streaming service on hold because the cable companies and networks were proving too resistant to the idea. By February 2016 CBS CEO Les Moonves had confirmed that talks with Apple had stopped following months of conversations with content providers: "We had conversations awhile back, and we haven't had recent conversations with them," Moonves said.  Why did Apple fail to come to an agreement in these negotiations? One report claimed that Apple was looking to collect a 30% fee from all subscriptions and the network operators weren't happy about this. Having failed to negotiate content deals will Apple instead seek to acquire companies that have content available for distribution? There are claims that the company could buy Disney, for example, more on that below. For now the company seems to be distancing itself from the idea. Speaking at Recode, Apple's Eddy Cue said that Apple isn't "trying to buy a bunch of shows," indicating that Apple isn't planning to make any content acquisitions, and back in June 2016 Apple's Eddy Cue said that Apple wasn't interested in becoming a Netflix competitor. Is Apple going to launch a television? The short answer: no. Rumours that Apple would launch a TV were circulating for some time, spurred by the fact that Apple's co-founder Steve Jobs seemed to hint in his biography that he intended to reinvent television. This spurred a long running rumour that Apple would launch an actual television set. Jobs told his biographer Walter Isaacson: "I'd like to create an integrated television set that is completely easy to use… It will have the simplest use interface you could imagine. I finally cracked it." Apple CEO Tim Cook seemed to share Jobs' TV dreams. Over the years he has suggested both that the TV experience needed to be bought up to date, and that Apple might revolutionise television. He stated back in September 2014: "Think how much your life has changed, and all the things around you that have changed, and yet TV, when you go into the living room to watch TV or wherever it may be, it almost feels like you're rewinding the clock and you've entered a time capsule and you're going backwards. The interface is terrible, I mean it's awful. You watch things when they come on unless you remember to record them." Analyst Gene Munster was probably the most vocal in his predictions that Apple would launch an actual TV, he may even have been correct, as there were reports that Apple did have a team working on an actual TV, but it appears that the company eventually ditched the idea. Instead of launching an actual television, the company launched Apple's tvOS and the re-imagined Apple TV in 2016, both of which could be seen as the culmination of Steve Jobs vision for TV. However, those who were hoping for the reinvention of television, with a fancy TV set and a Netflix-style streaming service were disappointed. Read our review of the 2015 Apple TV here: Apple TV (fourth-gen, 2015) review. Could Apple buy Disney? Apple could probably buy a whole country if it wanted to, it has so much money in the bank. As to whether it might buy Disney, there are reasons to think that such a deal wouldn't be completely surprising: to do so would bring content, excellent co-branding potential, and a 30% share of Hulu. There is also the fact that Steve Jobs was Disney's biggest shareholder following his sale of Pixar to the company, and the fact that Disney CEO Bob Iger sits on Apple's board. With all that in mind, it's hardly surprising that the rumour has been circulating. However it would make Apple a conglomerate and we don't think that becoming such a diverse organisation would fit  with Apple's DNA. Could Apple buy Netflix? Another rumour doing the rounds is that Apple could buy Netflix. However, Apple's Eddy Cue has quashed that rumour by saying that Apple isn't looking to buy a content company: "We might be better buying somebody or doing that, but that's not what we're trying to do," Cue said at the Recode conference in February 2017. Could Apple buy HBO? Time Warner? There was a rumour that Apple was considering buying HBO, the home of Game of Thrones as part of an acquisition deal with Time Warner. Back in early 2016 a New York Post report even claimed that Apple might even buy Time Warner, Inc. That purchase would include HBO, CNN, HLN, TNT, TBS and the Cartoon Network. However, no such deal emerged. Tags: Apple , Rumour , Apple TV Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search Should You Follow Warren Buffett And Load Up On Apple Inc. Stock? February 15, 2017 11:54am Nasdaq:AAPL ShareTweet According to recent regulatory filings, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway nearly quadrupled its position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Should everyday investors follow suit? In the fourth quarter of 2016, Berkshire bought a massive 42.1 million shares of Apple. That move brought its total AAPL holdings to 57.4 million shares, or 1.09% of the company’s total stock. Owning 1% of a company doesn’t sound like too much, but that position was worth about $6.6 billion at the end of 2016. Still, that’s only a fraction of Berkshire’s entire portfolio, which is valued at approximately $155 billion. For those of us lacking that kind of money to invest, does it make sense to follow suit? First, let’s examine why Buffett made the investment to begin with. According to notes posted by Dr. David Kass, Buffett himself probably didn’t even make the investment. Instead, it was a couple of his trusted employees that are largely in charge of Berkshire’s technology investments: “Ted (Weschler) and Todd (Combs) each have about $9 billion to invest. One or more invested in Apple. With Apple, people get hooked on things that they like. [Buffett] has a competitive edge within his circle of competence (which does not include tech companies). His circle grows wider over time but outside of his circle tech people know better than he does. [Buffett] mentioned that he did not invest in Microsoft even though it had no cost of goods sold and was earning a ‘royalty on the world’ since the world needed its operating system.” The fact that Buffett himself didn’t make the investment shouldn’t worry anyone, however. The Oracle has the final say on every move the company makes, and he gave his seal of approval to allocate billions into Apple shares. Buffett loves companies that have a competitive advantage like he does. Apple certainly falls under that category — its massive installed user base for its devices (on which it books huge margins, by the way) opens up many doors for future growth. Apple is also extremely cash rich — another quality Buffett admires. That’s because a company with tons of cash can afford to be very generous with share buybacks and dividends, not to mention grow via acquisitions. Historically, Apple has shied away from too many big purchases, preferring to absorb smaller firms whose technology it can leverage in its own products and services. But that doesn’t mean it’ll operate like that forever. In fact, there are many potential major acquisitions out there for Apple, all easily attainable given its cash position and creditworthiness. There simply isn’t another company in the history of the world that can match Apple’s size, reach, margins, cash, and customer affinity. With the iPhone 8 reportedly on the horizon this year, we may be entering the firm’s next golden age. And all of these things mean that the stock is absolutely worth following Buffett into. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was trading at $135.17 per share on Wednesday morning, up $0.15 (+0.11%). Year-to-date, AAPL has gained 16.71%, versus a 4.80% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

The media were only allowed 15 minutes to ask Mr Stokes and Seven boss Tim Worner questions about the sex scandal, which has engulfed the network for months now. But it was worth the wait. The question did not even relate directly to the affair between former staffer Amber Harrison and Mr Worner.

It is not a satisfactory answer given the turmoil at Seven West. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Seven West Media is still grappling with the fallout of the relationship between CEO Tim Worner and former employee Amber Harrison.  "I interpret [the resignation] as being a discomfort either with the lack of transparency around the release of the [investigations firm] Allens report or some other aspect of the process the board had undertaken," Paul Redmond, a law professor and associate director of the Centre for Corporate Governance at the University of Technology Sydney, told Bloomberg. Sitting besides Mr Worner on the conference call, Mr Stokes also said his chief executive officer "continues to have the full confidence of the board" and praised the way Mr Worner has handled himself since the company became aware of the affair in 2014. "At the time it arose, I told him he must have nothing to do with this issue and the people involved. And that's why he's been able to focus on what he's done," said Mr Stokes, speaking of Seven's industry leading results. Mr Worner also addressed the issue. He referred to Ms Harrison as a "former employee" and said: "I have apologised for what did happen and do not want to give any more oxygen to things that did not happen." Mr Stokes did not hold back when it came to what he thought of Ms Harrison and the barrage of allegations she has made against the boss of Australia's top television network. "The facts of the matter are there were significant amounts of our money taken by her," said Mr Stokes. He also expressed dissatisfaction that the board had had to launch another investigation into "irrelevant allegations that have no substance at all". Ms Harrison is effectively gagged from making any sort of reply to Mr Stokes' comments after the company obtained an interim court injunction on Monday. It stops Ms Harrison from releasing documents the network says she has no right to hold, access or release. Ms Harrison is expected to respond when the matter goes before the NSW Supreme Court next week. Follow CBD on Twitter.

Rumours of curved handset heat up as OLED display deal discussed Report claims Apple in talks with Chinese display company for iOS smartphone of the future. By Oliver Cragg February 15, 2017 17:20 GMT Apple could be eyeing an all-OLED future for its iOS smartphoneLeon Neal/ Getty Images With rumours swirling that Apple's iPhone 8 could pack a Samsung-made OLED display, a new report has suggested that the Cupertino giant is looking to another display maker for its OLED iPhones from 2018 onwards. The supplier in question is BOE Technology, a Chinese company that is upscaling its display output by investing $14.5bn to build two OLED plants in Sichuan, China with the aim of providing backlit, flexible AMOLED displays. According to a Bloomberg report, Apple is eyeing said displays as a long-term solution and is currently testing its output ahead of a potential agreement that would see future iPhones carry BOE's panels. Of particular note is the suggestion that BOE hopes to produce 1.6 million square-metres of flexible AMOLED glass each year – a number that dwarfs production estimates from other companies – although it is unclear how much this depends on it securing Apple's stamp of approval. Apple is expected to reveal an OLED-sporting high-end iPhone later this year in celebration of the smartphone's 10th anniversary. While at least one other variant is also rumoured to be in the works with an LCD panel, it has been suggested that the premium edition will feature an AMOLED screen produced by Samsung Display. A shipment of over 100 million units of OLED displays has reportedly been agreed between the Samsung's subsidiary company and Apple for the 2017 iPhone. But while those could eschew the type of curved form factor seen on the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, BOE's batch could see the entirety of Apple's future iPhones with OLED displays, perhaps even ones with curved edges or a flexible design? Conflicting rumours have previously suggested that Apple could be turning to Micro-LED technology as a long-term OLED alternative. The iPhone maker invested heavily in Micro-LED in 2014 when it acquired LuxVue Technology – a company that has previously filed multiple Micro-LED patents.

Mining restrictions last year by President Xi Jinping's government aimed at easing a glut resulted in a 9.4 per cent drop in production and a surge in prices, snapping at least four years of declines across Asia. To cool the market, officials reversed some measures to boost production ahead of winter. A resumption of restrictions now may support prices again if demand growth is sustained, according to Argonaut Securities (Asia). "The policy will effectively set a floor for coal prices," said Helen Lau, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Argonaut. "Reinforcing the 276-working-day restriction, even partially, will have an immediate impact to supply recovery and market sentiment." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link China is considering reinstating coal output restrictions to avoid the return of a glut after easing limits during winter.  Photo: Nick Moir The NDRC is considering reinstating the production limits for six months, with some mines and areas possibly excluded, said the people. No decision had been made yet, they said. In late trading in London, shares in BHP Billiton gained 3.2 per cent. Shares in Rio Tinto slipped 0.6 per cent, Glencore fell 0.7 per cent. Advertisement Thermal coal futures traded on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange reversed earlier losses and added 0.7 per cent to close at 535.2 yuan a tonne. Coking coal futures in Dalian fell 0.9 per cent to settle at 1214 yuan a tonne after earlier rising as much as 0.5 per cent. Teck see lower realised prices "Sellers of seaborne coking coal are banking on the recent drop in prices to encourage more buyers to make spot purchases and stem the decline," market participants told Metal Bulletin. Coking coal prices, which have been trending downwards since December, saw the pace of their decline accelerate this week. Metal Bulletin's cfr China premium hard coking coal index fell $US1.66 to $US159.23 per tonne on Wednesday, its lowest since early September. "The ample supply is affecting market sentiment and demand is really just moderate at best," a seller source told MB. Canada's Teck Resources, the largest producer of coking coal in North America, said overnight that customers appear to be drawing down inventories following a fourth-quarter buying binge, sparked by global supply worries that were ultimately unfounded. Teck forecast steelmaking coal sales of approximately 6 million tonnes in the first quarter, down from 7.3 million tonnes in the fourth quarter. It has reached agreements with the majority of its coal customers for the first quarter, based on a quarterly benchmark price of $US285 per tonne.  Teck expects an average realised price in the first quarter of about 70 per cent to 75 per cent of the $US285 per tonne benchmark. Teck's fourth-quarter realised price was $US207 a tonne. The company forecast 2017 steelmaking coal production of 27 million to 28 million tonnes, but said output may be adjusted depending on demand. NDRC seeks to avert renewed glut "The NDRC probably expects a decline in coal demand as the winter heating season ends and so they are attempting to limit supplies so a new glut doesn't emerge and knock down prices," said Laban Yu, head of Asia oil and gas equities at Jefferies Group in Hong Kong, "The policy is likely flexible and NDRC may change it again according to supply and demand." The NDRC wants coal prices in a range of 500 yuan to 570 yuan a tonne, according to Yu. Spot coal with an energy value of 5500 kilocalories per kilogram at the port of Qinhuangdao, China's benchmark grade, was at 605 yuan a tonne as of February 13, down almost 14 per cent since the start of November, according to data from the China Coal Transport and Distribution Association. Prices rose 73 per cent in 2016. Separately China rejected a shipment of coal from North Korea a day after the country testfired a ballistic missile in violation of international sanctions, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported. A load of around 16,295 tonnes of North Korean coal, estimated to be worth around $US1 million, was not allowed to be unloaded at a seaport in Wenzhou in China's Zhejiang province on Monday, and will be returned to the North Korean western port of Nampo, the agency said citing unidentified sources. The rejection was due to a higher-than-permissible level of mercury contained in the coal, the agency said. The move came a day after Pyongyang's test of the intermediate-range ballistic missile on Sunday, its first direct challenge to the international community since US President Donald Trump took office on January 20.

Wearable Tech by Matt Elliott February 15, 2017 7:00 AM PST @themattelliott The next time you want to go for a run -- or just a walk -- you can leave your iPhone behind and bust a move with your Apple Watch. All that's required is a pair of Bluetooth headphones and a little upfront work. Step 1: Sync a playlist Unlike your iPhone, your Apple Watch can't stream music from the internet, so you'll need to download music to the watch. To do so, grab your iPhone and open the Watch app. Next, tap Music from the list of apps and then tap Synced Music. From this screen, you can pick a single playlist to sync to your Apple Watch. Enlarge Image Screenshots by Matt Elliott/CNET Two things need to be in place for the sync to happen -- Bluetooth needs to be turned on on your iPhone, and your Apple Watch needs to be on its charger. Also, you'll need to exercise patience; even short playlists took a while to sync to my Apple Watch. Side note: You can set a limit for music storage on your Apple Watch using the Watch app on your iPhone. Under the Synced Music option in the Music section, you can choose between 100MB and 2GB (about 15 to 250 songs). Step 2: Pair headphones to your Apple Watch To pair your Bluetooth headphones, put them into pairing mode and then grab your Watch and go to Settings > Bluetooth. It should see your headphones and show them under Devices. When it does, tap on your headphones to pair the two. (Apple's AirPods or another set of headphones with Apple's W1 chip, such as BeatsX, will pair automatically with the Apple Watch if the headphones are already paired with your iPhone.) Step 3: Let the music play With your playlist synced and your headphones paired, tap to open the Music app on your Apple Watch. Swipe down to reveal the menu that lets you choose a music source and tap the icon for the Apple Watch. Next, scroll down and tap Playlists and you'll see one playlist listed under the header, On My Apple Watch. Tap to let the music play.

Really Double Its Services Business in 4 Years? Investors are excited about Tim Cook's pronouncement that Apple aims to double its services segment revenue in the next four years -- but some analysts doubt that Apple can pull this off. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Feb 15, 2017 at 10:35AM About a year ago, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) began spending more time discussing its services business during its quarterly earnings calls. It's pretty clear why it decided to do so -- the services segment is the only aspect of Apple's business that is still growing consistently. On the first quarter earnings call last month, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced an ambitious goal of doubling the company's services revenue in the next four years. That's a big reason why Apple stock has rallied more than 10% in the past few weeks, reaching a new all-time high. Apple YTD Stock Performance, data by YCharts. Plenty of analysts and other pundits are skeptical that it will be feasible to double the services business in four years, barring a big acquisition. But here are three reasons why doubling the services business might not be so hard after all. Services growth is accelerating First, the services segment's growth trajectory is better than it seems. For Q1 of fiscal 2017, Apple reported an 18% year over year increase in services revenue, down from 26% growth a year earlier. These figures make it seem like Apple's services growth is already slowing. Considering that Apple needs to grow its services revenue at a 19% compound annual rate to double it in four years, this would be an ominous sign. However, in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, Apple benefited from a one-time $548 million gain related to a patent infringement lawsuit. Excluding that patent revenue, Apple's services revenue grew only 15% in Q1 2016, but surged 30% year over year last quarter. Thus, Apple doesn't even need to maintain its recent services growth rate to hit its target. The App Store is gaining scale A second factor working in Apple's favor is that the App Store has recently become the largest contributor to Apple's services revenue. App sales have been growing at a fast clip for many years, but Apple only reports its net revenue from the App Store. The portion of App Store sales that goes to developers -- which ranges from 70%-85% -- doesn't show up in Apple's financial statements. Apple earns an extremely high profit margin on App Store revenue due to this accounting policy, but the growth of this revenue stream hasn't been very material until recently. Wall Street analyst Toni Sacconaghi estimates that Apple's net App Store revenue reached $7.3 billion in the 2016 fiscal year that ended last September. That would make it the largest piece of Apple's services segment, ahead of iTunes, which faces secular revenue declines. Furthermore, the App Store continues to grow at a phenomenal pace. Last month, Apple reported that developers' earnings rose more than 40% year over year during 2016. The pace of growth is sure to slow over time, but App Store revenue is on a trajectory to more than double in the next four years, providing a good chunk of the services revenue growth Apple is targeting. The iPhone Upgrade Program could lift AppleCare revenue Growth of the iPhone Upgrade Program is a third factor that could contribute to increases in Apple's services revenue. For as little as $32.41/month, this program allows customers to get a new iPhone every year by trading in their old one. Purchases under the iPhone Upgrade Program include AppleCare+ enhanced warranty coverage, which is worth $129. The iPhone Upgrade Program is boosting AppleCare+ revenue. Image source: Apple. Many iPhone fans have already enrolled in the iPhone Upgrade Program, but there's still plenty of room for growth. Apple could potentially expand the program to more countries. It could also consider creating similar programs for other devices like the Apple Watch. These Apple-operated upgrade programs can drive significant services revenue growth because AppleCare+ is part of the bundle. Very few of these customers would be buying AppleCare+ if it were still sold separately. A big reason for optimism Apple's services business produced more than $24 billion of revenue in fiscal 2016, up from less than $20 billion a year earlier. This allowed it to surpass both the iPad and Mac product lines to become Apple's second-largest segment by revenue. Even if Apple misses its target of doubling its services revenue by 2020, it will certainly get a meaningful amount of revenue growth from that segment. With strong services growth ensuring that Apple's non-iPhone revenue will rise consistently in the years ahead, Apple will be well positioned to return to strong earnings growth as the next iPhone sales cycle heats up.

Over the year as a whole, Huawei saw its sales leap by 26.7 percent, while the South Korean and US rivals both suffered a sales decline of 4.3 percent, Gartner said in a study. As result, Huawei was able to increase its share of the smartphone sector to 8.9 percent in 2016 from 7.3 percent a year earlier, while Samsung saw its market share shrink by two full percentage points to 20.5 percent and Apple’s contracted to 14.4 percent from 15.9 percent. “Chinese makers succeeded in winning market share over last year and Huawei now seems to be the main rival to the two giants, even if the gap remains large,” Gartner analyst Annette Zimmermann said. The other Chinese smartphone makers are OPPO, BBK Communication Equipment (with its One Plus and Vivo brands), ZTE, Xiaomi and Lenovo. “We’re seeing a very real progression compared with earlier years, when the number three maker and the others had struggled to hold on to a market share of more than four percent,” Zimmermann said. “Huawei looks likely to strengthen its position again this year,” she added. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the launch of the iPhone 7 and Samsung’s difficulties with its Note 7 model enabled Apple to take top position in the market with a share of 17.9 percent or 77 million units sold. Samsung sold 76.8 million smartphones in the October-December period, giving it a market share of 17.8 percent, while Huawei sold 40.8 million phones or a market share of 9.5 percent. “Preliminary data for the current quarter suggest that Samsung will overtake Apple again. But it’s remarkable that Apple can hold on to that sort of share of the market with a closed eco-system,” the analyst said. With regard to the different operating systems, Android, which is used by the large majority of smartphone manufacturers, commands a market share of 81.7 percent, while Apple’s iOS operating system of its iPhones and iPads accounts for 17.9 percent of the market.

CBS News Logo CBS News News Latest US World Politics Entertainment Health MoneyWatch SciTech Crime Sports Shows Video More In Depth Photos Mobile Radio Local Shop Log in/out Search CBSN Toggle video By Shara Tibken CNET February 15, 2017, 12:07 PM Apple vs. FBI one year later: Still stuck in limbo Apple CEO Tim Cook last year fought a request to develop software that would help the FBI break into an iPhone used in a terrorist attack. James Martin/CNET Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email It’s been a year since Apple fought the FBI over data privacy, and we’ve barely heard a peep from either side on the issue. So everything’s fine, right? Uh, no. The FBI’s attempt to force Apple to unlock an iPhone used by a terrorist set up a grand legal battle between security and privacy. On one side is a massive tech company envisioning a future similar to the setting in George Orwell’s “1984” (which, coincidentally, has become a bestseller again after President Donald Trump’s inauguration). On the other is the world’s most powerful government dangling the threat of a terrorist attack if it can’t get access to vital information. The stakes were sky-high. Cybersecurity experts said the dispute could have far-reaching implications for everything from how private our personal photos are to how tech companies operate in other countries. Both were poised to head to court, and then a funny thing happened: The FBI suddenly said it didn’t need Apple’s help, and the whole affair just faded away. But that doesn’t mean everything is hunky-dory. Play Video CBS Evening News How did the FBI break into the San Bernardino shooter's iPhone? The FBI has successfully broken into the San Bernardino terror attacker's iPhone without the help of the manufacturer Apple. John Blackstone take... Because the battle never went to court, we never got an answer on whether security or privacy takes priority. A year later, the only thing that’s clear from the public battle is just how hazy everything still is. And the conflict isn’t going away anytime soon, especially if there’s another terrorist attack. “This past year was kind of a missed opportunity to work this thing out,” said William Snyder, visiting assistant professor of law at the Syracuse University College of Law. “It hasn’t gone away. The question is whether you deal with it now when things are calm or later when the stakes are high.” The FBI referred CNET to comments made by FBI Director James Comey in April, when he talked about how the US has always balanced privacy with public safety and how encryption has upset that balance. “The logic of strong encryption means that all of our lives, including law enforcement’s life, will soon be affected by strong encryption,” he said. “The notion that privacy should be absolute, or that the government should keep their hands off our phones, to me just makes no sense given our history and our values.” Apple CEO Tim Cook, meanwhile, has continued to champion strong encryption and Apple’s efforts to protect customer data. Last week at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, he said that “it wasn’t that we were being activists; it’s that we were being asked to do something that we knew was wrong. And so we had a choice to just blindly do what the institution said to do, or to fight. And we just fought.” What happened again? Here’s a quick refresher: In early 2016, the FBI wanted Apple to create software to unlock an iPhone 5C used by Syed Farook, who weeks earlier had killed 14 people in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California. Apple helped pull data from Farook’s iCloud account, but some dates were missing. And the FBI couldn’t get into the phone because it didn’t know the passcode. Play Video Saturday Apple isn't backing down on iPhone privacy battle A CBS News/New York Times poll suggests Americans are divided over whether Apple should unlock the encrypted iPhone of one of the San Bernardino ... On February 16, 2016, US Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym ordered Apple to create that software for the FBI. Apple refused, with Cook arguing that the order went too far and would threaten the security of all iPhone users. Bypassing the iPhone’s password meant creating a “back door” in its iOS mobile software that could then be used to access every other iPhone, he said. The two sides battled over the following weeks in legal filings and public comments. The fight ended with a whimper on March 21 -- the day before a slated court hearing -- when the FBI found a third party to unlock the phone. It turned out the government didn’t need Apple’s help after all. A separate case in Brooklyn, New York, that involved a confessed drug dealer ended in a similar fashion, with the FBI dropping its request for Apple’s help after finding another way into the iPhone. In both instances, the FBI initially said Apple was the only organization that could get into the iPhones. But both times, the bureau ended up being able to access the phone with the help of third parties at the 11th hour. The government didn’t specify in either instance who helped it get into the iPhones, but reports later named Israeli security firm Cellebrite as the company that helped the FBI in the San Bernardino case. Cellebrite earlier this year was hacked, something Apple had worried about. “I would characterize this as the opening volley in what’s going to be a very long-term conversation,” said Paul Rosenzweig, a former Department of Homeland Security official and founder of cybersecurity company Redbranch Law and Consulting. The encryption debate What the fight came down to was the encryption used on Farook’s iPhone 5C. The technology scrambles data and requires a passcode before letting you have access. If investigators copied the hard drive, the data would remain scrambled. And if investigators entered the wrong passcode 10 times, the iPhone’s data would be wiped. Tech firms and privacy advocates argue that encryption is essential to secure personal information and communications. The government and law enforcement officials counter that encryption hurts their ability to investigate criminal and terrorist activity. Apple’s battle with the FBI got the average consumer and Congress thinking about the once wonky topic of encryption. It spurred others to act. Facebook-owned messaging app WhatsApp rolled out end-to-end encryption in early April, which means it doesn’t have access to those messages and can’t be forced to surrender them to the authorities. The same time Apple was battling the FBI, draft legislation leaked for a possible encryption bill from two US senators, Richard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina, and Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California. The bill would have given federal judges the authority to order tech companies like Apple to help law enforcement officials access encrypted data. Tech companies essentially would be legally required to build back doors into their products, the very thing Apple fought against. “The consensus among security and privacy and legal experts was that was a terrible idea,” said Larry Downes, project director for the Center for Business and Public Policy at Georgetown University McDonough School of Business. “It would mean the end of any actual privacy protection.” In late May, that bill -- which was never actually introduced to the Senate -- died. No other encryption bill has been proposed since. As of January, more than half the volume of internet traffic is now encrypted, according to Firefox browser maker Mozilla. Then what? While Apple may not have been back in court over this issue, others have. Microsoft and Google faced legal battles over giving law enforcement access to data stored in their cloud services, and law enforcement has asked Amazon to send recordings made by its Echo smart speaker that relate to a murder in Arkansas. Microsoft has prevailed in court with its argument that it shouldn’t have to hand over data held in an Irish data center until Ireland gives approval. Google, though, wasn’t as lucky. Earlier this month, a US judge ruled that Google has to give the FBI emails stored overseas. “It’s a question about information stored in the cloud that isn’t encrypted, but the government wants to get through the Stored Communications Act,” said David Opderbeck, a professor of law at Seton Hall University Law School. It’s an issue that could pop up more, he said. Apple, meanwhile, continues to beef up the security of its devices. In August, it introduced its first “bug bounty” program for outside researchers to find vulnerabilities in its software. That’s long been a common practice for other tech companies, but Apple previously performed its checks internally. It now offers up to $200,000 for any flaws found and reported to the company. The Trump card The wildcard in all of this is President Trump. He’s expected to take an even tougher stance than President Barack Obama when it comes to strengthening law enforcement access. “I can only expect the new administration ... to go even further than the Obama administration did in terms of data collection and the expectation that even private companies are going to be compelled to share private information with the government,” said Charley Moore, CEO of online legal technology company Rocket Lawyer. The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly bashed Apple for not helping the government hack the iPhone. “Who do they think they are?” he asked at one time. Another occasion, Trump called for a boycott of Apple’s products until the company helped unlock the device. That never happened. Play Video CBS This Morning From iPhone encryption to fake news, a look back at tech in 2016 The tech industry saw a lot of ups and downs this year. Facebook promised to fight fake news on its social network and launched its live video fe... “They have to open it up,” Trump said in mid-February 2016. “I think security -- overall, we have to open it up and we have to use our heads. We have to use common sense.” Some of Trump’s early moves have butted up against the technology industry. His ban on immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations caused an outcry joined by Apple, Microsoft and dozens of other companies. His pick for the head of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai, will likely dismantle net neutrality, which most of the tech industry favors. Trump also withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which had a provision that would ensure no company from a member state had to provide access to its software source code as a condition of entering the market another member state’s market. “That provision would have gone a long way toward avoiding the parade of foreign horribles that Apple raised in its opposition to the FBI warrant,” said Joshua Rich, a partner at law firm McDonnell Boehnen Hulbert & Berghoff. “But because the US withdrew, other TPP member states will not be required to extend those protections to US companies.” Trump made Hillary Clinton’s use of a private server while secretary of state a key campaign talking point. And in late January, he was slated to sign an executive order on cybersecurity but canceled those plans without explanation. With Trump in the White House and with Congress controlled by the Republican party, pro-law enforcement legislation is likely. The hope among cybersecurity experts is that anything related to encryption or privacy that happens takes place soon, not in the aftermath of an attack as was the case with the Patriot Act. That post-Sept. 11 law increased surveillance powers and caused major privacy concerns. “The pendulum swung wildly to the national security side because we suffered through a catastrophic attack,” said Daniel Rosenthal, a former counterterrorism official with the National Security Council who currently works as an associate managing director at Kroll, a corporate investigations and risk consulting firm. “If we suffer through another [attack], there’s a good chance the pendulum swings again, away from the privacy and data security side.” Special Reports: CNET’s in-depth features in one place.

Newsletters Site Log In Advisor Insights Log In Facebook Set to Launch New Video App for TV (FB, GOOG) By Gayatri Sapru | February 15, 2017 — 6:47 AM EST Share In a move to further its dominance across platforms, Facebook Inc. (FB) has announced a new app for set-top boxes that will allow users to stream videos on their televisions. This includes saved videos, Facebook's recommended videos, videos shared by pages or friends, and top live videos from around the world. The app will roll out soon to stores for Amazon's (AMZN) Fire TV, Samsung Smart TV, and Apple TV (AAPL), with more platforms to be announced soon. "A lot of people when they’re watching video in news feed during the day will save it for later, because they don’t have time to watch," said VP of Partnerships Dan Rose at Recode's Code Media conference. "Now it's easy to watch on your TV if you want to do that. We want people to be able to consume content wherever they are – whether it’s on their phone, whether it’s on their computer — and TV is just another screen for that." In October, the company added a feature to its smartphone app that let users hit a button to stream videos on Apple TV and Google's (GOOG) Chromecast. (See also: Apple Offers First Look at Its TV Shows) The company also announced other video features in the blog post. Users can now stream videos in a corner of the screen as they continue scrolling through their newsfeeds. Videos will also autoplay with sound as a user scrolls down and vertical videos will expand to fill the screen. The Wall Street Journal had reported last month that Facebook was developing a 'video-centric' app for TV and that it was negotiating licensing deals for TV-quality programming. The report also said that the new content may include longer videos and even commissioned scripted shows alongside sports and entertainment videos. On a Q4 earnings call, Zuckerberg did indeed confirm that Facebook is looking toward developing episodic content, amongst other things. (See also: Is Facebook a Future Competitor to Netflix?) "I see video as a mega trend on the same order as mobile," Zuckerberg said to investors in a conference call this month. "That's why we're going to keep putting video first across our family of apps and making it easier for people to capture and share video in new ways." Facebook has been actively pushing users to try out its range of video offerings, including Facebook Live and Instagram Stories which it launched successfully last year. This latest move pits Facebook directly against rivals like Google's YouTube and Hulu, both competitors to traditional broadcast television. Facebook will be able to compete with television for ad dollars if it can get its user base to use the TV app. It's not clear yet if Facebook plans to monetize users accessing the content it develops, so we can keep an eye out for news on that.

Interestingly, Apple’s frenemy Samsung is going to be the sole supplier of OLED displays for Apple’s best iPhone this year. But Apple is looking to fix this OLED “problem” in the years that follow, mostly since Samsung alone won’t be able to fulfill Apple’s iPhone needs. Don't Miss: Mesh is the hottest trend in home Wi-Fi, so we tested every top system to find the best Various reports have revealed that Samsung and other display makers including LG and Japan Display will invest heavily in OLED factories now that Apple is moving from LCD screens to OLED. Now, a new report from Bloomberg adds massive Chinese conglomerate BOE Technology Group Co. to that list. BOE has already sent OLED screens to Apple for testing, but it’s unclear whether they’ve been deemed suitable for the next-gen iPhone — that’s the 2018 iPhone, not the iPhone 8 coming out this year. BOE is one of China’s largest display panel makers, and it’s looking to invest $14.5 billion building two AMOLED plants in Sichuan in anticipation of future business. The iPhone is one of BOE’s targets, and that shouldn’t surprise anyone. Apple’s OLED adoption will convince many other smartphone makers to follow suit, numerous reports have suggested, even though OLED screens have been around for years. That means even if you’re not an iPhone user, you future smartphones might pack high-quality OLED screens thanks to Apple. Apple reportedly ordered some 160 million OLED screens from Samsung this year, but that won’t be enough to equip all 2017 iPhones with OLED displays. Instead, only the iPhone 8 will get the OLED treatment, while the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will stick to LCD screens. Samsung is also setting aside about 60 million OLED screens for its Galaxy S8 phones. In the future, Apple will want all of its iPhones to have OLED displays, and the same probably goes for other products it sells. Android device makers, in turn, will likely move to OLED displays as supply increases and OLED screens become even more affordable. Samsung Display, which has 95% of the OLED market according to the same report, will see tremendous competition in the coming years. BOE alone is expected to mass-produce 1.6 million square meters of flexible OLED glass substrates per year once its two factories come online, which is slightly more than what researchers from IHS estimate for this year’s total global OLED production.

Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version 09:45 15 Feb 2017 The answer is one share, but there’s more to it than that Buffett's estimated to be worth US$75bn It was Valentine’s day yesterday, but if you’re a Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK.A) shareholder, you won’t be remembering it for the over-priced dinner at the local steakhouse. Instead, 14 February 2017 will be remembered as the day that the Berkshire share price edged over US$250,000 to reach its all-time highest close. No, you haven’t read that wrong nor is it a typo. A quarter of a million dollars is now the going rate for one Berkshire Hathaway Class A share. At the head of this ultra-exclusive club is Warren Buffett, the renowned investor and (depending on your source of information) the second richest person in the world worth a cool US$75bn or so. His company has surged more than 12% in the months following the US election, which ironically he reportedly had hoped would be won by Hillary Clinton. It might not stop there either. Analysts reckon insurance firm Geico – taken over by Berkshire in 1996 – is likely to post improved results at its next quarterly earnings report. Wall Street reckons the cash pouring in from the likes of Geico and other wholly-owned subsidiaries such as NetJets and Fruit of the Loom could see the Berkshire cash pile hit US$100bn later this year. The astonishing price tag on the company's shares can almost be justified by Berkshire's returns over the past 50 years or so since Buffett took the reins. The per-share book value of the company rose by more than 1,800,000% between 1964 and 2015. Upsetting the Apple-cart The company might be about to make another sizeable return on investment thanks to a certain tech company called Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), as well. At the ripe old age of 86, if Buffett can still cartwheel there’s a good chance he’s done one or two over the past couple of weeks. The billionaire has tended to avoid tech stocks in his time at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, following the principle of "invest in what you know", but the company began to pile into Apple this time last year. By September, Berkshire had 15.23mln shares in the California-based group. The share price then began to fall away towards the end of the year but rather than follow the likes of George Soros and pull out from Apple altogether, Buffett went the other way and loaded up even more. By the end of the year, Berkshire owned a little over 57mln shares in the tech giant. Assuming its stake has remained the same during the first six weeks of the year, that stake is now worth in the region of US$7.75bn; or around US$1.1bn more than it was at the end of 2016. Airliners get the backing of Buffett Alongside Apple, the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ as he’s affectionately known, has ploughed into airlines in recent times. Berkshire more than doubled its stake in American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ:AAL) to 45.5mln shares as of 31 December, while its investment in Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) increased almost tenfold to 60mln shares. Berkshire also bumped up its stake in fellow airline companies United Continental Holdings Inc (NYSE:UAL) and Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV) in the last few months of 2016. Monsanto Company (NYSE:MON) and Sirius XM Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SIRI) were also on the list of Berkshire investments at the end of 2016. All of these companies, without exception, gained in pre-market trading on Wednesday. Others like Walmart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT), Kinder Morgan Inc (NYSE:KMI) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) – which Berkshire either sold off completely or reduced – were all down this morning. Warren Buffett: A brief history The son of Congressman Howard Buffett, the future billionaire was born in 1930 in Omaha, Nebraska (hence the nickname). He had a penchant for making money from a young age, with various stories of him selling chewing gum, delivering papers and working in his grandfather’s grocery shop. When he was still only 15, Buffett and a friend put a games machine in a barber shop. Within months the pair had installed a few more machines in other shops and sold the business shortly after for US$1,200. After being rejected for Harvard, the 19-year-old Buffett enrolled at the Columbia Business School of Columbia University, earning a master’s degree in economics. Following a few successful partnerships and fairly well-paid jobs as a broker and salesman, by 1962 Buffett was a millionaire. He started buying shares in a relatively unknown textiles firm, Berkshire Hathaway, in the same year, before completing the takeover of the group in 1965. Berkshire eventually moved away from its textiles roots, with Buffett instead choosing to use it as a holding company for other investments. The company has gone on to make numerous investments in the likes of Coca Cola (NYSE:KO) and American Express (NYSE:AXP), while it has also bought outright several businesses including Geico and Fruit of the Loom. The millionaire became a billionaire in May 1990 when Berkshire Hathaway began selling Class A shares, with the market closing at US$7,175 a share on the first day of trading. Value investing Savvy investments have been key to Buffett’s success, and if you were to ask Buffett where he learned most of his tricks he’d likely point to his old Columbia Business School professor Benjamin Graham. Graham first came up with what is now called ‘value investing’ back in the ‘30s, a theory which he then passed on to many students, including the young Buffett. The professor, and now his ex-student, has argued that the essence of value investing is buying stocks at less than their intrinsic value. For example, a stock that trades at a discount to its book value, or has low price-to-earning multiples might be considered to be a value investment. Value investing doesn’t mean buying cheap stocks though. As Buffett has explained on several occasions: “It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price, than a fair company at a wonderful price.” Greatest hits Buffett's investing methods have paid off handsomely on numerous occasions, and the world famous drinks brand that is Coca Cola is up there with one of his greatest ever buys. He purchased a 7% stake in the firm for US$1bn back in 1988, which Berkshire still holds to this day. That same stake is now worth upwards of US$12bn. One of his early deals, way back in 1964, was to buy shares in American Express after the bank’s share price collapsed to US$35 following a fraud scandal. While Wall Street moved its money out of the company, in came the Oracle who snapped up a 5% stake for US$13mln. Only a few years later and the share price was back up to US$180, netting him a tidy US$20mln profit. Another smash hit for the world’s second richest man also came in his earlier days. In 1976 when insurance firm Geico was facing bankruptcy, Buffett started buying stock at US$2 a share before completing the takeover almost two decades later in 1996. Under Berkshire’s leadership, Geico has become the second largest private vehicle insurer in the US. A couple of misses, too It hasn’t all been plain sailing though. Buffett admitted a couple of years ago that “thumb sucking” with regards to selling its stake in UK supermarket Tesco PLC (LON:TSCO) cost Berkshire US$444mln; one of the biggest losses in its history. Buffett refused to pull the plug on his investment despite the grocer issuing four profit warnings and becoming embroiled in an accounting scandal back in 2014. Another error of judgement came in 2007 when Buffett, without consulting his right hand man Charlie Munger, bought US$2bn of bonds in the utilities firm Energy Future Holdings. Buffett had expected gas prices to rise but they took a dive instead. Buffett threw in the towel in 2013 and sold the bonds for just US$259mln for a total loss of almost US$900mln.

Mobile phones have arguably become a necessity in the modern world, we all need texts, calls, internet and emails, but what happens when humanity’s love of wanton excess takes over? When practicality and efficiency give way to mindless decadence? Sure, you can send emails from it, but does it need to be made of diamond and gold? For some people that answer is yes, so here is a look at the top seven most expensive mobiles in the world.   1. iPhone 5 Black Diamond At a whopping £10 million, the iPhone Black Diamond has been dubbed ‘the worlds most expensive phone’. British designer Stuart Hughes, who will be mentioned again in this list, is known for his luxury modifications of Apple products but this one is on another level. The phone itself is made of solid gold dotted with some 600 solid white diamonds, the home button has been replaced by a single 26 carat black diamond, while the Apple logo on the back is made up of another 53 small diamonds. You’re probably asking who could afford such a thing? The answer is an unnamed Chinese businessman.   2. iPhone 4s Elite Gold Also one of Stuart Hughes’ more opulent creations, the iPhone 4S Elite Gold has a market value of £6 million and was also the previous record holder of ‘worlds most expensive phone’. If the 500 flawless diamonds, a 24 carat gold Apple logo, and a solid platinum chest wasn’t enough, the chest also contains pieces of actual Tyrannosaurus Rex bone. Yes, this phone is made from dinosaurs. Only two of the phones were ever made and it’s quite easy to see why, dinosaur bones aren’t exactly the most common material in the world.   3. Amosu Call of Diamond iPhone 6 At £1.7 million, the Amosu Call of Diamond version of the iPhone 6 has more than earned it’s place in the expensive phones hall of fame. This phone comes from noted luxury designer Alexander Amosu, who in 2009 sold the world’s most expensive suit worth an incredible £70,000. The phone itself is a not so standard Apple iPhone 6 with an 18 karat solid gold chassis, which is then smothered in a maddening 6,000 small diamonds, and one large 51 carat diamond cut into the shape of the rear logo. The entire design process takes roughly two months to craft a single phone. If the diamond version is too expensive then there’s always the plain old solid gold  version for £2000, which all of a sudden doesn’t seem like such a ludicrous decision.   4. GoldVish Le Million As well as being one of the more garish looking phones on this list, the GoldVish Le Million, as it’s name suggests, is worth just over £1 million. Goldvish SA, the Swiss manufacturer, has made a name for itself in the overly lavish phone business, however the Le Million was their first and certainly most expensive. The phone boasts a solid gold body studded with diamonds, something that at this point is becoming fairly run of the mill. Perhaps most interestingly, because the phone was produced way back in 2006 for the ‘Moscow Millionaire Fair’ it’s functionality is probably pretty limited despite being worth more than most houses.   5. Gresso Luxor Las Vegas Jackpot With a price tag almost as long as it’s name it’s easy to see why this £800,000 phone made the list. In a refreshing change, this device goes slightly easier on the amount of gold used and instead most of the body is actually made from 200 year old African Blackwood, which may or may not be worse depending on how you look at it. The keypad is also made up of 17 etched sapphires, though the bulk of it’s price comes from the diamonds which cover most of the front. There is also a £15,000 version available if you want to save that extra £785,000 for a rainy day. Though at that reduction you’ll have to forego the diamonds.   6. Vertu Signature Cobra Significantly cheaper than the previous entry, the Vertu Signature Cobra will still set you back by about £250,000, and you’re not getting much for that. The phone was designed by french jeweller Boucheron in a limited run of eight phones and as the name suggests the handset has a pear cut diamond cobra surrounding the casing. In terms of materials, this one boasts an obscene 439 rubies and two emerald eyes for your new Cobra friend.   7. Black Diamond VIPN Smartphone Just slightly cheaper, at £240,000 the Black Diamond VIPN is one of the ‘classier’ looking phones you could buy for an outlandish price. Rather than diamonds embedded in gold, African Blackwood, or diamond snakes, the VIPN has just two diamonds on show, one on the back and one serving as the joystick, which certainly shows the phones age. However, if you’re looking for exclusivity, it’s worth noting that only five of these phones were ever made.   Tags iPhone mobile Previous ArticleHow to be more ‘Google’ with talent analytics Next Article5 most expensive drones in the world Most read CASB Explained Ellie Burns 15th February 2017 IBM, Hortonworks tackle big data in Hadoop analytics partnership Ellie Burns 14th February 2017 Business collaboration software: Tech for the sake of tech or vital enterprise tool?

"Following" : "Follow"}} February 15, 2017 11:27am   Comments Share: Related AAPL Apple, Alphabet, Panera, Tesla: Fast Money Picks For February 15 Paul Singer's Latest 13F Shows Big Changes In Apple, Western Digital Dow Strikes New Record High As P&G Rallies, Apple Keeps Rising (Investor's Business Daily) Plenty of investors follow the smart money during 13-F filing season. If the managers running billion-dollar hedge funds are all buying or selling the same stock, it may serve as a strong indication that retail investors should be doing the same. However, sometimes the smart money doesn’t necessarily all flow in the same direction. The latest 13-F filings have revealed several of the biggest names on Wall Street still don’t seem to see eye-to-eye on the world’s largest company. Apple In April of 2016, Icahn Enterprises LP (NASDAQ: IEP) chairman Carl Icahn revealed he sold out of his massive 46 million share stake in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). At the time, Icahn said he was concerned about Apple’s inability to deliver sales growth and its challenging prospects in China. Related Link: 13F Roundup: Apple, Bank of America And Other Stocks Hedge Funds Love/Hate However, several other Wall Street giants apparently saw Apple in a quite different light. The exact same quarter Icahn sold his stake in Apple, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A)’s Warren Buffett and Greenlight Capital’s David Einhorn and were both buying shares. “We believe there is tremendous value in Apple’s brand and growing global customer base that periodically buys new devices and increasingly buys additional services,” Einhorn said at the time. This time, at least, Buffett and Einhorn picked the right side of the trade. Apple shares are up 23 percent since the beginning of April 2016, outpacing the S&P 500 by about 10 percent. Berkshire Hathaway and Greenlight Capital finished 2016 up 24.6 and 8.4 percent, respectively. Icahn Enterprises finished the year down 6.0 percent. New Stakes In the most recent quarter, both Buffett and Einhorn upped their stakes in Apple. Berkshire upped its stake from 15.2 million shares to 574. million shares in Q4. Greenlight added 613,300 shares, bringing its total stake up to more tan 5.8 million shares.

The feature is only available at Shell stations starting in the UK, but Jaguar says it “will become available later this year in other markets.” Rather than using a card at the pump, or waiting in the service station, owners who install the Shell app can simply drive up to any pump at a Shell service station (initially in the UK and then globally) and use the vehicle’s touchscreen to select how much fuel they require and securely pay using PayPal® or Apple Pay®. Android Pay™ will be added later in 2017. In-car fuel payments are available as part of the Shell app on 2018 Jaguar F-PACE, XE and XF models according to the announcement. You still need to pump your own gas, but you do avoid insecure credit card readers. Jaguar says in-car payments for fuel is only the beginning as they want to add parking and food order payments in the future. It’s unclear exactly how Jaguar’s new in-car payment feature will work with Apple Pay, however, as the current description sounds a little more ambitious than what we’ve seen as possible to date. While Jaguar describes the feature as a first, it may work a lot like ExxonMobil Speedpass for Apple Pay specifically. Speedpass is an iPhone app that lets you authorize payments for fuel at Exxon and Mobil gas stations using Apple Pay. Some gas stations support Apple Pay at the pump with updated payment terminals, although these aren’t as common in the U.S. yet. While Jaguar’s implementation here may not be as exciting as described, it does point to something Apple could do with CarPlay in the future with Apple Pay. We’ll update our coverage if we receive clarification on how Apple Pay will work with Jaguar’s new feature.

"We have a billionaire battle we don't talk about enough. Carl Icahn, when he sold the stock, he really made it clear that Apple's best days were behind it and they had problems with China. Buffett clearly did not believe that scenario," Cramer said on "Squawk on the Street." When asked what he thought about Icahn's comment, Cramer said, "I do have to say that when you say that China was the problem, you got mainland China. Mainland China is very strong for Apple." Cramer's comment came after Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway nearly quadrupled its stake in Apple and increased its stake sevenfold in the four biggest U.S. airlines, according to a fourth quarter regulatory released on Tuesday. Cramer said that perhaps Buffett "got in on another wave of when the Street was believing that perhaps that airlines are no good again." Assuming Berkshire has not sold its stake, Apple's 16.6 percent stock price gain this year would leave it with a $1.1 billion paper profit in 2017 alone, according to Reuters. Separately, Buffett revealed last month that he beefed up his stock portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway after Donald Trump's election. In an interview with talk show host Charlie Rose that aired last month, Buffett said, "We've, net, bought $12 billion of common stocks since the election." Buffett added it was "in large part" his decision. Icahn, Trump's special advisor, increased his holdings in Herbalife and Hertz Global Holdings in the fourth quarter, and exited Voltari in the fourth quarter, according to Reuters.

Source: Apple Will Fight 'Right to Repair' Legislation Apple representatives plan to tell Nebraska lawmakers that repairing your phone is dangerous. Apple is planning to fight proposed electronics "Right to Repair" legislation being considered by the Nebraska state legislature, according to a source within the legislature who is familiar with the bill's path through the statehouse. The legislation would require Apple and other electronics manufacturers to sell repair parts to consumers and independent repair shops, and would require manufacturers to make diagnostic and service manuals available to the public.  Nebraska is one of eight states that are considering right to repair bills; last month, Nebraska, Minnesota, New York, Massachusetts, Kansas, and Wyoming introduced legislation. Last week, lawmakers in Illinois and Tennessee officially introduced similar bills.  According to the source, an Apple representative, staffer, or lobbyist will testify against the bill at a hearing in Lincoln on March 9. AT&T will also argue against the bill, the source said. The source told me that at least one of the companies plans to say that consumers who repair their own phones could cause lithium batteries to catch fire. Motherboard is protecting the identity of the source because they are not authorized to speak to the press. So far, Nebraska is the only state to schedule a hearing for its legislation. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. Update: A representative for AT&T said the company is "familiar with this legislation but [has] no plans to attend or testify." The spokesperson said that the CTIA, a wireless industry trade group that includes members such as AT&T and Verizon, is "working to find a viable solution." Last year, industry lobbyists told lawmakers in Minnesota that broken glass could cut the fingers of consumers who try to repair their screens Manufacturers have lobbied hard against right to repair legislation in the past. Last year, a bill headed through the New York statehouse was killed in part due to lobbying from Apple and IBM, among other manufacturers. But nationwide, the legislation appears to have much more momentum this year as more states introduce right to repair bills. Last month, the American Farm Bureau Federation, an influential political organization representing farmers, officially endorsed right to repair legislation. The bills nationwide are being pushed by Repair.org, a trade organization made up of independent repair shops who say that their companies have been harmed by an attempt by manufacturers to gain a monopoly over the repair business. Even without readily available repair parts or service manuals, a healthy DIY repair hobby has thrived thanks to online crowdsourced instruction manuals on sites like iFixit and grey market parts that are available directly from factories in China or can be salvaged from recycled devices. The idea that it's "unsafe" to repair your own devices is one that manufacturers have been promoting for years. Last year, industry lobbyists told lawmakers in Minnesota that broken glass could cut the fingers of consumers who try to repair their screens, according to Gay Gordon-Byrne, executive director of Repair.org. Byrne said she will also testify at the Nebraska hearing and "plans to bring band aids."  "They should want to give people as much information about how to deal with a hazardous thing as they can," Gordon-Byrne said. "If they're concerned about exploding batteries, put warning labels on them and tell consumers how to replace them safely." We need to keep adding bills because manufacturers can keep playing whack-a-mole with lobbyists if there's only one or two states It should be noted that iPhone 7 batteries do have a warning label that says there is a "potential for burning" if punctured. The label also says they should only be replaced by an "authorized service provider"—either Apple itself or a company that pays Apple a fee to become authorized. Tractor manufacturer John Deere has also come out vehemently against right to repair legislation; a letter the company wrote opposing the Kansas right to repair bill says the company wants to prevent "unintended alterations" to the tractors it sells. The company also said that such bills should be shot down "to protect consumers' significant investment in equipment," which it says can only be retained by servicing the vehicles at authorized John Deere repair centers. The full letter is embedded below. The goal of Repair.org is to get at least one bill passed this year, the hope being that manufacturers won't want to deal with a patchwork of laws in different states around the country. In 2012, a Massachusetts law guaranteeing the right to repair automobiles became de-facto national legislation after car manufacturers decided to comply with the law nationwide rather than continue to fight burgeoning legislation in other states. "We need to keep adding bills because manufacturers can keep playing whack-a-mole with lobbyists if there's only one or two states," Gordon-Byrne said. "But if there's 10, 12, 16 bills—that level of pressure is going to be hard to ignore."  John Deere letter by MotherboardTV on Scribd

According to sources who have worked with Apple in M&A, the company struggles repeatedly to pull off big deals "because of a series of quirks," including a refusal to work with investment bankers, inexperience with large takeovers, and an "aversion to risk." Apple is more interested, and more confident, in building its own services rather than outright purchasing them from a competitor, with occasional exceptions like the 2014 acquisition of Beats and later launch of Apple Music. “The first step in M&A is having some conviction about what it is you want to do,” said Eric Risley, managing partner at Architect Partners LLC who has negotiated deals with Apple. “Apple probably more than most feels that they’re very capable of building things" rather than buying them, he added. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. According to analysts and investors, Apple's next big move should be the acquisition of an online video streaming service. The company has began making strides towards beefing up Apple Music's original video content division, with Carpool Karaoke: The Series and Planet of the Apps coming this spring, but analysts believe it needs something "akin to Netflix or Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Video." In order to reach a forecast of $50 billion revenue in its services business by 2021, Erick Maronak, chief investment officer at Victory Capital Management, said that the company is "going to have to pursue something bigger than a Beats-like acquisition." This might include other possible "blockbuster" acquisitions like Walt Disney Co. or Tesla Inc, according to Baird analyst William Power. Netflix is also mentioned multiple times as a logical acquisition target for Apple, with multiple investors and analysts saying the company "needs at least one big acquisition in online video." But even here, some analysts and investors argue for a big acquisition, especially in online video streaming. Apple has started distributing videos through the Music service, and pooling other providers’ video in its mobile TV app, but it has no service akin to Netflix or Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime Video. On Friday, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said Apple needs at least one big acquisition in online video. To reach its $50 billion target, the company must find an extra $13 billion in services revenue over the next four years -- beyond what it can generate itself. Netflix Inc. ended 2016 with sales of less than $9 billion, so even buying that business may not be enough, the analyst said. Looking behind the scenes at the process Apple goes through to acquire a company, the Apple deals team is said to be made up of around a dozen people and led by Apple's head of M&A Adrian Perica. Most deals "take place at the behest of the company's engineers," so the team meets with Apple engineers who advise them on which potential acquisition targets are attractive and include talented engineers that would add value to Apple. Its acquisition strategy works well for smaller startups, which it acquires frequently, but the company faces a challenge for bigger deals. Apple refuses to work with investment bankers in an attempt to work directly with the other company's management teams. This results in an air of arrogance, according to Eric Risley, who has negotiated deals with Apple, further stating that "they’re used to being able to muscle their way in and get attractive economics." The company's overall attitude "puts off sellers," as well as its inexperience with integrating larger companies. Some analysts point towards the "lukewarm" launch of Apple Music after the Beats acquisition as proof of this struggle. Still, some investors remain adamant that for Apple to succeed, particularly in its attempts at creating and producing original TV, a big acquisition has to happen soon. Many of those have been pushing Netflix as an attractive target, despite Netflix saying it's not for sale. Read the rest of Bloomberg's report right here.

Can you define what it is you expect Apple to be releasing? I can't help anyone that thinks the TouchBar is "exciting". The touch bar signifies everything wrong with Apple. Junk products not thought out. Think about typing in a word processor. The touch bar gives you suggested words.....but your typing so you are looking at the screen and not the keyboard....sooooo. I tried to type a document with it in the Apple Store and discovered it was quicker to just type and use spell check than use the touch bars auto-correct and recommendations. By something like 3-4x faster. That is a products that solves a problem that nobody had. It also is dim and feels very cheap just like the MacBook Pro it's in. It is just not a good idea or product.

The drawings show that pressing the "Share" key would bring up a share sheet on the iPad Pro with options to share through apps such as Facebook, Mail, and Messages. There is no description of how the "Emoji" key would function, but pressing it would presumably bring up the on-screen Emoji keyboard on the iPad Pro. The current Smart Keyboard already has a globe key in the bottom left corner that can bring up the on-screen Emoji keyboard, but this key is not visualized in the patent drawings. There is a non-existent "Fn" key in its place. The third key, labeled with a magnifying glass, would serve multiple purposes. A single press, for example, could bring up a search field for searching within apps. A double press could bring up shortcuts for Messages, Photos, Calendar, Camera, Notes, Settings, and other apps. Long-pressing the key would invoke Siri. Since this is not a design patent, Apple's drawings are not entirely accurate, but rather just basic visualizations. The "Share" key is located where the right-side Command and Option keys would normally be, for example, while the "Emoji" key is included in lieu of Caps Lock, which is an essential key. Nevertheless, we roughed up a quick mockup of what the new Smart Keyboard could look like based on the same layout of the new keys as Apple's drawings. Apple is rumored to launch a trio of new iPads as early as March, but possibly not until later this year, including an all-new 10-inch range iPad Pro with an edge-to-edge display. The other models are expected to be updated 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models with faster A10X processors. A so-called "Smart Keyboard 2" could accompany the new iPads and perhaps the so-called "Apple Pencil 2" rumored to launch this year. The current Smart Keyboard was released in November 2015 and costs $149 and $169 for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro and 12.9-inch iPad Pro respectively. International versions such as British English, Dutch, Korean, Spanish, Italian, German, Swedish, French, and Arabic were released in August 2016.

Intel beat its initial hiring goals; Microsoft is tying executive compensation to diversity success; and Google says it's made changes to remove pay inequality, even though the diversity of its workforce has remained flat. Apple also claims to have removed pay disparities and has made slight gains on hiring women and people of color. It’s even launched an "Inclusion & Diversity" page with visualizations of its hiring data. But a small group of Apple investors believe the company isn't making progress fast enough, and they're trying to force the company to pick up the pace. "Some of the excuses given by Apple and others — there's not sufficient people in the pipeline, this and that," says investor Tony Maldonado. "Excuse my language, it's bullshit." Apple wants investors to shoot down the proposal Maldonado is leading an effort to mandate that Apple accelerate its work toward becoming a more diverse company. For the second year in a row, he's submitted a shareholder proposal asking that Apple "adopt an accelerated recruitment policy ... to increase the diversity of senior management and its board of directors." If approved, Apple would have to prioritize diversity at the top levels of its organization. How exactly it accomplishes that, and on what timeline, would be entirely up to Apple — but it'd have to do something. Maldonado says that could include tying executive pay to diversity goals, as Intel and Microsoft have done, or adopting a board refreshment policy, requiring the company to regularly explore potential new board members from diverse backgrounds. This year, Maldonado is submitting his proposal alongside Zevin Asset Management, an investment firm that specializes in "socially responsible investing." While that amplifies Maldonado's voice, it still doesn't give him anywhere near the Apple holdings needed to pass the proposal. Maldonado and Zevin will need help from other investors. And right now, there's a major voice standing in their way: Apple. In a filing with the SEC, Apple’s board wrote a note recommending that shareholders vote against the proposal. The company argues that it already has "much broader" diversity efforts at work and, in the past three years, has made "steady progress in attracting more women and underrepresented minorities." The proposed policy, Apple concludes, "is not necessary or appropriate because we have already demonstrated our commitment to a holistic view of inclusion and diversity." Apple declined a request for further comment. The company’s answer isn't good enough for Maldonado. He says Apple is leaning too heavily on retail stores to improve its diversity figures while doing little at the senior level (82 percent of Apple's leadership is white, versus only 56 percent of its retail employees). If that practice continues, Maldonado fears it'll hurt Apple's business in the years to come. “The board and their leadership needs to expand their viewpoints.” "In the long term, this will affect them," he says. "The more this becomes public and the more they provide pushback and resistance to this, then the people [this affects] will happily shop somewhere else." Pat Tomaino, an associate director at Zevin, agrees that Apple faces a "reputational risk" by not addressing diversity. Tomaino also says that Apple risks losing top talent by not casting its "search light as wide as possible" for new engineers and executives. That'll be particularly important, he says, as Apple begins losing longtime employees who are "basically irreplaceable." Maldonado adds that failing to hire more diverse talent could hurt Apple's decision-making abilities when it comes to different areas of the world. The company's efforts in China and India are two particular areas of concern. "The board and their leadership needs to expand their viewpoints, and only by allowing others to come in to provide them their insight will [Apple] be able to tackle those challenge." For Zevin, challenging Apple on diversity is both a financial issue and a social one. Investors are beginning to look for returns in both areas, Tomaino says, and that's led Zevin to work on issues like climate change and improving supply chain conditions. On climate change, Zevin worked with companies to "to get ahead of carbon pricing;" on supply chains, it was about managing reputation. "You have increasingly a large portion of the investment community that is attuned to these issues," Tomaino says. "Most of our colleagues, we choose issues to work on that we know we can move forward," says Tomaino. "With Apple and diversity, the case is clear." For Maldonado, diversity is solely a business issue Maldonado, who is Hispanic, makes a pure business case for diversity. He identifies as a "fiscally conservative, socially moderate person," clarifies that he doesn't want this turned into "a social justice warrior issue," and says he's simply "looking at things in black and white in terms of money." He’s also a “diehard” Trump supporter, who ends many of his tweets with “#MAGA” and says he both donated to and volunteered for the campaign. "I know it sounds as if it's socially progressive, but it's not a socially progressive issue," he says. "Money talks, okay?" Maldonado says Apple's leadership diversity became an issue for him after his son brought it up a few years ago. "I was actually quite blind to this as an investor and a business person," he says. "I dug into it and saw Apple has rarely ever had many people of ethnic or racial diversity within their board or senior leadership," he says. For a 40-year-old company “that’s laughable. That's racism plain and simple. That's all it is. There has to be plenty of people with sufficient qualifications.” At the company's 2015 shareholder’s meeting, Maldonado managed to get a question in with Apple CEO Tim Cook. He wasn't happy with the answer. "Tim Cook was very defensive, and he presented the two black people on their leadership — but not senior leadership — as a sign of their diversity," Maldonado says. "Personally, I took it as an insult. They were put on the spotlight as 'here's tokenism,' and he didn't seem to accept that." Six percent is this year’s goal Later that year, Maldonado filed his proposal with Apple for the first time. The company tried to have the proposal dismissed, but was ultimately shot down by the SEC. It went up for consideration at Apple's 2016 shareholder’s meeting, where it received only 5.1 percent of the vote. That may have been an overwhelming failure, but it was high enough — above 3 percent — to allow Maldonado to submit the proposal again this year (missing the target would have let Apple bar similar proposals for three years). It’ll go up for a vote again at the company's shareholder’s meeting on February 28th. Maldonado doesn't expect to win this year, but he's hoping to get enough support to keep the proposal going. This time, the threshold he needs to reach is 6 percent in order to resubmit. "If I can reach six percent," he says, "then I can live again to fight another day."

Apple has currently contracted with Samsung to provide 160 million OLED displays for its 2017 iPhones, but people familiar with the discussions said Apple is considering adding BOE to its list of suppliers moving forward to offset the chances of experiencing an OLED display shortfall. BOE is building new OLED plants in China in anticipation of ramping up production in the hopes of becoming Apple’s first display provider outside of Japan and South Korea. LG is also set to begin supplying foldable OLED screens to Apple starting in 2018. Comments « Apple to fight Nebraska ‘right to repair’ bill Daily Deal: Keezel Online Security & Privacy Solution.

Nebraska is one of eight states considering legislation that would force Apple and other electronics manufacturers to provide the public with diagnostic and service manuals so they can do their own repairs, but Nebraska is the first state to schedule hearings for the proposed law. A source within the legislature said “an Apple representative, staffer, or lobbyist” will testify against the bill during the March 9 hearing, arguing that customers trying to make their own modifications could cause the device’s lithium battery to catch fire. Apple declined to comment on the story, but the company has successfully lobbied against similar legislation in the past, most recently last year in New York. The bills gained new steam this year after being backed by the trade organization Repair.org and endorsed by the American Farm Bureau Federation.

What does US$250,000 get you at Berkshire Hathaway? Warren BuffettGeorge Soros Wednesday, 15 February 2017 (18 hours ago) It was Valentine’s day yesterday, but if you’re a Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK.A) shareholder, you won’t be remembering it for the over-priced dinner at the local steakhouse. Instead, 14 February 2017 will be remembered as the day that the Berkshire share price edged over US$250,000 to reach an all-time highest closing level. No, you haven’t read that wrong nor is it a typo. A quarter of a million dollars is now the going rate for one Berkshire Hathaway Class A share. At the head of this ultra-exclusive club is Warren Buffett, the renowned investor and (depending on your source of information) the second richest person in the world worth a cool US$75bn or so. His company has surged more than 12% in the months following the US election which he had hoped would be won by Hillary Clinton. It might not stop there either. Analysts reckon insurance firm Geico – taken over by Berkshire in 1996 – is likely to post improved results at its next quarterly earnings report. Wall Street reckons the cash pouring in from the likes of Geico and other wholly-owned subsidiaries such as NetJets and Fruit of the Loom could see the Berkshire cash pile hit US$100bn later this year. The astonishing fee can almost be justified in Berkshire's returns over the past 50 years or so since Buffett took the reins. The per-share book value of the company rose by more than 1,800,000% between 1964 and 2015. Upsetting the Apple-cart The company might be about to make another sizeable return on investment thanks to a certain tech company called Apple Inc (NYSE:AAPL). At the ripe old age of 86, if Buffett can still cartwheel there’s a good chance he’s done one or two over the past couple of weeks. The billionaire has tended to avoid tech stocks in his half a century or so at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway but the company began to pile into Apple this time last year. By September, Berkshire had 15.23mln shares in the California-based group. The share price then began to fall away towards the end of the year but rather than follow the likes of George Soros and pull out from Apple altogether, Buffett went the other way and loaded up even more. By the end of the year, Berkshire owned a little over 57mln shares in the tech giant. Assuming its stake has remained the same during the first six weeks of the year, that stake is now worth in the region of US$7.75bn; or around US$1.1bn more than it was at the end of 2016. Airliners get the backing of Buffett Alongside Apple, the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ as he’s affectionately known has ploughed into airliners in recent times. Berkshire more than doubled its stake in American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ:AAL) to 45.5mln shares as of 31 December, while its investment in Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) increased almost tenfold to 60mln shares. Berkshire also bumped up its stake in fellow airline companies United Continental Holdings Inc (NYSE:UAL) and Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV)in the last few months of 2016. Monsanto Company (NYSE:MON) and Sirius XM Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SIRI) were also on the list of Berkshire investments at the end of 2016. All of these companies, without exception, gained in pre-market trading on Wednesday. Others like Walmart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT), Kinder Morgan Inc (NASDAQ:KMI) and Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ) – which Berkshire either sold off completely or reduced – were all down this morning. Warren Buffett: A brief history The son of Congressman Howard Buffett, the future billionaire was born in 1930 in Omaha, Nebraska (hence the nickname). He had a penchant for making money from a young age, with various stories of him selling chewing gum, delivering papers and working in his grandfather’s grocery shop. When he was still only 15, Buffett and a friend put a games machine in a barber shop. Within months the pair had installed a few more machines in other shops and sold the business shortly after for US$1,200. After being rejected for Harvard, Buffett – now 19 – enrolled at the Columbia Business School of Columbia University, earning a master’s degree in economics. Following a few successful partnerships and fairly well-paid jobs as a broker and salesman, by 1962 Buffett was a millionaire. He started buying shares in a relatively unknown textiles firm Berkshire Hathaway in the same year, before completing the takeover of the group in 1965. Berkshire eventually moved away from its textiles roots, with Buffett instead choosing to use it as a holding company for other investments. The company has gone on to make numerous investments in the likes of Coca Cola (NYSE:KO) and American Express (NYSE:AXP), while it has also bought outright several businesses including Geico and Fruit of the Loom. The millionaire became a billionaire in May 1990 when Berkshire Hathaway began selling Class A shares, with the market closing at US$7,175 a share on the first day of trading. Value investing Savvy investments have been key to Buffett’s success, and if you were to ask Buffett where he learned most of his tricks and he’ll point to his old Columbia Business School professor Benjamin Graham. Graham first came up with what is now called ‘value investing’ back in the ‘30s, a theory which he then passed on to many students, including the young Buffett. The professor, and now his ex-student, has argued that the essence of value investing is buying stocks at less than their intrinsic value. For example, a stock which that trades at a discount to its book value, or has low price-to-earning multiples might be considered to be a value investment. Value investing doesn’t mean buying cheap stocks though. As Buffett has explained on several occasions: “It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price, than a fair company at a wonderful price.” Greatest hits Buffett's investing methods have paid off handsomely on numerous occassions, and the world famous drinks brand that is Coca Cola is up there with one of his greatest ever buys. He purchased a 7% stake in the firm for US$1bn back in 1988 which Berkshire still holds to this day. That same stake is now worth upwards of US$12bn. One of his early deals, way back in 1964, was to buy shares in American Express after the bank’s share price collapsed to US$35 following a fraud scandal. While Wall Street moved its money out of the company, in came the Oracle who snapped up a 5% stake for US$13mln. Only a few years later and the share price was back up to US$180, netting him a tidy US$20mln profit. Another hit for the world’s second richest man also came in his earlier days. In 1976 when insurance firm Geico was facing bankruptcy, Buffett started buying stock at US$2 a share before completing the purchase almost two decades later in 1996. Under Berkshire’s leadership, Geico has become the second largest private auto insurer in the US. A couple of misses, too It hasn’t all been plain sailing though. Buffett admitted a couple of years ago that “thumb sucking” with regards to selling its stake in UK supermarket Tesco PLC (LON:TSCO) cost Berkshire US$444mln; one of the biggest losses in its history. Buffett refused to pull the plug on his investment despite the grocer issuing four profit warnings and becoming embroiled in an accounting scandal back in 2014. Another error of judgement came in 2007 when Buffett, without consulting his right hand man Charlie Munger, bought US$2bn of bonds in the utilities firm Energy Future Holdings. Buffett had expected gas prices to rise but they took a dive instead. Buffett threw in the towel in 2013 and sold the bonds for just US$259mln for a total loss of almost US$900mln. » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   You Might Like Recent related news What does your Horoscope have in store this week?

Cue, Apple’s SVP of Internet software and services, said original series is “one of the differentiating factors we can add to Apple Music. He said the music service now has more than 20 million users. Apple is also setting the release of another original, Carpool Karaoke: The Series, which will also be distributed by Apple Music.  Planet of the Apps, a series about apps and their creators features Jessica Alba, Gwyneth Paltrow, Gary Vaynerchuk, and will.i.am, and is produced by Propagate Content chairman and co-CEO Ben Silverman, the former co-chairman of NBC Universal and Universal Media Studios, who joined Cue on-stage. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was seeking to form a new business focused on high-quality original TV shows and movies and to start offering scripted content by the end of this year. But rather than using that strategy to go after OTT video giants like Amazon and Netflix, the content strategy is to center around Apple Music as it continues to grapple with rival music streaming service Spotify. RELATED: Apple Ramping Up Plan for Original TV Shows, Movies: Report "We're not out trying to buy a bunch of shows, we're trying to do some things that are creative, that can, we think, move culture and that Apple is adding some value to" he said. Cue said the move into original TV content doesn’t mean Apple is gearing up to buy a big media company like Lionsgate or Time Warner. RELATED: Cook: Apple ‘Open to Acquisitions of Any Size’ “We are trying to do something that’s unique, takes advantage of our platforms and that really brings culture to it,” Cue said. “Right now, we think we can do that with partners like Ben, and we don’t see that anywhere else.” Last year, Apple hired former Time Warner Cable exec Peter Stern in a VP role focused on the company’s subscription services, including Apple Music.

Rumors suggest that there will be three new devices with the more basic devices being the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus. The third device is expected to be a very high-end and feature packed smartphone called the iPhone 8 to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the iPhone launch. A new rumor circulating today suggests that the iPhone 8 may be the only new iPhone of the trio that is fitted with a glass and steel body. We reported yesterday that the iPhone 8 has also been tipped to get a curved OLED screen made by Samsung Display. Apple ordered up another 60 million screens recently according to reports. Apple may finally lure those folks who haven’t seen a worthy upgrade in more recent iPhone devices to finally upgrade to the iPhone 8. The catch is that the cost for the iPhone 8 has been rumored at around $1,000. With carriers no longer offering subsidies on phones, if the price rumor is accurate your phone bill will go up significantly to cover the cost of the new smartphone. A large chunk of that cost is said to be the screen. There will be users of the iPhone 4 out there that remember that glass and steel bodied smartphone that was able to crack on the front and back if you dropped it. Hopefully the iPhone 8 won’t have this issue thanks to modern glass. The steel body might be needed to help facilitate wireless charging.

Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version 14:45 15 Feb 2017 The answer is one share, but there’s more to it than that Buffett's estimated to be worth US$75bn It was Valentine’s day yesterday, but if you’re a Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK.A) shareholder, you won’t be remembering it for the over-priced dinner at the local steakhouse. Instead, 14 February 2017 will be remembered as the day that the Berkshire share price edged over US$250,000 to reach its all-time highest close. No, you haven’t read that wrong nor is it a typo. A quarter of a million dollars is now the going rate for one Berkshire Hathaway Class A share. At the head of this ultra-exclusive club is Warren Buffett, the renowned investor and (depending on your source of information) the second richest person in the world worth a cool US$75bn or so. His company has surged more than 12% in the months following the US election, which ironically he reportedly had hoped would be won by Hillary Clinton. It might not stop there either. Analysts reckon insurance firm Geico – taken over by Berkshire in 1996 – is likely to post improved results at its next quarterly earnings report. Wall Street reckons the cash pouring in from the likes of Geico and other wholly-owned subsidiaries such as NetJets and Fruit of the Loom could see the Berkshire cash pile hit US$100bn later this year. The astonishing price tag on the company's shares can almost be justified by Berkshire's returns over the past 50 years or so since Buffett took the reins. The per-share book value of the company rose by more than 1,800,000% between 1964 and 2015. Upsetting the Apple-cart The company might be about to make another sizeable return on investment thanks to a certain tech company called Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), as well. At the ripe old age of 86, if Buffett can still cartwheel there’s a good chance he’s done one or two over the past couple of weeks. The billionaire has tended to avoid tech stocks in his time at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, following the principle of "invest in what you know", but the company began to pile into Apple this time last year. By September, Berkshire had 15.23mln shares in the California-based group. The share price then began to fall away towards the end of the year but rather than follow the likes of George Soros and pull out from Apple altogether, Buffett went the other way and loaded up even more. By the end of the year, Berkshire owned a little over 57mln shares in the tech giant. Assuming its stake has remained the same during the first six weeks of the year, that stake is now worth in the region of US$7.75bn; or around US$1.1bn more than it was at the end of 2016. Airliners get the backing of Buffett Alongside Apple, the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ as he’s affectionately known, has ploughed into airlines in recent times. Berkshire more than doubled its stake in American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ:AAL) to 45.5mln shares as of 31 December, while its investment in Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) increased almost tenfold to 60mln shares. Berkshire also bumped up its stake in fellow airline companies United Continental Holdings Inc (NYSE:UAL) and Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV) in the last few months of 2016. Monsanto Company (NYSE:MON) and Sirius XM Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SIRI) were also on the list of Berkshire investments at the end of 2016. All of these companies, without exception, gained in pre-market trading on Wednesday. Others like Walmart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT), Kinder Morgan Inc (NYSE:KMI) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) – which Berkshire either sold off completely or reduced – were all down this morning. Warren Buffett: A brief history The son of Congressman Howard Buffett, the future billionaire was born in 1930 in Omaha, Nebraska (hence the nickname). He had a penchant for making money from a young age, with various stories of him selling chewing gum, delivering papers and working in his grandfather’s grocery shop. When he was still only 15, Buffett and a friend put a games machine in a barber shop. Within months the pair had installed a few more machines in other shops and sold the business shortly after for US$1,200. After being rejected for Harvard, the 19-year-old Buffett enrolled at the Columbia Business School of Columbia University, earning a master’s degree in economics. Following a few successful partnerships and fairly well-paid jobs as a broker and salesman, by 1962 Buffett was a millionaire. He started buying shares in a relatively unknown textiles firm, Berkshire Hathaway, in the same year, before completing the takeover of the group in 1965. Berkshire eventually moved away from its textiles roots, with Buffett instead choosing to use it as a holding company for other investments. The company has gone on to make numerous investments in the likes of Coca Cola (NYSE:KO) and American Express (NYSE:AXP), while it has also bought outright several businesses including Geico and Fruit of the Loom. The millionaire became a billionaire in May 1990 when Berkshire Hathaway began selling Class A shares, with the market closing at US$7,175 a share on the first day of trading. Value investing Savvy investments have been key to Buffett’s success, and if you were to ask Buffett where he learned most of his tricks he’d likely point to his old Columbia Business School professor Benjamin Graham. Graham first came up with what is now called ‘value investing’ back in the ‘30s, a theory which he then passed on to many students, including the young Buffett. The professor, and now his ex-student, has argued that the essence of value investing is buying stocks at less than their intrinsic value. For example, a stock that trades at a discount to its book value, or has low price-to-earning multiples might be considered to be a value investment. Value investing doesn’t mean buying cheap stocks though. As Buffett has explained on several occasions: “It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price, than a fair company at a wonderful price.” Greatest hits Buffett's investing methods have paid off handsomely on numerous occasions, and the world famous drinks brand that is Coca Cola is up there with one of his greatest ever buys. He purchased a 7% stake in the firm for US$1bn back in 1988, which Berkshire still holds to this day. That same stake is now worth upwards of US$12bn. One of his early deals, way back in 1964, was to buy shares in American Express after the bank’s share price collapsed to US$35 following a fraud scandal. While Wall Street moved its money out of the company, in came the Oracle who snapped up a 5% stake for US$13mln. Only a few years later and the share price was back up to US$180, netting him a tidy US$20mln profit. Another smash hit for the world’s second richest man also came in his earlier days. In 1976 when insurance firm Geico was facing bankruptcy, Buffett started buying stock at US$2 a share before completing the takeover almost two decades later in 1996. Under Berkshire’s leadership, Geico has become the second largest private vehicle insurer in the US. A couple of misses, too It hasn’t all been plain sailing though. Buffett admitted a couple of years ago that “thumb sucking” with regards to selling its stake in UK supermarket Tesco PLC (LON:TSCO) cost Berkshire US$444mln; one of the biggest losses in its history. Buffett refused to pull the plug on his investment despite the grocer issuing four profit warnings and becoming embroiled in an accounting scandal back in 2014. Another error of judgement came in 2007 when Buffett, without consulting his right hand man Charlie Munger, bought US$2bn of bonds in the utilities firm Energy Future Holdings. Buffett had expected gas prices to rise but they took a dive instead. Buffett threw in the towel in 2013 and sold the bonds for just US$259mln for a total loss of almost US$900mln.

 Apple Music gets into the TV business BI Intelligence Feb. 15, 2017, 10:11 AM 1,001 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Facebook makes a play for music Google reshuffles its music products Most Americans will have more than one streaming video subscription by 2018 This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Digital Media Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Apple officially unveiled its first two TV series, “Planet of the Apps” and a series version of “Carpool Karaoke,” at the Recode Media conference on Monday night. Both shows will be available on Apple Music, an imperative segment for the future growth of Apple as it looks to differentiate itself from competitors, according to Apple SVP of Internet Software and Services Eddy Cue. The company is also rumored to be planning the launch of a six-part mini-series produced by Dr. Dre, though Cue gave no mention of additional developments in that project. Original TV content is a way for Apple Music to differentiate itself from Spotify. As of December 2016, Apple Music logged around 20 million subscribers, and while this is just about half of those paying for Spotify, it took Spotify double the amount of time to reach 20 million paying subscribers as it did for Apple. To continue this growth, Apple will need to continue to innovate, and securing original TV shows and movies is one way to do that, especially as mobile online video is expected to comprise roughly 75% of all mobile data by 2020, according to Cisco. However, Cue was hesitant to compare Apple’s business to that of Netflix and Hulu. Cue made it clear the company is not at the point where it is swiftly increasing spend on video via content licensing or acquisitions, according to a Recode article. It’s important to point out, though, that Apple is sitting on over $200 billion in cash, which it could use to invest heavily in original or syndicated content. By comparison, Netflix plans on spending $6 billion on original content in 2017. The company has also undergone a set of TV-related initiatives within the last few months. Most recently, Apple hired Timothy Twerdhal, the former the head of Amazon's Fire TV unit, as a vice president to lead Apple TV product marketing. And last fall, Apple debuted a TV app that serves as a unified platform for video content. The app seeks to improve the film and TV search discovery and viewing experience. Apple’s new TV app hopes to do away with the inconvenience traveling from app to app when searching for content. Growth of subscription-video-on-demand (SVOD) services in the US has slowed considerably over the last year as competition in the online video streaming space intensifies. Heavy hitters like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime are increasingly squeezed by new competitors with exclusive content and niche video offerings.   International markets, and specifically, the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region will be paramount for both established SVOD players and new entrants looking to establish themselves in the successful video space. The SVOD market in the APAC region is poised for explosive growth over the next five years due to increased mobile adoption, amplified broadband expansion, and enhanced purchasing power. Dylan Mortensen, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on subscription video on-demand that explores how slowing SVOD growth in the US will lead to a surge in the APAC region. Here are some of the key takeaways from the report: While SVOD services are increasingly rooted among US households, growth is beginning slow. Growth in North American SVOD subscriptions is set to fall from 30% in 2014 to 4% by 2018. The best opportunity for continued growth lies in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. The region had nearly 42 million SVOD subscribers in 2015, but could have up to 158 million by 2021. The increasing adoption of smartphones and mobile data is propelling growth in mobile video viewing across APAC, which is poised to outpace the rest of the world. Rising purchasing power in APAC underlines the opportunity for online video services. China and emerging Asian economies represent nearly two-thirds (63%) of global economic growth. Content creators and marketers stand to gain from SVOD’s push into the APAC region. Content creators can benefit from the surge in short-form video, while marketers can capitalize on advanced product placements. In full, the report:  Forecasts SVOD subscribers in the APAC region. Explores the factors behind SVOD’s slowing growth in the US. Breaks down reasons why APAC is ripe for massive online video growth. Discusses who will benefit from SVOD growth in APAC.

A front-facing 3-D scanner could replace the home button, which could be phased out if Apple goes with a full-glass front this year, Hall wrote in a research note this week. Biometric facial scanning would be more secure for Apple Pay and could work better in "wet conditions" if the iPhones are more water resistant, JPMorgan wrote. Other industry watchers, like Gene Munster of Loup Ventures, have speculated that Apple is likely working on an augmented reality platform using 3-D sensors in phones. While this may eventually be true, JPMorgan expects the feature is more likely to be used with clothing sizing, home improvement measurements and scanning for 3-D printing. CNBC has reached out to Apple, which rarely announces product features before a new version is officially unveiled. Facial scanning would put Apple in the race with Google's Android platform, which has a "trusted face" security lock setting. It would cost about $10 or $15 per phone, Hall said, squaring with other analysts who have predicted it would be costly. Apple's sensor technology is also a valuable part of its intellectual property, Hall said. On Tuesday, Apple's chief financial officer Luca Maestri said that chips and sensors are among the most "strategic" and "important" Apple investments. — CNBC's Mack Hogan contributed to this report Anita BalakrishnanNews Associate Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change AAPL --- Binge 'Walking Dead' a megahit, thanks in part to white-knuckled binge-watchers By: Marc Gilbert, senior producer, CNBC Walking Dead producer: The phenomenon is no accident    Walking Dead producer: The show isn’t about zombies    Terminator writer sounds alarm on AI    Walking Dead producer: VR makes me nauseous

Position Last Quarter Berkshire Hathaway now has a 1% stake in the Mac maker. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Feb 15, 2017 at 9:44AM So much for that aversion to tech. The Oracle of Omaha made waves last year when Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) disclosed that it had picked up a cool $1 billion worth of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares, enough to scoop up 9.8 million shares. It's worth noting that this initial investment decision was not made by Buffett himself, but rather one of his lieutenants. Berkshire then proceeded to buy an additional 5.4 million shares in the second quarter of 2016, increasing its position to 15.2 million shares valued $1.5 billion at the time. There was no reported change in the number of shares during the third quarter, although Berkshire enjoyed some gains as shares rose. Berkshire has just filed its Form 13F for the fourth quarter, and it nearly quadrupled its Apple position. Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Berkshire is now sitting on 57.4 million shares of the Mac maker, valued at $6.6 billion at the end of last year. Not many investors can say this, but Buffett now has a 1% stake in Apple, which is a pretty tall order when we're talking about a $700 billion company. You can count on one hand the number of institutional investors that have a stake greater than or equal to Buffett's, and most of those are fund families that aggregate reported holdings across different funds. Apple was a big chunk of Buffett's buying spree In an interview with Charlie Rose a few weeks back, Buffett noted that Berkshire had acquired $12 billion in common stock in the wake of the election, which represented a significant increase in buying activity. In contrast, Berkshire bought approximately $10 billion worth of equities through all of 2015. Apple Store Third Street Promenade. Image source: Apple. While some of that $12 billion was seemingly purchased after the new year, and we don't know what prices Berkshire was buying Apple at, it's safe to say that a good chunk of that money was allocated to the Mac maker. Apple's average share price during the fourth quarter was right around $113, which would translate into $4.8 billion based on the additional 42.1 million shares purchased during the quarter. Of course, Buffett is far from a market timer, but with shares currently trading at all-time highs, the increased position is already faring quite well. Shares are already up 17% year to date, thanks in part to a record fourth-quarter earnings release. AAPL data by YCharts. Cash flow is one of Buffett's favorite investing metrics, particularly compared to figures like net income, which are subject to more qualitative judgments from management and more prone to manipulation in general. Apple has cash flow in spades, and currently has the largest cash position of any company ever. The tech titan generated over $65 billion in operating cash flow in 2016, of which $52 billion was free cash flow. If Buffett thinks Apple is undervalued enough to nearly quadruple Berkshire's position, he's probably on to something. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

 Apple fans and employees are 'ashamed' of Apple's new reality show, 'Planet of the Apps' Kif Leswing Feb. 14, 2017, 12:38 PM 29,230 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple Music Apple is breaking into original TV content, and the trailer for one of its first shows, "Planet of the Apps," was released Monday evening. And by a large margin, Apple fans — and even some employees — seem to hate it. The concept for the reality-TV show is something like "Shark Tank" meets "The Voice." App developers come up with ideas for apps, choose a celebrity mentor such as Will.i.am or Jessica Alba, and eventually win $10 million in funding from Lightspeed Venture Partners as well as premium placement on the front page of Apple's App Store. "Developers, they're the rock stars of right now," Will.i.am says in the trailer while wearing gold boots. One contestant gives the one-liner, "We're eBay for the Snapchat generation." The show will air exclusively on Apple Music. You can watch the trailer at the bottom of the page. Here's what the Apple world is saying about it: Paul Haddad, the developer of popular iOS apps including Tweetbot: I can’t wait to see https://t.co/50qeVJsNkW doing code review. “You’ve got an unsatisfiable layout constraint, look at my gold shoes!” — Paul Haddad (@tapbot_paul) February 14, 2017 Sam Soffes, who previously developed popular apps including the top Bible app: Got an email from Apple asking me to apply for this. So glad I passed. https://t.co/pOU0QTMMvB — Sam Soffes (@soffes) February 14, 2017 Realmac Software founder Dan Counsell: Apple should be producing amazing content like Netflix Originals does. Not this garbage. I am disappointed. — Dan Counsell (@dancounsell) February 14, 2017 Renaud Lienhart, the Home app developer at Apple: Today, I am ashamed to work for Apple. This is embarrassing, and not what we work hard for.https://t.co/9O5mjEGElm — Renaud Lienhart (@RenaudLienhart) February 14, 2017 Apple blogger and Instapaper founder Marco Arment: I’m sure Planet of the Apps will be a great show for all of those people who bug developers with their awful ideas. https://t.co/PORl3y4t1Y — Marco Arment (@marcoarment) February 14, 2017 Jake Frey, an app designer at Frey Labs: Devs: Hey the App Store has a few problems and its hard to be discovered. Can you take a look? Apple: Uh nope but that would make great TV! https://t.co/IjYAc58XLF — Jake Frey (@frey) February 14, 2017 Dermot Daly, the founder of Tapadoo, an iPhone app studio (Daly also wrote a Medium post): “Planet of the Apps. No. Just No”. https://t.co/Z67aaLH5xu (Typos, etc on a postcard to me please). — Dermot Daly (@dermdaly) February 14, 2017 But some are defending the show, pointing out that perhaps Apple fans and developers are not its target audience. Apple blogger Rene Ritchie: Planet of the Apps: Not intended for “us” but for the mainstream. Or, now “we” know how cooks have felt about Hell’s Kitchen for a decade. — Rene Ritchie 🖇 (@reneritchie) February 14, 2017 Watch the full trailer below:     SEE ALSO: Apple is at an all-time high More: Apple Apple Music Planet of the Apps Marco Arment Rene Ritchie Will.i.am Jessica Alba Lightspeed Ventures Lightspeed Venture Partners facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru Apple fans and employees are 'ashamed' of Apple's new reality show, 'Planet of the Apps' Apple fans and employees are 'ashamed' of Apple's new reality show, 'Planet of the Apps' Apple is breaking into original TV...

The only major winner last year, reports CNET, was Amazon, which doubled the number of tablets it sold – though Lenovo also saw a 12.3% growth to 10.9M sales. Despite the plunge in iPad sales, however, Apple comfortably retains its #1 slot in the market. Apple‘s iPad […] retained its top spot, selling 42 million devices to comfortably best Samsung. Samsung came in at a distant second place with 27 million tablets sold. Trendforce is predicting that iPad shipments will continue to fall this year, with a further slip in its market share, but that the damage will be minor. It is forecasting a slide in sales from 42.5M to 39.3M. With Samsung expected to experience a similar drop, Apple’s market share would be only marginally reduced, from 27% to 26.6%. The numbers back earlier ones from IDC and Strategy Analytics, which also give Apple a comfortable lead over Samsung and other players. Numbers differ, thanks in part to rather interchangeable use of sales and shipments, and also through different definitions of ‘tablet.’ Some analysts count two-in-one laptop/tablet devices while others don’t. Slow upgrade cycles are a significant factor in iPad sales, with the majority of even 9to5Mac readers – who likely upgrade more often than most – buying a new devices at 4+ year intervals. Apple is, however, fighting back with promotions and enterprise initiatives. Guides iPad What's next for Apple's iPad line?
