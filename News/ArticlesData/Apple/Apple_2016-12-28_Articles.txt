Follow TechnoBuffalo What do you want from the next iPhone? An OLED screen? An improved camera? Maybe the death of the home button? We don’t know what Apple intends to release next year but won’t stop people from dreaming. This iPhone 8 concept, released last week, imagines what Apple’s device would look like if fans were involved in the design process. Everything from a bezel-less display to Touch ID embedded in the display is featured, making us pine for what could be in next year’s release. What’s notable about this concept is the cues it takes from devices like the V10 and V20. Rather than a home button, the concept inserts a secondary display at the bottom—a Touch Bar if you want to stick with Apple’s preferred vernacular. You’ll never get this iPhone The problem with concepts is we’ll never see them come to fruition. As badly as we want this iPhone to exist, it won’t. Not only because it’s technologically unfeasible, but because Apple is slow to adopt new trends in the market. It’s unlikely we’ll see an iPhone with wireless charging for at least a few years. In fact, we’ve been hearing next year’s release will simply be a general follow-up to the iPhone 7, with the possibility of a new color. That’s about as far from this concept as you can get. The New Year is just around the corner, however, which means we’ll soon start seeing iPhone rumors pop up with greater frequency. In the meantime, check out the concept and yearn for what will never be.

Happy New Year firework wallpapers   skip to main content skip to main menu     Why Apple shouldn’t pass on the rumored Jet White iPhone 7 By Steffen Reich, Dec 30, 2016 Tweet 19 Comments On Tuesday, Apple afficionados were treated to a new wave of white shell iPhone 7 mock-ups and purported leaks hitting the internet, advancing the notion that the Cupertino-based company could plan to release a white counterpart to their Jet Black coating some time around March 2017. From an aesthetic standpoint, everyone is going to have their two cents on the necessity of it in the grand scheme of things. Simply by moving the discussion from the fashion sphere to the finance department though, the ambivalence in regard to whether or not this iPhone release is genuinely necessary quickly crumbles and clearly comes down on one side of the fence. As we will learn in late January, Apple’s first quarter of the fiscal year 2017 is going to look after itself nicely, but in view of the Q2 figures and a long summer following, Jet White definitely needs to happen. Two key reasons must be paid attention to in order to understand the imperative of a Jet White iPhone for a healthier bottom line in the fiscal year of 2017. Let’s kick this off by saying that by and large Apple is of course still flying incredibly high and unlike some, I am not going to exhibit the overbearing arrogance to tell you otherwise. With that out of the way, the Apple of late has seen quite a few hiccups and could be on the precipice of another negative record year. Yes the Q1 earnings report in January is going to look glorious for a variety of reasons (and good on Apple for that) with analysts predicting revenues of up to $76.96 billion – which would marginally best last year’s Q1 results – but that is hardly telling the whole story. The whole story namely comprises the fact Apple desperately needs that break, hopefully ending a negative streak of three quarters of year-over-year declines in revenue. The answer to whether or not this negative record can be broken we will learn soon enough, and does not hinge on the possible introduction of a Jet White iPhone 7 some time around March. Yet it is important to remember that in spite of the assumedly strong figures that will be published by the end of January, it is not all smooth sailing at Apple. The truth of the matter is that the drop from the beginning of the fiscal year 2017 to Q2 and Q3 could be steeper than ever, which is why the new coating would play a crucial role. Here are the two central points to substantiate my claim: Could this be the Jet White iPhone 7? pic.twitter.com/pHoDiZ63ON — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) December 27, 2016 The iPhone SE vacuum It somewhat befuddles me to think the iPhone SE happened this year, but it did see the light of day just this March. Accordingly, Apple had an absolute crowd pleaser in the pipeline for that critical Q2 spell following the holiday quarter. The SE succeeded at bolstering the sales revenue from March onwards, appealing to both Apple nostalgics and segments with less buying power. But where there is light, there is also plenty of shadow, because despite the additional revenue stream (let’s ignore product cannibalisation for simplicity), the drop in revenues from Q1’16 to Q2’16 has been appreciably steeper than the corresponding curve back in 2015. The graph following below visualises that by pitting quarterly revenues of the two years against each other. The green wedge is visible enough already, so just imagine the drop of the curve without the SE pulling its weight in 2016. What does that tell us about 2017? The gist is that not even the iPhone SE in 2016 could save Apple from continuing their quarterly year-over-year decline. Now imagine the additional revenue of a new introduction to the iPhone family in March breaking away altogether in 2017, and the impact this would have on the revenue curve. It is by no means a long shot to say that the dropout would be considerably worse than what we saw in April this year, when Apple reported a drop of $8 billion in revenue in year-over-year comparison for Q2 ($58bn in Q2’15 to $50bn in Q2’16). A white and shiny iPhone 7 fresh on the shelves to grab in March could counteract the trend of a back to back plummet in Q2. If Apple were to forfeit the chance of a white iPhone boost, I believe the Q2’17 numbers could dwindle down to a dismal $40 billion. Aside from the iPhone SE vacuum occurring in 2017, other variables need to be factored in to understand the seriousness of the descent we might face after peaking in late January: Apple Watch sales are still rocky (although we might get a glimpse of the potential of the Series 1 and 2 in January’s earnings report) and have gathered zero to negative momentum in 2016 (more on that later) and analysts are expecting the iPhone 7 euphoria to wane quicker than in previous years, eventuating in much lower shipment numbers in early 2017. With the shine coming off the iPhone 7 earlier than it did for its predecessors, the Jet White iPhone could be the lifeline Apple needs. Perhaps not to fully tide them over spring 2017, but at least to soften the blow. Botched product launches for Christmas No matter how hard Apple is going to try to put a spin on this, PR language can not gloss over the monumental fail the launch of the AirPods has been. At $159, the product must harvest margins that will make any Apple executive salivate. Add to it the fact that hundreds of millions of iPhone users are potential buyers and Apple really forewent a massive chunk of revenue for what they label ‘Other Products’. This category also contains Watch sales, which as touched on before evidently stagnated through 2016. I don’t mention the wearable at this point because I like to go off on a tangent, but rather because the slow rollout of Series 1 and 2 could be indicative of what the AirPods might suffer from as well: we do not know at what point AirPods are actually going to attain a fair market saturation, we are not privy to how bad the bottleneck situation is right now and how distant a future lies in which we can promenade into an Apple Store and grab a pair on a whim. The backlog could easily carry into Q2 and hamper the value of ‘Other Products’, which is going to be covered up by tremendous iPhone unit sales in Q1, but laid bare in Q2. Beats X are suffering an even grimmer fate, one where we know next to nothing about a possible release in 2017. Just like with the AirPods, this is going to be an accessory badly needed to counterbalance (as much as ‘Other Products’ worth $2-5 billion can offset dwindling iPhone sales) the sales revenue hit to be recorded in Q2’17. Besides, never mind the opportunity costs for Apple with those two big cash cows not providing the milk they could and should have if handled more professionally. As you can see in the data, ‘Other Products’ are a far cry from the worth of any other product category, even though they were designated to enjoy a huge growth spurt right about now. The botched launches are going to thwart that development for months into the fiscal year of 2017, again calling for an alternative product to iron out such shortcomings. This is again where the Jet White iPhone enters the scene, ideally coming to the rescue. In conclusion, those should be the two major motivations for Apple to launch Jet White in March. Another rather tongue in cheek point to consider is that the success story of iPhone 7 is in parts surely down to the simple fact that they were finally offered in new, black colors. Mind you, that is not to say the iPhone 7 boasted underwhelming specs, but at the end of the day visual stimuli often make or break purchase decisions. It has proven to work beautifully for iPhone 7 in 2016 and it would be smart business to make use of that strategy one more time next March.

Such a long essay for something so small Jay Fun fact. The iPhone 7 is merely a SE. 5, 5S, SE – same form factor, screen size with plenty of internal upgrades 6, 6S, 7 – copy & paste from above Nothing bad could come from releasing a new color, the more the merrier, and they would still sell plenty along with next years upgrade. MMA Rules Jay there’s a big difference from the 6 to the 7 in terms of internals, the 6 only had 1gb of ram and couldn’t even hold an app in the background plus camera, speed 3D Touch, etc. Same form factor though Jay The same difference from the 5 to the SE. The 7 is the iphone 6s’ “SE”. Im saying just how the se was completely reworked on the inside the 7 was reworked just as much from the 6, the fact the outside is still the same is my point of it being an SE. burge The SE was out before the 7 so the SE has nothing from the 7 in it. The SE has 5s, 6 and 6s parts Jay You missed the point. The 7 has iphone 6 screen resolution, form factor and external look on the front minus the headphone jack. burge And home button. You pointed out that the 7 is an SE of sorts. It’s not, Yes the 7 is not the device it should or could of been and apple have made a poor device but it’s not comparable to the SE at all. In spec wise you could class it with the 6s and that’s it. Jay I have a7, I upgraded from a 6. I also had a 5 and have personally used the SE. The upgrades internal feel the same. The home button isn’t really an upgrade from anything either. burge It feels the same because the devices operate exactly the same as each other. Be it on a bigger or smaller interface. The older devices are just a fraction slower on the newer OS. Yes the 7 is a poor device you’ll get no argument there from me, and I’m so glad that I didn’t purchase mine and it was a gift. The device itself looks fantastic but that’s about all I have to say about it. Mark S Well they need to do something for their slumping sales. zoLa siWisa Why are you worried though? burge It’s because thay get paid to do it. It’s called a job. Anonymous This is how dude gets paid. Just like what ever you do for a living. Shadowelite123 Technology is a beautiful thing. Business is also the same. No one is worshipping a phone except for the annoying fanboys you see for any kind of product. Like others have said, its a job they’re doing and whose to say that they dont love what they do? If they love what they do and they get paid for it too, isn’t that just as good as walking outside and smiling at the first three people you see? Do you not have any ambitions or dreams in your life? Natalie Whenever I see the word “Analyst” in any kind of tech related article I just wave it off as being f#cking obvious. These guys get paid to say “Apple will release a phone next year” Which is dumb in my opinion. Half the shit they say never comes to fruition anyway lol, Ignoring that stupid part of the article. It’s very possible that a Jet White iPhone is coming, Kinda makes sense ya know… Black, White, two colors that have been part of the iPhone line since the 2nd gen… You don’t need to be an Analyst to know that lol Shadowelite123 Thats not exactly true. Most things analysts say actually come to life. Rumors are separated into two categories: Analyst predictions and possibilities due to uncovered information such as patents and such. Not everything predicted will be guaranteed. This is because no one actually knows what will happen. Look at the sapphire glass screens we were supposed to see. Production was low and we weren’t able to see them come to life. Now GTAT is bankrupt i think. Things come up, thats life. We pretty much predicted nearly everything that the iPhone 7 models would have. Less than a handful of things didn’t show up. Gerardo Castro I still can’t shake the fact that this looks like a colorware or dbrand skin on a white iPhone… h4nd0fg0d This comment section- up there with some of the dumbest of all time… Charles Finally someone said it “jet white”, who has seen or been on a black jet, prior to the stealth projects?

If not, you are part of the reason the market for wearables, an umbrella term that typically encompasses smartwatches and fitness trackers, has struggled to fully take off. The third quarter, ending in October, was especially unkind to Apple Watch sales. Apple (AAPL) shipped about 1 million Apple Watches in the quarter, according to research firm IDC, a 70% drop compared to the year before. Apple was in fact the only manufacturer to lose market share in wearables in the quarter. Apple Watch Series 2 (Getty) Apple CEO Tim Cook told Reuters that things are looking up for the end of the year, and that the fourth quarter will be the “best quarter ever for Apple Watch” thanks to the holidays and the release of the Series 2. Fitbit, on the other hand, has forecast a weaker holiday season than expected, even amidst double-digit growth for fitness trackers in the third quarter. And Pebble, a once-hot smartwatch that grabbed headlines for raising $10 million via Kickstarter, unceremoniously sold itself to Fitbit this month. Fitbit (FIT) only wants the “software assets” and will discontinue the Pebble hardware. I don't mind that #pebble was acquired by #fitbit…but ceasing 1to1 support and not honouring backers is just wrong #pebblexfitbit — Isikeli (@engine13nz) December 7, 2016 Make no mistake: The short-term future for the entire $20 billion wearables market is not sunny unless the leading manufacturers innovate, and fast. Graphiq Common complaints about smartwatches Those consumers who have held off on buying a smartwatch or fitness tracker thus far tend to have one of three complaints, says Ramon Llamas, wearables researcher for IDC. Many watches must be in range of a smartphone. Llamas points to Samsung’s Gear S2 watch as a rare exception. Indeed, this is one of the big limitations with the new Nike+ Apple Watch Series 2: many of its most exciting features only work when your iPhone is nearby, which defeats the purpose of running with the watch in place of your phone. Where are the apps? In too many instances, the apps that come loaded onto smartwatches are just modified versions of smartphone apps. “I go back to smartphones, years ago,” Llamas says, “when I would say, You can’t just take your PC apps and shoehorn them into the smartphone. And that’s what’s happening over here.” Many people are bullish on smartwatches for the entertainment, shopping, and social networking possibilities. But the great apps for these purposes haven’t manifested yet. There’s still a style hurdle. “People want their watch to look like a watch,” Llamas says. Many consumers IDC has surveyed say they’d be interested in a smartwatch for the tech capabilities, but aren’t ready to replace their traditional everyday watch with something that looks like a tech device. (This is my own complaint as well.) A note of optimism “Wearables are dead,” declared Business Insider last week, pointing to the Pebble sale, the delay of Google’s next Android Wear smartwatch, and Motorola halting its smartwatch plans as evidence. Not so fast, says IDC. “The market has taken baby steps,” says Llamas. “But I’m not forecasting doom and gloom.” The third quarter was a time of “out-of-cycle refreshment,” he says, chalking it up to “growing pains.” Many have suggested that wearable devices may have been a short-lived fad all along. If you include wearable camera maker GoPro under the wearables umbrella, you have another example; its sales have dropped and its stock (GPRO) is down 49% this year. Fitbit, despite market share gains, is down 74% this year. But it would only be a fad, Llamas argues, “if what we have now is the end all, be all in wearables.” All of the major wearable makers know they must innovate and update. “This market is going to continue to change, and it’s changing in the right direction,” Llamas says. “I have to preach patience here.” Apple still has the biggest piece of the smartwatch market in the US, though Samsung is very close behind. But if you expand the pie to all “wearables,” Fitbit is No. 1, then Samsung, then Garmin, and Apple is in fourth. In the global wearables market, China’s Xiaomi, maker of the Mi Band, pops up at No. 2. Graphiq It makes sense that Apple would only be fourth when the pool includes Fitbit; Apple only makes smartwatches. It is also a reminder that the term “wearables” is so broad as to include two types of devices that perhaps should not be lumped together: smartwatches and fitness trackers. If Tim Cook’s big promises about the holiday season prove true and the Apple Watch Series 2 is a hit, the Apple Watch’s weak third quarter will be forgotten. But Apple can’t keep cruising in smartwatches if it only sells them at Christmas. Its future versions will need to address those three popular complaints in order to convert the skeptics. — Daniel Roberts is a writer at Yahoo Finance, covering sports business and technology.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « In Apple's Wearable Device Universe you'll one day wear a Mini iPhone, iPod or Medical Device on your Wrist | Main | Production of Apple's AirPods goes into High Gear in Multiple Shanghai Plants to Meet Consumer Demand » December 29, 2016 Family Sues Apple for not using a patented iOS Feature Designed to shut Off Certain Apps while Driving   According to a new Courthouse news report published late yesterday, "A family grieving the death of their young daughter wants Apple held accountable for encouraging distracted driving with its FaceTime app, in a lawsuit filed Friday in Santa Clara County Superior Court.   James and Bethany Modisette claim the tech giant and smartphone manufacturer had the patent for a safer version of its 'FaceTime' video calling app, but elected to make the less safe version available with the iPhone 6 – ultimately resulting in the death of their daughter."   The Modisette family further stated in their court filing that "Apple is responsible for their daughter's death because of its "failure to install and implement the safer, alternative design for which it sought a patent in December 2008 (later issued by the United States Patent Office in April 2014) to 'lock out' the ability of drivers to utilize the 'FaceTime' application on the Apple iPhone when driving a motor vehicle, which resulted in the injuries sustained by plaintiffs." .   The dispute arises from events that occurred on Dec. 24, 2014, when the Modisettes and their daughters Isabella and Moriah in their car on Interstate I-35 just north of Dallas.   James Modisette slowed due to traffic caused by an accident and a strong police presence. A vehicle slammed into the family's car, severely injuring both James and Moriah, who was 5 years old at the time.   Emergency workers extracted James and Moriah from the car, and had to work strenuously due to the severity of the damage. Both were flown to local hospitals and Moriah eventually died from the injuries she suffered in the wreck.   The driver who hit the family told police he was on the FaceTime application at the time of the wreck. Officers found FaceTime was still live when they arrived at the scene, according to the complaint.   The Modisette family said Apple's failure to either program a shutoff into the FaceTime program or give strong warning about using the app while driving is particularly egregious given the app fully engages visual components rather than audio ones as with regular cellphone usage.   "Defendant Apple Inc. has had the technology to prevent these events, and the Modisettes' injuries, specifically since at least Dec. 12, 2008, when it filed an application with the U.S. Patent Office for a 'driver handheld computing device lock-out," the family says in the complaint.   Noted below are patent figures from the Apple patent that is noted in the Modisette family's court filing. Apple's patent FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary vehicle with unsafe and safe operating areas according to one embodiment of the invention; FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary process in which a handheld computing device can provide a lock-out mechanism; and FIG 4 illustrates an exemplary process in which a vehicle can provide a lock-out mechanism. It should be noted that the color coding found in FIG. 1 was done by Patently Apple to clearly demark the two areas that Apple points out in FIG. 1 OF Unsafe and Safe.     Patently Apple reviewed the patent in question and notes that Apple's patent states the following:   "Embodiments of the invention relate to disabling the ability of a handheld computing device to perform certain functions, such as texting, while one is driving.   An opportunity exists for handheld computing device makers to put into place a lock-out mechanism to disable the input and, possibly, the reception of text messages while the user is driving.   The achievement of such a mechanism may be a significant selling point in the eyes of concerned parents, and it could lead to legislation that would require all handheld computing devices to disable texting while driving.   Although some embodiments of this invention may be described and illustrated herein in terms of a lock-out mechanism to disable text messaging, it should be understood that embodiments of this invention are not so limited, but are generally applicable to disabling any function of a handheld computing device that may interfere with the safe operation of a vehicle by a driver, such as receiving or placing cellular telephone calls without a hands-free device, for example. "   For the record, while the patent does mention "any function of a handheld computing device that may interfere with a safe operation of a vehicle by a driver," it doesn't mention any particular app by its particular known branding and specifically it doesn't single out FaceTime as is mentioned in the Modisette's court filing.    The Courthouse news report further noted that "Specifically, the family says Apple possessed the capability to use GPS tracking to gauge the speed of a vehicle in which a user was traveling and shut down FaceTime, but that its failure to include this technology was a significant factor in the crash that injured the Modisette family.   Apple did not return an email seeking comment by press time.   The family seeks economic damages related to the injuries suffered in the crash, along with punitive damages.   About Comments: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit comments.

We've already heard some rumors saying the Korean company will once again emulate Apple and ditch the analog connector, and today a new report might have confirmed that. Not directly, though. Samsung is now said to be launching wireless in-ear headphones alongside the Galaxy S8, whenever the smartphone becomes official. It's still unclear whether these will be bundled with the smartphone, or sold separately (or both). The rumor also doesn't explicitly say we're talking about truly wireless headphones, like Samsung's own Gear IconX or Apple's AirPods. However, it does claim that Samsung really wants to put out a product to compete with the AirPods, so we assume these could be truly wireless after all. Harman audio tech may be inside the headphones, but probably won't, since Samsung's acquisition of Harman has happened recently and the headphones were probably already in development by then. So while this rumor doesn't directly say that the Galaxy S8 will be devoid of a 3.5mm headset jack, that sure is implied by Samsung's alleged plan to unveil wireless headphones alongside its next flagship handset. It may once again do what Apple did, and try to soften the blow of the missing port by presenting the world its own AirPods alternatives.

Well, here we go. According to some unnamed "Taiwan-based supply chain makers", Apple will release not two, but three new iPhone models next year. The usual 4.7" and 5.5" sizes will come with LCD screens just like every single one of their predecessors. However, a new 5.8-inch model will be outed too, and this one will feature an AMOLED display. Samsung will be the sole supplier of those AMOLED panels for what will certainly be Apple's highest-end (and most expensive) iPhone ever. The Korean company can reportedly supply a maximum of 20 million such panels per month to Apple. Global shipments of the 5.8" AMOLED iPhone are estimated by the aforementioned sources at around 60-70 million units for 2017. This report goes on to say that Nissha Printing of Japan will supply the touch sensors for use with Samsung's AMOLEDs, while the bonding of the touch sensors with the display panels will be undertaken either by Samsung Display, or by Taiwan-based TPK Holding and General Interface Solution. Apple's suppliers are set to start production for the next iPhones in small volumes in March, increasing their output in May-June so that there will be enough units to meet demand when they go on sale in the fall. As usual, take such reports with a dose of skepticism - even if this particular one does rehash things we've heard before. It's still pretty early in the new iPhones' development cycle, and even if all this information is true, things can still change until the handsets become official.

James and Bethany Modisette say Apple was granted a patent in 2014 for a FaceTime design that would’ve used GPS tracking to determine speed of travel to prevent people from using the app while driving, reports Courthouse News. Moriah Modisette, 5, died in a fatal car accident on Christmas Eve in 2014. (GoFundMe) Yet Apple never implemented the design, nor did it strongly warn drivers against using the app, per the lawsuit filed Friday. As a result, Garrett Wilhelm, 22, was able to use FaceTime while driving 65mph on Interstate I-35 near Dallas on Christmas Eve in 2014, when he slammed into the back of the Modisettes’ vehicle, which had slowed with other vehicles because of a traffic accident, say police. Wilhelm’s vehicle rolled “up and over the driver’s side of the Modisette car,” the lawsuit states. Driver James and 5-year-old Moriah, seated behind him, were both critically injured. James, Bethany, and 8-year-old daughter Isabella were taken by ambulance to Denton Regional Medical Center, along with Wilhelm, while Moriah was airlifted to Cook Children’s Medical Center in Fort Worth, where she died of her injuries, reports the Denton Record-Chronicle. Wilhelm—whose FaceTime app was still active when officers arrived on the scene, say police—now faces a manslaughter charge. But Apple’s failures “were a substantial factor in causing the plaintiffs’ injuries and decedent’s death,” the lawsuit states. Apple has not responded. (This woman was on FaceTime when a deadly tornado struck.)

Sueing Apple is just a way for the parents to get some easy money. They should be blaming THE DRIVER not a company! December 29, 2016 at 5:32 pm Reply Report comment wesm6 I agree with Ms. Cooper, that this is not Apple’s fault. Nor, should it be Apple’s responsibility. This other driver made the decisions that day. I do not believe anyone from Apple showed up at this other person’s house and forced him to use this app while driving in Dallas traffic. I mean, if we are going to go down this rabbit hole, then what kind of car was he driving? Perhaps, the family should also sue the car maker for making the car that he was driving as well. It was a senseless accident and with a very tragic ending, but it was only the other driver’s fault. January 1, 2017 at 2:25 pm Reply Report comment Mercy Healthwatch Your latest health news.

After its AirPods were mercilessly mocked at their debut in September, and after weeks of delay on their availability, Tim Cook says that the wireless headphones are a "runaway success." Cook had been touring the New York Stock Exchange with his nephew on Wednesday when reporters from CNBC asked him how the AirPods were doing. The $159 headphones were put on back order within hours after their release on December 13, and they've taken off to become a holiday hit, Apple's CEO noted. Buyers will have to wait up to six weeks for their AirPods to ship out.  "We're making them just as fast as we can," Cook told reporters. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The AirPods are available in more than 100 countries, including the US, the UK, Canada, Mexico, China, France, India and Japan -- all places where customers will have to wait more than a month for the hyped headphones as Apple pushes to meet demands. The holiday season appears to have been kind to Apple. Cook earlier noted the Apple Watch was on track for its best quarter yet as "one of the most popular holiday gifts this year." Apple hasn't released any sales data for its AirPods or its smartwatch. If you're thinking of getting a pair for yourself -- and don't mind the wait -- here's our review of the AirPods.

There are still bright spots, like the company's growing services business, and the company is still making insane amounts of money. Even so, the stalled growth has to be concerning to both the company and its investors. Don't get me wrong, I'm not here to pity Apple. I'm here to commiserate with its fans, the ones who Apple shafted this year. Particularly those of us who waited all year long for a substantial update to the Mac lineup only to be offered a pair of intriguing but compromised new laptops. Or those of us who bought an iPhone 7 and can't use the headphones included with it in our new MacBook Pro, or even those of us trying to figure out which iPad to buy. Across the board, Apple has confusing product lineups with weird and unnecessary compromises. And if you believe the wailing of aggrieved fans across the internet, it seems like plenty of loyal Apple supporters might be contemplating life outside the company's ecosystem. How did we get here? The product that most exemplifies Apple's difficulty in 2016 is the Mac. The Mac may only compose a small part of Apple's overall business, but that doesn't excuse the neglect it's endured recently. For 10 full months, the only update was a processor refresh on the 12-inch MacBook. (OK, you can also buy it in pink now. Thanks, Apple.) The company's main three machines -- the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and iMac -- went untouched. That's still the case for the iMac and MacBook Air; it's hard to recommend that anyone buy them right now. And we all know what happened when the MacBook Pro was finally updated: A portal to the dongleverse was opened. Yes, Apple had already released the 12-inch MacBook with just a single USB-C port. But that computer was designed with extreme portability in mind; it was a laptop inspired by the iPad. It'll likely take the aging MacBook Air's place in the lineup as the company's entry-level Apple laptop. That was fine when the MacBook Pro and its many ports existed, but Apple has now made it clear it's not interested in keeping any legacy I/O around, even for its "pro" customers. That's an aggressive move, and one that has been met with widespread displeasure. In a vacuum, there are plenty of things to like about the new MacBook Pro. The screen is excellent, the reductions in size and weight are welcome improvements, performance and audio quality are both improved, and even the controversial Touch Bar has potential. Other things, such as the redesigned keyboard, are a matter of personal preference, not a definitive drawback. But reduced battery life, the loss of physical function keys and only one type of port mean that many of the professionals Apple is targeting will need to change their workflow. And that's not even mentioning the price increases: It'll cost you at least $1,799 to get a MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar. History suggests that prices of the new MacBook Pro will eventually drop as the old models are phased out, but there's still some significant sticker shock here. This confusing middle ground between old and new makes it hard to decide which MacBook Pro is the best for a given shopper. Is your $1,499 better spent on the previous-generation model or the new one? If you opt for the new model, you get a piddly two ports and no Touch Bar, while opting for last year's computer gets you all the ports you could want but in a heavier package with an older processor and worse screen. My guess is that lots of people will decide not to make a purchase instead of being forced to compromise one way or another. The new entry-level MacBook Pro would be a great step up from the MacBook Air for a lot of users -- but the $500 separating the two computers is a difficult gap to close. The most frustrating thing about all of this is that Apple could have silenced its critics by simply including a USB 3 port and not removing the SD reader. Space may be at a premium on this new device, but I'd be willing to bet that many potential buyers would be happy to give up two of the four USB-C ports in exchange for those legacy connections. But that wouldn't be a "courageous" move now, would it? Hell, Apple could even throw us the smallest of bones by including a USB 3 to USB-C dongle in the box so users can charge their iPhones without any further hassle. Speaking of the iPhone, let's go over that headphone situation one more time. Putting aside Schiller's ridiculous "courage" line, it's not unreasonable to wonder if we can evolve beyond the headphone jack. No other port has been immune to the march of time, and Apple probably has the data to show that most iPhone buyers use the included headphones. In theory, switching to the included Lightning headphones wouldn't be a big deal, and there's a dongle in there if you have a nice pair you want to keep using. What's the harm? Just as with the MacBook Pro, the problem is making consumers change their routines without a clear benefit. Apple executives gave a few rare interviews about the headphone jack decision when the iPhone 7 first came out, but the rationale mostly came down to using the limited space inside the iPhone for more useful technology, such as water resistance, a bigger battery and better cameras. Those are indeed great features to add to the iPhone. But they're also table stakes at this point. It's easy to forget that before the Galaxy Note 7 started exploding, Samsung had closed basically all the hardware gaps between its offerings and the iPhone, which means these updates were necessary, not revolutionary. And without also presenting an improved headphone solution, it's hard to not feel like something was lost in this move. Adding insult to injury, Apple did come up with an improved wireless-headphone experience: AirPods are much simpler to use than your average Bluetooth headset. But the price and mediocre audio quality make them a tough sell, and Apple didn't even manage to have the headphones out on time. They only just hit the Apple Store a few weeks ago, and they'll be in short supply for a good long time. They should have been ready to go alongside the iPhone 7, but Apple's latest handset has been on the market for nearly three months without its companion wireless earphones. That's a major tactical blunder. Many of Apple's more fervent supporters have scoffed at the notion that Apple is floundering a bit. After all, the company's bottom line grew for 15 years: It clearly knows how to build products that resonate. But there's been a growing chorus of unhappy fans who say that Apple doesn't have the same eye for detail as it used to. Some point to the goofy charging experiences for the new Apple Mouse and Pencil as design decisions that Steve Jobs never would have allowed. For me, it's this new world of dongles that I'd have to use to make a new MacBook Pro work the way I need it to. Something isn't right when the MacBook Air, which hasn't substantially changed in design for five years, is still better for my needs than the brand-new MacBook Pro. I'd happily open my wallet and pay $1,799 for that new computer if it had an SD slot and a full-sized USB port. Part of me feels like those are tiny things to quibble over when weighed against the improvements -- I'm dying for a better display at this point -- but we all have to draw the line somewhere. For others, that line might be the missing headphone jack, the late AirPods, the lack of substantial Mac updates (the Mac Pro hasn't been touched for three years), the confusing iPad lineup, the lackluster Apple Watch reception or any other chink in Apple's armor. Apple fans were sold on the promise that "it just works." When that stops being the case, it's much easier to start looking at competitors like Microsoft and Google. And that won't help Apple make 2017 a better year. Check out all of Engadget's year-in-review coverage right here.

Government officers race around wooden pallets piled high with boxes — counting, weighing, scanning and approving shipments. Unmarked trucks stretch for more than a mile awaiting the next load headed for Beijing, New York, London and dozens of other destinations. The state-of-the-art facility was built several years ago to serve a single global exporter: Apple, now the world’s most valuable company and one of China’s largest retailers. The well-choreographed customs routine is part of a hidden bounty of perks, tax breaks and subsidies in China that supports the world’s biggest iPhone factory, according to confidential government records reviewed by the New York Times, as well as more than 100 interviews with factory workers, logistics handlers, truck drivers, tax specialists and current and former Apple executives. The package of sweeteners and incentives, worth billions of dollars, is central to the production of the iPhone, Apple’s best-selling and most profitable product. It all centers on Zhengzhou, a city of 6 million people in an impoverished region. Running at full tilt, the factory here, owned and operated by Apple’s manufacturing partner Foxconn, can produce 500,000 iPhones a day. Locals now refer to Zhengzhou as “iPhone City.” The local government has proved instrumental, doling out more than $1.5 billion to Foxconn to build large sections of the factory and nearby employee housing. It paved roads and built power plants. It helps cover continuing energy and transportation costs for the operation. It recruits workers for the assembly line. It pays bonuses to the factory for meeting export targets. All of it in support of iPhone production. “We needed something that could really develop this part of the country,” said Li Ziqiang, a Zhengzhou official. “There’s an old saying in China: ‘If you build the nest, the birds will come.’ And now, they’re coming.” U.S. officials have long decried China’s support of its state-owned companies, calling the subsidies and other aid an unfair competitive advantage in a global marketplace. But the Zhengzhou operation shows the extent of China’s effort to entice overseas multinationals to set up production in the country. Local and provincial officials have courted manufacturers with incentive packages that make it easier and cheaper to do business. Beijing, for decades, has encouraged such efforts at the national level, by developing special economic zones that offer tax breaks to multinationals and exempt them from costly and cumbersome rules. In this way, China is not unlike other countries, including the United States, where states and cities vie for companies. To compete in the era of globalization, multinationals, which face pressures from shareholders and customers, must seek the best opportunities, increasingly by relying on a highly interconnected supply chain spread across the world. In China, the competition for companies is secretive and rarely exposed to public scrutiny or debate — and it is often focused on manufacturing partners, rather than multinationals themselves. While Apple came later than many technology companies, it now generates nearly a quarter of its revenues from sales in China and has some of the fattest profit margins in the business. As such, the Zhengzhou operation provides an especially illustrative look at China’s importance to U.S. technology companies — and specifically iPhone production and, more recently, Apple’s consumer sales. A 32-gigabyte iPhone 7 costs an estimated $400 to produce. It retails for roughly $649 in the United States, with Apple taking a piece of the difference as profit. The result: Apple manages to earn 90 percent of the profit in the smartphone industry worldwide, even though it accounts for only 12 percent of the sales, according to Strategy Analytics, a research firm. It is difficult to tally the total value of government benefits for the Zhengzhou operation or to determine the exact effect on the profit of Foxconn or Apple. The subsidies aren’t disclosed by the Chinese government or Foxconn. They aren’t available in public records. And Apple says it was not a party to Foxconn’s negotiations. As China’s largest private employer, Foxconn, a Taiwanese company, has enormous leverage in the negotiations for those incentives. The company’s size and scale is connected to Apple. Foxconn is Apple’s largest supplier. Apple is Foxconn’s largest customer. The two companies are intertwined in Zhengzhou. When the factory opened, Apple was Foxconn’s only customer here. Even now, the U.S. technology company accounts for almost all of the production at the Zhengzhou plant, where about half of the world’s iPhones are made. Apple is also the main exporter using the customs facility here. A growing backlash against globalization puts Apple and other big multinationals directly in the sight lines of two increasingly combative giants: the United States and China. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to bring down the full force of the government on U.S. companies that move jobs overseas, threatening punitive tariffs on the goods they sell back at home. Apple has been a frequent target of Trump. China, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, is growing less tolerant and more suspicious of Western influence, particularly U.S. technology companies and the huge influence they have over Chinese consumers. A state-owned publication called Apple one of the “guardian warriors” that have “seamlessly penetrated” China and may pose a threat to national security. China, no longer content with just being the world’s factory floor, is moving aggressively to develop its own technology giants. Beijing is pressuring local governments to cut subsidies that the country encouraged just a few years ago. And big exporters, courted and protected for decades by Beijing, now face broad scrutiny. Regulators shut down Apple’s iTunes Movies and iBooks Store last spring. The Chinese authorities fined the Cupertino company for failing to pay taxes. And Apple went through a national security review in China for the iPhone 6, delaying its release in the country. Apple is now engaged in the corporate version of shuttle diplomacy. In December, CEO Tim Cook, along with other Silicon Valley executives, met with Trump in New York, part of an effort to build bridges with the incoming administration. It followed a similar goodwill tour in China in August, when Cook sat down with the country’s vice premier at Zhongnanhai, the government’s walled leadership compound in what was once part of Beijing’s Imperial City. The two countries are playing a high-stakes game. Apple, like many multinationals, depends on a vast global supply chain that includes multiple companies and countries, each with its own expertise and advantages — a complexity that is often lost in the political debate over trade. The iPhone is a collection of intricate parts that are made around the world and assembled in China, spurring employment in many countries; Apple says it supports 2 million jobs in the United States. As China and the United States both brandish a new form of economic nationalism, they risk disrupting the system, without necessarily achieving their goals. And multinationals and their manufacturing partners would face serious financial trade-offs. As the Zhengzhou operation shows, China not only provides a large pool of labor; it also offers incentives that would be difficult to replicate in the United States or anywhere else. The benefits in Zhengzhou flow through the production process for the iPhone, from the factory floor to the retail store. Foxconn receives a bonus when it meets targets for exports. Those subsidies, according to the government records, totaled $56 million in the first two years of production, when the factory was exclusively dedicated to the iPhone. The Zhengzhou government eliminated corporate taxes and value-added taxes that Foxconn pays for the first five years of production; they are half the usual rate for the next five. The city lowered Foxconn’s social insurance and other payments for workers, by up to $100 million a year. The customs operation is also in a so-called bonded zone, an area that China essentially considers foreign soil, subject to different import and export rules. This setup allows Apple to sell iPhones more easily to Chinese consumers. Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

Don't Miss: Google’s Pixel copied more than just the iPhone’s design The accident in question occurred on December 24 when the Modisette family was blindsided by a distracted driver who, instead of paying attention to the road, was engaged in a Facetime call. Originally spotted by Courthouse News, the lawsuit claims that Apple should be held responsible for the crash because the company’s Facetime app doesn’t incorporate a “lock out” feature that could have prevented the offending driver from using it while in the car. The Modisette family said Apple’s failure to either program a shutoff into the FaceTime program or give strong warning about using the app while driving is particularly egregious given the app fully engages visual components rather than audio ones as with regular cellphone usage. What’s more, the lawsuit points out that Apple has the technology to incorporate such a feature, as evidenced by a pertinent software patent originally filed by the company in 2008. Similar to arguments we’ve seen with respect to texting, the lawsuit argues that an iPhone’s GPS functionality can easily detect when a device is being used in a car and that the Facetime app should be locked down in such scenarios. Without downplaying the tragedy in any regard, this lawsuit isn’t likely to go anywhere. The distracted driver could have just as easily taken his eyes off the road while watching Netflix, texting, or checking his email etc. Apple may have deep pockets, but it’s hard to assign blame to anyone here aside from the driver of the car.

Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Dec 29, 2016 at 2:30PM iPhone final inspection in China. Image source: Apple. Domestic manufacturing and the related jobs was one of the pillars of President-elect Donald Trump's campaign. Following his victory nearly two months ago, the pressure is now on to deliver to his voters and supporters, even if most of the reasons why U.S. manufacturing has declined are out of his control. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is, and has always been, an easy political target, given its sheer size and the fact that it's common knowledge that iPhones are assembled in China. Trump has vaguely offered Apple incentives to bring manufacturing jobs back, and while Apple and Foxconn are considering the idea, there are many hurdles that are arguably impossible to overcome. If anything, the company would likely rather kill U.S. manufacturing if it could, including its last vestige of domestic assembly, the Mac Pro. A couple of recent reports further underscore why Apple would be unable to bring iPhone production stateside, at least in any meaningful way beyond small political gestures (like the Mac Pro was, which is already a financial and operational headache for the company). We built this city on rock and roll (and incentives) Trump may tout that he's the most tremendous dealmaker in the observable universe, but The New York Times just published a must-read investigative report today detailing how China wooed Foxconn -- and by proxy, Apple -- with incentives worth billions of dollars. The local government in Zhengzhou offers a wide range of ongoing incentives that support Foxconn's iPhone manufacturing facility in the city that churns out half a million iPhones daily, earning Zhengzhou the nickname of "iPhone City." Approximately half of all iPhones are made in the city. iPhones aren't the only Apple products assembled in China. Image source: Apple. The details were discovered through confidential government records that the Times got a hold of. Apple says it knows that the government provides some level of support, but says it doesn't know the specifics surrounding the incentives that Foxconn has scored. Here's a key sentence in the report that might rain on Trump's parade: "As the Zhengzhou operation shows, China not only provides a large pool of labor; it also offers incentives that would be difficult to replicate in the United States or anywhere else." Who's coming with me? A separate report from qq (via DIGITIMES) yesterday points out that even if Apple and Foxconn wanted to move manufacturing to the U.S. in any non-trivial sense, many of the suppliers and component manufacturers would not be willing to follow suit. It's well known that the global consumer electronics supply chain is heavily concentrated in Asia, with manufacturing and assembly being but part of the value chain. A map of Apple's suppliers by geography. All those Asian suppliers aren't moving halfway across the world. Image source: Apple. For these smaller companies, the prospect of expanding in the U.S. would be prohibitively expensive due to higher labor costs, operating costs, and regulatory costs given the U.S.'s more stringent environmental regulations. There are also concerns around the demographics of the labor pool, with Chinese workers typically being younger than their U.S. counterparts. One of the key benefits of assembling in China is the close proximity to suppliers, which dramatically simplifies operations and reduces logistics costs. It also allows for flexibility to tweak and adapt manufacturing processes as challenges arise. So don't expect Apple to start bringing those jobs back en masse. Sorry, Trump.

Adam Levy (adamlevy) Dec 29, 2016 at 3:08PM Image source: Fitbit. The wearables market isn't growing as analysts originally anticipated. Last quarter, unit sales across the entire market grew just 3% year over year, according to IDC. That's quite a slowdown from the first quarter of the year, when wearable unit sales increased 67%. Part of the slowdown in sales may have been the anticipated release of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch Series 2, which delayed some purchases into the fourth quarter. Smartwatch sales in general lagged in 2016, as simpler fitness trackers like Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) devices continue to grow. Here are the five best-selling wearable device brands of 2016, based on data through the first three quarters. Fitbit Fitbit's brand is synonymous with fitness trackers. Its strong brand, combined with the company's wide lineup of devices with varying functionality and price points, allowed it to dominate the wearable market in 2016. Through the first three quarters of the year, Fitbit sold 15.8 million wearable devices, according to data from IDC Research. Fitbit released several new devices in 2016. It launched its Alta and Blaze lines in the first quarter. Both sold extremely well through the first three quarters of the year, accounting for the majority of Fitbit's revenue in the first half of the year. In the third quarter Fitbit added refreshes of the Charge and Flex devices to its lineup, bolstering unit sales 11% for the quarter. Some of Fitbit's biggest opportunities for growth are abroad. It's growing well in Europe, as CEO James Park points out. "The population of the five largest countries -- Germany, France, the U.K., Italy and Spain -- equals the approximate size of the U.S., but less than 15% of our total devices sold today," he told analysts on Fitbit's third-quarter earnings call. Fitbit has struggled to penetrate the large market in Asia, though. Xiaomi Xiaomi may be to blame for Fitbit's struggles in Asia. The Chinese electronics maker released an update to its Mi Band this year to include a heart-rate sensor and a few other upgrades, and it's managed to keep the price point below $20 (in U.S. dollars) in its home country. For reference, Fitbit's average selling price was $93 last quarter. Xiaomi's dominance is mostly confined to China, where it also holds a substantial share of the smartphone market. Xiaomi is working to extend its brand throughout Asia, particularly in large emerging markets like India. The company should continue to dominate the low-end wearable device category in the region, as it uses inexpensive wearables to improve its brand recognition. Garmin Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) offers a range of wearable devices catered toward specific sports like golf, swimming, and cycling. It also offers generic fitness trackers like many of Fitbit's or Xiaomi's, as well as high-end smartwatches like the Apple Watch. Garmin's high-end "fenix" line of smartwatches boosted sales of its wearables this year. Smartwatches accounted for nearly half of Garmin's wearable sales last quarter, offsetting declines in unit shipments for its more basic wearables. Garmin is also expanding developer support for its Connect IQ app store. Its high-end devices, like Apple's, benefit from the additional functionality offered by third-party support. As Garmin expands its number of smartwatch designs and the number of apps in Connect IQ, smartwatches should continue to grow as a share of the company's wearable sales. Apple It took over a year for Apple to refresh the Apple Watch, and that ultimately cost it in sales. Sales declined 57% in the second quarter and 71% in the third quarter, after lapping the April 2015 launch of the original Apple Watch. The release of the Apple Watch Series 2 at the end of September was unable to save third-quarter sales; the smartwatch leader sold 1.1 million units in the third quarter, according to IDC. CEO Tim Cook responded to IDC's report by telling Reuters, "We're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch." While he didn't provide any exact sales figures, he said, "During the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history." (Sell-through is a measure of how many units actually reach consumers, instead of just store shelves.) If Apple does indeed have its best quarter ever of Apple Watch sales, it will (based on IDC estimates) sell over 4.1 million units. Samsung Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) managed to grab the fifth-place position in 2016. Its Gear S2 smartwatch differentiates itself with built-in cellular connectivity, so it doesn't need to be connected to a smartphone to access internet-enabled apps. Samsung also benefited from bundling its newest Gear Fit model with its line of smartphones, including the Galaxy Note 7. Despite the recall of the Note 7, customers were able to keep their discounted smartwatches, which inflated unit sales somewhat. Low-end devices like the Gear Fit, which compete with Fitbit devices, accounted for all of Samsung's unit growth in the third quarter. Early days Smartwatches have fallen out of favor recently as basic wearables pick up the slack. IDC expects the market to more than double by 2020, and smartwatches could play a major role in that growth. Two main factors will impact the growth of smartwatches over lower-end fitness bands. First, the introduction of cellular connectivity in more devices will make them more useful as independent devices. Second, the growth of third-party developer support will produce functionality that exceeds simpler fitness bands. All five companies listed here are poised to take advantage of further growth in smartwatches if and when they take off, but Apple lacks a low-end fitness band to protect against a lack of consumer interest in that market segment.

Wistron, a Taiwanese OEM maker for Apple, is setting up a facility in Peenya, the city's industrial hub, to manufacture the iPhones. The facility will start production from next April, according to industry sources. Top sources in the company confirmed to TOI that Apple is "very serious" about beginning assembly operations —and thereafter full manufacture — in India by the end of next year. "Bangalore is being looked at seriously," said multiple sources within the company. Local manufacture will help Apple price its phones competitively as full imports attract 12.5% additional duty. Foxconn, Apple's largest Taiwan-based OEM, earlier committed to setting up a manufacturing plant in Maharashtra. The assumption was the plant would make only Apple products. But sources say Foxconn has tied up with other players like Xiaomi and OnePlus for local manufacture and not necessarily to only make Apple products there. This will be Apple's second big announcement for Bengaluru. In May, Apple announced a design and development accelerator in the city to grow the iOS developer community and also to guide Indian developers to leverage Apple's programming language Swift and build apps for Apple TV and Apple Watch. The facility will open early next year. The Bengaluru manufacturing facility underscores India's importance for the Cupertino-based company. Apple CEO Tim Cook's multi-city India tour earlier this year signalled the growing importance of India powered by the demand for Apple products by a burgeoning middle class. Data from Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Technology Market Research showed that Apple sold 2.5 million iPhones in India from October 2015 to September 2016, a rise of more than 50% over the year-ago period. The revenue numbers speak for themselves. Apple India clocked robust sales touching Rs 9,997 crore in the 2016 financial year, up 56% from Rs 6,472 crore, previously. The company's net profit grew 21% to Rs 294 crore during the same period with deeper retail penetration and lower prices for older iPhone models that garnered a huge user base. An email sent to Apple didn't elicit a response till the time of going to press. Apple has published job openings on its portal for a few positions at its OEM's factory in Bengaluru like operations program manager and product quality manager. Faisal Kawoosa, principal analyst (telecom) at CyberMedia Research, said, "Apple coming to India is a big booster for the make in India initiative."

Now, a new report from the Times of India claims that Apple will start manufacturing the iPhone in India in April of 2017, while the company has also posted a handful of job listings in the country. The report, citing industry sources, claims that Taiwanese OEM maker and Apple partner Wistron is setting up a facility in Bengaluru. Specifically, the facility is said to be located in Peenya, which is widely known as the industrial hub of the city. Furthermore, the report claims that Apple is “very serious” about assembly and manufacturing in India. Setting up manufacturing in the country means that the company will be able to sell its phones at a more competitive price. When importing units, Apple is forced to pay a 12.5 percent additional tariff, but that won’t be the case for locally made goods. While Foxconn is also setting up a facility in India, it won’t be used exclusively for Apple manufacturing, according to today’s report. Foxconn has reportedly arranged to manufacture for company’s like Xiaomi and OnePlus, as well. In addition to today’s report, a handful of job openings on Apple’s job site have also been uncovered that further corroborate Apple’s manufacturing plans for India. One listing is for an “iPhone Operations Manager” in India. The job description says that this person “will lead Apple’s new products ramp in India” and be responsible for leading the “original equipment manufacturer (OEM) team” and working closely with suppliers, engineers, and operation teams to ensure part availability and readiness. The Operations Program Manager (OPM) will lead Apple’s new products ramp in India with superior product quality and maximum customer availability. This individual will also own operational success of the products throughout their product life cycle. Other positions listed in India include Vendor Manager, Regional Field Sales Manager, Site Reliability Engineer, Partnership Manager, Demand Generation Program Manager, Software Engineering Lead, and several others. In setting up a manufacturing facility in India, Apple will theoretically be allowed to finally establish retails stores in the country, as well. Indian law requires that any company with retail stores manufacture a certain portion of their products in the country, and while it was originally believed that Apple could circumvent that requirement, that didn’t turn out to be the case. Tim Cook and Apple have touted India as the company’s next big market of growth for several years, and with iPhone manufacturing and retail stores, that growth will likely pick up as we head into late 2017 and on.

By Todd Haselton | December 29, 2016 Share Stay Connected with Us! Follow TechnoBuffalo As Snapchat works toward its initial public offering (IPO), the company and its management are trying to woo banks to make new investments in the firm. According to The Wall Street Journal, part of the pitch includes likening the company to Facebook and even Apple. In other words, Snapchat thinks it might not only be the next big thing, but a company worthy of growing into one of the world’s largest firms. Snapchat is indeed unique in its market position. It’s more compelling than Facebook to a younger audience, the same audience that once helped propel Facebook to great heights and, indeed, to its own IPO. And unlike competitors like Twitter, it’s able to attract new users and, indeed, keep them interested in the social network. Also a huge distinguishing factor from Twitter and, perhaps a likening to Apple, Snapchat now sells hardware. The company introduced its Spectacles sunglasses earlier this year, allowing its users to record and publish content to the social network right from their faces. The Wall Street Journal said Snapchat hopes that these differences help drive new investments, even though Snapchat doesn’t really have the financials to back up some of its comparisons to far larger companies like Facebook and Apple. The next Apple? Or the next Twitter? “In the expected pricing range, Snap would be valued at a far higher multiple of market capitalization to advertising revenue than other social-media companies, including Facebook and Twitter,” The Wall Street Journal explained. In other words, investors and, indeed, one day the public, will be acquiring stock in a company that doesn’t generate as much income as Facebook or even Twitter, the latter of which has constantly made headlines for being overvalued, failing to generate profit and lacking the ability to show user growth. Snapchat will go down one path or the other. Will it, as the companies management argues, follow the successes of Facebook and Apple? Or will it be the next Twitter? My guess is it’ll fare better than Twitter, but it may take continued innovation, perhaps in the form of hardware like Spectacles, in order to attract new users and drive revenue growth up to levels where comparisons to Facebook and Apple aren’t balked at. That’ll take time.

The patent filing covers a lot of ground relating to the Apple Watch in terms of its wide ranging features including touch input, force input, an interchangeable attachment system, health monitoring functionality, wireless power charging, wireless authentication and transaction functionality along with other features. Yet there was one aspect of their vision that took me totally by surprise. Apple not only envisioned being able to interchange wearable bands with differing materials and clasps but also to eventually provide interchangeable bodies that could be an Apple Watch, mini iPhone, an iPod or health monitoring systems all with different size displays and unique features that fit on your wrist.   Cutting right to the chase, Apple's patent FIG. 5 tells the whole story. The figure depicts a system #500 of interchangeable components for a wearable device. More specifically, Apple's patent FIG. 5 depicts a system that includes a variety of interchangeable components, including multiple device bodies 515, 525, 535 that are configured to connect via a standard interface to any one of a number of different bands 551a-b, 552a-b, 553a-b, 554a-b, and 555a-b.   As shown in patent FIG. 5, the system may include a body or device that is adapted to attach to one or more bands, straps, or other similar component that may be used to attach the device to the body of a user.   As shown in FIG. 5, the system may include multiple device bodies 515, 525, 535 that may vary in size, shape, and composition.   The device body 515, 525, 535 may include one or more of the embodiments described herein and may include, but is not limited to a wearable computer, a wearable watch, a wearable communication device, a wearable media player, a wearable health monitoring device, and/or the like.    In some embodiments, the device may be interchangeable or interchanged to provide a different set of functions or features. In some embodiments, the bands or attachment components may be interchangeable or interchanged to provide desired functionality or features.   Apple filed patent application 20160378071 back in September 2016. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office.

Information on this set of wireless earbuds is thin, but given Samsung’s recent acquisition of Harman audio technology, things could sound mighty nice. This is just the latest in a long line of rumors surrounding the next release from Samsung – the device that’ll almost certainly be called Galaxy S8. It would not be surprising if Samsung ended up trying to out-do Apple’s public AirPods image with additional options. Instead of just revealing a pair of wireless in-ear earbuds with Bluetooth, Samsung could move forward with a this-and-that solution. Earbuds that are wireless if you want them to be wireless, or connected to one-another if you’re worried about tiny device loss. Samsung just released a pair of wireless earbuds this most recent season. These earbuds went by the name Samsung Gear IconX – and they were pretty decent. Not anything mind-blowing, but they certainly did what they set out to do. Their only real drawback was their master-slave relationship where a both-at-once bit of technology would be ideal. Have a peek at SlashGear’s Samsung Gear IconX hands-on from earlier this year to get an idea of what Samsung might have in store next. They’ll likely get a bit more sleek and solve the (very few) problems Apple’s AirPods had here near the end of the year 2016. See our AirPods Review to get another idea of what Samsung could be aiming for. Watch the throne and keep an eye on the competitors. Information about the appearance of a new pair of wireless earbuds coming with the Samsung Galaxy S8 comes from SamMobile. The other possibility is that a replacement for the Gear IconX is simply approaching far faster than expected. Another far-improved pair of wireless earbuds made for running action this Spring wouldn’t be that difficult a pill to swallow. Either way we’ll see inside of a couple months!

Andrew Cunningham - Dec 29, 2016 9:50 pm UTC Enlarge / The iPhone 6S Plus and 7 Plus. Andrew Cunningham reader comments 157 Share this story Further ReadingTrump says he’s going to get Apple to “build a big plant” in US Apple sells iPhones all over the world, but it builds them in China with the help of manufacturing companies like Foxconn and Pegatron. A particular Foxconn facility in the city of Zhengzhou, China, is the subject of a lengthy report in The New York Times today. The report details the complex series of tax breaks, subsidies, and other incentives that makes the Zhengzhou facility so uniquely suited to Foxconn's and Apple's needs. Confidential government records obtained by the Times reveal, among other things, that the city of Zhengzhou helped finance the construction of Foxconn's factory and housing for its workers; that it provides discounted energy and constructed power generators and other infrastructure to support the facility; that it has waived and deeply cut corporate and value-added taxes; that it helps Foxconn hire and train workers; that it put its factory inside a "bonded zone" that made selling devices within China easier; and that it spent a total of $10 billion to upgrade an airport to make exporting products from China quicker and easier for Apple and other companies. The report also highlights just how important Foxconn is to Apple and vice-versa. Apple relies on Foxconn to keep its costs down and profit margins up, and Foxconn relies on orders from Apple to maintain the size and clout that makes it possible for Foxconn to cut such favorable deals in the first place. The Zhengzhou plant can build as many as 500,000 iPhones in a day. While Foxconn also manufactures electronics for other companies, the bulk of the work is being done on Apple's behalf. Factors could disrupt this arrangement, however. In particular, the Chinese government is increasingly interested in backing Chinese companies, which could keep cities like Zhengzhou from offering such attractive deals to companies based in the US and elsewhere. President-elect Donald Trump has also threatened to impose heavy taxes on Chinese imports, which could kick off a trade war and change the financial calculus significantly. The entire piece is worth a read, especially in light of the rhetoric about trade and jobs we heard throughout the US presidential election. Trump asserted on the campaign trail that he would “get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries.” Since the election he has spoken with Apple CEO Tim Cook about building “a big plant” in the US. The Times report highlights just how difficult it would be (and how long it would take) to recreate those incentives and move those manufacturing jobs to the United States or anywhere else.

Apple is thought to be developing a few different handsets for the tenth anniversary of its iPhone, including iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus models and maybe even a flagship iPhone 8 model. According to a new report, that iPhone 8 could feature an all-new design and a 5.8-inch AMOLED display. Apple has huge expectations for this flagship device, as it reportedly expects to ship as many as 70 million units in 2017 alone. DigiTimes, which has a so-so record when it comes to leaking Apple news, citing Apple suppliers in Taiwan, claimed that the 70-million figure will be in addition to the smaller iPhone 7S models with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays. The interesting takeaway here is that Apple reportedly thinks the iPhone 8 will be a big hit - and this is yet another report to suggest Apple is working on three new iPhone models rather than the usual two. The DigiTimes report (via Apple Insider) also said that Samsung will be the sole supplier of the OLED panels for the 5.8-inch iPhone 8, which is something we've heard before, and that production will begin in March, ahead of a September release. The phone is thought to feature a bezel-less design that hides components such as the earpiece and Touch ID. Check out Pocket-lint's rumour round-up to see what else it might feature. As for those iPhone 7S models, they're expected to feature LCD panels and might sport a glass rear casing instead of metal. One of them - the middle phone - might also come with a vertical dual-lens setup.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Features Reviews Search Subscribe Mobile Technology 2016 in review: Hits and misses in mobile technology Emily FerronDecember 30th, 2016 7 pictures Some of 2016's tech hits and misses: Samsung Gear VR, Pokemon Go and the Galaxy Note 7View gallery - 7 images What did 2016 bring for smartphones, laptops and other mobile technology? A few heralded releases surpassed expectations, while others promptly fell flat. Let's take a look back and which products and trends came out on top with a win – and which ones chalked up a big loss. Hit: Pixel, the first phone by Google Google's province has historically been software and platforms, not hardware manufacturing. The company did head into the year with previous forays into Chromebooks and involvement in some Nexus phones, but the release of Pixel, the first Google-branded smartphone, put a lot on the line – and came through with flying colors. We like the Pixel and Pixel XL for their no-nonsense builds, generous internal processing power and storage, elegant delivery of Android and excellent cameras. They only add more éclat to the Google name, and we bet the Pixels and their future generations earn a prominent place amongst top tier smartphones. Miss: Galaxy Note 7 debacle and iPhone fumbles We'd be remiss not to include the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 on a list of the year's tech disappointments. While the phone itself was luxurious and capable, all of its good points are negated by the fact that the phones had a defect making them prone to catching fire and exploding. Samsung consequentially purged Note 7s from the market at great expense. Apple's iPhone 7 and 7 Plus may not have literally gone up in smoke, but their omission of the headphone jack combined with other customer complaints (like the overpriced letdown of AirPods) are sparking enough criticism to damage Apple's standing. Google Pixel (L) hit headlines for mostly good reasons, but that's not true for the Galaxy Note 7 or iPhone 7 Hit: Moto Z's elegantly delivered modular approach Modular smartphones – that is, phones that are expandable with special-use accessories – had a moment this year. Lenovo's Moto Z and Moto Z Force are the best examples. Their mods add some interesting functions to the phone, and snap on and off simply and easily with understated magnetic prongs. And even without the mods, the Moto Z phones are impressive. They pack in quality performance, displays, cameras and battery life. Apart from Pixels, they were the first phones to be Google Daydream-ready. Miss: LG G5 drops the ball on modular LG had a hyped modular smartphone release last spring, but the G5 was a nonsuccess due to its just-OK internals and unpolished approach to modularity. Its ecosystem of mods are not very user-friendly; you actually need to power down the phone and remove its entire bottom section, including the battery, to connect one of its accessories (of which there were only a few). (L) Moto Z (R) LG G5 Hit: Pokémon Go Whether or not you're a fan, there's no denying that Pokémon Go took the mobile gaming world by storm. Its 1-2 punch of Pokémon franchise revelry and emerging augmented reality tech propelled it into a global phenomenon. For a time, its popularity was so widespread that it became the closest thing we've seen to a "killer app" for augmented reality. Miss: Super Mario Run We're not saying that Super Mario Run is a bad game. It's intuitive yet challenging, more multifaceted than other constant running games we've played, and it even has liberal helpings of that characteristic Nintendo magic. We just want to call it out for not living up to hype. It was announced at Apple's iPhone launch event in September, where a significant amount of time was dedicated to extolling it as a groundbreaking reincarnation of the beloved Super Mario Bros. franchise. Super Mario Run is good, but not that good – especially when weighed against the insane popularity of other mobile games. Hit: Better, higher quality options in smartwatches and fitness wearables Smartwatches and fitness trackers are growing incrementally more sophisticated. This year's Apple Watch Series 2 and many of its competitors added integrated GPS and water resistance. These features go a long way, especially in fitness trackers. If wristbands aren't your thing, non-bracelet options are better than ever. Miss: Pebble ends its run Pebble was a pioneering smartwatch company with up-and-coming ideas and several intriguing Kickstarter-funded projects in the works. In December, Pebble announced it was selling its assets to Fitbit and disbanding. While a number of factors probably went into Pebble's extinction, we think it reflects more on the state of the industry than on company leadership or direction. Smartwatch companies are having a hard time convincing consumers of their value, and it's likely that only bigger companies have the ambition and resources to keep the momentum going. Apple Watch Series 2 (L) made incremental gains this year, but the smartwatch company Pebble (R) shut its doors Hit: 2-in-1 convertible laptop/tablets Some of the year's most exciting laptop releases were 2-in-1 convertible laptop/tablets. Like many of the best consumer products, these machines take the standout features of previous technologies and streamline them into one versatile device. Microsoft released a Performance Base edition of its well-regarded Surface Book, and Lenovo released an ambitious Yoga Book with a "Halo keyboard" that converts between a drawing tablet and a capacitive QWERTY keyboard, as well as the classy Yoga 910 laptop. Miss: Apple's Touch Bar is out of touch Apple also included a bit of mobile-inspired touch-sensitive technology in this year's crop of MacBook Pros. However, the so-called "Touch Bar" – a capacitive bar that replaces the traditional Fn keys along the top of the keyboard – failed to provoke much excitement. Between the Touch Bar option's high price tag and middling utility, along with the MacBook Pro's anemic expansion options, it's a hard time to be a MacBook Pro fan. 2-in-1 Windows laptops like the Lenovo Yoga 910 are gaining traction, but Apple's mobile-inspired Touch Bar is a dud Hit: Gear VR & Google Daydream lay the groundwork for mobile VR Although the Samsung Gear VR first hit shelves last year, 2016 was the year that mobile VR truly emerged. Not only did the Gear VR receive a minor upgrade and a proliferation of apps and games in its content library, but the mobile VR headset finally met its first real rival: Google Daydream View. While there are a few differences in their respective platforms and hardware, the two headsets offer remarkably similar glimpses into the VR experience – for now. As competition grows in this space, we look forward to seeing each company differentiate themselves and accelerate these early days of consumer VR. Miss: Sony PlayStation VR Props to Sony for attempting to fill the sweet spot mid-range between cheap, limited mobile VR headsets and expensive, powerful PC-dependent options like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. While the idea behind the PlayStation VR is excellent, its delivery is a flop. The system's motion-controller-tracking works so poorly that it breaks the illusion of VR and results in an enormously frustrating experience. It would be more at home amongst campy virtual reality devices of yesteryear than in 2016's lineup of consumer VR breakthroughs. The Gear VR is a better entry point to virtual reality than Sony PlayStation VR For more on consumer tech in 2016, you can revisit our VR year in review, our list of the best smartphones of the year and our picks for the best wearables.View gallery - 7 images 2016 in review: Hits and misses in mobile technology 1 / 7 Tags #Apple #Google Pixel #Google Share this article Show 5 comments   Over 255,000 people receive our email newsletter See the stories that matter in your inbox every morning Your Email Top stories 13,000 lethal near-Earth asteroids, and what the White House plans to do about them Dell's new laptop leaves the power cord in the past Honda's self-balancing motorcycle follows you around like a puppy 209-mph Bentley Continental Supersports becomes world's fastest production four-seater Recommended for you Latest in Mobile Technology Smartphone add-on sees into your skin "Foam cube" transforms into 3D virtual objects Graphene sticker promises up to 20 percent more smartphone battery life Asus's ZenFone AR can both Daydream and Tango Samsung unveils Android-ready, stylus-sporting convertible Chromebooks Molecular-sensing smartphone analyzes the world around us Honor 6X smartphone offers dual-lens portrait photography for US$250 Here's what Apple should do to bounce back in 2017 The 2016 mobile tech trends with the most staying power The best smartphone tech coming your way in 2017 2016 in review: Hits and misses in mobile technology How Samsung can rebound from the Note 7 debacle in 2017 Latest phone comparisons Google Pixel XL vs. LG V20 OnePlus 3T vs. iPhone 7 Plus OnePlus 3T vs. Samsung Galaxy S7 edge OnePlus 3T vs. Google Pixel XL OnePlus 3T vs. OnePlus 3 Google Pixel XL vs. OnePlus 3 2016 Smartphone Comparison Guide Google Pixel XL vs. Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Google Pixel XL vs. Nexus 6P Google Pixel vs. Samsung Galaxy S7 Google Pixel XL vs. iPhone 7 Plus Google Pixel vs. iPhone 7 Editors Choice The fastest cars in history: 1894 to 1914 Compare the latest tech gear Interview: Vitaly Bulgarov, designer of that giant Korean robot suit Faraday Future's FF91 launch: A stumbling start for the new king of electric cars 2016 from above: Some of the year's finest drone photography Wing to wing: Wild men and machines of the Reno Air Race Turning junk into funk: Guitars made from things found around the home Hex keys to Bond villain chic: The best houses of 2016 2016: The year AI got creative Escaping the everyday: 2016's best motorhomes and adventure vehicle hardware Map of the entire visible universe released to the public Powerful, intriguing and mind-bending off-road vehicles of 2016 Over 255,000 people receive our email newsletter See the stories that matter in your inbox every morning Email address Top Home About Contact Privacy Terms & Conditions Advertise Copyright © Gizmag Pty Ltd 2017 Twitter Facebook RSS Flipboard Gizmag is now New Atlas

The firm’s data shows that Apple’s products accounted for 44 percent of activated smartphones and tablets between December 19th and 25th, down from 49.1 percent in 2015. Meanwhile, Samsung saw a bump from 19.8 percent in 2015 to 21 percent. The results are surprising considering the Note 7 recall became a global media phenomenon, which many expected to permanently taint the brand. “Most of those who bought or wanted to buy a Note 7 opted for a different high-end Galaxy phone,” said NPD Group primary hardware analyst Stephen Baker in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, adding that in addition to loyalty to the Android platform “Samsung was able to fend off other Android competition, and Apple, too, thanks to Apple’s own lack of a wowing product this year.” Consumer tech and mobile industry consultant Chetan Sharma concurred with Baker in the WSJ report, stating: “Apple has the strongest ecosystem, with its hardware, software and app and content stores. iPhone users looking for an upgrade stick with Apple. But in a year when Samsung dropped the ball in a huge way [Apple] didn’t have a phone with a compelling enough feature set to lure Samsung owners away.” SourceWall Street Journal Rev0lver Durrr me keep my Note cause me smrter than everyone. ciderrules And? iPhone will sell over 70 million phones this quarter. Note 7 didn’t even hit 3 million. Even if a large chunk of Note 7 owners switched and bought the iPhone 7 it would still be a tiny fraction of their total sales. beans28 Well yeah, there are 70 million baristas out there. Can’t Fix Stupid This article may have triggered you into a round of revisionism. Because I can guarantee that wasn’t the way you were spinning it a few months ago before the results were in. p_lindsay I have only ever had one Samsung phone, the GS3, and it’s easily the worst phone I’ve ever owned so I’m far from a Samsung fanboy. But the Note 7 was so much better than the iPhone 7 that the two actually weren’t even comparable. Obviously Samsung got a bit ahead of themselves with it, but the fact remains, Apple is miles behind in innovation these days. Shogun Since when are sales and profit numbers meaningless? What metric do you use to measure success? That is besides your own biases p_lindsay Well, if we’re talking sales and our I’d still 80% global markets hate and profit is a result of Apples ridiculous margins which translates to their customers being (usually happily) ripped off. But the point is the 7 is less popular than the 6S which was less popular than the 6. Apple is on the way down. This is undeniable. Shogun Ridiculous margins or not they are still making a killing selling their hardware and insulting those who buy it and suggesting they enjoy getting ripped off speaks to an arrogance on your part. Apple has some retooling to do no doubt but they are far from being on the way down yet. p_lindsay If you think for even a second that I’m more arrogant than Apple you are exactly the customer that likes to get ripped off. englishinator Lol, looks like we have ourselves a die-hard fanboy here Can’t Fix Stupid Blackberries slide also started as some minor “retooling”. Apple is doing retooling such as cutting production 10% due to sagging demand. Techguru86 The fact that Apple numbers are dropping across the board and Android is clearly the majority, Apple stopped doing anything after the 5 and let HTC, Nexus, LG Huawei and others catch up and surpass Can’t Fix Stupid Report today that they are cutting production 10% out of Asia. thereasoner They’re meaningless as far as those sales/profits don’t necessarily mean it’s the best phone. McDonalds makes the most money off burgers, they don’t make the best burgers. Domino67 Funny how BGR spun the same information from Flurry as Apple trouncing Samsung….pinheads! Can’t Fix Stupid It’s why people don’t trust the news anymore. TrickyDickie I wish they’d just go down so that the iTards will shut up lol hoo dat There are 7 billion people in this world, 1% isn’t really that big. Domino67 “iPhone will sell over 70 million phones this quarter.”…..does Apple know that? So Apple will sell lots of phone…so what? Samsung will sell 50% more phones and Android will still be at about 85% marketshare. ciderrules Samsung has never sold even half as many flagships as Apple does. Last time they came close was almost 3 years ago. 85% market share made up of $50 throwaway phones. What does that 85% do for you? Nothing: – The App Store still makes 4X the money for iOS developers vs Android developers. – Developers still favor iOS. Either launching first, or exclusively. See above for a reason why. – iOS has 5X the mobile shopping revenue vs Android. – iOS has 6X the digital content revenues vs Android (music, TV, movies). – iOS dominates enterprise and corporate use vs Android. Only thing Android leads is in market share. A useless statistic when it’s made up of junk devices owned by people who don’t buy Apps or content and do nothing to contribute to the ecosystem. BetelgeuseOrion and what does any of the things you said help me as a consumer? Domino67 Blah blah blah Shogun It didn’t help Blackberry either despite the grousing and over optimistic BS of company touts. yoyo ma That’s one way to spin this data lol. Can’t Fix Stupid Many of us rationally said they wouldn’t see the benefit the fanboys were predicting. And they didn’t. Pretty bad when Apple is tossed a gimme and still fall flat on their face. Their best years are past them. bmccull Actually I think it was Google’s Pixel that was tossed the gimme. There is no good reason for Note 7 owners to switch OS, but moving to the Pixel should have been natural. I wonder why they were not able to take advantage? Can’t Fix Stupid They blew it by overpricing it and there isn’t much brand recognition. Pixel in itself is new enough plus they dusted the Nexus name. Google has a bad habit of not focusing and changing things too often. Like Hangouts etc. The move from the more reasonably priced Nexus pricing and naming convention wasn’t a good one. p_lindsay Probably because the iPhone 7 is incredibly underwhelming. Can’t Fix Stupid I guess you didn’t see the Jet Black colour. It’s black, reimagined. p_lindsay I did see it and I must admit it was pretty revolutionary. It’s basically the Che Guevara of colours. Domino67 That is a very “courageous” colour. Lol Brad Fortin I’ve yet to meet anyone who’s been “underwhelmed” by the iPhone 7. I think the feeling of being underwhelmed is limited to people who had unrealistic expectations. It’s the fastest phone on the market, it’s one of the brightest and most accurate screens on the market, one of the best cameras, it’s got stereo speakers, and it’s waterproof without making the speakers sound like garbage. Genuinely, what more were you expecting? p_lindsay Oh I dunno, maybe a different design after 3 years and features that weren’t on my Xperia Z3 compact nearly 3 years ago and other Android phones even before that. And the funny thing about the “fastest phone on the market” is it’s only really faster at loading games, which admittedly is great if you’re 12 and don’t own a PlayStation. Otherwise it tends to actually be slower at loading apps like facebook, Instagram, Snapchat etc. It also seems to be the worst reviewed iPhone yet. Even the most iFan sites out there are scoring it lower than previous models. Brad Fortin So a design change for the sake of a design change, or do you know of a different design that’s markedly better? Getting new features are a good thing, especially if they’re features people wanted. I haven’t heard anyone complain that it’s waterproof now, or that it has better speakers, etc, those are welcome additions. It’s faster both in terms of CPU speed and storage speed, so loading data and processing that data are both the fastest on the market, allowing any app to benefit (not just games). But, again, genuinely, what more were you expecting? Give me some actual examples, not just a bunch of hand-waving. Iris scanner? Ultrasonic or radar proximity sensor? What does the competition have that’s so obviously better that you expected the iPhone 7 to have? Techguru86 IR Blaster, a better camera app that actually does more than just take panorama, video, slow-mo, something that the HTC M7, Sony, LG and others have been doing for almost 4 years lol Being able to actually customize your device yet still have IOS lol Not relying on Itunes and Imessage lol VaultDweller73 I would love an IR blaster. It’s the reason I’m not currently updating. englishinator Haha, yep, I’ve had an IR blaster and many other features on my Sammy phones and tablets for over 5 years. These Apple fanboys will never learn. Brad Fortin lol, IR blaster? Really? A feature most flagships are dropping because nobody’s using it? Samsung got rid of it, HTC got rid of it, most companies got rid of it. That’s not so much a feature as it is a legacy port. UI customization and advanced camera controls aren’t things most people want and aren’t things that are “so obviously better”. “Not relying on […] iMessage”? iMessage is a tool that iPhone users love to use, and is a feature that keeps a lot of people using Apple devices. It’s something even Android users ask for all the time, and it’s something people keep expecting Google to come out with. That’s some great spin, though, trying to turn a feature people love and clamour for into some kind of negative. p_lindsay Even HTC, who basically designed the iPhone 6 have a markedly better design these days. I have no doubt you enjoy the features Android users have been enjoying for years. But the point is they’ve been around for years. And what was I expecting from Apple? Absolutely nothing. Let me look into my crystal ball and predict your future, young man. I see an unchanged iPhone 7S with the groundbreaking new features of an AMOLED display and USB C port. Place bets on it, it’s money in the bank. Brad Fortin HTC has pretty much the same design that they had when they debuted the M7 back in 2013. Maybe one day Android users will be able to enjoy the features iPhone users have been enjoying for years, like getting messages on multiple devices, getting new apps and games first and without ads, getting a device that doesn’t come with tons of bloatware, etc. So you were expecting nothing and were still underwhelmed? That has more to do with you than it does with the iPhone 7, then, and you’re shifting the blame from yourself to the iPhone in order to hop on the Apple Hate Train. AMOLED on an iPhone? I really hope not, especially not with those awful subpixel layouts and burn-in issues. USB-C? I’m all for it, and it wouldn’t have been possible without Apple’s contributions to the USB consortium. You also forgot the part where Apple’s silicon once again blows the competition out of the water. p_lindsay HTCs design (that Apple stole) has evolved more than Apples over the past 3 years. Android users can get messages on multiple devices and almost every app has a paid version that is ad free. Maybe one day Apple users will get a free option for apps. I’m actually not even an apple hater. My main computer is a MacBook pro that I really like. It’s really just iPhone I don’t like. AMOLED displays are fantastic these days. And apples contributions to USB C appear to be pretty minor. If anything they’ve been a detriment to it by continuing to push the inferior lightning port on iOS devices. And I very clearly wrote that apples Samsung made silicone is only superior for games. Which I couldn’t care less about. Brad Fortin You’re right, HTC’s design has changed over the last 3 years. They dropped the front-facing stereo speakers that gave the phone a unique look and instead went with a 2.5D glass front with a fingerprint reader below the screen, looking more like an iPhone or Galaxy than previous HTC phones. Which built-in app allows Android users to get messages on multiple devices? Google Messenger doesn’t forward messages to a tablet, Google Hangouts doesn’t synchronize messages to a desktop, and Allo can’t even handle SMS yet. So, how exactly are Android users getting their messages on multiple devices when none of the built-in apps support it? Do they have to download a third-party app and just trust that the developers aren’t reading through every text message? Free apps are nice in theory but developers need to get paid and freemium is an awful business model that most people abhor. AMOLED still suffers from weird sub-pixel layouts, still suffer from burn-in, the blue sub-pixels still die before the other colours so the screens look awful after a few years, and most AMOLED screens are still incredibly inaccurate when it comes to colours. USB-C is based on Lightning. If Apple hadn’t put the work into developing Lightning they wouldn’t have been able to pass on their work to put into USB-C and we’d still be stuck with things like Micro-USB 3 (like on the Galaxy S5). Apple’s A9 chip was made by both Samsung and TSMC but the A10 is made solely by TSMC. It’s actually worse at GPU tasks than competing processors, they just have a resolution advantage so their framerates are higher and can be sustained longer, but it’s more than twice as fast at CPU tasks, and the storage is more than twice as fast at loading data (game or not, the storage doesn’t care what kind of content is being loaded, I don’t know why you would think it’s faster at games but nothing else). Domino67 “Google Hangouts doesn’t synchronize messages to a desktop” Yes it does. Brad Fortin Not SMS. Domino67 And a Mac won’t do it with an Android device, you have to have an iphone. Sweet You also have to consider how the speed test was conducted. Did it test the speed of a single task ? How fast is it when multi-tasking ? AFAIK, Android does much more multi-tasking than iOS. Multi-tasking slows down the performance of a single task for the benefit of a better user experience. e.g. I’m able to play music (stored on my BB10 phone) on a Sonos system, play a movie (also stored on my BB10 phone) on a smart TV, browse the web, chat on BBM and reply to e-mail, all at the same time without skipping a beat nor slowing down. The processor is probably not as fast as in the iPhone7, but the iPhone7 can’t do that amount of multi-tasking either. hoo dat But it’s not exponentially better than anything else out there. It’s 0.1 here and 0.02 there, but it’s not got an overwhelming case as to why I should buy one. I NEED expandable and swappable memory, it’s the #1 reason why I don’t buy Apple. There are many other reasons too but to suggest it’s simply down to the ‘experience’ is incorrect and manipulative. Brad Fortin Why does Apple’s device need to be exponentially better than anything else out there? Is there another device on the market that’s exponentially better than anything else? As far as I know most flagships are roughly on par nowadays. You NEED expandable and swappable memory? A hypothetical phone with 1 TB of non-expandable memory wouldn’t work for you? What are you using the expandable memory for? I never mentioned anything about the experience, I mentioned expectations, and unrealistic ones at that (for example, expecting a “revolutionary” phone every year). Techguru86 Android have just as good as any IPhone camera and the software does more, Apple’s problem is consumers are seeing the next IPhone offers little to nothing more than last years model and IOS is still limiting compared to what is offered by Google.And considering amazing offers from ZTE, OnePlus, LG, Samsung, Huawei, Pixel , Blackberry Brad Fortin Keep drinking that Android kool-aid. p_lindsay Actually he’s objectively 100% correct. It’s you that’s drinking the Kool aid, bud. Brad Fortin He’s correct about Android being more customizable and the cameras being on par, he’s wrong about the new iPhone offering little to nothing more than before. But, more importantly, he didn’t answer the question: Why does Apple’s device need to be exponentially better than anything else out there? Why is Apple being held to a higher standard than everyone else, and why does everyone else get a free pass when they’re not up to par? All any of you have done is hand-waving without a single one giving any compelling arguments to back up your statements. Sweet Apple is not being held to a higher standard. The “exponentially better” comment applies to all phones. e.g. Galaxy S fans aren’t going to upgrade to the latest version if it only offers “small” increase in benefits. I’ll bet that applies to other products and industries too. My current phone had only 3 improvements over the previous year’s model. But one of those improvements was really important to me, so I upgraded. Otherwise, I would not have upgraded. Ask yourself how many iPhone users have you heard saying they wish their iPhone was waterproof ? How many have wished their iPhone had a faster processor ? How many have wished it was a little thinner ? I know lots of iPhone users (most of my family), and none of them have ever asked for the improvements Apple made in the iPhone7. Next year’s model is rumoured to be a re-design to celebrate the 10th anniversary. This time, I believe the rumours are true. 🙂 p_lindsay I don’t think anyone is suggesting it needs to be exponentially better. I think he’s suggesting it should at least be as good. I think he’s suggesting you get a more feature rich experience and superior hardware with a number of different Android devices, in some cases for substantially less money. I think he might be suggesting that apples innovation has been stagnant for years while their prices continue to climb. Brad Fortin “I don’t think anyone is suggesting it needs to be exponentially better.” Those were exactly the words @disqus_ZjbWAsoXMI:disqus used: “it’s not exponentially better than anything else out there” And he never mentioned Android, just the need for expandable storage, nor did he mention price, or innovation, or any of the things you’re suggesting, that’s just you projecting your thoughts onto his words. Apple’s had plenty of innovations lately, people simply confuse novelty for innovation and are disappointed that Apple doesn’t do as many novel things as other companies. Their prices have been pretty steady for nearly a decade, but you may be confusing their pricing with the performance of the CAD, which hasn’t been doing too well. p_lindsay Listen, DongleLUVR45, or whatever your name is. Apple is truly in the midst of an identity crisis and if you can’t see that you’re blind. There is no innovation, there is no grand vision. Brad Fortin Pot, meet kettle. p_lindsay Whatever, super chief. When literally any other company on the planet releases a flagship phone with only a USB A cable and no headphone jack and then a month later releases their flagship laptop with USB C and a headphone jack then we’ll talk. Until then, keep pretending I’m wrong. Domino67 “Why does Apple’s device need to be exponentially better than anything else out there?” Uh because they charge exponentially more than others! ciderrules Someone is mathematically challenged. Brad Fortin They charge the exact same amount as companies like Google, Samsung, HTC, Motorola, Sony, etc. p_lindsay Actually they don’t. The pixel was the only Android flagship priced the same as iPhone. Brad Fortin iPhone 7: $900 Pixel: $900 Galaxy S7: $900 Moto Z: $900 HTC 10: $900 LG G5: $750 (not the exact same but still pretty close) Sony X Performance: $700 (still pretty close) Domino67 Iphone 7 plus: $1075…upgrade storage…$1,344 S7 edge: $1,000 Thats some big differences. The other thing is quite a few people buy Apple Care at $169…which is nearly PURE PROFIT for Apple. With your comparisons some are similar priced for sure but the others are 20% less expensive. Brad Fortin You forgot to upgrade the storage on the S7 Edge. If you’re going to upgrade one of them you need to upgrade both of them otherwise it’s a biased comparison. Putting aside the fact that $1075 and $1344 are carrier pricing and Apple’s pricing is $1049 and $1309, the upgrade in storage is $260, while a microSD card that’s 256 GB and UHS (the closest speed you can get to internal storage, even though it’s still an order of magnitude slower) is $280 on Newegg or $240 on Amazon (+ shipping). That’s some negligible differences. Quite a few people also buy $10/month insurance plans from the carriers, which is pure profit for the carriers, and OEMs are free to offer their own warranty, like HTC does in the US with its Uh Oh protection, but none of them are willing to offer it in Canada, so that’s entirely on the OEM. And extended warranties are only pure profit if they go unused which, again, would be the same for any other OEM if they ever decide to offer their own warranty. Domino67 Newegg are selling a 128gb card for $55…that’s more than 1/2 price of Apple pricing…….if a person is loading songs, or movies it will be plenty fast enough for 99% of the population. Techguru86 No it doesn’t, considering what hardware offerings are from everyone else. Apple should be no more priced than a mid range android, considering the iPhone is using old technology Brad Fortin iPhone 7: $900 Pixel: $900 Galaxy S7: $900 Moto Z: $900 HTC 10: $900 LG G5: $750 (not the exact same but still pretty close) Sony X Performance: $700 (still pretty close) So, yes, they do charge the same amount as other companies, with only a couple of exceptions that still come pretty close. Which part of having the fastest CPU on the market is “using old technology”? Which part of having the fastest storage with the latest PCIe/NVMe is “using old technology”? Which part of having the one of the best cameras is “using old technology”? Which part of having one of the brightest and the most accurate wide-colour displays is “using old technology”? If you really believe that having some of the best and latest technologies is “using old technology” then you need to stop drinking the kool-aid and wake up. Domino67 Then perhaps you can spread the word….Most apple fans seems to think that every Android device is $50…cough Ciderrules cough. Keep in mind that Apple really screw the fans over with upgrade of storage….to go from 32 gb to 256gb is $230. Where an SD card is at least half that. Brad Fortin It’s not that every Android device is $50, just the majority of them. The iPhone’s average selling price is ~$700 USD (~$950 CAD) while Android’s is almost a third of that at ~$250 USD (~$350 CAD). Apple’s storage is PCIe/NVMe, which is in an entirely different league than SD cards. It’s an expensive upgrade because the components are expensive. BetelgeuseOrion “Why does Apple’s device need to be exponentially better than anything else out there?” because its more expensive than its competitors (except for maybe the pixel) Brad Fortin Except the Pixel, and S7/S7 Edge, and the HTC 10, and the Moto Z, and the Sony X Performance and XZ, and the G5. Really, it’s the same price as its competitors, carriers just don’t give as big a subsidy because, like many people here, they don’t like Apple. Sweet Same here. I also use DLNA often, USB OTG and NFC (for transferring data between mobiles.) The iPhone offers nothing that I want/need and can’t get from either Android or BB10. Mo Dabbas but feels the same as the 6 and 6S. It’s not giving a reason for current iPhone 6 and 6S owners to upgrade. That’s what hurting the sales. I know lots who are staying on their iPhone 6 waiting for the next iPhone (7S or 8 or 10th edition…) just because they don’t see a real reason to update. Brad Fortin I think to a lot of people having a familiar device is a pro, not a con, especially if they can upgrade from one generation to another and still be able to use the same cases and accessories, like being able to use a 5/5S case on an SE or a 6/6S case on a 7. If people are staying on their old iPhones because they don’t see waterproofing, better speakers, better cameras, a better screen, and faster speed as a compelling reason to update doesn’t that speak more to the longevity of the old devices (which are still getting regular updates) and how they’re increasingly “good enough” for many years like desktop computers rather than the lack of a “real” reason to update? Not to mention that most people on an older iPhone are also on an older rate plan, and to get a new phone would require an undesirable increase in their rate plan. Mo Dabbas Feels the same I meant with the overall experience, not the familiarity of the OS. It’s an expensive device, and if there is no compelling reason many will hold on to their money until something compelling comes out. Waterproofing is an overrated feature to be honest. Most of the time a phone loses that with use (adhesives don’t stay strong enough to seal). See a year old Sony phone and you’ll see what I mean. In anyway, I see it as a protective step rather (a “just in case”) than a feature. Camera, screen and speed is amongst the things that people won’t notice because the 6 and 6S still do those well. Eluder I’m underwhelmed by it and I got it at launch. My Pixel is a far better experience and an actual upgrade over all my other phones. Only reason I’ve got the iPhone 7 Plus is to make things easier to communicate with my girlfriend. Nothing about the iPhone 7 is impressive over the 6s Plus I had. Domino67 The OnePlus 3T does some things faster. The only place that the Apple phone are faster is in loading graphic intensive games. ciderrules Rendering video or adjusting photos iPhone 7 rules. Audio processing iPhone 7 rules. Anything that requires processor power for more than a few seconds iPhone 7 rules. If all you do is email or use Facebook and Twitter then you’re not going to notice a difference. ciderrules – I hate having the fastest processor in mobile in my iPhone 7P. – I hate having iOS developers write powerful Apps that leverage the A Series 64bit processors and bring desktop features to my iPhone. – I hate having a DCI-P3 screen to check color accuracy of photos I take with my Nikon DSLR. Something no Android device in the world is capable of because Android lacks color management. Right away that makes Android and any Android device useless for photographers or other creatives who need color accuracy. – I hate having hardware encryption that doesn’t slow my device when encryption is turned on (iPhone had this since the 3GS in 2009, Pixel finally added this 7 years late). – I hate the camera with dual focal lengths, portrait mode and superior video. – I hate having 256GB high speed storage with NVMe that nobody else has (they’re still using inferior UFS 2.1). For starters…. BetelgeuseOrion you forgot garbage low resolution screen still missing multi tasking, even bringing down the notification shade freezes the running program and screws up a bunch of things especially connected games. lack of USB C, headphone jack, speakers sound like crap, DAC is garbage, costs the most, Sweet And the worst UI (compared to WP, BB10, Android), no support for microSD, no USB OTG, no general-purpose NFC support and arguably the most easily breakable phone. There’s more, but that’s enough to make my point. p_lindsay Cool story, champ. Still extremely underwhelming. Techguru86 Lol old news bro, even mid range devices are fast nowadays and good performance. My DTEK50 has no bloatware, built in encryption ,lightning fast and much cheaper than any iPhone AW Sudo The irony… “courageous” enough to get rid of the headphone jack. NOT “courageous” enough to release to release a new phone model that is redesigned. I disagree with Apple — releasing an incremental update a year later is not the same as a new phone. It may have worked in 2012, but this is 2016/17… hunkyleepickle After the note 7 was DOA, I really thought I’d go for the s7 edge. Then I played with a pixel, and the performance was just leaps above the S7 edge. Too bad Google is so terrible at retail, and I still haven’t been able to get an XL months later. OP3t still out of stock, even I am tempted by the iPhone 7 plus lately…..But that price tho!! Zach Gilbert All posts with links are held for moderation. It isn’t just you. Can’t Fix Stupid There is a report today out of “Asia.nikkei” that iPhone production is being cut 10% due to weak demand. Might be an interesting data point to follow up on within the context of this article. Smitty To me this article isn’t about Samsung vs. Apple. It’s about the fact that people are so committed to their OS that buying a device that explodes is not enough to make them switch. If that’s not enough, debating which is better in the comment section over and over again is even more pointless.

Tech CES 2017 Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Super Bowl Ads     The Rumoured White IPhone 7 And IPhone 7 Plus Shown In A Video Posted: Dec 29 2016, 11:30am CST | by Ahmed Humayun, in Rumors | Apple     This year with the release of the iPhone 7 series Apple took an opportunity to add a Jet black colour to the line-up. This addition has proven to be an absolute hit even though the colour makes it prone to micro abrasions which give it a scratched look. Just after the release, speculation started if Apple could release another addition in the Line Up with a ‘Jet White’ version. Don't Miss: Super Bowl 2017 Ads This has not happened as yet but speculation has resurfaced due to a sketchy video which suggests how the Jet White phones may actually look like. The video shows the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus depicted by the difference in sizes. The larger device is shown to have a popular iSight Duo camera in place of the rear. Could this be the Jet White iPhone 7? pic.twitter.com/pHoDiZ63ON— Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) December 27, 2016 However both the devices have been coated with what could be the possible representation of the Jet White colour if Apple ever releases such a device. It may be that these phones are not official devices but are mock ups of the iPhone 7 duo. Many auction sites sell almost identical phones such as these shown in the video both with and without the Apple Logo display. The Jet White colour will definitely be a hit since it will not depict the micro white abrasions. However, we still have to wait whether Apple takes this decision or not.

We've seen monthly drone updates of the location during the construction period, letting us keep an eye on Apple's progress, and now SkyIMD has created a neat high-resolution aerial mosaic that gives an incredibly detailed overall view of the nearly-finished campus. Click here to see a larger high-resolution image on the SkyIMD website The image depicts the main spaceship building that is the highlight of the campus, with its massive curved glass windows and huge built-in glass doors that open up into a cafeteria area. The aerial photo, composed of ten 100-megapixel images captured with a PhaseOne iXA-RS1000, was made on December 22. Duncan Sinfield, who has shared Apple Campus 2 drone videos with MacRumors for several months, has also uploaded an updated video captured on Christmas morning that shows the progress Apple has made on landscaping in recent weeks. Apple plans to have the campus finished by the beginning of 2017, with employees moving in during the first quarter, but landscaping work will not be finished until the middle of the year.

Credit: Thinkstock More like this 8 tech startup trends to watch in 2017 How AI is transforming cloud computing AI is coming, and will take some jobs, but no need to worry Video 4 great gifts for mobile professionals Machine learning and other variations of artificial intelligence (AI) are expected to proliferate in the enterprise in 2017. The majority of IT players, including today's leading technology companies, have invested in the space and plan to increase efforts for the foreseeable future, according to analysts who cover the market. However, while machine learning has generated tremendous interest throughout the enterprise, a wide gap still exists between research and beneficial use cases in the real world. And only a small number of companies have the resources to actually drive AI innovation and deliver it to the masses, sources say. During last month's Code Enterprise conference, LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner said AI was one of leading factors in the company's decision to be acquired by Microsoft. A limited pool of AI experts means relatively few companies can make machine learning work at scale, he said at the time. AI sets stage for big change in 2017 Box CEO Aaron Levie says machine learning and AI are pillars of his cloud-storage company's strategy. He predicts AI will have a momentous year in the enterprise in 2017. "We are going to see a dramatic change in how enterprise software is designed and how enterprise software takes advantage of all the data that's in our platforms to produce way better outcomes for customers," he says. Machine learning has already become "table stakes for data preparation and other tools related to managing curation of data," but the technology will continue to grow and find its way into more applications and services in 2017, according to an Ovum report on tech trends in 2017. The research firm predicts machine learning is still more likely to show up in large-scale services than custom-developed apps, because few organizations outside of the Global 2000 have data scientists with the appropriate skills on their staffs. Machine learning took the place of big data as the "shiny new thing" in technology, and it will be the "biggest disruptor for big data analytics in 2017," according to Ovum. Enterprises are also under pressure to make data science a team sport, because the most rigorous models and hypotheses will require outside collaboration to reach greater potential.  Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft all open-source or share their latest research in AI to advance developments in the space. These moves from such notable organizations also meet the collective interests of scientists and researchers who prefer to share their findings with the larger community, instead of limiting access to a select group. Apple makes secrecy exception for AI Earlier this month, Apple made a significant exception to its generally-secretive practices and allowed its AI team to publish research papers on the subject for the first time, according to Bloomberg.com. Russ Salakhutdinov, Apple's director of AI research who also studies the technology at Carnegie Mellon University, reportedly confirmed the change in policy at the Neural Information Processing Systems conference. Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, says he expects Apple to build out AI features for Siri with more capabilities across iOS and macOS. "If Apple does enhance desktops, I would expect it to support far-field commands like an Echo or Google Home," he says. However, Moorhead believes a separate AI-fueled device such as Amazon's Echo is unlikely. Apple CEO Tim Cook has also played up the strengths and promise of AI as it pertains to the company's future. During an interview with Nikkei Asian Review in October, he emphasized the relative immaturity of smartphones and predicted that AI will result in an "incredible future" for the iPhone. Facebook explains foundational concepts of AI Facebook's head of AI research, Yann LeCun, this month produced a series of educational videos that outline how AI works, what it can conceivably achieve and how people can get involved. "AI is not magic, but we have already seen how it can make seemingly magical advances in scientific research and contribute to the everyday marvel of identifying objects in photos, recognizing speech, driving a car or translating an online post into dozens of languages," LeCun wrote in a blog post. The technology will be the "backbone of many of the most innovative apps and services of tomorrow," but it remains a mystery for many people who will eventually see AI influence their daily lives, according to LeCun. "Increasingly, human intellectual activities will be performed in conjunction with intelligent machines," he wrote. "Our intelligence is what makes us human, and AI is an extension of that quality." LeCun also predicted that health care services and transportation will be among the first industries that AI transforms. "The most meaningful thing Facebook can do in AI in 2017 is to make their chatbots useful, as so far they are weak and lack slick utility," Moorhead says. "Consumers are using them a few times, see they don't do much well and stop using them."  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently published a detailed year-end update on his personal challenge to build simple AI to run his home. Zuckerberg spent about 100 hours building "Jarvis" and concluded that even if he spent another 1,000 hours on the project, he still wouldn't be able to build a system that could learn new skills on its own. Zuckerberg's experience also reinforced his prediction that AI systems will be more accurate at reading senses than the human nervous system within a decade. "In a way, AI is both closer and farther off than we imagine," he wrote. Ultimately, according to LeCun, Facebook has one goal with respect to AI, and that is to understand intelligence and build intelligent machines. "That's not merely a technology challenge, it's a scientific question," he wrote. "What is intelligence and how can we reproduce it in machines? The answers to these questions will help us not just build intelligent machines, but develop keener insight into how the mysterious human mind and brain work." Google bakes machine learning into G Suite apps Google invests in AI for various purposes, perhaps more than any other company today, but it also exemplifies how machine learning can be blended into popular apps, such as Gmail, that billions of people use every day. Google's self-driving car project, now a separate company called Waymo, may generate more attention for AI, but small features in Google Apps could potentially add up to a bigger impact for more people. When Google renamed its suite of productivity apps as "G Suite," it also announced plans to bake more AI and machine learning into the portfolio. The company introduced a new feature in Drive, for example, called "quick access," that "uses your activity patterns to predictively serve up to you the file that you need," said Prabhakar Raghavan, vice president of Google Apps, in September. "Explore," a new feature in Docs, Sheets and Slides, automatically applies formulas to company data based on common queries from users.  Moorhead doesn't expect Google to add many more features to Google Home in 2017 and says it's also unlikely that the device will exceed the capabilities of Amazon's Echo in the coming year. He does, however, expect Google to extend many of its AI-driven features in image search to video search during 2017.  Microsoft shares progress on AI development Microsoft this month shared some of the latest research and development progress it achieved in AI with a specific focus on conversational computing. The company says it has invested in AI for almost 25 years and is determined to bring new technology to consumers, business and developers in 2017. Microsoft's newest chatbot Zo, which it launched in the United States on Kik in October, has more than 115,000 users, according to the company.  The Microsoft Bot Framework attracted 67,000 developers to date, and Microsoft says it's adding new tools to make it easier to create bots with cognitive functions and natural-language processing. Microsoft also announced a new service, called "Calendar.help," that uses AI to simplify the task of scheduling meetings and introduced the Cortana Devices SDK to make its digital assistant available to hardware manufacturers who want to build smarter capabilities into their devices, according to Microsoft. "Microsoft surprised everyone in 2016 and I'm expecting more surprises in 2017," Moorhead says. He predicts the company will release a standalone intelligent agent and a personal computer that will outperform Amazon's Echo. "I'm also expecting to see many more business-related AI APIs." Gauging the impact of AI in the enterprise in 2017 Forrester Research recently surveyed 612 business and technology professionals to determine the scope of AI research in enterprise. While 58 percent of the respondents said their organizations are researching AI, only 12 percent said they use AI systems at work. "This gap reflects growing interest in AI but little actual use at this time," the firm wrote in a separate report on the potential of AI in the enterprise in 2017. "We expect enterprise interest in, and use of, AI to increase as software vendors roll out AI platforms and build AI capabilities into applications," the firm predicted. "Enterprises that plan to invest in AI expect to improve customer experiences, improve products and services, and disrupt their industry with new business models."

Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Dec 29, 2016 at 2:30PM iPhone final inspection in China. Image source: Apple. Domestic manufacturing and the related jobs was one of the pillars of President-elect Donald Trump's campaign. Following his victory nearly two months ago, the pressure is now on to deliver to his voters and supporters, even if most of the reasons why U.S. manufacturing has declined are out of his control. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is, and has always been, an easy political target, given its sheer size and the fact that it's common knowledge that iPhones are assembled in China. Trump has vaguely offered Apple incentives to bring manufacturing jobs back, and while Apple and Foxconn are considering the idea, there are many hurdles that are arguably impossible to overcome. If anything, the company would likely rather kill U.S. manufacturing if it could, including its last vestige of domestic assembly, the Mac Pro. A couple of recent reports further underscore why Apple would be unable to bring iPhone production stateside, at least in any meaningful way beyond small political gestures (like the Mac Pro was, which is already a financial and operational headache for the company). We built this city on rock and roll (and incentives) Trump may tout that he's the most tremendous dealmaker in the observable universe, but The New York Times just published a must-read investigative report today detailing how China wooed Foxconn -- and by proxy, Apple -- with incentives worth billions of dollars. The local government in Zhengzhou offers a wide range of ongoing incentives that support Foxconn's iPhone manufacturing facility in the city that churns out half a million iPhones daily, earning Zhengzhou the nickname of "iPhone City." Approximately half of all iPhones are made in the city. iPhones aren't the only Apple products assembled in China. Image source: Apple. The details were discovered through confidential government records that the Times got a hold of. Apple says it knows that the government provides some level of support, but says it doesn't know the specifics surrounding the incentives that Foxconn has scored. Here's a key sentence in the report that might rain on Trump's parade: "As the Zhengzhou operation shows, China not only provides a large pool of labor; it also offers incentives that would be difficult to replicate in the United States or anywhere else." Who's coming with me? A separate report from qq (via DIGITIMES) yesterday points out that even if Apple and Foxconn wanted to move manufacturing to the U.S. in any non-trivial sense, many of the suppliers and component manufacturers would not be willing to follow suit. It's well known that the global consumer electronics supply chain is heavily concentrated in Asia, with manufacturing and assembly being but part of the value chain. A map of Apple's suppliers by geography. All those Asian suppliers aren't moving halfway across the world. Image source: Apple. For these smaller companies, the prospect of expanding in the U.S. would be prohibitively expensive due to higher labor costs, operating costs, and regulatory costs given the U.S.'s more stringent environmental regulations. There are also concerns around the demographics of the labor pool, with Chinese workers typically being younger than their U.S. counterparts. One of the key benefits of assembling in China is the close proximity to suppliers, which dramatically simplifies operations and reduces logistics costs. It also allows for flexibility to tweak and adapt manufacturing processes as challenges arise. So don't expect Apple to start bringing those jobs back en masse. Sorry, Trump.

Adam Levy (adamlevy) Dec 29, 2016 at 3:08PM Image source: Fitbit. The wearables market isn't growing as analysts originally anticipated. Last quarter, unit sales across the entire market grew just 3% year over year, according to IDC. That's quite a slowdown from the first quarter of the year, when wearable unit sales increased 67%. Part of the slowdown in sales may have been the anticipated release of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch Series 2, which delayed some purchases into the fourth quarter. Smartwatch sales in general lagged in 2016, as simpler fitness trackers like Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) devices continue to grow. Here are the five best-selling wearable device brands of 2016, based on data through the first three quarters. Fitbit Fitbit's brand is synonymous with fitness trackers. Its strong brand, combined with the company's wide lineup of devices with varying functionality and price points, allowed it to dominate the wearable market in 2016. Through the first three quarters of the year, Fitbit sold 15.8 million wearable devices, according to data from IDC Research. Fitbit released several new devices in 2016. It launched its Alta and Blaze lines in the first quarter. Both sold extremely well through the first three quarters of the year, accounting for the majority of Fitbit's revenue in the first half of the year. In the third quarter Fitbit added refreshes of the Charge and Flex devices to its lineup, bolstering unit sales 11% for the quarter. Some of Fitbit's biggest opportunities for growth are abroad. It's growing well in Europe, as CEO James Park points out. "The population of the five largest countries -- Germany, France, the U.K., Italy and Spain -- equals the approximate size of the U.S., but less than 15% of our total devices sold today," he told analysts on Fitbit's third-quarter earnings call. Fitbit has struggled to penetrate the large market in Asia, though. Xiaomi Xiaomi may be to blame for Fitbit's struggles in Asia. The Chinese electronics maker released an update to its Mi Band this year to include a heart-rate sensor and a few other upgrades, and it's managed to keep the price point below $20 (in U.S. dollars) in its home country. For reference, Fitbit's average selling price was $93 last quarter. Xiaomi's dominance is mostly confined to China, where it also holds a substantial share of the smartphone market. Xiaomi is working to extend its brand throughout Asia, particularly in large emerging markets like India. The company should continue to dominate the low-end wearable device category in the region, as it uses inexpensive wearables to improve its brand recognition. Garmin Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) offers a range of wearable devices catered toward specific sports like golf, swimming, and cycling. It also offers generic fitness trackers like many of Fitbit's or Xiaomi's, as well as high-end smartwatches like the Apple Watch. Garmin's high-end "fenix" line of smartwatches boosted sales of its wearables this year. Smartwatches accounted for nearly half of Garmin's wearable sales last quarter, offsetting declines in unit shipments for its more basic wearables. Garmin is also expanding developer support for its Connect IQ app store. Its high-end devices, like Apple's, benefit from the additional functionality offered by third-party support. As Garmin expands its number of smartwatch designs and the number of apps in Connect IQ, smartwatches should continue to grow as a share of the company's wearable sales. Apple It took over a year for Apple to refresh the Apple Watch, and that ultimately cost it in sales. Sales declined 57% in the second quarter and 71% in the third quarter, after lapping the April 2015 launch of the original Apple Watch. The release of the Apple Watch Series 2 at the end of September was unable to save third-quarter sales; the smartwatch leader sold 1.1 million units in the third quarter, according to IDC. CEO Tim Cook responded to IDC's report by telling Reuters, "We're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch." While he didn't provide any exact sales figures, he said, "During the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history." (Sell-through is a measure of how many units actually reach consumers, instead of just store shelves.) If Apple does indeed have its best quarter ever of Apple Watch sales, it will (based on IDC estimates) sell over 4.1 million units. Samsung Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) managed to grab the fifth-place position in 2016. Its Gear S2 smartwatch differentiates itself with built-in cellular connectivity, so it doesn't need to be connected to a smartphone to access internet-enabled apps. Samsung also benefited from bundling its newest Gear Fit model with its line of smartphones, including the Galaxy Note 7. Despite the recall of the Note 7, customers were able to keep their discounted smartwatches, which inflated unit sales somewhat. Low-end devices like the Gear Fit, which compete with Fitbit devices, accounted for all of Samsung's unit growth in the third quarter. Early days Smartwatches have fallen out of favor recently as basic wearables pick up the slack. IDC expects the market to more than double by 2020, and smartwatches could play a major role in that growth. Two main factors will impact the growth of smartwatches over lower-end fitness bands. First, the introduction of cellular connectivity in more devices will make them more useful as independent devices. Second, the growth of third-party developer support will produce functionality that exceeds simpler fitness bands. All five companies listed here are poised to take advantage of further growth in smartwatches if and when they take off, but Apple lacks a low-end fitness band to protect against a lack of consumer interest in that market segment.

Approximately 44 percent of new smartphone and tablet activations in the week leading up to Christmas were iOS devices -  while its rival Samsung finished with just 21 percent. Chinese giant Huawei came in at third with 3 percent and LG, Amazon, Oppo, Xiaomi and Motorola each accounted for 2 percent of device activations. Scroll down for videos  About 44% of new smartphone and tablet activations in the week leading up to Christmas were Apple devices, while its rival Samsung had just 21 percent. Chinese giant Huawei came in at third with 3% and LG, Amazon, Oppo, Xiaomi and Motorola each accounted for 2% THE RESULTS  Flurry released a new report revealing what smartphone brands had the most new device activations over the holiday season - it pulled data from the the week leading up to Christmas. Apple had 44 percent, while its rival Samsung only had 21 percent. Experts believe the  South Korean firm is still dealing with repercussions of its Galaxy Note 7 fiasco.  Chinese giant Huawei came in at third with 3 percent and LG, Amazon, Oppo, Xiaomi and Motorola each accounted for 2 percent of device activations.  Even though medium-size phones, such as Apple's iPhone 7 and Samsung's Galaxy S7, are among the favorite, their popularity fell from 54 percent in 2015 to 45 percent this holiday season. This drop was due to an increase in phablet purchases.  The new report was published this week by Flurry, an analytics tool that tracks user data. 'With the dates of Christmas and Chanukah synced this year, smartphones were once again predominate on everyone's wish lists,' Chris Klotzbach, Director at Flurry and Lali Kesiraju, Marketing and Analytics Manager at Flurry, shared in a blog post. 'As we do every year, Flurry took a look at the most gifted smartphones and tablets this holiday season, examining phone and app activation throughout the week leading up to Christmas day and the start of Chanukah. The analytics firm found that Samsung is 'slowly growing in popularity throughout the holiday season', as it is up 1 percent from last year. Samsung's loss to Apple may be due to the global recall of the Galaxy Note 7 from September after many users reported the device was bursting into flames or exploding. However, while Apple may be basking in their 2016 win, the Cupertino company's activations fell by about 5 percent from last year. In 2015, Apple products accounted for 49.1 percent, which may be a result of many users being disappointed with the new iPhone 7 line - as it seems to be just a refreshed iPhone 6.

Share this article Share Flurry was surprised by Huawei and LG's ranking, as 'both manufactures do not have an individual device within the top 35 devices activated'. This could be because both electronics makers have developed a variety of different products at an affordable price point. Although Samsung fell behind Apple by more than half, the data does show that the two dominated the global phone market, as the other six smartphone makers  trailed far behind. Apple may be basking in their 2016 win, but its activations fell by about 5% from last year. In 2015, Apple products accounted for 49.1%, which may be a result of many users being disappointed with the new iPhone 7 line - as it seems to be just a refreshed iPhone 6 Even though medium-size phones, such as Apple's iPhone 7 and Samsung's Galaxy S7, are among the favorite, their popularity fell from 54 percent in 2015 to 45 percent this holiday season - the drop is because of phablets Even though medium-size phones, such as Apple's iPhone 7 and Samsung's Galaxy S7, are among the favorite, their popularity fell from 54 percent in 2015 to 45 percent this holiday season, Flurry found. And the drop is due to phablets – a smartphone with a 5 inch to 6.9 inch display. 'Although medium phones saw the most activations during the week leading up to the holidays, Phablets continue to increase their holiday share, at the detriment of the medium phone,' wrote Klotzbach and Kesiraju. THE REAL NOTE 7 PROBLEM  During the Galaxy Note 7 recal, Koh Dong-jin, Samsung's mobile president, told reporters in Seoul: 'The flaw in the manufacturing process resulted in the negative electrodes and the positive electrodes coming together.' But Anna Shedletsky, hardware engineer and chief executive of tech company Instrumental, was not satisfied with Samsung's explanation for the flaming phones. Shedletsky and colleagues took apart one of the phones and found it did not leave enough space for the battery to swell when it expanded during charging. 'When batteries are charged and discharged, chemical processes cause the lithium to migrate and the battery will mechanically swell,' the blog says. 'Any battery engineer will tell you that it's necessary to leave some percentage of ceiling above the battery, 10% is a rough rule-of-thumb, and over time the battery will expand into that space. 'Our two-month old unit had no ceiling: the battery and adhesive was 5.2 mm thick, resting in a 5.2 mm deep pocket.' The researchers said this flaw could have been overlooked when Samsung engineers developed the phone.  'Tablet device activations have stabilized and are relatively flat year over year. This indicates that users find purpose for their purchase, albeit the devices cater to more niche use. Flurry also found that this year's Christmas Day was on trend with 2015 for app downloads – it also had the most out of any other day in 2016.  Within a month of the iPhone 7 line hitting the market, Apple's profits tumbled 19% to $9 billion when it revealed its third quarter its third quarter of falling iPhone sales in a row. The firm also said revenue declined 9 percent to $46.8 billion for the quarter that ended in September.  The analytics firm found that Samsung is 'slowly growing in popularity throughout the holiday season', as it is up 1% from last year. Samsung's loss to Apple may be due to the global recall of the Galaxy Note 7 (pictured) The world's most valuable publicly traded company said in October that it sold 45.51 million iPhones in the three months ending September 24, beating the average analysts' estimate of 44.8 million, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount. Apple also sold 48.05 million smartphones in the year-earlier period. However, iPhone 7 sales did turn around, but Apple has yet to reveal if the numbers are enough to offset its first annual revenue decline in 15 years, reports The Wall Street Journal. 'Apple has the strongest ecosystem, with its hardware, software and app and content stores,' said consumer tech and mobile industry consultant Chetan Sharma. 'iPhone users looking for an upgrade stick with Apple.' 'But in a year when Samsung dropped the ball in a huge way,' he said, Apple 'didn't have a phone with a compelling enough feature set to lure Samsung owners away.'      Read more: Apple and Samsung Missed Holiday Smartphone Sales Opportunities, Say Analysts - WSJ From Apps to iPhones: Holiday Shoppers Invest in... | Flurry Blog Share or comment on this article e-mail 9 shares Most watched News videos Dan Bilzerian show off glitzy lifestyle as 'King of Instagram' Blind man attaches GoPro to guide dog to record his commute Cyclist forced off the road by dangerous braking driver Heartbreaking moment horse cries at owner's funeral 'I thought he was going to hit me': Ann Widdecombe on Philpott Great White shark breaches the water in pursuit of a tasty treat "UFO" has been filmed demonstrating highly unusual behaviour Stepdaughter surprises stepmom with adoption papers at Christmas Meryl Streep arrives at Debbie Reynolds' and Carrie Fisher's memorial Dangling kid rescued from a ski lift at Whistler Mountain Police Video Shows Rescue Of Kidnapped Man Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds are buried together Pictured: The Fort Lauderdale 'air rage' gunman who 'argued...

For the past five years, SoundExchange has been one of the music industry's few bright spots in a transitional and contracting market. In that time, the non-profit entity which collects and distributes digital royalties for labels and artists for non-interactive transmissions (i.e. Pandora, SiriusXM and others), saw its revenue collections explode 229 percent from $270 million in 2010 to $888 million in 2015. But according to sources with knowledge of the situation, a recent shift to direct licensing will likely lead to slower growth in 2016 and a precipitous drop next year as collections could decrease by about $200 million, according to Billboard estimates. The primary reason for this loss is that some of the major satellite, digital radio and cable music players have begun moving away from using a compulsory license for recorded music and are instead signing direct deals with record labels. Under the compulsory license, U.S. regulations say digital services must pay all royalties to SoundExchange, which disburses payments to record labels, (50 percent of royalties); recording artists (45 percent of royalties); and side musicians and singers' unions (5 percent of royalties). Since its creation in 2003, the use of compulsory licenses have dominated the digital landscape for programmed music -- until recently. “We've been warning SoundExchange for years that direct licensing will eventually impact their business model and they need to get ready for it,” said one source in the digital services camp. While SoundExchange declined to comment for this story, sources insist that the collections organization has been doing just that: looking for new income streams. This trend of labels and services cutting direct deals mimics what’s been going on in music publishing, where the majors have begun cutting direct deals with Pandora, iTunes Radio and Apple Music. One of the benefits of direct deals for the services is that they cut out any administrative fees. Beginning in 2014, Pandora cut a direct deal with Merlin, the global indie label rights organization that negotiates and administers licensing deals. Meanwhile, Apple’s radio-like services, including first iTunes Radio and then Apple Music's radio component Beats 1, have never used a compulsory license or paid any royalties to SoundExchange. And in the last two years, SiriusXM has aggressively cut direct deals with indie labels, although the satellite radio broadcaster is still largely reliant on the compulsory license for sound recordings. Sirius has cut deals with about 500 indie labels that comprise about 6% of its plays, according to its filing with the CRB for its ongoing proceeding to determine rates for satellite and cable TV radio for 2018-2022. Now that Pandora is entering the on-demand streaming business, it too has begun cutting a slew of direct deals with major labels, Merlin and many of the remaining indie labels. Those direct deals are not only covered in its on-demand service slated to launch in 2017, but they also cover its custom radio service started in Q4 of 2016. While SoundExchange will miss out on collecting and dispersing label royalties from most of Pandora's direct deals, it will still process payments to recording artists and unions, which is why income growth will likely slow slightly for 2016 and fall off more in 2017. Through the third quarter of 2016, Pandora operated under a compulsory license and paid about $525 million in royalties to SoundExchange, of which about $125 million went to publishing and about $400 million for sound recordings, Billboard estimates. Under the statutory split, $200 million of the $400 million was paid out to the labels and $200 million to the artists and musician unions. Billboard estimates that the major labels and Merlin comprised at least 90 percent, or $180 million, of label payouts from Pandora. That means that in 2017, if Pandora stays the same size, SoundExchange will only get paid about $200 million for the artist and musician’s share and $20 million for indie labels not affiliated with the majors or Merlin, resulting in SoundExchange losing an estimated $180 million in revenue. Billboard was unable to estimate the size of revenue that the Sirius direct deals amounted to, nor could Billboard determine which labels had the clout to demand direct payments from Pandora. In 2014 -- before the majors jumped aboard the direct deal wagon -- when Merlin cut its first direct deal with Pandora, SoundExchange refused to administer the artist payments unless it could also administer and get its cut from the Merlin labels, too, sources say. Changes in Overhead Costs That revenue shortfall represents a double-edged sword to SoundExchange in that it could impact its overhead expense structure, too. Since 2010, its overhead costs have grown from $18 million in 2010 to $41 million in 2015, which works out to an administrative fee of 4.6 percent of revenue, something that SoundExchange touts at the top of its home page as the lowest in the industry. Performance Rights Organizations like BMI and ASCAP, in comparison, charge an administrative fee of about 13 percent of revenue. Sometimes the administrative fee is negotiated and determined beforehand, but most often PROs like ASCAP, BMI and other collections organizations total their operating costs and use that number as the numerator, put it against total revenue as the denominator, and that fraction determines the administration fee. So when SoundExchange had expenses of $41 million against $888 million in revenue in 2015, that worked out to the aforementioned 4.6 percent. But that low percentage is not just a measure of SoundExchange’s efficiency, as others point out; it also represents the explosive growth of Pandora and Sirius, the two digital services paying the most in royalties to the agency. In fact, some sources in the digital sector say SoundExchange has neglected the growth of Pandora and Sirius when taking credit for having the industry’s lowest administration fee of all U.S. collection organizations. For example, if Pandora had direct deals in 2015, SoundExchange's revenue would have only been $708 million, not $888 million, so its expense ratio would instead have been 5.8 percent of revenue ($41 million overhead/$708 million in revenue), not 4.6 percent. Without the $180 million in revenue, SoundExchange’s overhead costs suffer an $8.28 million shortfall. Making Up for Lost Revenues With compulsory licenses by digital services dropping off, SoundExchange has been pursuing other income streams, like administering Sirius’ two pre-1972 settlements -- the first for the majors and ABKCO; the second for the Turtles -- which combined could add up to $235 million and more than offset the Pandora decline. But while those deals may help the company maintain top line collections growth for 2017, do they pay enough in administration fees to maintain the $41 million level in overhead? And what does SoundExchange do for an encore to offset the defection of Pandora to direct deals? In addition to those two pre-1972 deals, SoundExchange is now administering 13 other direct deals, sources report, some for digital services that previously used compulsory licenses, but others from deals the PRO normally wouldn’t have handled three or four years ago, those sources say. Also, some suggest that SoundExchange is exploring ways to get into the administration of mechanical royalties. That would represent a whole new licensing sector for the agency As for Sirius, it's unclear if any of the Sirius direct deals are paying the labels directly, but the satellite radio service could pose another revenue shortfall problem for SoundExchange. It is proposing that the CRB rule that its royalty payments to labels be in the range of 8.1% to 11% for the 2018-2022 term. Sirius says that the 500 direct deals it has cut "fully adjusted suggest a reasonable royalty rate of no more than 9.87% of Sirius revenue," which is less than the 11% rate Sirius is set to pay in 2017. If the CRB Judges agree with Sirius, its payments to SoundExchange going forward may be slightly less than what they are currently. On the other hand, the challenges posed by direct licensing in 2017 may also be a one-year blip if things go SoundExchange’s way with the Copyright Royalty Board. It is proposing that beginning in 2018 Sirius should be paying Sound Exchange 23% of income which would produce a windfall of $600 million in incremental revenue for SoundExchange, Billboard estimates. If that happens, then Sound Exchange's salad days could be starting all over again.

The problem has generated some creative solutions: wrap the wires over your ear, the website Lifehacker recommends. SiliconBeat has tried this, and while the earphone may not plummet from the ear to drag on the ground, the speaker still ends up pulling out, requiring frequent re-insertion. “If you’d prefer a more hacked-together approach you can always make your own hooks from twist ties,” Lifehacker suggests as an alternative to hog-tying your lobes. Ever-fashionable SiliconBeat refuses to try this method (why not duct tape if you’re really going to go the DIY route?). But there’s hope, perhaps, at least for users of Apple products. The company in June filed for a patent — made public by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Dec. 29 — for earphones that are clamped to the ear with magnets. To be sure, Apple CEO Tim Cook recently claimed Apple’s new wireless “AirPods” have never fallen from his ears because there are no wires to snag on things or drag the earphones down. But Cook, reports said, was referring to time he spent wearing the earphones while walking, using treadmills and dancing — and it could reasonably be assumed that the latter activity, for the tech honcho, would involve classic dad moves rather than spinning on his head. It appears Cook may have ears shaped favorably for his product, but the AirPods experience was different for Sean O’Kane at tech website The Verge. “Every time I wear AirPods it’s a constant battle to keep them in,” O’Kane wrote. “They don’t fall out immediately, and when I first twist them in I can get what feels like a snug fit. But they inevitably slide out, especially in my right ear.” Apple’s patent application noted that for active people, and participants in sports, “earphones can move and/or become dislodged, either ruining the sound quality or falling out completely from a functional position with respect to a user’s ear.” Apple’s possible solution goes beyond the over-the-ear hooks that some sports-specific earphones use. An ear hook would contain a magnet, as would the body of the earphone. Put the magnets on either side of the ear, and the speaker would remain firmly in place during vigorous movement, the application suggested. It remains to be seen whether Apple will produce such earphones, as patent applications do not necessarily lead to actual products.   Image: A drawing from an Apple patent application for earphones held to the ear with magnets (U.S. Patent and Trademark Office) Share this: Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Google More Pinterest Tumblr   Tags: AirPods, Apple, application, ear buds, ear phones, earbuds, earphones, magnets, patent   More Posts in 1 Apple sued over girl’s death at hands of driver ‘distracted’ by FaceTime video call December 30, 2016   What do Airbnb users want in 2017?

Opinion: this will be a pivotal year for the Mac By Gary Marshall | Dec 29, 2016, 10.13 PM IST FacebookLinkedinTwitterGoogle+Reddit Continue reading In December, Microsoft made a surprising announcement: more Mac users are switching to Surface devices than ever before, partly due to “the disappointment of the new MacBook Pro.” It’s important to take rivals’ claims with a huge pinch of salt, of course, but at the same time the ever popular MacRumors’ Buyer’s Guide was only willing to recommend a single Mac, the same new MacBook Pro. The MacBook was labelled with "caution", and the MacBook Air, iMac, Mac Mini and Mac Pro were – and at the time of writing, still are – labelled with big red “don’t buy” buttons. You can see why. All of those Macs are massively overdue updates, assuming Apple intends to update them at all. The worst offender is the “innovation my ass” Mac Pro, which hasn’t been touched since its debut three years ago. In computing, that’s an eternity. After years of rising sales, Macs are in decline. According to Strategy Analytics, the decline increased from a 3% year-on-year drop in the fourth quarter of 2015 to a 17% drop in the third quarter of 2016. Strategy Analytics’ senior analyst Eric Smith has an explanation: he says that Apple “pretty much forgot about the Mac” in 2016. He’s not the only person who thinks that Macs aren’t Apple’s top priority, and that they haven’t been for some years now. Are we seeing the last gasp of the Mac? It just doesn’t work You can pin some of the blame for the lack of exciting new Macs on chip suppliers, who haven’t delivered what Apple’s hardware needs to make updates necessary or attractive. Mac updates were similarly sluggish just before Hell froze over and Apple moved from PowerPC to Intel processors. But people’s concerns aren’t just about the lack of hardware excitement. The software is making some Mac fans nervous, too. Here’s a genuine example: we’d have started this piece earlier, but a minor update to macOS Sierra borked our iMac’s boot disk and took most of our morning with it. The last update killed Boot Camp on our MacBook Pro. We’re battling intermittent Finder errors on our MacBook Air. And don’t get us started on iCloud Drive, Siri or iTunes. Our experience is not unusual. Legendary tech commentator Walt Mossberg wrote early in 2016 that “I’ve noticed a gradual degradation in the quality and reliability of Apple’s core apps, on both the mobile iOS operating system and its Mac OS X platform,” he wrote. While the core apps generally still work beautifully, the “it just works” mantra no longer applies.  We share the LA Times’ exasperation at Preview’s endless crashes, and we’ll happily echo Marco Arment’s lament that “just a few years ago, we would have relentlessly made fun of Windows users for these same bugs on their inferior OS, but we can’t talk anymore.”  How to fix common macOS problems Even John Gruber, aka Daring Fireball, was moved to write that “Maybe we expect too much from Apple’s software. But Apple’s hardware doesn’t have little problems like this.”  The reason is obvious. Apple’s concentrating most of its resources on the iPhone, which is where it makes most of its money and which requires significant annual updates, and on the iPad, which it sees as the future of general purpose computing. New Macs are coming in 2017 – the iMac, at least, is due to be updated imminently – but it’s clear that Apple’s attention is elsewhere. Will it come back? In many respects, Apple’s Mac business looks very much like its Mac business of the 1980s: solid but uninspiring, and focused on maximising profits rather than finding the next insanely great thing. The current product range echoes that too: Apple no longer sticks to Steve Jobs’ grid of four distinct Mac lines (consumer desktop, consumer laptop, pro desktop, pro laptop).  But what’s different this time around is that the Mac isn’t Apple’s core business any more. Mobile is.  Since 2009, the iPhone has jumped from 25% of Apple’s revenues to 68%; while Apple shipped 4.2 million Macs in Q3 2016, it shipped 40.4 million iPhones and 9.9 million Macs.  You don’t need to be an accountant to recognize that Apple without the Mac would still be one of the most successful and highly profitable companies in the world. Macs in a post-PC world “The Macintosh line of computers is 32 years old”, writes former Apple executive Jean-Louis Gassée. “It has a venerable past… but what kind of future does it have in a declining market?” As Gassée rightly points out, the Mac is still big business: $22 billion in annual revenue for the year just gone isn’t bad at all, and of course Apple’s profit margins remain huge. But is it a business Apple wants to keep, when the future increasingly looks ARM-powered and iPad shaped? Industry analyst Horace Dediu is well known for his perceptive analysis of Apple. While he’s quick to applaud the Mac’s continued success, he argues that thinking in terms of Macs vs PCs is a distraction. It’s Macs vs mobile now. “What exactly is the purpose of the Mac in the age of the mobile device?” he asks.  It’s a rhetorical question. “It cannot take on the role of being the future,” - that’s the iPhone’s job. And “it will not morph into a touch device any more than a teen’s parent will become cool by putting on skinny jeans.” For Dediu, “What it will do is become better at what it is hired to do.” And that’s to deliver non-touchscreen input in jobs where it makes sense to do so. Touch interfaces can be great, but there are some tasks for which the good old keyboard and mouse (or trackpad) and perhaps Touch Bar are better suited. “Alternative ways of doing the jobs it does will with direct input are emerging, but they are not yet good enough,” Dediu argues.  For as long as that’s the case, there will still be Macs.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple is running into a lot of battery problems this year, it seems. First it was the iPhone 6s, then it was the new MacBook Pro. Now, users are saying the Apple AirPods case isn’t holding up to 24 hours of juice as promised. Redditors are complaining about issues rather publicly, and it’s not just a single person with a problem. “I started with 100 percent level for both the buds and case yesterday, I used the buds for maybe 3 hours then put them back into the case. This morning my case is at 50 percent,” one user complained. “Seriously! This is not even close to the 24 hours. The other 2 days I used about 5 hours and the case was already down to 30 percent.” Another user had this to say: “My case drained about 10-15 percent overnight. So the sleep time isn’t long on these for some reason. Most likely due to the fact that they may not actually “turn off”. I know some other [Bluetooth] buds I have don’t drain this quickly and can stay idle for a good month or two before dying.” Can Apple update the AirPods case? It’s unclear what’s causing the battery of the case to drain so quickly. Theoretically, it should be able to idle just fine and power the headphones as needed, whether they’re powered on or not. It sounds like it may be attempting to charge buds after they’re filled, which might explain the battery drain. I’m not sure, though, and I haven’t used mine enough to see similar issues. Maybe Apple needs to issue a software update to the AirPods case. Can it even do that? Apple hasn’t commented on the matter yet.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

Tough Call Parsing the impulsive president-elect's stance on encryption is tricky. Here, a look at how the encryption issue could unfold in 2017. [Photo: Flickr user Michael Vadon] Mark Sullivan 12.29.16 3:00 PM Judging by Donald Trump’s statements about Apple on the campaign trail, you'd think privacy advocates and tech company attorneys would be nervous about attacks on encryption in 2017. They probably are—and they should be. But what the president-elect actually thinks about the matter is a mystery. As we've seen during his transition process, what he said while campaigning may not fit into his plans for governing. So figuring out where he might land on the encryption debate takes a bit of guesswork. First, let's recap. Apple became the poster child for strong encryption this year when the FBI publicly demanded the company hack into an iPhone to access evidence on the 2015 terrorist attack in San Bernardino. Apple held the line, explaining repeatedly that if it were to weaken the encryption on one phone, the encryption on all phones of that type would be weakened, too. Decrypting one iPhone would in effect create an opening through which some clever bad apple could wreak all kinds of chaos. The FBI eventually withdrew its request for a warrant to compel Apple to help. While other presidential candidates were circumspect on the matter, Trump came down strongly on the side of law enforcement, stating that Apple should unlock the phone in question. "Who do they think they are!?" he said. Apple eventually won the PR war, successfully spreading the message that weakening encryption hurts everybody and works against both national security and law enforcement interests. The Argument That Trump Will Uphold Strong Encryption Despite his earlier comments, Trump may not buy the FBI’s argument that tech companies build encryption "backdoors" into their products, either. Over the past several weeks, Trump has shown no compunction of reversing himself on his campaign promises. (He has softened his tone on immediately dismantling Obamacare, for instance.) He continues to appear impulsive and unpredictable, seemingly glomming onto the opinion of the last person he spoke to. Trump’s handlers' advice for those of us trying to make sense of it all? "Take him seriously, not literally." And there are more concrete indicators that Trump could become pro-encryption. Earlier this month, Tim Cook sat in a room with Trump and a bunch of other tech leaders to talk about how Silicon Valley and the government can work together. Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg was there. So was Peter Thiel, who we can officially call the Trump Whisperer. Thiel isn’t likely to advise Trump to take any action that might harm encryption. Thiel serves on the board at Facebook, and Facebook’s business relies on strong encryption as much as Apple’s does, if not more. There's also a good chance that weak encryption's biggest proponent, FBI director James Comey, won't be leading the FBI for much longer, since Trump has criticized him in the past. When asked on 60 Minutes if he would keep Comey on as FBI director, the president-elect was offered an evasive, "I'm not sure." (Comey, of course, might have been the single most damaging factor in Hillary Clinton's surprise defeat on November 8.) The Argument That Trump Will Weaken Encryption On the other hand, Trump might decide that encryption backdoors are a good idea. If he does, he may go nuclear—that is, use executive orders—to make tech companies comply. "It is entirely possible for the new administration to totally circumvent the traditional channels of statute in the agency regulation process by going the route of executive orders or presidential policy directives," tech attorney and encryption expert Peter Fu said in an email to Fast Company. Fu says that despite outward appearances, Trump has a very deep data science bench working for him, and they may decide to put their expertise and influence behind law-enforcement goals. "I think this president, more than any other president since Nixon, will test the outer boundaries of executive action, particularly in the world of digital security." Trump might sign an executive order stating that tech companies must build encryption backdoors into their products (hardware or software), and shoulder the significant expense of doing so. And if he's like Nixon, Trump might work behind the scenes to pressure tech companies into providing encryption backdoors, says Fu. Meetings with tech leaders would take place in secret and the public would never know. Or Trump might connect the immigration issue with the encryption issue and insist that encryption backdoors are crucial for monitoring or investigating immigrants the government suspects have bad intentions. At the moment, the encryption issue is on "simmer" in the capital, as one industry source said. No major encryption bills are circulating during Congress's holiday recess. But if, after Trump takes office on January 20, any of those scenarios come to pass, tech company lawyers and lobbyists can look forward to a busy 2017 as they fight against backdoors. Lobbying by large tech companies and their associations was already intense through much of 2016, and encryption is still at the top of tech companies’ policy agendas for next year. With the trust of their customers at stake, Apple and Facebook would spare no expense in a battle that would be the biggest tech policy fight in years. For its part, Apple hopes that encryption never comes to a boiling point like it did earlier this year. If it does, it might end up being the issue that defines Tim Cook's tenure as CEO.

And once again, it looks like it was a very good holiday for Apple. App-analytics company Mixpanel tracks new smartphone and tablet activations during the three days after Christmas, giving us an early indication of consumer behavior during a time that many spend with family, friends — and handheld devices. Mixpanel's metrics suggest that iPhones were still the hottest gift in smartphones. Last year, it was all about the 6s, and this year, it was all about Apple's latest model, the iPhone 7. From Dec. 25 to 27, the number of unique active iPhone 7s increased by nearly 13 percent, according to Mixpanel. By contrast, Android devices — including smartphones and tablets — saw a rise of less than 3 percent in the same period of time. Data show, though, that Google's new Pixel smartphone held up better. According to Mixpanel, the number of unique active Google Pixels increased 8.5 percent. The Apple Watch was was still popular, though far less so than last year. In 2015, activations rose nearly 20 percent in the three days after Christmas. This year, they were up just 9 percent. Analysts like Michael Yoshikami, founder and CEO of Destination Wealth Management, say the holiday numbers may be a sign of what's to come in 2017. "I think wearables will continue to be a tough space. I think it really is looking to be more of a fitness market rather than something that people will use for their cellphones," he said. And amid industrywide "phone fatigue," holiday sales could be more important than ever.

Apple: Samsung Gains Ground During Holidays Despite Galaxy Note 7 Recall By AJ Dellinger On 12/29/16 AT 3:00 PM Close Brand loyalty often gets attributed to Apple fanatics who will wait in line for the latest device, but Samsung’s recent struggles revealed a set of consumers similarly set in their ways. According to analysts, Samsung users opted not to switch over to Apple devices or other Android handsets during the holiday season, even in the wake of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 recall. Data from mobile analytics firm Flurry released earlier this week announced Apple dominated the holiday season with the most new device activations, but hidden within the data was another illuminating bit of information: Samsung actually saw more devices activated in 2016 than in 2015. The jump could in part be attributed to the fact one of the Korean manufacturer’s flagship phones, the Galaxy Note 7, was recalled by the millions after reports of the devices exploding. But the figures also mean users who had to ditch their Galaxy Note 7 were making the switch to other Samsung devices rather than jumping to iPhone. Most of those who bought or wanted to buy a Note 7 opted for a different high-end Galaxy phone,” Stephen Baker, a hardware analyst at the NPD Group, told the Wall Street Journal. “Samsung was able to fend off other Android competition, and Apple, too, thanks to Apple’s own lack of a wowing product this year.” Related Stories Apple Vs Samsung Lawsuit Fallout: Apple Wins Patent For Rounded Rectangle Design Apple Vs Samsung Lawsuit: Apple Is Trying To Block iPhone Competition, Says Samsung Samsung has been in the process of removing the Galaxy Note 7 from circulation, discontinuing and recalling the device and pushing out software updates to brick the handsets that have yet to be returned. According to tech research firm Gartner, Samsung suffered its worst smartphone sales drop in its history following the recall, dropping 14.2 percent in year over year sales during the third quarter of 2016. Apple has been a similarly difficult position with its sales of its iPhone sliding in the last few quarters, resulting in the company’s first annual revenue decline since 2001 when it reported earnings in October. Apple is expected to report record-breaking sales figures during when it reports its first quarter earnings in 2017, primarily on the strength of its holiday sales and the popularity of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Senior Indian Government Officials Reportedly meeting with Apple in the New Year to Discuss iPhone Plant Incentives | Main | In Apple's Wearable Device Universe you'll one day wear a Mini iPhone, iPod or Medical Device on your Wrist » December 29, 2016 Apple Advances the Concept of the Apple Watch's Digital Crown Coming to all iDevices eventually   In late July Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Considers using a Digital Crown Mechanism for iPad." It was Apple's first invention whereby they were taking an Apple Watch feature and considering its use in another mobile device. Apple initially noted that the digital crown on an iPad could be used as a volume controller or locking the touch screen, turning on the touch screen, taking a picture, resizing text and other actions. Then in August another invention covering a Digital Crown for an iDevice discussed and illustrated a far more elaborate concept that could be used with a unique 3D UI whereby the user would be able to rotate an interface-cube with each side containing different information. Admittedly that was a rather cool idea as illustrated below. Today's patents focus on bringing haptics to the Digital Crown to enhance the user's experience.   Today's patent applications 20160378187 and 20160378189 as noted in the patent figures below refines Apple's invention that surfaced back in July. Apple's patent FIG. 4 specifically illustrates "an exemplary rotary input that can rotate in a rotational direction as well as be displaced in a direction orthogonal to the rotational direction."   Apple's patent FIG. 8 illustrates an exemplary magnetic implementation of the mechanical input sensor and actuator; FIG. 10 illustrates an example computing system for implementing the mechanical input displacement.   In Apple's summary they note that "Some electronic devices may include mechanical inputs, such as buttons and/or switches. These mechanical inputs can control power (i.e., on/off) and volume for the electronic devices, among other functions. However, sometimes these mechanical inputs can fail to give a user tactile feedback, such as the "click-click-click" feeling of winding a mechanical alarm clock with a knob.   It can be beneficial to provide haptic or tactile feedback to a user who is interacting with a mechanical input of an electronic device to give the user a richer interaction experience with the device.   In some examples, such haptic feedback can constitute giving the user a sensation that the user's finger is moving over a ridge, bump or valley feature on an otherwise smooth surface. This type of sensation can simulate the feeling of the user rotating a mechanical knob against the teeth of an internal gear (e.g., the feeling of a detent when turning a rotary input, such as the "click-click-click" feeling of winding a mechanical watch).   Haptic feedback as described in this patent filing can give the user feedback about the effect of the user's input on the electronic device, such as changing the zoom-scale of content displayed on the device in response to the user's rotary input.   Apple envisions the Digital Crown working across the iPhone, iPad, iPod and Apple Watch. The 3D UI concept would even help Apple Watch users being able to have each side of the cube represent the most used apps like mail, phone calls (future), contacts, games, iWork and so forth. The idea is growing on me, how about you?   Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office.

Government officers race around wooden pallets piled high with boxes — counting, weighing, scanning and approving shipments. Unmarked trucks stretch for more than a mile awaiting the next load headed for Beijing, New York, London and other destinations. The state-of-the-art facility was built several years ago to serve a single global exporter: Apple, now the world’s most valuable company and one of China’s largest retailers. The well-choreographed customs routine is part of a hidden bounty of perks, tax breaks and subsidies in China that supports the world’s biggest iPhone factory, according to confidential government records reviewed by The New York Times, as well as more than 100 interviews with factory workers, logistics handlers, truck drivers, tax specialists and current and former Apple executives. The package of sweeteners and incentives, worth billions of dollars, is central to the production of the iPhone, Apple’s best-selling and most profitable product. It all centres on Zhengzhou, a city of 6 million people in an impoverished region of China. Running at full tilt, the factory here, owned and operated by Apple’s manufacturing partner Foxconn, can produce 5,00,000 iPhones a day. Locals now refer to Zhengzhou as “iPhone City.” The local government has proved instrumental, doling out more than $1.5 billion to Foxconn. It helps cover continuing energy and transportation costs for the operation. It recruits workers for the assembly line. It pays bonuses to the factory for meeting export targets. All of it in support of iPhone production. “We needed something that could really develop this part of the country,” said Li Ziqiang, a Zhengzhou official. “There’s an old saying in China: ‘If you build the nest, the birds will come.’ And now, they’re coming.” The US officials have long decried China’s support of its state-owned companies, calling the subsidies and other aid an unfair competitive advantage in a global marketplace. But the Zhengzhou operation shows the extent of China’s effort to entice overseas multinationals to set up production in the country. Local and provincial officials have courted manufacturers with incentive packages that make it easier and cheaper to do business. Beijing, for decades, has encouraged such efforts at the national level, by developing special economic zones that offer tax breaks to multinationals and exempt them from costly and cumbersome rules. In this way, China is not unlike other countries, including the US, where states and cities vie for companies. To compete in the era of globalisation, multinationals, which face pressure from shareholders and customers, must seek the best opportunities, increasingly by relying on a highly interconnected supply chain spread across the world. In China, the competition for companies is secretive and rarely exposed to public scrutiny or debate — and it is often focused on manufacturing partners, rather than multinationals themselves. While Apple came later than many technology companies, it now generates nearly a quarter of its revenues from sales in China and has some of the fattest profit margins in the business. As such, the Zhengzhou operation provides an especially illustrative look at China’s importance to US technology companies — and specifically iPhone production and, more recently, Apple’s consumer sales. A 32-gigabyte iPhone 7 costs an estimated $400 to produce. It retails for roughly $649 in the US, with Apple taking a piece of the difference as profit. The result: Apple manages to earn 90% of the profits in smartphone industry worldwide, even though it accounts for only 12% of sales, according to Strategy Analytics, a research firm. It is difficult to tally the total value of government benefits for the Zhengzhou operation or to determine the exact effect on the profits of Foxconn or Apple. The subsidies aren’t disclosed by the Chinese government or Foxconn. They aren’t available in public records. And Apple says it was not a party to Foxconn’s negotiations. As China’s largest private employer, Foxconn, a Taiwanese company, has enormous leverage in the negotiations for those incentives. The company’s size and scale is connected to Apple. Foxconn is Apple’s largest supplier. Apple is Foxconn’s largest customer. The two companies are intertwined in Zhengzhou. When the factory opened, Apple was Foxconn’s only customer here. Even now, the US technology company accounts for almost all of the production at the Zhengzhou plant, where about half of the world’s iPhones are made. Apple is also the main exporter using the customs facility here. A growing backlash against globalisation puts Apple and other big multinationals directly in the sightlines of two increasingly combative giants: the US and China. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to bring down the full force of the government on US companies that move jobs overseas, threatening punitive tariffs on the goods they sell back at home. Apple has been a frequent target of Trump. China, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, is growing less tolerant and more suspicious of Western influence, particularly US technology companies and the huge influence they have over Chinese consumers. A state-owned publication called Apple one of the “guardian warriors” that have “seamlessly penetrated” China and may pose a threat to national security. National security review Regulators shut down Apple’s iTunes Movies and iBooks Store last spring. The Chinese authorities fined the technology giant for failure to fully pay its taxes. And Apple went through a national security review in China for the iPhone 6, delaying its release in the country. Apple is now engaged in the corporate version of shuttle diplomacy. In December, the company’s chief executive, Timothy Cook, along with other Silicon Valley executives, met with Trump in New York, part of an effort to build bridges with the incoming administration. China and the US are playing a high-stakes game. The iPhone is a collection of intricate parts that are made around the world and assembled in China, spurring employment in many countries; Apple says it supports 2 million jobs in the United States. As China and the US both brandish a new form of economic nationalism, they risk disrupting the system, without necessarily achieving their goals. And multinationals and their manufacturing partners would face serious financial trade-offs. As the Zhengzhou operation shows, China not only provides a large pool of labour; it also offers incentives that would be difficult to replicate in the United States or anywhere else. The benefits in Zhengzhou flow through the production process for the iPhone, from the factory floor to the retail store. Foxconn receives a bonus when it meets targets for exports. Those subsidies, according to the government records, totalled $56 million in the first two years of production, when the factory was exclusively dedicated to the iPhone. The Zhengzhou government eliminated corporate taxes and value-added taxes that Foxconn pays for the first five years of production; they are half the usual rate for the next five. The customs operation is also in a so-called bonded zone, an area that China essentially considers foreign soil, subject to different import and export rules. This setup allows Apple to sell iPhones more easily to Chinese consumers.

In the third quarter alone, Apple, as a company that had never produced a firmware for a mobile, let alone a phone on its own[1], sold 270,000 phones and ended up bringing 6.1 million iPhones over the counter in just 6 quarters. Android Image source: George Thomas – Flickr Far more amazing than Apple’s sales is how technology evolves, especially to someone who has no background in this what so ever. In fact, Apple considers the first generation  iPhone ‘obsolete’ on a worldwide scale since 2013. Think about this: an invention that had revolutionized the entire mobile industry 6 years before is already ‘out of date’. In 2007, this first-gen iPhone was so successful that Apple’s chances to take over the market were fairly realistic. There needed to be an alternative and for someone to provide it. A Different Approach Apple’s AppStore for iOS is partially vertically closed towards app developers. Silicon Valley’s favorite not only takes in 30 percent of application software sales revenue, it also maintains total control over which apps you see on your phone. Google’s PlayStore (what was originally the Android Market) has a different approach: even though not being open-sourced, Google’s application downloader only makes developers subject to entering into a free-of-charge licensing agreement with Google, as long as its compatibility requirements are applied. This includes pre-installing Google products such as Gmail or the PlayStore (something that the IB Times apparently considers a huge scandal). Out of the current almost 2.5 million apps on PlayStore, only 12 percent are paid-apps. Google’s software offer is more diverse and less costly. Open-Source Community Android has an active community of developers who use the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) source code to develop and distribute their own modified versions of the operating system. The advantage here is that innovation is reached faster than through the developer, becoming a sort of open-world idea pool. Apple’s iPhone is stuck in the last decade when it comes to acceptance of jailbreaking, meaning to remove software restrictions of the developer in order to install additional applications or features. The company even threatens warranty expirations should customers chose to jailbreak their phone. The Android system has adopted more of a laissez-faire attitude to this situation: companies such as Sony, HTC, Samsung or Motorola now encourage (HTC’s bootloader) or provide support for third-party developers. The Use of Knowledge in Society Google’s approach to openly provide access to app developers and coders of new themes and extensions to software, that the creators hadn’t even thought about, relies on the principle that knowledge is dispersed in society, and that it cannot only reside in the heads of a few people at Apple. After the 2007 release of the very first iPhone, the possibility of Apple overtaken the entire mobile market was an imminent threat, not only to companies such as Samsung or Sony, but to customers who in the face of a monopoly would have been stuck between their old mobiles or the costly innovation of Steve Jobs. Google seized to opportunity and implemented a policy that no anti-trust law could have outperformed.

We’ve known for a while that Apple is working on three different iPhones for the 2017 generation, and while the first two are likely to come with the same dimensions as the existing models, the third has been pretty much an enigma for all of us. Digitimes, however, claims that Taiwan-based supply chain makers are already aware of Apple’s plans to build a third model with a 5.8-inch display that would be manufactured by Samsung. This particular model is expected to boast an OLED panel, just like we’ve heard before, and feature a new form factor, possibly without bezels and a Home button. It goes without saying that we should all take this report with a pinch of salt, but the same source says that Apple will stick with LCD panels for the two other mode... » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit Headline News - 1 week ago< > Embed Apple Beats Samsung To Top Holiday Phone Activations 00:45 According to new research released Tuesday, Mobile-app analytics firm Flurry found that about 44 percent of new phone activations during the holidays were Apple's iPhones, compared with Samsung's 21 percent.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

However, the first leaked benchmark for the next-generation Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 is troubling, because it seems to indicate next year’s Galaxy S8 might not even be as powerful as this year’s iPhone 7, let alone whatever new flagship phones Apple has planned for 2017. Don't Miss: Laying bricks like giant dominos is the laziest, most impressive way to work Historically, Samsung phones have not been able to beat Apple’s iPhone line when it comes to real-world performance tests. Same-year Galaxy S and Galaxy Note models never top iPhones released in the same calendar year. In fact last year, the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy Note 7 couldn’t even top the older iPhone 6s in these tests, which speaks volumes for Apple’s mobile chips. The iPhones also beat Android handsets in benchmark tests from Geekbench and AnTuTu. The iPhone 7 is significantly faster than its predecessor and it outperforms every other Android phone out there. But all these devices sport 14nm and 16nm chips, while next year’s chips will be built on 10nm process technology. It wouldn’t be unreasonable to expect that new Qualcomm and Samsung chips to perform better than the older A10 Fusion chip in the iPhone 7, right? qualcomm-snapdragon-835-geekbench-benchmarkMore According to Phone Arena, a leaked Geekbench test of the Snapdragon 835 that’s going into the Galaxy S8 shows a single-core score of 1844 and a multi-core score of 5426. That might seem impressive, but that’s still not as impressive as the iPhone 7, which has an average score of around 3300 in single-core and about 5400 in multicore tests. In fact, the purported single-core Snapdragon 835 score is within within reach of current Android devices. That’s a bit concerning and could indicate that Qualcomm and Samsung still have a long way to go until they catch Apple. Assuming this test is real, we’ll point out the fact that we might be looking at Snapdragon 835 versions that aren’t finalized (though it’s a bit late in the game for significant modifications).

Happy New Year firework wallpapers   skip to main content skip to main menu     NYT details Foxconn’s Zhengzhou facility that manufactures iPhones on a massive scale By Christian Zibreg, Dec 29, 2016 Tweet 9 Comments Most of the iPhone models Apple develops, markets and sells are being assembled by Foxconn, the world’s leading contract manufacturer. In a new investigative piece, The New York Times newspaper delves into the inner workings of Foxconn’s iPhone manufacturing plant in Zhengzhou, a city of six million people in an impoverished region of China. Fun fact: the world’s biggest iPhone factory, referred to as “iPhone City” by the locals, is capable of churning out half a million iPhones per day at peak. Author David Barboza was able to uncover confidential government records and had to conduct a bunch of interviews with logistics handlers, truck drivers, factory workers, tax specialists and executives from Apple and Foxconn to paint an accurate picture of the massive scale of Apple’s operations in China. For starters, “iPhone City” is responsible for half the world’s iPhone output. An excerpt from the report: A crushing work force begins arriving for the early shift at 6:30 a.m. They travel by foot, by bus, by motor scooter and even by pedicab. They file steadily into dozens of factory sites, spread out across 2.2 square miles. At the peak, some 350,000 workers assemble, test and package iPhones — up to 350 a minute. The government pays recruiters a subsidy for every worker they hire, Mr. Liu said. “If the demand is high, then they will pay more,” he said. “If the demand is low, then the payment will be low, too.” It is no secret that Foxconn built the Zhengzhou facility with “billions in perks” and a “hidden bounty of benefits tax breaks and subsidies” by the Zhengzhou government. Decades ago, China created special economic zones that offer tax breaks to multinationals and exempt them from costly and cumbersome rules. Beijing has never disclosed the total value of benefits and subsidies for the Zhengzhou operation. Apple said it was not a party to Foxconn’s negotiations. What we do know is that Zhengzhou did pledge to spend more than $10 billion to vastly expand an airport just a few miles from the iPhone factory to expedite Apple’s global shipments. You can see a model of that airport on the image below. Some of the perks supplied to Foxconn by the Zhengzhou government include: Built and partly financed the construction of a huge manufacturing complex at a cost of $600 million. Spent around $1 billion to build housing that could accommodate hundreds of thousands of workers. Provides a discount that reduces the cost of power by 5 percent annually. Built infrastructure, including power generators and a 24-kilometer pipeline. Eliminated corporate taxes and value added taxes for five years, then halved the usual rate for the next five years. Granted a $250 million loan from the municipal treasury. Helps recruit and train workers, as well as paying subsidies for new hires. Lowered the amount of social insurance and other payments by up to $100 million a year. Offers bonuses tied to the growth of exports. Pays out a subsidy to help defray the cost of shipping goods. In the mid-1980s, Apple used to manufacture Macs in its own factories in Texas and California. Following Jobs’s return at Apple’s helm in the late 1990s, Apple partnered with Foxconn and moved all production overseas. Foxconn’s heft and expertise has allowed Apple to build the original iPod and other products on a huge scale that would not have been possible if the firm hadn’t outsourced production to China. The location of Foxconn’s “iPhone City”. Ahead of the original iPhone’s launch, Foxconn considered offers by officials from various cities before eventually choosing Zhengzhou for its huge manufacturing plant. The city even provided a $250 million loan to Foxconn, with government subsidies totaling $56 million in the facility’s first two years of iPhone manufacturing. Jeff Williams, Apple’s current chief operating officer who was Tim Cook’s right-hand man back then, was part of the early discussions about setting up a factory. “I was impressed,” Williams told the paper. “They were very focused.” In 2014, the Zhengzhou facility had 94 production lines for iPhone 6 and iPhone 5s. Foxconn’s ability to produce Apple gadgets on a truly massive scale was first tested with the introduction of the original iPod music player, according to the following illustrative excerpt from the investigative piece: When Apple’s sales took off after the introduction of the iPod in 2001, Foxconn had the heft and expertise to meet the demand that accompanied each hit product. Foxconn’s factories could quickly produce prototypes, increase production and, during peak periods, hire hundreds of thousands of workers. Foxconn founder Terry Gou provided political clout, spending years building relationships with Chinese officials and lobbying for subsidies, cheap land, workers and infrastructure for his firm’s facilities. According to former Apple executive Joe O’Sullivan, Foxconn has some “brilliant tooling engineers”. They earned Apple’s respect by showing willingness “to invest a lot” over the years in order to keep pace with Apple’s explosive growth. Tony Fadell, another former Apple executive also known as the iPod Godfather, attributed Foxconn’s impressive growth to the managerial skills of Terry Gou. “He said he’d create the manufacturing, and the Chinese government would give him some of the money to do it,” Fadell told NYT’s Barboza. “As Terry grew with the Apple business, no one else could compete,” he continued. Apple said it was aware of the government’s infrastructure support given to Foxconn, but underscored it had no knowledge of specific grants, subsidies or tax breaks. Foxconn on its part said in a separate statement to the paper that the government support it has received over the years was “no different than similar tax breaks all companies get in locations around the world for major investments.” Top image: Foxconn workers leaving at the end of the day shift through the gates of the Zhengzhou bonded zone.

On December 20 the WSJ basically covered the same news. Today the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) has followed-up on their report with newer information.   According to a new WSJ report, "Indian government officials will likely meet early next week to evaluate the incentives sought by Apple Inc. to manufacture its products in the country, two people familiar with the matter said.   Senior officials from the Ministries of Trade, Finance, Electronics and Information Technology, Forests and Environment are expected to participate in the meeting, one of the people said.   The Indian government has incentives to promote local manufacturing under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Make in India' campaign, and it remains to be seen whether they would agree to more concessions for Apple.   The country has a program that provides capital subsidies for companies manufacturing electronics in India. Another program provides subsidies for investments in special economic zones and allows tax-free imports of some components used to make mobile handsets.   "The government will have to see if it can tweak its rules for one company, though we want it to produce in India," a government official said. For more on this read the full WSJ report here.   Perhaps Apple should just be blunt and make the Indians around the negotiations table, one at a time, yell and repeat the line: Show me the Money!

Photosets’ in-app Camera is intended for Wide Color Motion Photography & Motion Photoshoot applications, and produces Wide Color Motion Photosets (thus the app name, Photosets). A singular Motion Photoset is simply a set of photos, intended to capture “the motion” of your photo subject. When you hit the camera’s Start button, Photosets will typically capture up-to 30 photos per Burst (or up-to 45 photos per Burst, if you have an iPhone 7 Plus) … note that each captured photo will have a resolution of 8 Mpx … note also that if you’re using an Apple mobile device with a 12 Mpx image sensor, all Zoomed-In capture photos will have 24% higher quality than if captured with an 8 Mpx image sensor !

X Inside China’s ‘iPhone City’, the land of sweeteners and perks Facility can produce 500,000 iPhones per day and even allows for an Irish tax advantage Thu, Dec 29, 2016, 17:17 Drivers at a rest area between Zhengzhou and Shanghai in China.

The facility can produce 500,000 iPhones a day. Photograph: The New York Times Previous Image Next Image Previous Images More Images         A vast, boxy customs centre acts as a busy island of commerce deep in central China. Government officers, in sharply pressed uniforms, race around a maze of wooden pallets piled high with boxes, counting, weighing, scanning and approving shipments. Unmarked trucks stretch for more than a mile awaiting the next load headed for Beijing, New York, London and dozens of other destinations. The state-of-the-art facility was built several years ago to serve a single global exporter: Apple, now the world’s most valuable company and one of China’s largest retailers. The well-choreographed customs routine is part of a hidden bounty of perks, tax breaks and subsidies in China that supports the world’s biggest iPhone factory, according to confidential government records reviewed by the New York Times, as well as more than 100 interviews with factory workers, logistics handlers, truck drivers, tax specialists and current and former Apple executives. The package of sweeteners and incentives, worth billions of dollars, is central to the production of the iPhone, Apple’s best-selling and most profitable product. It all centres on Zhengzhou, a city of six million people in an impoverished region of China. Running at full tilt, the factory here, owned and operated by Apple’s manufacturing partner Foxconn, can produce 500,000 iPhones a day. Locals now refer to Zhengzhou as “iPhone City”. The local government has proved instrumental, doling out more than $1.5 billion (€1.43 billion) to Foxconn to build large sections of the factory and nearby employee housing. It paved roads and built power plants. It helps cover continuing energy and transportation costs for the operation. It recruits workers for the assembly line. It pays bonuses to the factory for meeting export targets. All of it in support of iPhone production. Build the nest “We needed something that could really develop this part of the country,” said Li Ziqiang, a Zhengzhou official. ADVERTISEMENT “There’s an old saying in China: ‘If you build the nest, the birds will come.’ And now, they’re coming.” US officials have long decried China’s support of its state-owned companies, calling the subsidies and other aid an unfair competitive advantage in a global marketplace. But the Zhengzhou operation shows the extent of China’s effort to entice overseas multinationals to set up production facilities in the country. Local and provincial officials, in an effort to create jobs and drive growth, have courted manufacturers with incentive packages that make it easier and cheaper to do business. Beijing, for decades, has encouraged such efforts at the national level, by developing special economic zones that offer tax breaks to multinationals and exempt them from costly and cumbersome rules. China’s lure is strong. Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Samsung have all flocked to the country to lower their production costs, bolster their bottom lines and tap into the world’s largest consumer market. And many rely on local manufacturing partners such as Foxconn. While Apple came later than many technology companies, it now generates nearly a quarter of its revenues from sales in China and has some of the fattest profit margins in the business. As such, the Zhengzhou operation provides an especially illustrative look at China’s importance to US technology companies, and specifically iPhone production and more recently, Apple’s consumer sales. A 32-gigabyte iPhone 7 costs an estimated $400 to produce. It retails for roughly $649 in the United States, with Apple taking a piece of the difference as profit. The result: Apple manages to earn 90 per cent of the profits in the smartphone industry worldwide, even though it accounts for only 12 per cent of the sales, according to Strategy Analytics, a research firm. It is difficult to tally the total value of government benefits for the Zhengzhou operation or to determine the exact effect on the profits of Foxconn or Apple. The subsidies aren’t disclosed by the Chinese government or Foxconn. They aren’t available in public records. And Apple says it was not a party to Foxconn’s negotiations. Confidential records The confidential government records obtained by the New York Times detail multiple meetings over several years in which Zhengzhou city officials discussed their “support” for iPhone production, calling the benefits a “preferential policy.” The records offer a snapshot of those benefits, including the specific aid for Foxconn in multiple areas, such as infrastructure, labour, taxes and exports. As China’s largest private employer, Foxconn, a Taiwanese company, has enormous leverage in the negotiations for those incentives. The company’s size and scale – and the sway that they afford in China – is connected to Apple. Foxconn is Apple’s largest supplier. Apple is Foxconn’s largest customer. The two companies are intertwined in Zhengzhou. When the factory opened, Apple was Foxconn’s only customer here. Even now, the US technology company accounts for almost all of the production at the Zhengzhou plant, where about half of the world’s iPhones are made. Apple is also the main exporter using the customs facility here. In response to questions, Apple said it was aware of the Chinese government’s infrastructure support. But the company added that it had no knowledge of specific grants, subsidies or tax breaks given to its manufacturing partner. Foxconn, in a separate statement, said it was grateful for the support of the government, noting that it was “no different than similar tax breaks all companies get in locations around the world for major investments”. A growing backlash against globalisation puts Apple and other big multinationals directly in the sightlines of two increasingly combative giants: the US and China. US president-elect Donald Trump has vowed to bring down the full force of the government on US companies that move jobs overseas, threatening punitive tariffs on the goods they sell back at home. Apple has been a frequent target of Trump, who said during the campaign that he would get the technology company to “build their damn computers and things in this country”. ADVERTISEMENT Western influence China, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, is growing less tolerant and more suspicious of western influence, particularly US technology companies and the huge influence they have over Chinese consumers. A state-owned publication called Apple one of the “guardian warriors” that have “seamlessly penetrated” China and may pose a threat to national security. China, no longer content with just being the world’s factory floor, is moving aggressively to develop its own technology giants. Beijing is pressuring local governments to cut subsidy programmes that the country heartily encouraged even just a few years ago. And big exporters, courted and protected for decades by Beijing, now face broad scrutiny. Chinese regulators shut down Apple’s iTunes Movies and iBooks Store last spring, just six months after the services were introduced in China. The Chinese authorities fined the technology giant for failing to pay taxes. And Apple went through a national security review in China for the iPhone 6, delaying its release in the country. Apple is now engaged in the corporate version of shuttle diplomacy. In December, the company’s chief executive, Tim Cook, along with other Silicon Valley executives, met Trump in New York, part of an effort to build bridges with the incoming administration. It followed a similar goodwill tour in China in August, when Cook sat down with the country’s vice premier at Zhongnanhai, the government’s walled leadership compound in what was once part of Beijing’s Imperial City. The two countries are playing a high-stakes game. Apple, like many multinationals, depends on a vast global supply chain that includes multiple companies and countries, each with its own expertise and advantages – a complexity that is often lost in the political debate over trade. The iPhone is a collection of intricate parts that are made around the world and assembled in China, spurring employment in many countries; Apple says it supports two million jobs in the US. As China and the US both brandish a new form of economic nationalism, they risk disrupting the system, without necessarily achieving their goals. And multinationals and their manufacturing partners would face serious financial trade-offs. As the Zhengzhou operation shows, China not only provides a large pool of labour; it also offers incentives that would be difficult to replicate in the US or anywhere else. The trove of benefits in Zhengzhou flows through the production process for the iPhone, from the factory floor to the retail store. Export targets Foxconn receives a bonus when it meets targets for exports. Those subsidies, according to the government records, totalled $56 million in the first two years of production, when the factory was exclusively dedicated to the iPhone. The bonus is small on each of the tens of millions of iPhones produced during that period. But the subsidies add up: The government records list more than a dozen other forms of financial aid at the Zhengzhou operation. The Zhengzhou government eliminated corporate taxes and value-added taxes that Foxconn pays for the first five years of production; they are half the usual rate for the next five. The city lowered Foxconn’s social insurance and other payments for workers, by up to $100 million a year. The customs operation is also in a so-called bonded zone, an area that China essentially considers foreign soil, subject to different import and export rules. This setup allows Apple to sell iPhones more easily to Chinese consumers. Apple was late to China. In a bid to lower costs, some of the biggest US technology companies, including Compaq, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, began dismantling their domestic manufacturing in the 1980s and moving work overseas, largely to Asia. Not Apple. The company’s co-founder, Steve Jobs, believed that software and hardware development had to be closely integrated. ADVERTISEMENT Rather than close plants, Apple decided to build them – in Colorado, Texas and California. Apple would maintain some of them long after Jobs left the company in 1985. The plants were highly automated, with the walls painted white, just as Jobs liked them, and they were promoted as a symbol of American ingenuity. “This is a machine that is made in America,” Jobs trumpeted in 1984, after Apple opened a manufacturing facility in California to produce the Macintosh personal computer. Finances forced Apple to change course. As Mac sales plummeted and inventories began to bulge in the mid-1990s, Apple had to embrace outsourcing, something with which it had only just experimented. After Jobs returned to the company in 1997, he turned to his new operations chief, Cook, who had recently joined from Compaq, to figure out how. Under the direction of Cook, Apple shifted more business to Foxconn, then an up-and-coming Taiwanese contract manufacturer that had started to gain a following among big US brands such as Compaq, IBM and Intel. The partnership freed up Apple to focus on its strengths: design and marketing. Apple would come up with a new idea, and Foxconn would find ways to produce millions of units at a low cost. Brilliant engineers “They have brilliant tooling engineers, and they were willing to invest a lot to keep pace with Apple’s growth,” said Joe O’Sullivan, a former Apple executive who worked in Asia. When Apple’s sales took off after the introduction of the iPod in 2001, Foxconn had the heft and expertise to meet the demand that accompanied each hit product. Foxconn’s factories could quickly produce prototypes, increase production and, during peak periods, hire hundreds of thousands of workers. Foxconn’s founder, Taiwanese billionaire Terry Gou, provided political clout. Over the years, he frequently visited China to meet local officials and members of the decision-making Politburo to lobby for subsidies, cheap land, workers and infrastructure for facilities that churned out iPods, iPads and iPhones. “The reason Foxconn’s so big is Terry Gou,” said Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who helped design the iPod. “He said he’d create the manufacturing, and the Chinese government would give him some of the money to do it. As Terry grew with the Apple business, no one else could compete.” After the first iPhone was rolled out in 2007, Foxconn moved to expand production and began scouting new locations around China, unleashing a fierce competition among cities eager for the business. Officials from various regions camped out at hotels in Shenzhen, where Foxconn had its main operations. “These have become like Olympic competitions,” said Gao Yuning, who teaches public policy at Tsinghua University in Beijing. The Zhengzhou government saw the factory as a huge opportunity for development in an area that had been bypassed by China’s boom. Officials wanted to rebrand a place derided as a source of migrant labourers and unfairly tarnished as a land of thieves and counterfeiters. City officials lavished money and favourable investment terms on Foxconn, according to the government records. They promised discounted energy and transportation costs, lower social insurance payments, and more than $1.5 billion in grants for the construction of factories and dormitories that could house hundreds of thousands of workers. The city created a special economic zone for the project and provided a $250 million loan to Foxconn. The local government also pledged to spend more than $10 billion to vastly expand the airport, just a few miles away from the factory. The right boxes “We know that China has all sorts of policies to promote development, and this one ticks all the right boxes,” said Barry Naughton, an authority on the Chinese economy at the University of California, San Diego. The city moved quickly. Factories were built, licences were approved and assembly lines began operating in August 2010, just a few months after the government signed the deal. ADVERTISEMENT In Zhengzhou, the Chinese government effectively took a huge tract of land on the barren, dusty plains of central China and transformed it into a sprawling industrial park. “I was impressed,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, who was part of the early discussions about setting up a factory. “They were very focused.” When Apple first moved into China, the country was largely a low-cost production site. It quickly evolved into one of the world’s biggest consumer markets, with more than a billion potential customers. But Apple initially had to take the “Hong Kong U-turn” to get its products into the hands of Chinese consumers. Since China began opening its economy to the outside world in the 1980s, the government’s policies have encouraged manufacturing and exports with the creation of special economic zones. But those same policies have discouraged domestic consumption of overseas brands. Most products made in China by big multinationals had to be physically shipped out of the country and then brought back so that they could be taxed as imports, hence, the u-turn employed by many companies. In 2005, Apple’s best-selling portable music device, the iPod, was manufactured in southern China. To comply with the country’s stringent rules, iPods were loaded onto a cargo ship and sent to Hong Kong. Often, when the ship arrived, it was simply turned around and sent back to China. “This was really a legacy of China’s old export-oriented economy,” said Edwin Keh, the former head of global procurement at Wal-Mart, who worked for the retailer and other multinationals in China for 20 years. “Back then, we built supply chains good at making things in the East and selling them in the West.” Apple and other multinationals wanted a better system. By the time Apple released the iPhone in 2007, China faced growing pressure to loosen its restrictions and give global companies easier access to its market. Apple and other companies believed that shipping goods to Hong Kong was a waste of time and energy. They wanted to send goods from the factory gate in China directly to their stores and distribution centres inside the country. In discussions with Zhengzhou officials, Foxconn insisted that the operation be located inside a bonded zone, equipped with customs right at the factory gate to facilitate iPhone exports. It also wanted the factory to be built within a few miles of the city’s airport, to expedite Apple’s global shipments. Although it wasn’t the first city to create such a cohesive operation, Zhengzhou provided a convenient system, since it would serve what would become the world’s largest iPhone manufacturing facility. A bonded zone functions much like a diplomatic territory, in that the government regards it as foreign soil. The zone eliminates the need for global brands to pay duties or taxes on imported components. And it makes it unnecessary to physically export the goods. In those zones, products can be imported and exported virtually at customs, without crossing a single border. After that, they can move swiftly around the country or out to the rest of the world. The Ireland connection As the final assembly point for the iPhone, China also functions as a base for Apple’s global tax strategy. In the Zhengzhou bonded zone, typically at customs, Foxconn sells the finished iPhones to Apple. After purchasing the iPhones, Apple then resells the goods to Apple subsidiaries. The process largely takes place electronically. The process also plays out with other Apple goods that are produced in the country. Apple can assign some profits on these goods to an Irish affiliate, offering well-documented tax advantages, which have attracted the attention of the European Commission. In August, the Republic was told to claw back more than €13 billion from Apple in unpaid taxes from a decade-long period, a ruling that the Government and Apple are appealing. ADVERTISEMENT The practice is nonetheless commonly employed by many big technology brands and is not unique to China. “US multinationals are the world leaders in tax avoidance strategies,” said Edward D Kleinbard, the former chief of staff of the US congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. “In doing so, they create stateless income – income that has become unmoored from the countries to which it has an economic connection.” Apple said it follows all applicable tax rules, insisting that the company pays all its taxes. The company said it had made some changes to its tax procedures to comply with new laws, including registering an Irish subsidiary that previously had no tax jurisdiction. At Zhengzhou, a crushing workforce begins arriving for the early shift at 6.30am. They travel by foot, by bus, by motor scooter and even by pedicab. They file steadily into dozens of factory sites, spread out across 2.2 square miles. At the peak, some 350,000 workers assemble, test and package iPhones – up to 350 a minute. Apple’s labour force, the size of a national army, relies heavily on the generosity of the Zhengzhou government. As part of its deal with Foxconn, the state recruits, trains and houses employees. Provincial officials call townships and villages to ask for help finding potential workers. “Every city’s department of labour and ministry of human resources is involved,” said Liu Miao, who runs a private recruiting centre in Zhengzhou. The government pays recruiters a subsidy for every worker they hire, Liu said. “If the demand is high, then they will pay more,” he said. “If the demand is low, then the payment will be low, too.” Cities such as Zhengzhou have handed out subsidies to manufacturers in the hope of driving economic gains. But increasingly those local interests don’t align with the national agenda, creating a raft of uncertainty for multinationals operating in China. Slowing economy As the economy slows, Beijing has started to shift its development path away from manufacturing and exports and toward innovation and consumption. It wants to empower Chinese brands and foster homegrown technology. To advance its cause, Beijing has started to rethink the investment policies that support overseas companies. In November 2014, China’s State Council, the country’s cabinet, directed local governments to evaluate and eliminate any subsidies and tax breaks that benefited multinational exporters. The threat prompted a pushback, mostly notably by Foxconn which, along with other international businesses, fought to keep existing incentives. Since then, Beijing has backed off the issue. But the broad trend lines are clear: Overseas companies will no longer get the welcome they once received. The Chinese government is tightening access to its huge market and pressuring Western technology companies to advance domestic goals ? in a coordinated action that one congressional study in the United States called a new form of “techno-nationalism.” “The government wants to know what you can give to China,” said James McGregor, who lives in Shanghai and has for decades advised US companies operating in China. “And they have the market and the muscle. They’re not playing around anymore.” – (New York Times Service)       Topics: Apple tax Donald Trump Edwin Keh James Mcgregor Jeff Williams Joe O Sullivan Li Ziqiang Steve Jobs Terry Gou Tim Cook Tony Fadell European Commission Apple Dell Computer Foxconn Hewlett Packard IBM Intel Samsung WalMart Zhengzhou Read More John McManus: Apple’s adventures in tax wonderland Apple ruling: EU accuses Ireland of inconsistencies on tax rules Apple dismisses tax bill, says Ireland ‘doesn’t do any engineering for us’ Cliff Taylor: Battle lines drawn in State’s EU Apple appeal Court ruling on Spanish tax may give clues to Apple appeal Meet ‘the Maxforce’ – the EU team that fined Ireland €13bn over Apple Five tech presents you wanted, but probably didn’t get Huge implications of technology-sector issues in coming year Toshiba writedown warning revives financial stability fears Government has tough call to make as broadband tender enters endgame Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy Nearly everybody paid their property tax last year Technology CES 2017: Anglers get a helping hand from PowerRay Pro12 Johnny Sexton cruises on return as Leinster hammer sorry Zebre Innovation Wexford teen creates iOS app for US software giant Salesforce Sponsored Making a difficult fertility journey a lot less lonely Redbreast Lustau: an old friend with a new whiskey perspective Infertility and the workplace: one woman's experience Do you know how much you’ll save by switching health plan?

(Photo: Google) Site Selection Are Oregon’s Data Center Tax Breaks Worth It? State Doesn’t Know by Yevgeniy Sverdlik  on December 29, 2016 Add Your Comments Tweet Oregon may be giving up too much money in data center tax breaks to attract big projects by companies like Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon relative to the number of permanent jobs those projects create, according to a recent audit by the state of its economic development arm called Business Oregon. Oregon does not have a sales tax. Combined with property tax breaks for data centers, filled with expensive IT equipment, the tax savings alone make for potent lure for companies whose infrastructure costs represent a huge portion of total spend. Google launched a data center in The Dalles, Oregon, in 2006; Facebook and Amazon launched their first data centers in the state in 2011, followed later by Apple. In Oregon, data center builders commit to creating a predetermined number of jobs in exchange for tax breaks. They also pay fees and other taxes that “can help offset the property taxes foregone,” the auditors said. The problem is that Business Oregon does not really track how many jobs each individual project creates, nor does it collect enough data to determine whether the fees and taxes data center operators do pay adequately offset the potential revenue lost as a result of the tax breaks, they wrote in a report. In 2015 alone, property tax exemptions resulted in $87,000 to $500,000 per data center job foregone by state and local governments, according to the audit report by the Secretary of State’s office. See also: States Issued $1.5B in Data Center Tax Breaks over Past Decade Unlike other incentive programs, Business Oregon does not decide whether data center projects such as the hypersale server farms that sprung up in rural areas in recent years receive tax breaks. Those decisions are made by local governments, while the state’s business development agency plays a purely administrative role. In an official response, Business Oregon representatives wrote that the agency “generally agrees with the audit recommendations.” The weakness in evaluating actual performance outcomes of incentive programs, such as jobs, wages, and return on investment, was one of the audit’s two biggest conclusions about all of the programs, not just the one that applies to data centers. Another weakness it identified was lack of transparency about incentive money actually awarded to individual businesses. Ten of the 15 programs reviewed by auditors did not report outcomes like jobs and wages for individual businesses receiving incentives and loans. For 11 of the programs, the auditors found it “difficult or impossible” to determine whether a particular business met program requirements given the information reported publicly. Part of the transparency problem is privacy. Because of tax-return confidentiality, agencies often could not report the amount of tax incentives given to individual businesses. But the tax-incentive program rural-area data centers fall under, the enterprise zone tax exemption, often lacked outcome data simply because county tax assessor reports contained “incomplete information on jobs and wages.” To help make its case for data center tax incentives in Oregon and elsewhere, Facebook has been hiring outside firms to assess the economic impact of its operations on the areas surrounding its data centers. One such assessment, done by ECONorthwest, found that in 2013 its data center operations in Prineville, Oregon, were “linked” to $45 million in output and 207 jobs in Central Oregon, and $64.7 million in output and 266 jobs in the state overall. Economic activity its operations generated that year was associated with about $500,000 in property taxes and $750,000 in personal state income taxes, according to ECONorthwest’s assessments.

Barboza begins by looking deep into the city of Zhengzhou, better known as ‘iPhone City’ by the locals. The city produces half of the world’s iPhones at a Foxconn facility. Running at full tilt, the factory here, owned and operated by Apple’s manufacturing partner Foxconn, can produce 500,000 iPhones a day. Aside from details we all know, Barboza explains how incentives and government play a significant role as to why some technology companies choose China to manufacturer its products. Beijing, for decades, has encouraged such efforts at the national level, by developing special economic zones that offer tax breaks to multinationals and exempt them from costly and cumbersome rules. However, the years of development and manufacturing expertise in China could make it nearly impossible to bring it back to the United States. Foxconn, Apple’s largest supplier, has plans on moving some of its manufacturing back to the United States, but not all of Apple’s supply chain is on board with the idea. A 32-gigabyte iPhone 7 costs an estimated $400 to produce. It retails for roughly $649 in the United States, with Apple taking a piece of the difference as profit. The result: Apple manages to earn 90 percent of the profits in the smartphone industry worldwide, even though it accounts for only 12 percent of the sales, according to Strategy Analytics, a research firm. While customers will likely only see the end result for products, it took several years for Apple to build relationships with China. For example, the iPod back in 2001 is where most of it began.. When Apple’s sales took off after the introduction of the iPod in 2001, Foxconn had the heft and expertise to meet the demand that accompanied each hit product. Foxconn’s factories could quickly produce prototypes, increase production and, during peak periods, hire hundreds of thousands of workers. Foxconn’s founder, the Taiwanese billionaire Terry Gou, provided political clout. Over the years, he frequently visited China to meet local officials and members of the decision-making Politburo to lobby for subsidies, cheap land, workers and infrastructure for facilities that churned out iPods, iPads and iPhones. “The reason Foxconn’s so big is Terry Gou,” said Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who helped design the iPod. “He said he’d create the manufacturing, and the Chinese government would give him some of the money to do it. As Terry grew with the Apple business, no one else could compete.” You can read the full piece here. Tags: Foxconn, Zhengzhou About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

Combing through confidential government records and a swath of interviews, Barboza explores the complexities technology companies like Apple have to go through to make manufacturing a success overseas. At the same time, the piece highlights the difficulties companies will encounter when attempting to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. Barboza’s investigative piece delves deep into the city of Zhengzhou that locals have now dubbed ‘iPhone City’. The city, in one of China’s poorest regions, produces half of the world’s iPhones at a Foxconn facility. Running at full tilt, the factory here, owned and operated by Apple’s manufacturing partner Foxconn, can produce 500,000 iPhones a day. Exploring past just the factories we commonly know, Barboza tells the story of how incentives and government play a significant role for technology companies in the region. Beijing, for decades, has encouraged such efforts at the national level, by developing special economic zones that offer tax breaks to multinationals and exempt them from costly and cumbersome rules. The years of work and investment developing the supply chain overseas can make bringing manufacturing back stateside near impossible. Foxconn has brought the idea of potentially moving a portion of their operations to the US, but not all of Apple’s other supply chain manufacturers have. With President-Elect Donald J. Trump promising punitive tariffs on companies that move jobs overseas, Apple’s years of relationship building in China are notable to say the least. These deals with government agencies and various companies have allowed Apple to remain as profitable as possible. A 32-gigabyte iPhone 7 costs an estimated $400 to produce. It retails for roughly $649 in the United States, with Apple taking a piece of the difference as profit. The result: Apple manages to earn 90 percent of the profits in the smartphone industry worldwide, even though it accounts for only 12 percent of the sales, according to Strategy Analytics, a research firm. Barboza’s reporting shows that although consumers may just see the end product of the newest Apple gadget, the years it took to arrive to that point are full of stories unto themselves. For example, the relationship that had started with Foxconn during the original iPod sales has become a significant contributor in Apple’s strength in China until today. When Apple’s sales took off after the introduction of the iPod in 2001, Foxconn had the heft and expertise to meet the demand that accompanied each hit product. Foxconn’s factories could quickly produce prototypes, increase production and, during peak periods, hire hundreds of thousands of workers. Foxconn’s founder, the Taiwanese billionaire Terry Gou, provided political clout. Over the years, he frequently visited China to meet local officials and members of the decision-making Politburo to lobby for subsidies, cheap land, workers and infrastructure for facilities that churned out iPods, iPads and iPhones. “The reason Foxconn’s so big is Terry Gou,” said Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who helped design the iPod. “He said he’d create the manufacturing, and the Chinese government would give him some of the money to do it. As Terry grew with the Apple business, no one else could compete.” The entire piece makes for a great read in understanding not only how Apple has operated within the country, but how even some of it’s competitors like Dell, Hewlett-Packard, and Samsung have too.

The two recently filed a formal appeal of the EC's decision ordering Apple to pay nearly US$14 billion in back taxes, based on its finding that Ireland had given Apple several illegal tax breaks. The commission this summer found that Ireland had allowed Apple to determine its tax based on the activities of its subsidiary firms, Apple Sales International and Apple Sales Europe, which are incorporated in Ireland. That tax approach allowed Apple to pay a much lower tax rate than other firms doing business in Europe, according to the EC. Irish Eyes The Irish government "profoundly disagrees with the commission's analysis, and had no alternative than to file an appeal to have the entire decision overturned, according to David Byrne, a spokesperson for the Department of Finance in Ireland. "Ireland did not give favorable tax treatment to Apple," he told the E-Commerce Times. "Ireland does not do deals with taxpayers." No fine or penalty has been levied against the Irish state, Byrne said, noting that the EC explicitly stated that the decision does not call into question Ireland's general tax system or its corporate tax rate. "The commission will defend its decision in court," EC spokesperson Ricardo Cardoso told the E-Commerce Times. The U.S. Treasury Department disagreed with the EC's findings, suggesting that the commission retroactively applied a new "State Aid" theory opposing established legal principles, challenging individual countries' tax rules, and threatening to undermine the European business climate. The ruling threatens to erode America's tax base, according to the DoJ. The department considers tax avoidance a serious problem around the world, and it will continue to work with the commission and other international partners, such as the OECD, toward the shared goal of preventing the erosion of corporate tax bases. Apple Bites Apple's Irish presence dates back to 1980, when it opened its first factory in Cork, Ireland, with 60 employees, noted CEO Tim Cook in an open letter to the Apple community written this summer, after the EC handed down its decision. The company eventually expanded to a nationwide presence of 6,000 people across Ireland, the vast majority of them still working in Cork. Apple's presence in Cork has helped sustain more than 1.5 million jobs across Europe, Cook pointed out, held by Apple employees, app developers, smaller manufacturers and suppliers. Apple has never asked for or received any special deals from Ireland, he insisted. The EC's claim that Apple paid an effective tax rate of .005 percent is "extremely misleading and deceptive," Apple said in a note sent to investors this summer. Apple paid $400 million in corporate income taxes to Ireland in 2014, making it one of the largest corporate taxpayers in the country, according to the note to investors. Apple paid $400 million of its current U.S. taxes on those profits, bringing the company's total taxes paid to $800 million. Apple's total global corporate income tax rate that year was 26.1 percent, the company claimed. The EC in 2013 began investigating the tax treatment of multiple companies, and early this year ruled that 35 multinational firms had received selective tax treatment that it considered illegal. Investigations into the tax treatment of McDonald's and Amazon are pending. David Jones is a freelance writer based in Essex County, New Jersey.

X Inside China’s ‘iPhone City’, the land of sweeteners and perks Facility can produce 500,000 iPhones per day and even allows for an Irish tax advantage Thu, Dec 29, 2016, 17:17 Drivers at a rest area between Zhengzhou and Shanghai in China.

The facility can produce 500,000 iPhones a day. Photograph: The New York Times Previous Image Next Image Previous Images More Images         A vast, boxy customs centre acts as a busy island of commerce deep in central China. Government officers, in sharply pressed uniforms, race around a maze of wooden pallets piled high with boxes, counting, weighing, scanning and approving shipments. Unmarked trucks stretch for more than a mile awaiting the next load headed for Beijing, New York, London and dozens of other destinations. The state-of-the-art facility was built several years ago to serve a single global exporter: Apple, now the world’s most valuable company and one of China’s largest retailers. The well-choreographed customs routine is part of a hidden bounty of perks, tax breaks and subsidies in China that supports the world’s biggest iPhone factory, according to confidential government records reviewed by the New York Times, as well as more than 100 interviews with factory workers, logistics handlers, truck drivers, tax specialists and current and former Apple executives. The package of sweeteners and incentives, worth billions of dollars, is central to the production of the iPhone, Apple’s best-selling and most profitable product. It all centres on Zhengzhou, a city of six million people in an impoverished region of China. Running at full tilt, the factory here, owned and operated by Apple’s manufacturing partner Foxconn, can produce 500,000 iPhones a day. Locals now refer to Zhengzhou as “iPhone City”. The local government has proved instrumental, doling out more than $1.5 billion (€1.43 billion) to Foxconn to build large sections of the factory and nearby employee housing. It paved roads and built power plants. It helps cover continuing energy and transportation costs for the operation. It recruits workers for the assembly line. It pays bonuses to the factory for meeting export targets. All of it in support of iPhone production. Build the nest “We needed something that could really develop this part of the country,” said Li Ziqiang, a Zhengzhou official. ADVERTISEMENT “There’s an old saying in China: ‘If you build the nest, the birds will come.’ And now, they’re coming.” US officials have long decried China’s support of its state-owned companies, calling the subsidies and other aid an unfair competitive advantage in a global marketplace. But the Zhengzhou operation shows the extent of China’s effort to entice overseas multinationals to set up production facilities in the country. Local and provincial officials, in an effort to create jobs and drive growth, have courted manufacturers with incentive packages that make it easier and cheaper to do business. Beijing, for decades, has encouraged such efforts at the national level, by developing special economic zones that offer tax breaks to multinationals and exempt them from costly and cumbersome rules. China’s lure is strong. Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Samsung have all flocked to the country to lower their production costs, bolster their bottom lines and tap into the world’s largest consumer market. And many rely on local manufacturing partners such as Foxconn. While Apple came later than many technology companies, it now generates nearly a quarter of its revenues from sales in China and has some of the fattest profit margins in the business. As such, the Zhengzhou operation provides an especially illustrative look at China’s importance to US technology companies, and specifically iPhone production and more recently, Apple’s consumer sales. A 32-gigabyte iPhone 7 costs an estimated $400 to produce. It retails for roughly $649 in the United States, with Apple taking a piece of the difference as profit. The result: Apple manages to earn 90 per cent of the profits in the smartphone industry worldwide, even though it accounts for only 12 per cent of the sales, according to Strategy Analytics, a research firm. It is difficult to tally the total value of government benefits for the Zhengzhou operation or to determine the exact effect on the profits of Foxconn or Apple. The subsidies aren’t disclosed by the Chinese government or Foxconn. They aren’t available in public records. And Apple says it was not a party to Foxconn’s negotiations. Confidential records The confidential government records obtained by the New York Times detail multiple meetings over several years in which Zhengzhou city officials discussed their “support” for iPhone production, calling the benefits a “preferential policy.” The records offer a snapshot of those benefits, including the specific aid for Foxconn in multiple areas, such as infrastructure, labour, taxes and exports. As China’s largest private employer, Foxconn, a Taiwanese company, has enormous leverage in the negotiations for those incentives. The company’s size and scale – and the sway that they afford in China – is connected to Apple. Foxconn is Apple’s largest supplier. Apple is Foxconn’s largest customer. The two companies are intertwined in Zhengzhou. When the factory opened, Apple was Foxconn’s only customer here. Even now, the US technology company accounts for almost all of the production at the Zhengzhou plant, where about half of the world’s iPhones are made. Apple is also the main exporter using the customs facility here. In response to questions, Apple said it was aware of the Chinese government’s infrastructure support. But the company added that it had no knowledge of specific grants, subsidies or tax breaks given to its manufacturing partner. Foxconn, in a separate statement, said it was grateful for the support of the government, noting that it was “no different than similar tax breaks all companies get in locations around the world for major investments”. A growing backlash against globalisation puts Apple and other big multinationals directly in the sightlines of two increasingly combative giants: the US and China. US president-elect Donald Trump has vowed to bring down the full force of the government on US companies that move jobs overseas, threatening punitive tariffs on the goods they sell back at home. Apple has been a frequent target of Trump, who said during the campaign that he would get the technology company to “build their damn computers and things in this country”. ADVERTISEMENT Western influence China, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, is growing less tolerant and more suspicious of western influence, particularly US technology companies and the huge influence they have over Chinese consumers. A state-owned publication called Apple one of the “guardian warriors” that have “seamlessly penetrated” China and may pose a threat to national security. China, no longer content with just being the world’s factory floor, is moving aggressively to develop its own technology giants. Beijing is pressuring local governments to cut subsidy programmes that the country heartily encouraged even just a few years ago. And big exporters, courted and protected for decades by Beijing, now face broad scrutiny. Chinese regulators shut down Apple’s iTunes Movies and iBooks Store last spring, just six months after the services were introduced in China. The Chinese authorities fined the technology giant for failing to pay taxes. And Apple went through a national security review in China for the iPhone 6, delaying its release in the country. Apple is now engaged in the corporate version of shuttle diplomacy. In December, the company’s chief executive, Tim Cook, along with other Silicon Valley executives, met Trump in New York, part of an effort to build bridges with the incoming administration. It followed a similar goodwill tour in China in August, when Cook sat down with the country’s vice premier at Zhongnanhai, the government’s walled leadership compound in what was once part of Beijing’s Imperial City. The two countries are playing a high-stakes game. Apple, like many multinationals, depends on a vast global supply chain that includes multiple companies and countries, each with its own expertise and advantages – a complexity that is often lost in the political debate over trade. The iPhone is a collection of intricate parts that are made around the world and assembled in China, spurring employment in many countries; Apple says it supports two million jobs in the US. As China and the US both brandish a new form of economic nationalism, they risk disrupting the system, without necessarily achieving their goals. And multinationals and their manufacturing partners would face serious financial trade-offs. As the Zhengzhou operation shows, China not only provides a large pool of labour; it also offers incentives that would be difficult to replicate in the US or anywhere else. The trove of benefits in Zhengzhou flows through the production process for the iPhone, from the factory floor to the retail store. Export targets Foxconn receives a bonus when it meets targets for exports. Those subsidies, according to the government records, totalled $56 million in the first two years of production, when the factory was exclusively dedicated to the iPhone. The bonus is small on each of the tens of millions of iPhones produced during that period. But the subsidies add up: The government records list more than a dozen other forms of financial aid at the Zhengzhou operation. The Zhengzhou government eliminated corporate taxes and value-added taxes that Foxconn pays for the first five years of production; they are half the usual rate for the next five. The city lowered Foxconn’s social insurance and other payments for workers, by up to $100 million a year. The customs operation is also in a so-called bonded zone, an area that China essentially considers foreign soil, subject to different import and export rules. This setup allows Apple to sell iPhones more easily to Chinese consumers. Apple was late to China. In a bid to lower costs, some of the biggest US technology companies, including Compaq, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, began dismantling their domestic manufacturing in the 1980s and moving work overseas, largely to Asia. Not Apple. The company’s co-founder, Steve Jobs, believed that software and hardware development had to be closely integrated. ADVERTISEMENT Rather than close plants, Apple decided to build them – in Colorado, Texas and California. Apple would maintain some of them long after Jobs left the company in 1985. The plants were highly automated, with the walls painted white, just as Jobs liked them, and they were promoted as a symbol of American ingenuity. “This is a machine that is made in America,” Jobs trumpeted in 1984, after Apple opened a manufacturing facility in California to produce the Macintosh personal computer. Finances forced Apple to change course. As Mac sales plummeted and inventories began to bulge in the mid-1990s, Apple had to embrace outsourcing, something with which it had only just experimented. After Jobs returned to the company in 1997, he turned to his new operations chief, Cook, who had recently joined from Compaq, to figure out how. Under the direction of Cook, Apple shifted more business to Foxconn, then an up-and-coming Taiwanese contract manufacturer that had started to gain a following among big US brands such as Compaq, IBM and Intel. The partnership freed up Apple to focus on its strengths: design and marketing. Apple would come up with a new idea, and Foxconn would find ways to produce millions of units at a low cost. Brilliant engineers “They have brilliant tooling engineers, and they were willing to invest a lot to keep pace with Apple’s growth,” said Joe O’Sullivan, a former Apple executive who worked in Asia. When Apple’s sales took off after the introduction of the iPod in 2001, Foxconn had the heft and expertise to meet the demand that accompanied each hit product. Foxconn’s factories could quickly produce prototypes, increase production and, during peak periods, hire hundreds of thousands of workers. Foxconn’s founder, Taiwanese billionaire Terry Gou, provided political clout. Over the years, he frequently visited China to meet local officials and members of the decision-making Politburo to lobby for subsidies, cheap land, workers and infrastructure for facilities that churned out iPods, iPads and iPhones. “The reason Foxconn’s so big is Terry Gou,” said Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who helped design the iPod. “He said he’d create the manufacturing, and the Chinese government would give him some of the money to do it. As Terry grew with the Apple business, no one else could compete.” After the first iPhone was rolled out in 2007, Foxconn moved to expand production and began scouting new locations around China, unleashing a fierce competition among cities eager for the business. Officials from various regions camped out at hotels in Shenzhen, where Foxconn had its main operations. “These have become like Olympic competitions,” said Gao Yuning, who teaches public policy at Tsinghua University in Beijing. The Zhengzhou government saw the factory as a huge opportunity for development in an area that had been bypassed by China’s boom. Officials wanted to rebrand a place derided as a source of migrant labourers and unfairly tarnished as a land of thieves and counterfeiters. City officials lavished money and favourable investment terms on Foxconn, according to the government records. They promised discounted energy and transportation costs, lower social insurance payments, and more than $1.5 billion in grants for the construction of factories and dormitories that could house hundreds of thousands of workers. The city created a special economic zone for the project and provided a $250 million loan to Foxconn. The local government also pledged to spend more than $10 billion to vastly expand the airport, just a few miles away from the factory. The right boxes “We know that China has all sorts of policies to promote development, and this one ticks all the right boxes,” said Barry Naughton, an authority on the Chinese economy at the University of California, San Diego. The city moved quickly. Factories were built, licences were approved and assembly lines began operating in August 2010, just a few months after the government signed the deal. ADVERTISEMENT In Zhengzhou, the Chinese government effectively took a huge tract of land on the barren, dusty plains of central China and transformed it into a sprawling industrial park. “I was impressed,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, who was part of the early discussions about setting up a factory. “They were very focused.” When Apple first moved into China, the country was largely a low-cost production site. It quickly evolved into one of the world’s biggest consumer markets, with more than a billion potential customers. But Apple initially had to take the “Hong Kong U-turn” to get its products into the hands of Chinese consumers. Since China began opening its economy to the outside world in the 1980s, the government’s policies have encouraged manufacturing and exports with the creation of special economic zones. But those same policies have discouraged domestic consumption of overseas brands. Most products made in China by big multinationals had to be physically shipped out of the country and then brought back so that they could be taxed as imports, hence, the u-turn employed by many companies. In 2005, Apple’s best-selling portable music device, the iPod, was manufactured in southern China. To comply with the country’s stringent rules, iPods were loaded onto a cargo ship and sent to Hong Kong. Often, when the ship arrived, it was simply turned around and sent back to China. “This was really a legacy of China’s old export-oriented economy,” said Edwin Keh, the former head of global procurement at Wal-Mart, who worked for the retailer and other multinationals in China for 20 years. “Back then, we built supply chains good at making things in the East and selling them in the West.” Apple and other multinationals wanted a better system. By the time Apple released the iPhone in 2007, China faced growing pressure to loosen its restrictions and give global companies easier access to its market. Apple and other companies believed that shipping goods to Hong Kong was a waste of time and energy. They wanted to send goods from the factory gate in China directly to their stores and distribution centres inside the country. In discussions with Zhengzhou officials, Foxconn insisted that the operation be located inside a bonded zone, equipped with customs right at the factory gate to facilitate iPhone exports. It also wanted the factory to be built within a few miles of the city’s airport, to expedite Apple’s global shipments. Although it wasn’t the first city to create such a cohesive operation, Zhengzhou provided a convenient system, since it would serve what would become the world’s largest iPhone manufacturing facility. A bonded zone functions much like a diplomatic territory, in that the government regards it as foreign soil. The zone eliminates the need for global brands to pay duties or taxes on imported components. And it makes it unnecessary to physically export the goods. In those zones, products can be imported and exported virtually at customs, without crossing a single border. After that, they can move swiftly around the country or out to the rest of the world. The Ireland connection As the final assembly point for the iPhone, China also functions as a base for Apple’s global tax strategy. In the Zhengzhou bonded zone, typically at customs, Foxconn sells the finished iPhones to Apple. After purchasing the iPhones, Apple then resells the goods to Apple subsidiaries. The process largely takes place electronically. The process also plays out with other Apple goods that are produced in the country. Apple can assign some profits on these goods to an Irish affiliate, offering well-documented tax advantages, which have attracted the attention of the European Commission. In August, the Republic was told to claw back more than €13 billion from Apple in unpaid taxes from a decade-long period, a ruling that the Government and Apple are appealing. ADVERTISEMENT The practice is nonetheless commonly employed by many big technology brands and is not unique to China. “US multinationals are the world leaders in tax avoidance strategies,” said Edward D Kleinbard, the former chief of staff of the US congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. “In doing so, they create stateless income – income that has become unmoored from the countries to which it has an economic connection.” Apple said it follows all applicable tax rules, insisting that the company pays all its taxes. The company said it had made some changes to its tax procedures to comply with new laws, including registering an Irish subsidiary that previously had no tax jurisdiction. At Zhengzhou, a crushing workforce begins arriving for the early shift at 6.30am. They travel by foot, by bus, by motor scooter and even by pedicab. They file steadily into dozens of factory sites, spread out across 2.2 square miles. At the peak, some 350,000 workers assemble, test and package iPhones – up to 350 a minute. Apple’s labour force, the size of a national army, relies heavily on the generosity of the Zhengzhou government. As part of its deal with Foxconn, the state recruits, trains and houses employees. Provincial officials call townships and villages to ask for help finding potential workers. “Every city’s department of labour and ministry of human resources is involved,” said Liu Miao, who runs a private recruiting centre in Zhengzhou. The government pays recruiters a subsidy for every worker they hire, Liu said. “If the demand is high, then they will pay more,” he said. “If the demand is low, then the payment will be low, too.” Cities such as Zhengzhou have handed out subsidies to manufacturers in the hope of driving economic gains. But increasingly those local interests don’t align with the national agenda, creating a raft of uncertainty for multinationals operating in China. Slowing economy As the economy slows, Beijing has started to shift its development path away from manufacturing and exports and toward innovation and consumption. It wants to empower Chinese brands and foster homegrown technology. To advance its cause, Beijing has started to rethink the investment policies that support overseas companies. In November 2014, China’s State Council, the country’s cabinet, directed local governments to evaluate and eliminate any subsidies and tax breaks that benefited multinational exporters. The threat prompted a pushback, mostly notably by Foxconn which, along with other international businesses, fought to keep existing incentives. Since then, Beijing has backed off the issue. But the broad trend lines are clear: Overseas companies will no longer get the welcome they once received. The Chinese government is tightening access to its huge market and pressuring Western technology companies to advance domestic goals ? in a coordinated action that one congressional study in the United States called a new form of “techno-nationalism.” “The government wants to know what you can give to China,” said James McGregor, who lives in Shanghai and has for decades advised US companies operating in China. “And they have the market and the muscle. They’re not playing around anymore.” – (New York Times Service)       Topics: Apple tax Donald Trump Edwin Keh James Mcgregor Jeff Williams Joe O Sullivan Li Ziqiang Steve Jobs Terry Gou Tim Cook Tony Fadell European Commission Apple Dell Computer Foxconn Hewlett Packard IBM Intel Samsung WalMart Zhengzhou Read More John McManus: Apple’s adventures in tax wonderland Apple ruling: EU accuses Ireland of inconsistencies on tax rules Apple dismisses tax bill, says Ireland ‘doesn’t do any engineering for us’ Cliff Taylor: Battle lines drawn in State’s EU Apple appeal Court ruling on Spanish tax may give clues to Apple appeal Meet ‘the Maxforce’ – the EU team that fined Ireland €13bn over Apple Five tech presents you wanted, but probably didn’t get Huge implications of technology-sector issues in coming year Toshiba writedown warning revives financial stability fears Government has tough call to make as broadband tender enters endgame Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy Nearly everybody paid their property tax last year Technology CES 2017: Anglers get a helping hand from PowerRay Pro12 Johnny Sexton cruises on return as Leinster hammer sorry Zebre Innovation Wexford teen creates iOS app for US software giant Salesforce Sponsored Making a difficult fertility journey a lot less lonely Redbreast Lustau: an old friend with a new whiskey perspective Infertility and the workplace: one woman's experience Do you know how much you’ll save by switching health plan?

But with this year's model featuring only iterative upgrades, many Apple fans are already looking ahead to the iPhone 8. 2017 marks the tenth anniversary of the iPhone, which was first announced by Steve Jobs on 9 January 2007, and released later that year on June 29. Given the momentous occasion, rumour has it that Apple has been holding back some of its most groundbreaking features for next year's model - which many expect to be called the iPhone 8. We've rounded up all the latest rumours and leaks, so if you're unimpressed by the iPhone 7's features, you'll know what next year's update has in store. Read More iPhone 7 review: More evolution than revolution Latest news Apple is rumoured to be working on three versions of its next iPhone, including a 5-inch model to sit between its existing 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch handsets. Japanese blog Mac Otakara reports that all three models will boast identical specifications , citing sources within Apple's Taiwanese supply chain. The 5-inch version is also rumoured to feature a dual-lens camera, with iSight modules arranged vertically instead of horizontally. The iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone SE (Photo: Apple) Read More Apple's iPhone 8 will have a glass back and come in THREE different sizes While Apple has long been rumoured to be working on three models of its next iPhone , earlier reports have claimed that they will not all have the same specifications. Meanwhile, a recent report in the Wall Street Journal claimed that Apple is currently testing more than 10 different prototypes for its next smartphone. Release date Apple traditionally releases its latest iPhone in the first two weeks of September, in good time for the start of the Christmas shopping season. So far, there's nothing to suggest the company will break with tradition. That means we can expect Apple to unveil its new handset either the week of September 4 or September 11. Then again, with it being a special anniversary, Apple may choose to pick a different date for the launch. If Apple is feeling particularly nostalgic, it may opt for June 29 - the same day the first iPhone was released. The iPhone 8 could be Apple's most exciting launch in years (Photo: Getty) Read More Forget the iPhone 7 launch - experts say wait for the iPhone 8 Price It's unlikely that Apple's iPhone 8 will be any easier on the wallet than previous models, but it may not be much more expensive. In past years, Apple has launched its new handset at roughly the same price point as the previous model, and simultaneously knocked around £100 off the cost of the previous model. Apple's 32GB iPhone 7 costs £599, while the iPhone 7 Plus starts at £719. That should give you a fairly good idea of what the iPhone 8 will cost - although if it does get a major design ovehaul, we wouldn't be surprised if Apple increased the price a bit. Name Based on Apple's well-established "tick-tock" cycle, the 2017 model would be called the iPhone 7s. These photos taken in China and obtained by the blog site Apple Insider allegedly show an iPhone with a very different design. (Photo: AppleInsider) The tick-tock cycle refers to Apple releasing a new design every two years, and new features within the same casing on alternate years (which are usually known as "s" models). However, rumour has it that Apple is moving to a three-year cycle on major iPhone refreshes. This, combined with the fact that next year is the tenth anniversary of the iPhone, suggests that Apple's 2017 model will be a fairly major upgrade.

It's more likely that it will be called the iPhone 8. Apple may even decide to go for something completely different - the iPhone 10 perhaps, to mark the anniversary, or even the iPhone Air or iPhone Pro, to reflect the iPad lineup. All-glass design Apple is allegedly planning a major design overhaul for the iPhone 8. The company is said to be working on an all-glass version of its iconic iPhone , for release in 2017. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has a track record of leaking accurate information on Apple products, published a report in May claiming the American tech firm will completely redesign the iPhone in 2017. Instead of the aluminium casing used in the iPhone 7, Apple will move to an all-glass enclosure. iPhone concept image via Twitter / @GlobalFlare (Photo: Twitter / @GlobalFlare) This wouldn't be the first time Apple has used glass in its iPhones. The iPhone 4 and 4s had glass front and back panels, with a stainless steel band sandwiched between the two. However, these phones were plagued by durability issues, with many customers claiming their phones cracked too easily when dropped . Kuo noted that some investors are concerned that glass casing would be too heavy or fail a drop test, but said he believes that a return to glass casing will not be problematic for Apple. The phone screen break is the fear of all avid smartphone users (Photo: Getty) "Apple already uses glass casing for iPhone 4/ 4S, and non-Apple brands have also been using glass casings. We therefore think a drop test will not be problematic for glass casing," he wrote in his report, according to MacRumours . "A glass casing may be slightly heavier than an aluminum one of the same thickness, but the difference is so small that the use of the thinner and lighter AMOLED panel will compensate for that." Read More This ultra-strong glass could spell the end for smashed smartphone screens The rumour has been backed up by a couple of other leaks. A source reportedly told Japanese website Nikkei that "Foxconn has been trying glass chassis' since last year." The arguments to be made for a glass smartphone include better antenna reception and more options for wireless charging. Curved OLED display At least one of the iPhone 8 prototypes is said to feature a new cutting-edge curved OLED display with practically no bezels - similar to that used on Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge. Although there is no functional reason to have a curved screen, Samsung has been seeing significantly higher sales of the curved versions of its Galaxy smartphones. Concept image of an iPhone with curved OLED display (Photo: Martin Hajek) In March 2016, Nikkei reported that Apple was planning to ditch LCD displays in favour of OLED screens, with the first OLED iPhone arriving in 2017. Then in April, The Korea Herald reported that Samsung had managed to bag the $2.59 billion manufacturing contract. The company is reportedly contracted to supply 100 million 5.5-inch OLED panels per year, starting from 2017. OLED displays are superior to the LCD panels currently used in Apple’s iPhones because, rather than requiring a backlight, an OLED-based screen lights up individual pixels when necessary. Read More Apple is testing more than 10 versions of the iPhone 8 - and at least one has a CURVED screen This translates to blacker blacks and brighter whites, lower power consumption and faster response times compared to LED displays. The iPhone 8's display could also have a 4K resolution - which would make it more suitable for virtual reality applications. End of the Home button Rumours have been swirling for some time that Apple is planning to get rid of the traditional physical Home button and replace it with a touch-sensitive digital button. This was originally rumoured for the iPhone 7, but it's now looking more likely that it will be one of the major changes coming with the iPhone 8. Weidlich has turned the entire front of the futuristic smartphone into a screen (Photo: Marek Weidlich) A Chinese website called Storm reports that the virtual home button will have the same haptic feedback motors used in the iPhone 7 to create the illusion of a Home button, even if it's really just a flat capacitive surface. Designers around the world have been speculating about what Apple has planned, and one artist, Marek Weidlich , has created an intriguing concept video (see above). Weidlich has turned the entire front of the futuristic smartphone into a screen - leaving no home button or any visible bezel. Read More Latest iPad clues suggest iPhone 8 redesign - and another massive feature may be dropped Another concept by industrial designer Herman Haidin envisions an iPhone made from a material known as "liquidmetal", which is tougher and more water-resistant than typical aluminium. In the concept, Haidin envisions the new iPhone as a mere 3mm thick with a body formed of glass and liquidmetal. Amazing 'liquidmetal' iPhone 7 concept shows what Apple's next-generation smartphone could look like (Photo: Herman Haidin) In order to get to this level of thinness, the concept ditches bulky ports such as the Lightning charging port and the 3.5mm headphone jack, as well as the physical Home button. Wireless charging Wireless charging has become a common feature of some Android smartphones - including Samsung's latest family of devices - although it is still a lot slower than wired charging methods. Some of Samsung's devices can already be charged wirelessly (Photo: Samsung) A report in Bloomberg in January claimed that Apple was working on "cutting edge" wireless technology that would allow future iPhones and iPads to be placed further away from charging mats than current smartphones. The unnamed sources said Apple was working on overcoming "technical barriers including loss of power over distance," and that the technology will feature in iPhones coming out in 2017. Iris scanner One of the stand-out features of Samsung 's latest flagship smartphone, the Galaxy Note 7 , is eye-scanning technology, allowing users to unlock their phone by simply looking at it. Eye scanning on the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 (Photo: PA) Now a report from Chinese-language website MoneyDJ.com , picked up by Digitimes , indicates that Apple may be planning to introduce similar technology with the iPhone 8. According to the report, a Taiwan-based company called Xintec is to start mass producing iris-recognition chips, some of which will be embedded in the 2017 series of iPhone. iPhone Pro model The iPhone 7 Plus is currently Apple's most powerful model, but rumour has it the company is working on an even higher tier, known as the iPhone Pro. Originally rumoured for release in 2016, it now looks like the iPhone Pro will make its debut in 2017, featuring a massive 5.8-inch screen and 'Pro' features such as a Smart Connector, dual-lens camera and premium software. Specs iPhone concept (Photo: Yasser Farahi) The iPhone 8 will, more than likely, feature an A11 chip, built on ARM's highly-efficient 10nm manufacturing process, and run the next version of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS 11. It will most likely come in 32BB, 128GB and 256GB storage options. Camera If you were hoping that the next version of Apple's 4.7-inch iPhone was going to feature a dual-lens camera, you may be disappointed. According to the latest investor note from well-informed KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple's dual-camera system will remain exclusive to the larger "Plus" model next year. Dual-lens camera on the iPhone 7 Plus "While an attractive addition for avid picture takers and professional photographers, the iPhone 7 Plus dual-camera is not a mass-market killer application yet," Kuo says in the note seen by Apple Insider and 9to5Mac . "Along with its high cost (estimated at over US$30-40) and the necessity for Apple to enhance the added value of high-end iPhone models, we expect only high-end new iPhone models (30-40% of them) to have a dual-camera next year." Kuo's analysis contradicts industry insider predictions that Apple's entire 2017 iPhone lineup will feature dual-camera technology. iPhone 7 Plus is expected to have a dual-lens camera Waterproof iPhone Apple's iPhone 7 is water-resistant to a depth of one metre for up to 30 minutes - a rating known as IP67, which is the same as the Apple Watch . It therefore makes sense that Apple would carry this through to the iPhone 8. IP67 means it will survive a dip in the sink or down the loo, and it won't break if you pour a drink over it, but you probably don't want to take it swimming.

The article describes how the facility became one of Apple's major global manufacturing plants, as well as the "hidden bounty of perks, tax breaks, and subsidies" uncovered behind the scenes of Foxconn's operations -- negotiations Apple said it is "not a party to." Looking at the origins of Apple's move to production overseas, the article first details Steve Jobs' decision to manufacture the Macintosh in its facilities in Texas and California in the mid-1980s. Following the company's financial slump in the 1990s, Jobs upon his return made the decision to outsource production in places like China. Partnerships with the likes of Foxconn provided Apple with the "heft and expertise" to create products, including the original iPod, on a massive scale. Workers leaving the Foxconn factory When Apple’s sales took off after the introduction of the iPod in 2001, Foxconn had the heft and expertise to meet the demand that accompanied each hit product. Foxconn’s factories could quickly produce prototypes, increase production and, during peak periods, hire hundreds of thousands of workers. “They have brilliant tooling engineers, and they were willing to invest a lot to keep pace with Apple’s growth,” said Joe O’Sullivan, a former Apple executive who worked in Asia. As the launch of the iPhone approached, Foxconn began scouting locations for a new facility around China and created an Olympic-level competition among cities to be the home of its new plant. Officials from various cities offered perks like discounted energy and transportation costs, lower social insurance payments, and over $1.5 billion in grants for factory construction and dorms for workers. After Zhengzhou was chosen, it only took a few months between the signing of the deal and the launch of assembly lines in August 2010. The city created a special economic zone for the project and provided a $250 million loan to Foxconn. The local government also pledged to spend more than $10 billion to vastly expand the airport, just a few miles away from the factory. “I was impressed,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, who was part of the early discussions about setting up a factory. “They were very focused.” To create its cohesive export system, Foxconn insisted that the Zhengzhou facility be located within a "bonded zone." This allowed Foxconn to bypass China's stringent restrictions on foreign manufacturing and directly import and export iPhone components, which was further expedited thanks to the facility's purposeful proximity to a nearby airport. The iPhone plant continued to ramp up, and in 2014 included 94 production lines for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 5s, with an estimated 230 million smartphones having been exported from Zhengzhou in the years it had been open. The government referred to it as "one of the nation's crucial export centers." With all of the work came a labor force "the size of a national army," who relied heavily on government subsidies and produced 500,000 iPhones a day at peak. A crushing work force begins arriving for the early shift at 6:30 a.m. They travel by foot, by bus, by motor scooter and even by pedicab. They file steadily into dozens of factory sites, spread out across 2.2 square miles. At the peak, some 350,000 workers assemble, test and package iPhones — up to 350 a minute. The government pays recruiters a subsidy for every worker they hire, Mr. Liu said. “If the demand is high, then they will pay more,” he said. “If the demand is low, then the payment will be low, too.” One of the other major topics of the article centered around the help that Foxconn has received from the Chinese government in return for providing its services to Zhengzhou's financial and political surge over the years. Foxconn is said to receive a bonus for each export target it reaches, according to government records discovered by The New York Times, with subsidies totaling $56 million in the factory's first two years of iPhone manufacturing. Foxconn, in a separate statement, said it was grateful for the support of the government, noting that it was “no different than similar tax breaks all companies get in locations around the world for major investments.” In response to questions, Apple said it was aware of the government’s infrastructure support. But the company added that it had no knowledge of specific grants, subsidies or tax breaks given to its manufacturing partner. Foxconn remains a loyal partner in Apple's manufacturing processes to this day, most recently considering expansion into the United States and gearing up to be a major supplier of the 2017 iPhone. The rest of The New York Times' findings, discovered through over 100 interviews with factory workers, logistics handlers, truck drivers, tax specialists and current and former Apple executives, can be read in the full coverage here.

Tags: China, Foxconn [ 99 comments ] Top Rated Comments (View all) sir1963nz 1 week ago Those perks going to disappear by Jan 20th. 1.Trump does not control the perks in China. 2. Any tariffs Trump applies only applies to goods going to the USA, the rest of the world will simply get Cheaper products than the USA. 3. Impacted countries will put a tariff on US imports. Airbus for example would be pleased to see Boeing being 5% more expensive, as will Japanese car manufacturers. Just because China puts a tariff on US imports does not mean they will put a tariff on ones from the EU. If anything Trump will create a slow down of world trade, creating a global recession and even MORE US jobs lost. The rest of the world could also turn around and reduce copyright and patent terms, especially medical ones, so that generics will come quicker and cheaper. Dump the FAA,FDA etc from having sway over policy outside the USA, the EU I am sure would love to take up the mantle. Dump the US$ as the standard for trade, the euro will do just as well. Trump is a warning bell to other countries, reduce your exposure to the US and its policies. Its is also an opportunity to increase trade internationally (excluding the USA) with the understanding that Asia holds 60% of the worlds population, and 96% of the worlds population lives outside of the USA. The US (if not already) will soon be only the 2nd largest economy, China will be the biggest, and if the EU plays its cards right, they will soon become 2nd leaving the US 3rd. Unfortunately the US response will be to sow political discord, and if need be start a few wars around the world to try and maintain their grip on world affairs.

A LOT of companies get their parts made by them, and I'm willing to bet Apple is doing more than any of the other companies that have work done there to monitor and help the people working there. You don't hear of Samsung sending people there and looking into problems. Also, as far as jobs and work goes, I bet working there is a pretty desirable option for the employed in the area. At least as far as their options go. The problems are with the country and how it's run. People (the media) just love to mention Apple when they bring up the issues associated with FoxConn and other factories there because with Apple mentioned in the story, they'll get a lot more clicks, views, and attention. Rating: 13 Votes thewitt 1 week ago I'm looking forward to the day factories such as these will be fully automated, and need only a few people for oversight. No more "slave labor" when machines can do the work. It's time for the planet to move past the concept of there needing to be a job for everyone. We need to embrace a future where most jobs can be done by machines, and decide how best to proceed from there. The utopia where no one works and everyone gets everything for free? Just so you know, Foxconn is actually automating these factories and eliminating thousands of jobs a year. The Chinese government is financially supporting this as it allows them to keep manufacturing costs low in a labor market where costs are increasing and creating a real middle class. This means Vietnam and India will get the next factory cities unless China does something to stay competitive. Where there were once 80,000 employees in a single factory city complex in China, there are now only 60,000 generating the same output thanks to automation. Those 20,000 people are now out of work. I'm sure they are better off somehow for being sent back to their villages where they can farm rice. Rating: 10 Votes SlowX 1 week ago Remember when the People's Republic of China was communist? Rating: 9 Votes sir1963nz 1 week ago You do realize, you are drawing a parallel between them and us (the West) that even during our period of Industrialization did not exist. The future is not always a mirror of the past, especially with difficult cultures and political regimes/empires. There are many, many reasons that conditions may not improve. In fact, there are likely more arguments of why it will not when they try to be even more competitive with us after Jan 20. Your prediction is short sighted. And what happens on Jan 20, nothing really. Trump has no magic wand, factories and infrastructure and supply chains all take time to build. Or, to put it another way, by the time mid term elections are held, no new jobs will have been created in the US, lots more may have been lost in companies who export (US$2 Trillion) as tariffs on US exports by other countries made ones from China , the EU, etc more cost competitive, e.g. Airbus, Samsung,Panasonic, Toyota,etc etc etc etc. This could see punishment in the polls. End of term, few if any major players (Apple, HP, etc etc etc) will have started manufacturing by that stage. Trump is gone, policies are reversed and the world carries on. Its not just the factories, where is the power, the water, the raw materials, freight haulage, etc etc comping from, all of that takes years and years to happen. Where do 300,000 workers come from ? Where do they live, what about schools, hospitals, roads, water, sewerage, electricity, police, fire, internet, phone, shops, car mechanics, we are talking of a city of over 1 million people by the time you add in all the other services a population needs. How soon can a city of 1 million people get created ? But what happens if they go down the automation route, few employees. Well other US manufacturers will jump on that band wagon too, a rush a new automation will cause a fall in costs making it cost effective for a lot more companies. This will lead to few jobs comping back to the US, and a lot of jobs lost to automation. AI is going to have a major impact, its going to change almost everything and will replace a LOT of jobs. Instead of trying to bring back non existent jobs back to the USA, the US would have been better to start panning on what to do with a very large number of unemployed. The world has possibly hit (or soon will) peak employment, AI and automation is only going to see employment ratios head one way....down.

Entitlements? Love to hear your vision for the billions of people on the planet with no jobs. "We must do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian-Darwinian theory, he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living." - Buckminster Fuller Rating: 6 Votes Will do good 1 week ago I'm looking forward to the day factories such as these will be fully automated, and need only a few people for oversight.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search This iPhone feature may re-start the Android hardware wars Chris Burns - Dec 29, 2016 3 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Apple has long been rumored to bring a set of hardcore components to the iPhone lineup – next year they just might do it. A set of patents this week shows how Apple is preparing for – or at least protecting itself in case of the eventuality of – next-level hardness in outer components. This isn’t only for the iPhone, but the Apple Watch too. The patents released this week and last week to the United States Patent and Trademark Office show methods for sapphire treatment. They also mention and show places where Apple would like to place – or has already placed – sapphire in mobile devices. Places for sapphire to be – or potentially be – include the entire front panel of an iPhone, the Touch ID button (physical or touch sensitive), Apple Watch front glass, and iPhone back-facing camera lens glass. Images in this article come from a patent filed in June of 2015 and made public in December of 2016. This comes after Apple was rumored to include sapphire glass on the fronts and/or backs of their iPhones for the past couple of generations. This patent was filed for “System for heat treating a sapphire component” by Apple Inc., invented by Matthew S. Rogers et. all. What would it mean for the next iPhone to roll with a sapphire front glass panel? It’d mean a whole lot more pressure put on the rest of the industry to step up their efforts to make their hero devices more rugged, that’s for certain. Sapphire-infused glass is not unbreakable, but it’s far more durable than the reinforced glass we’ve dealt with in years past. Now that we’re in an age where smartphones aren’t all that different from one another – not in everyday use, anyway. Smartphones are able to use Sony-made image sensors to create cameras that are on-par with Apple’s setups. Apps that were once given priority development to iOS for the iPhone are now updated at the same time for Android. As such, making a switch from Android to iOS or from iPhone to Google Pixel isn’t nearly as much of a strain as it once was.

If true, that makes rumors of a larger screen iPhone in 2017 more likely—and that next year Apple plans to add yet another screen size to its smartphone lineup. Apple may be planning on making the iPhone display even bigger in 2017 Supply chain sources speaking with DigiTimes said Apple plans to use AMOLED displays only in the 5.8-inch model, and the updated 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models will continue to use TFT-LCD panels. Samsung will produce about 20 million panels a month. Reports of a 5.8-inch iPhone model cropped up earlier this year before the iPhone 7 was introduced. At the time, analysts expected Apple to replace the 5.5-inch model with the larger 5.8-inch version. Earlier this week, a report surfaced saying Apple is planning to add a 5-inch iPhone to its 2017 lineup. Since Apple doesn’t announce new product plans ahead of time, we don’t know for sure what’s in store for the iPhone, but at this point it’s looking like the company intends to add a new screen size. DigiTimes has a track record for getting bits of information right while sometimes misinterpreting what it learns. In this case, however, the information is pretty specific: Samsung will make the 5.8-inch AMOLED displays, Nissha Printing is supplying the touch sensors, and bonding the two together will be handled by either TPK Hilding and General Interface Solution, or Samsung Display. We are in the target window for new iPhone features to start leaking, so that makes word of a new screen size right on schedule. Later this year we’ll likely see parts leaks to help confirm these early rumors, and Apple typically unveils the new models in September, and ships a week or so later.

Nathan Ingraham, @nateingraham 12.29.16 in Personal Computing Comments 2659 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Nick Summers/ Engadget; Logo by L-Dopa Tim Cook and the rest of Apple's leadership will probably not look back fondly on 2016. iPhone sales declined for the first time, and Apple's profits followed suit. There are still bright spots, like the company's growing services business, and the company is still making insane amounts of money. Even so, the stalled growth has to be concerning to both the company and its investors. Don't get me wrong, I'm not here to pity Apple. I'm here to commiserate with its fans, the ones who Apple shafted this year. Particularly those of us who waited all year long for a substantial update to the Mac lineup only to be offered a pair of intriguing but compromised new laptops. Or those of us who bought an iPhone 7 and can't use the headphones included with it in our new MacBook Pro, or even those of us trying to figure out which iPad to buy. Across the board, Apple has confusing product lineups with weird and unnecessary compromises. And if you believe the wailing of aggrieved fans across the internet, it seems like plenty of loyal Apple supporters might be contemplating life outside the company's ecosystem. How did we get here? The product that most exemplifies Apple's difficulty in 2016 is the Mac. The Mac may only compose a small part of Apple's overall business, but that doesn't excuse the neglect it's endured recently. For 10 full months, the only update was a processor refresh on the 12-inch MacBook. (OK, you can also buy it in pink now. Thanks, Apple.) The company's main three machines -- the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and iMac -- went untouched. That's still the case for the iMac and MacBook Air; it's hard to recommend that anyone buy them right now. And we all know what happened when the MacBook Pro was finally updated: A portal to the dongleverse was opened. I'm not here to pity Apple. I'm here to commiserate with its fans, the ones who Apple shafted this year. Yes, Apple had already released the 12-inch MacBook with just a single USB-C port. But that computer was designed with extreme portability in mind; it was a laptop inspired by the iPad. It'll likely take the aging MacBook Air's place in the lineup as the company's entry-level Apple laptop. That was fine when the MacBook Pro and its many ports existed, but Apple has now made it clear it's not interested in keeping any legacy I/O around, even for its "pro" customers. That's an aggressive move, and one that has been met with widespread displeasure. In a vacuum, there are plenty of things to like about the new MacBook Pro. The screen is excellent, the reductions in size and weight are welcome improvements, performance and audio quality are both improved, and even the controversial Touch Bar has potential. Other things, such as the redesigned keyboard, are a matter of personal preference, not a definitive drawback. But reduced battery life, the loss of physical function keys and only one type of port mean that many of the professionals Apple is targeting will need to change their workflow. And that's not even mentioning the price increases: It'll cost you at least $1,799 to get a MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar. History suggests that prices of the new MacBook Pro will eventually drop as the old models are phased out, but there's still some significant sticker shock here. This confusing middle ground between old and new makes it hard to decide which MacBook Pro is the best for a given shopper. Is your $1,499 better spent on the previous-generation model or the new one? If you opt for the new model, you get a piddly two ports and no Touch Bar, while opting for last year's computer gets you all the ports you could want but in a heavier package with an older processor and worse screen. My guess is that lots of people will decide not to make a purchase instead of being forced to compromise one way or another. The new entry-level MacBook Pro would be a great step up from the MacBook Air for a lot of users -- but the $500 separating the two computers is a difficult gap to close. The most frustrating thing about all of this is that Apple could have silenced its critics by simply including a USB 3 port and not removing the SD reader. Space may be at a premium on this new device, but I'd be willing to bet that many potential buyers would be happy to give up two of the four USB-C ports in exchange for those legacy connections. But that wouldn't be a "courageous" move now, would it? Hell, Apple could even throw us the smallest of bones by including a USB 3 to USB-C dongle in the box so users can charge their iPhones without any further hassle. Speaking of the iPhone, let's go over that headphone situation one more time. Putting aside Schiller's ridiculous "courage" line, it's not unreasonable to wonder if we can evolve beyond the headphone jack. No other port has been immune to the march of time, and Apple probably has the data to show that most iPhone buyers use the included headphones. In theory, switching to the included Lightning headphones wouldn't be a big deal, and there's a dongle in there if you have a nice pair you want to keep using. What's the harm? Just as with the MacBook Pro, the problem is making consumers change their routines without a clear benefit. Apple executives gave a few rare interviews about the headphone jack decision when the iPhone 7 first came out, but the rationale mostly came down to using the limited space inside the iPhone for more useful technology, such as water resistance, a bigger battery and better cameras. Those are indeed great features to add to the iPhone. But they're also table stakes at this point. It's easy to forget that before the Galaxy Note 7 started exploding, Samsung had closed basically all the hardware gaps between its offerings and the iPhone, which means these updates were necessary, not revolutionary. And without also presenting an improved headphone solution, it's hard to not feel like something was lost in this move. Adding insult to injury, Apple did come up with an improved wireless-headphone experience: AirPods are much simpler to use than your average Bluetooth headset. But the price and mediocre audio quality make them a tough sell, and Apple didn't even manage to have the headphones out on time. They only just hit the Apple Store a few weeks ago, and they'll be in short supply for a good long time. They should have been ready to go alongside the iPhone 7, but Apple's latest handset has been on the market for nearly three months without its companion wireless earphones. That's a major tactical blunder. Many of Apple's more fervent supporters have scoffed at the notion that Apple is floundering a bit. After all, the company's bottom line grew for 15 years: It clearly knows how to build products that resonate. But there's been a growing chorus of unhappy fans who say that Apple doesn't have the same eye for detail as it used to. Some point to the goofy charging experiences for the new Apple Mouse and Pencil as design decisions that Steve Jobs never would have allowed. For me, it's this new world of dongles that I'd have to use to make a new MacBook Pro work the way I need it to. Something isn't right when the MacBook Air, which hasn't substantially changed in design for five years, is still better for my needs than the brand-new MacBook Pro. I'd happily open my wallet and pay $1,799 for that new computer if it had an SD slot and a full-sized USB port. Part of me feels like those are tiny things to quibble over when weighed against the improvements -- I'm dying for a better display at this point -- but we all have to draw the line somewhere. For others, that line might be the missing headphone jack, the late AirPods, the lack of substantial Mac updates (the Mac Pro hasn't been touched for three years), the confusing iPad lineup, the lackluster Apple Watch reception or any other chink in Apple's armor. Apple fans were sold on the promise that "it just works." When that stops being the case, it's much easier to start looking at competitors like Microsoft and Google. And that won't help Apple make 2017 a better year. Check out all of Engadget's year-in-review coverage right here.

Most Note 7 buyers purchased another high-end Samsung device, rather than switching to the iPhone, says Stephen Baker, a hardware analyst at the industry research firm NPD. Samsung was able to fend off other Android competition, and Apple, too, thanks to Apple’s own lack of a wowing product this year. Chetan Sharma, a mobile industry consultant also agreed with the statement. Apple has the strongest ecosystem, with its hardware, software and app and content stores. iPhone users looking for an upgrade stick with Apple. But in a year when Samsung dropped the ball in a huge way, Apple didn’t have a phone with a compelling enough feature set to lure Samsung owners away. Many analyst believe, however, that the iPhone 7 achieved strong sales, however it may not have been enough to reverse the decline in sales. With Apple’s decision to not reveal opening weekend sales, estimating the popularity of the device has become increasingly difficult.

Samsung Electronics Q4 Profit Jumps 50% Despite Note 7 Fiasco (Investor's Business Daily) The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) delivered a letter to India's national government last month, expressing its intent of manufacturing Apple products in the Indian market. India's Protectionist Laws India's tough protectionist laws make it nearly impossible for companies like Apple to sell its products in its own branded stores unless part of the manufacturing materials come from Indian vendors or are manufactured in India. Apple said in its letter that it is requesting financial incentives from the government and some compromised regulations to manufacture products in the country. The government has a program in place called "Make in India," which does provide capital subsidies Apple is looking for. Members from India's Ministries of Trade, Finance, Electronics and Information Technology, Forests and Environment will gather early next week to evaluate Apple's proposal. Possible Outcome If Apple and the Indian government come to an agreement, Apple should be able to open its own Apple-branded stores in the country and sell directly to the consumer. Currently, Apple sells its products through a network of Indian-owned retailers and distribution companies. The timing is ripe for an expansion since Apple commands a less than 5 percent of the fast-growing smartphone market. In fact, India's smartphone market could overtake the United States next year and become the world's second-largest market after China. Several Wall Street analysts, most notably Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities Research, believe Apple's next leg of growth will stem from the lucrative Indian market.

Parents Of Child Killed By Distracted Driver Sue Apple For Not Blocking FaceTime While Driving Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Parents Of Child Killed By Distracted Driver Sue Apple For Not Blocking FaceTime While Driving Image courtesy of Cheri Sundra December 29, 2016 11:42 am EST By Chris Morran@themorrancave distracted driving apple facetime texas lawsuits On Christmas Eve 2014, a driver distracted by using FaceTime on his iPhone crashed into another vehicle on I-35 in Texas, killing the 5-year-old girl in the back seat. The child’s parents and her older sister — all also injured in the collision — are now suing Apple, alleging that the company was negligent in not deploying safeguards that would restrict the use of FaceTime while driving. In a lawsuit [PDF] filed last week in a California state court, the parents point out that in 2008, Apple filed a patent application for a “Driver handheld computing device lock-out” systems that “disable the ability of a handheld computing device to perform certain functions, such as texting, while one is driving.” This patent was eventually granted by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office in April 2014. The plaintiffs allege that Apple was negligent by not including this technology in the iPhone 6 Plus (the phone used by the driver in the collision), and by allegedly failing to warn users that FaceTime was “likely to be dangerous when used or misused in a reasonably foreseeable manner.” This supposed negligence, was a “substantial factor” in the death of their daughter and their own injuries. Apple, argue the plaintiffs, has “consistently and continuously failed to implement a safer, alternative design that would lock-out and prevent used of FaceTime while driving.” The plaintiffs point to the Apple patent application, which cites research on the potentially deadly dangers of distracted driving, as evidence that the company willfully ignored the risks associated with FaceTime and driving. According to the complaint, Apple had known for years before this fatal incident about the “compulsory, addictive, and dangerous nature of iPhone usage by drivers” but “nevertheless voluntarily and intentionally failed to implement this technology.” [via Courthouse News] December 29, 2016 By Chris Morran@themorrancave distracted driving apple facetime texas lawsuits Tell a friend: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related don't look down New Apple Patent Seeks To Prevent Drivers From Texting While Behind The Wheel stopping the distraction Safety Regulators Hope A “Driver Mode” On Phones Would Curb Distracted Driving you're getting very sleepy State Farm Patents Wearable Device System That Could Poke Drowsy Or Distracted Drivers legal battles Lawsuit From Ericsson Wants To Ban Apple From Importing iPhones, iPads wisconsin alumni research foundation Jury Finds That Apple Used University Of Wisconsin Patent, Could Owe $862.4M In Damages Previous Sears Holdings Announces Another Round Of Kmart And Sears Closings Next Disruptive Couple Arrested After Forcing Delta Flight To Return To Airport Part of  Founded in 2005, Consumerist is an independent source of consumer news and information published by Consumer Media LLC, a not-for-profit subsidiary of Consumer Reports.

New Delhi (Sputnik) — Apple has sought tax incentives and relief from product labeling law from the Indian government to enter into local manufacturing of its iconic iphones. A group of senior officials from various ministries will meet in New Delhi in first week of January to consider the request made by Apple. However, India’s Ministry of Finance is not very keen to provide tax relief to Apple as it suspects that several other manufacturers, mainly Chinese, might ask for similar benefit. “Several companies in India are manufacturing mobile phones in India. Nobody is asking for additional incentives. Currently, the government provides sufficient support to boost electronic manufacturing,” a senior official told the news agency PTI. The Indian government has receiveda massive response in the electronic manufacturing sector in the last 18 months or so. According to the Ministry of Electronics and Information technology, 40 manufacturing units have been set up in India during this period. These include five units of global leading player Foxconn, four units of Intex, two unit of Lava and several other Chinese companies having one unit each. It is estimated that 220 million mobile phones have been sold in India in 2015-16 alone out of these; 110 million had some form of manufacturing in Indian locations. “Ease of doing business and a stable fiscal regime which the GST will bring to the forefront are likely to make India an overall attractive place for manufacturing. The early momentum that we have achieved actually needs to be sustained and further accelerated,” Aruna Sundararajan, top  bureaucrat of the Ministry of Electronics and Information technology said. © Photo: Pixabay iSpy: iPhones Secretly Store Call History on Apple’s ServersA recent study conducted jointly by India’s premier management institute IIM Bangalore and Counterpoint Researchers highlighted that the value addition in India is approximately 6% under the current state of manufacturing in India. This can be increased up to 32% by 2020 wherein the most of the manufacturing processes in India. The Indian government already provides financial incentives and subsidy to companies locally assembling smartphones. Apple has sought additional benefits  as it claimed that it is proposing to manufacture a state of the art product that cannot be outsourced from Indian vendors. This claim was rejected by Indian Finance Ministry in May this year. The government had also turned down a proposal made by Apple to import second hand IPhones and sell them in India. India is one of Apple’s top revenue generation and growth markets  despite the high price of its phones. The penetration of the high speed mobile internet network is expected to further boost the growth prospect of Apple which has already  seen 50% growth this year. ...

Happy New Year firework wallpapers   skip to main content skip to main menu     Sharp working to secure iPhone camera lens orders from Apple By Christian Zibreg, Dec 29, 2016 Tweet Leave a Comment According to Japanese outlet Nikkei, cited by DigiTimes, Sharp is hoping to secure some camera lens orders from Apple for future iPhones. To boost its chances of cutting a lucrative deal with Apple, Sharp is now speculated to increase its investment in Japan-based lens module maker Kantatsu, in which it currently holds a 44 percent stake. Sharp would need to compete with Taiwan-based Largan Precision, which currently supplies iPhone camera lens modules in volume. Sharp is owned by Foxconn, the world’s top contract manufacturer that assembles iPhones. Kantatsu currently produces 12-megapixel camera modules with a yield rate comparable to that of Largan, as per Chinese-language outlet Liberty Times. Sharp’s president Tai Jeng-wu said in recent letter to employees, a copy of which was obtained by Nikkei, that the company should boost its camera module business through investments and acquisitions of core equipment and manufacturing partners. Apple does not hold any stake in Kantatsu though it did provide the company with a batch of equipment for manufacturing upgrades in early 2016. In another report today, DigiTimes reiterated that Samsung will exclusively provide AMOLED panels for next year’s iPhone 8. Other panel makers such as LG Display, Japan Display and Sharp could join Apple’s AMOLED supply chain some time in 2018.

We'll find out soon. Sarah Tew/CNET For the past couple of years, the annual CES trade show in Las Vegas was a hotbed of new wearables. CES 2016 saw the Fitbit Blaze debut at the show, along with plenty of smart clothing concepts. CES 2015 had plenty of fitness trackers, too. CES 2017? Not so much.  In the mobile space -- including wearable tech -- CES has begun to take a backseat to the Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona (only about eight weeks later) and company-specific events, such as Apple and Google's annual developer conferences. In the wearable market, we aren't expecting any major announcements. There are several reasons: A late flood of watches and fitness trackers that arrived in the summer and fall means that companies have just begun their product cycles. Meanwhile, smartwatch sales are tanking, and we are seeing more companies pull back on releasing new products. If there is anything noteworthy, it will likely focus on health and fitness, but it probably won't have the mass appeal of an Apple Watch or a Fitbit. But that doesn't mean there won't be plenty of companies trying to make a splash.  What's on deck from the major players Two of the biggest names in tech -- Apple and Google -- don't even attend the show, at least not officially. While we will likely see hundreds of Apple Watch apps and accessories, there will be no new products from the iPhone-maker, which shouldn't come as much of a surprise. Google has already indicated that its delayed Android Wear 2.0 software will finally hit in 2017. But we don't expect any high-profile new hardware -- including those two new flagship smartwatches -- to be unveiled in Las Vegas. Samsung has a big presence on the show floor, but we aren't expecting any new wearables. The company will likely focus on other product categories (TVs, appliances, smart home), while promoting existing products, such as the Gear Fit 2 and Gear S3. Fitbit had a big 2016. The company refreshed nearly its entire portfolio over the course of the year with the release of the Blaze, Alta, Charge and Charge 2 fitness trackers. We aren't expecting much from Fitbit, although there is a slight chance we could see an update to the company's GPS sportwatch, the Fitbit Surge, which was released over two years ago. Garmin is one of the few companies to actually see shipments and market share increase this year, mainly in part due to its focus on niche sports watches. As for new products at the show? There is a good chance we see something. Garmin has a history of announcing new watches at CES. We saw the Fenix 3 multisport watch in 2015, followed by the Fenix 3 HR in 2016. Perhaps 2017 will be the year of the Fenix 4 or another Fenix 3 variant?  There could be some cool concepts Smartwatches and fitness trackers are stuck in a rut. Innovation has slowed down, battery life hasn't improved, and too many of these devices are still dependent on a phone, but CES is always a chance to show off some interesting products. A handful of companies usually dazzle us with futuristic product concepts, many of which focus on health and fitness. In 2016, Samsung showed off smart clothing and Intel wowed me with its Radar Pace smart sunglasses, which were eventually released this past October. What could we see in 2017? I'm predicting three things: voice assistants in watches, more personalized coaching as well as feedback and longer-lasting battery tech. We've seen examples of these trends in products like the Alexa-compatible Martian mVoice watch and Matrix Powerwatch, which -- according to the company -- never has to be charged and runs off of your own body heat.  Expect vaporware -- but hope for a surprise CES has become a show about startups and crowdfunded ideas -- and prototypes. On all these fronts, expect a few odd ideas and a lot of vaporware. There will be hundreds of Chinese knockoffs that we will never hear from again. And remember that even more established companies can miss deadlines. Last CES, I was really excited about the Mio Slice fitness tracker, but it's December and I am still waiting for it to hit the market. That said, there's still plenty of room for a surprise or two. Just like my colleague Claire Reilly, I'd love to be totally wowed by a new wearable. Make it happen, CES.

In India, all products, from food to gadgets, are required by law to have detailed packaging information stating the name and address of the importer, date of packaging, and maximum retail price, directly on the product. This, Apple argues, would ruin the look of its minimalist design aesthetics, according to a report by the Economic Times. The Cupertino company has filed a formal request to India’s Department of Revenue and Department of Electronics and Information Technology requesting to be excluded from the rule. The company is hoping to list all of that details in the software instead. It’s worth noting that Apple does indeed print some US government regulated information on the back of iPhones/iPads — you know, the part with the “Designed in California, Made in China” bit — but just the absolute bare minimum (which became even less in 2014 after President Obama signed the E-labeling bill). President Obama already gave Apple (and other phonemakers) a break when he signed a bill that removed the mandatory FCC regulation labeling. If Apple could have its way, it would have no markings on the back but its own logo. Photo: Apple It’s not known whether India’s government will concede to Apple’s demands (which also includes tax concessions), because the bargaining power in this negotiation isn’t as one-sided as one might think. Apple suffered a decline in annual revenue from$233.7 billion in 2015 to $215.6 billion this year, and India was one of the iPhones’ biggest growth market. Moreover, India’s smartphone market is expected to overtake the U.S.’s next year and become the second largest in the world behind China, according to recent research by IDC. Apple wants to manufacture iPhones in India not because India’s labor is cheaper than in China, but because that would allow the company finally open its own stores in the country, without distributors acting as the middle men (and taking a cut). It’s a strategy that Chinese phonemaker Huawei has also deployed.                                              Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Apple has been in something of a stand-off with the Indian government over the company’s wish to open retail stores in the country. India requires 30% of components to be manufactured locally before permission is granted for single-brand stores, and although it was once reported that this requirement was likely to be waived, that was contradicted by a later report. The company initially wants to open Apple Stores in three locations – Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai – but it now appears that local manufacturing will be the quid pro quo. Apple has requested two forms of incentive in return for manufacturing iPhones and iPads locally. First, it wants subsidies for the capital expenditure involved in setting up manufacturing plants. Second, as reported earlier today, it would like an exemption from the requirement to print product information on devices. The Indian government already provides local manufacturing incentives to a number of companies, but would reportedly need to ‘tweak its rules’ to meet Apple’s requests. Earlier in the year, Foxconn was reported to be planning to open a $10B iPhone manufacturing plant in India, but things have since been quiet on this front. Although the U.S. is currently Apple’s largest market, it’s widely expected that China will take this crown within the next year or so, with India likely to end up as #2 over time.

Happy New Year firework wallpapers   skip to main content skip to main menu     Samsung rumored to be lone supplier of AMOLED panels for 5.8-inch iPhone 8 By Christian Zibreg, Dec 29, 2016 Tweet 17 Comments Barclays Research analysts think Apple might offer iPhone 8 in two screen sizes, one measuring five inches diagonally and the other 5.8 inches. DigiTimes claimed in March that Apple had picked Samsung Display as the main supplier of 5.8-inch AMOLEDs. In a follow-up report Thursday, DigiTimes reiterated that Samsung Display will be Apple’s exclusive supplier of 5.8-inch AMOLED display panels for iPhone 8. Citing sources in the Taiwan supply chain, the trade publication said that Samsung Display is able to build up to approximately twenty million AMOLED units per month for Apple. Global shipments of AMOLED-based iPhone 8 models in 2017 could reach an estimated 60 to 70 million units, the sources noted. Japan-based Nissha Printing will reportedly supply touch sensors for use in AMOLEDs and bonding of touch sensors. Supply chain makers should begin building parts for next-generation iPhones in March 2017 in small volume, increasing output in May-June. Be that as it may, Apple may potentially source additional AMOLED panels from LG Display, Japan Display and Sharp in 2018, said earlier reports. Samsung, of course, is the world’s top producer of AMOLEDs with more than 90 percent share of the worldwide AMOLED market for smartphones. However, AMOLED panels are expensive and difficult to produce so they’re only featured on top-of-the-line phones from Samsung and other Android makers. Aside from LCD-based iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus updates, iPhone 8 is rumored to incorporate a curved-screen, bezel-less design. Combined with a rumored in-screen Touch ID Home button, this could theoretically permit Apple’s engineers to increase screen size without necessarily making the entire device bigger.

Docservlet Samsung will release the same garbage as the S6 again and you fandroids will gobble it up and declare it the best phone. What a joke. Rowan09 Apple never release the same internals on devices that’s always different (besides RAM). People care more about the external hence Samsung can sell a Note 7 when the S7 Edge is the same device without a stylus and some software tweaks. jOn Garrett The iPhone 4 & 4S was the same and the iPhone 5 & 5C was the same phone.

Specifically, in the first few days after Christmas, the number of unique iPhone 7’s increased by 12.7 percent, compared with an 8.5 percent increase for Google’s newest flagship. And when comparing iOS to Android devices in general – including phones, tablets, and iPods – more new  Apple devices were switched on in the first three days after Christmas, than Android devices. The number of unique Apple mobile devices (excluding Apple Watches) increased by 12.8 percent during this time, down from 15.8 percent last year. Meanwhile, the number of unique Android devices increased only by 2.6 percent, down from 10.6 percent in 2015. These figures confirm an earlier report from Flurry Analytics which found that Apple devices had the most activations throughout the week leading up to Christmas Day and the start of Hanukkah, with 44 percent of activations globally. Samsung came in second place with 21 percent – an indication that the Note 7 scandal didn’t turn off potential Samsung customers in significant numbers. However, neither Apple nor Samsung capitalized on their new smartphones, according to a recent Wall St. Journal report, citing a lack of a dramatic rise for either tech company. Apple may have led activations with its 44 percent share, but that was down from 49.1 percent the year before, it pointed out. In the new report from Mixpanel, the firm additionally looked into the numbers associated with the Apple Watch, and found declines on that front in terms of usage. In what appears to be a reflection of consumers’ overall waning interest in smartwatches, Apple Watch usage in the month of December 2016 is now below where it was during the same time last year, following a steady drop since peak usage this May. This doesn’t mean that people weren’t being gifted new Apple Watch devices over the holidays – in fact, the number of unique Apple Watches increased by 8.9 percent this year, during the first three days after Christmas. However, that’s down from 18.6 percent during the same time last year, said Mixpanel. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Founded 1976 Overview Apple is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications.

A new supply chain report today notes that Samsung Display will become the exclusive supplier of AMOLED panels for use in Apple's new iPhone devices to be launched in 2017 and can supply 20 million units in maximum a month.   The Digitimes report further notes that Apple will launch 4.7", 5.5" and 5.8" new iPhone models in second-half 2017, with TFT-LCD panels to be used in the former two models and AMOLED for the 5.8-inch one, the sources said. Global shipments of the AMOLED iPhone in 2017 are estimated at 60-70 million units, the sources noted.   Japan-based Nissha Printing will supply touch sensors for use in AMOLED panels and bonding of touch sensors and AMOLED display panels will be undertaken by either Samsung Display or Taiwan-based TPK Holding and General Interface Solution.   Supply chain makers of the new iPhone will begin production in small volumes in March 2017 and increase output in May-June.   Whether Apple will decide to use Samsung's ALD (Atomic Layer Deposition) technology to flexible OLED thin-film encapsulation process for future iPhones is still in question.The technology provides superior waterproofing and oxygen damage reduction for OLED displays.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Happy New Year firework wallpapers   skip to main content skip to main menu     Consumer Reports reportedly stands by its controversial MacBook Pro battery findings By Christian Zibreg, Dec 29, 2016 Tweet 9 Comments As you probably heard, the influential consumer organization Consumer Reports is not recommending Apple’s new MacBook Pro due to inconsistent battery performance. Apple’s marketing honcho Phill Schiller responded by saying that the product-testing magazine’s test results don’t match the company’s own data. 9to5Mac reached out to Consumer Reports to learn more about their findings, here’s what the magazine had to say. As a quick backgrounder, the magazine found wild discrepancies in the performance of the new MacBook Pro’s battery. The 13-inch Touch Bar-equipped model scored a run time of 16 hours in the first trial, then it dropped to 12.75 hours in the second trial and to a surprising 3.75 hours in the third trial. The non-Touch Bar 13-inch model ran 19.5 hours on a single charge, but only 4.5 hours in the next trial. The numbers for the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar ranged from 18.5 down to as little as 8 hours. No matter how you look at it, it’s hard to believe that the machines scored almost double the ten-hour battery life advertised by Apple. According to Consumer Reports’ director of electronics testing Maria Rerecich, they won’t be re-running the tests and their testing equipment is indeed working properly. In this case, we don’t believe re-running the tests are warranted for several reasons. First, as we point out in our original article, experiencing very high battery life on MacBooks is not unusual for us—in fact we had a model in our comparative tests that got 19 hours. Second, we confirmed our brightness with three different meters, so we feel confident in our findings using this equipment. Finally, we monitor our tests very closely. There is an entry logged every minute, so we know from these entries that the app worked correctly. Even stranger than the above numbers, Consumer Reports found that running the same tests using the power-hungry Chrome browser (Chrome did not affect overall ratings) resulted in “consistently high battery life” on all six runs. Rerecich says that Consumer Reports is working collaboratively with Apple to understand the lower battery life findings. “We will report back to our readers if and when there is an update,” she said. It’s true that the product-testing magazine has thus far rated Apple’s notebooks highly, but it’s also important to remember that Consumer Reports embarrassed itself during Antennagate back in the iPhone 4 days.

It’s comments like this that annoy me about iDB. They’re always defending Apple rather than just reporting. Should I have told my girlfriend about the time when I couldn’t “perform” with another girl, when I was 18? Smh… People in the real world have reported similar performance discrepancies, which seem to centre around the use of the discreet/integrated GPUs. n0ahcruz3 Well, its a blog for Apple so.. expect some biased reporting towards apple. lol george Also how did they embarrass themselves when atennagate was an actual phone defect. Shurmano reshulón Safari is running horrible for me lately. Way more slower than Chrome and others. Safari may be part of the problem. I still use Safari as my main browser, because I have all my bookmarks there… and because iOS integration. But I find my self more and more using alternate browsers in daily basis. I also find macOS to be more sluggish, buggier and worse every day. I really miss the Mavericks days. That was a good operating system: efficient, fast and the most bug-free OS X I ever seen. askep3 Just looking at the CR review it seems like safari is causing all the problems, and the chrome has no issues, in fact it’s giving high results even while being power hungry XDavior lanz I use Microsoft Edge …. Never in my life have I used a better browser! soundmanbrad Consumer Reports, in the past, has shown that they are biased and fully aware of their influence. They take advantage of it to hurt companies they might disagree with. That’s what I think. madmaxmedia Even the new MacBook Pro is the first Apple notebook that did not receive a Consumer Reports recommendation. Mark S Good I’m glad Consumer Reports isn’t a lap dog for tech giants. The worst person in the world to listen to talk about Apple products is Phil Schiller. Hello? He’s trying to sell you something. Of course he’s going to gush and rave and stretch the truth. I’m sure Apple can demonstrate anything in their labs under very controlled conditions that have nothing to do with an off the line product in the typical consumer’s hands.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines Apple planning to open first retail store on Samsung’s home turf Apple shares wallpapers created with Mac and iOS devices for Chinese New Year How to add Live Photos to your Instagram stories This is what the iPhone’s interface could have looked like TSSChecker now correctly supports iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus   The latest jailbreak news TSSChecker now correctly supports iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Yalu + mach_portal now supports TSMC models: still unstable NoTodayView disables the Spotlight widget page on the Home and Lock screens AntennaGIFDL lets you download GIFs from the Antenna Reddit client app CasualAlarm uses random songs from your music library for alarm sounds iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2017.

Apple’s concern is that the Indian regulatory requirements to print product-related information directly onto devices will clutter up the iPhone’s minimalist design; it’s said to be among several concessions Apple is seeking from India after expressing its intention to begin manufacturing there. Apple wants to instead provide those required product details either in software or on the product packaging, rather than having to etch them directly onto the iPhone itself. Another report from qq.com (via Digitimes) reveals that Apple’s China-based supply chain manufacturers would be unlikely to set up manufacturing operations in the U.S. even if Apple chose to shift production from China. Chinese companies note that higher labor costs would preclude them from operating as efficiently, since even though power and land costs in the U.S. are lower than in China, the cost and complexity of labor would be significantly higher — not only because of higher wages, but also due to worker supply, median age, and willingness to accept varying working schedules. Another supplier noted that a lack of the complete supply chain — which exists in China — would mean longer turnaround times to adapt to changes.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Patent Filing Shows new MacBook Pro Touch Bar Possibly coming to their Magic Keyboard and beyond | Main | Another Report Claims that Samsung has the Exclusive OLED Contract for the Anniversary 5.8" iPhone » December 29, 2016 Foxconn/Sharp Aim to Grab iPhone Lens Module Business from Apple   Yesterday Patently Apple posted a report titled "The False Narrative that Apple's Supply Chain in Taiwan won't move to the U.S. under any Circumstances." In that report I noted that some Chinese iPhone supply chain players have said off-record that they may not want to set up shop in the U.S. to support a Foxconn iPhone plant. I further noted that "Foxconn has been trying to expand their relationship with Apple forever and they'll be able to find other supply chain players to come to the U.S. and where they can't find suppliers of some kind they'll work with U.S. entrepreneurs and businesses to fill the gap, if not open a new division of their own."   Foxconn has been exploring a way to open an iPhone plant in the U.S. since Apple's CEO made the request back in June of this year. They may have found a weakness in the supply chain that they could fill. According to a new Japanese report, Sharp, backed by Foxconn Electronics, is likely to increase its investment in Japan-based lens module maker Kantatsu in order to compete with Taiwan-based Largan Precision to secure lens module orders from Apple for iPhone devices."   The speculation came after Sharp's president Tai Jeng-wu delivered recently a letter to its employees saying that Sharp should vertically integrate its camera module business through investments and acquisitions of core equipment and manufacturing partners.   Kantatsu is capable of producing of over 12-megapixel camera modules with a yield rate that is comparable to Largan Precision, said the Chinese-language Liberty Times. Sharp currently holds a 44% stake in Kantatsu.   Apple's current iPhone 7 uses 12MP wide-angle and telephoto cameras according Apple's own specifications.   While Apple currently does not hold any stake in Kantatsu, it did provide the Japan-based lens module maker with a batch of equipment for manufacturing upgrades in early 2016, said the paper.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

You can now register to find out when Super Mario Run hits Android Posted Dec 29, 2016 by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story Volvo integrates Skype for Business in its 90 series vehicles Nintendo gave Apple a timed exclusive with Super Mario Run, but ‘timed’ means that it was bound to arrive on Android sooner or later. Now, Android users can register in the Google Play Store to get notified when it is actually available, much like iOS users could prior to the game’s launch on Apple’s mobile devices. The Play Store entry for Super Mario Run features a video preview of the game, which looks pretty much exactly like Super Mario Run on iOS. The game’s description outlines the same features, too, including World Tour, Toad Rally and the Kingdom Builder. It mentions that a free trial will be available immediately upon download, with a set purchase price unlocking the rest of the content, but it doesn’t specific said price, though it’ll likely be on par with the iOS version. Nintendo launched Super Mario Run on iOS on December 15, and has racked up over 50 million downloads for the first mobile Mario game so far. It’s arriving on Android sometime in 2017, but judging by this pre-registration campaign, it should be sooner rather than later. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Medium in the Hot Seat | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Apps Popular Posts Featured Stories DJI Opens its Wallet for Hasselblad | Crunch Report VIDEO | 2:53 | Crunch Report A whole lot of people watched VR porn in 2016 51 minutes ago | Lucas Matney Intel report on hacking says Russian interference with US election was ‘boldest yet’ 4 hours ago | Kate Conger WikiLeaks mulls building a dox database of verified Twitter users 5 hours ago | Taylor Hatmaker Theranos slashes another 41 percent of its workforce 5 hours ago | Sarah Buhr Latest From Mobile Sprig adds tips and equity to keep meal deliverers loyal 5 hours ago | Josh Constine AOL’s Kanvas launches an SDK: now any app can use its photo and video effects 11 hours ago | Ingrid Lunden Nvidia hits prime time at CES this year yesterday | Matthew Lynley GoPro wants the moments you capture on the internet instantly yesterday | Matthew Lynley Comment moderation powered by Up Next Volvo integrates Skype for Business in its 90 series vehicles Posted Dec 29, 2016 CrunchBoard Job Listings Software Developer for Humanitarian Health Technology at Vecna Cares Charitable Trust (Boston, MA, United States) B2B Marketing Manager, SaaS at Qualer (San Diego, CA, United States) Senior Software Developer at American Physical Society (Ridge, NY, United States) Senior Data Engineer at Peaksware (Boulder, CO, United States) Graphic/Website Designer for Nonprofits at Media Cause (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Event & Editorial Calendar Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2017 AOL Inc.

You might expect this year in review to be a comedy roast. From exploding smartphones to Supreme Court cases, this was clearly not the South Korean tech company’s time to shine. Fortunately, there were enough silver linings to make up for it.  The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge were Samsung’s best phones yet. In fact, we called the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge “the best smartphone in the world” at the time of its release. And, because of the way things panned out with the latest Galaxy Note 7, we’re inclined to say that may still be the case. However, Samsung saw success in other areas this year as well. The Samsung Notebook 9, for instance, made our best Ultrabooks list, ostensibly as a return to form for the company’s ostensibly stagnating laptop business. Meanwhile, the company also revealed one of the most unique desktop computers of the year, namely the ArtPC Pulse, which looks to finally take on Apple’s now-antiquated Mac Pro.  Samsung even occupied the top spot on our best 4K TVs list with its quality backlit KS9500 range. That goes without mentioning its advancements in budget-friendly virtual reality options with its third helping of Gear VR headsets. Looking forward into the future, 2017 could potentially be a year of redemption for Samsung. Although this year brought a handful of stellar product launches, in retrospect they were all overshadowed by one monumental error – perhaps unfairly so. 2017 in Samsung mobile devices Samsung’s mobile business was hit the hardest this year, and understandably so. The Note 7 blunder, specifically, cost the company nearly $10 billion, according to CNN. Financial discussions aside, there’s no denying that Samsung’s mobile strategy needs to be turned around in 2017. If rumors and reports are to be believed, the company is most certainly making changes for the better. Next year, you can expect not three but six different smartphones from the Korean hardware maker.  The Galaxy S8, S8 Edge, and Note 8 are all surefire hits – assuming they don’t literally catch on fire – while the company also has refreshes to its low-to-mid range Galaxy A-series smartphones in the works, namely the Galaxy A3, A5 and A7. All will have sufficient bumps in specs including the move to full HD 1080p screens and 3,000mAh batteries at the entry level. Nevertheless, it should go without saying that we can’t help but have our curiosity piqued more by Samsung’s flagship devices than its low-cost alternatives. If you were one of those who abandoned ship on Apple because of the loss of the 3.5mm headphone jack, it may be disheartened to hear that with the Galaxy S8, Samsung may also be moving to USB-C only arrangement.  Like the iPhone 7, the Samsung Galaxy S8 will reportedly lose its headphone jack in favor of newer, digital interfaces. That’s right, USB-C will join the ranks of Apple’s Lightning connector in serving as a means of replacement for the antiquated (and analog) 3.5mm headphone jack we’ve all come to know and love. Of course, if that were the Galaxy S8’s only change, we wouldn’t be inclined to upgrade. Luckily, it looks as though the Galaxy S8 will also tote a bezel-free design with both the home button and fingerprint scanner built into the screen. Reports also suggest a large 4K screen, 6GB of RAM and a dual-lens rear camera, reminiscent of the iPhone 7 Plus. In another attempt to steal some of Apple’s lightning, Samsung released a Jet Black-inspired Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge color variant named Pearl Black. Assuming Samsung wants to keep its forthcoming models in line with current-gen handsets, we wouldn’t discount the possibility of the Galaxy S8 twins adopting the glossy black fashion as well.  Keeping with the company’s history in revealing flagship smartphones the day before Mobile World Congress (MWC) kicks off, we can expect to see both the S8 and S8 Edge in the flesh as soon as February 26. Another, more far-fetched string of gossip has repeatedly proposed that Samsung has not one, but two foldable phones in production slated for early 2017. One of these devices will ship complete with two flat panels bolstered by a hinge while the other will be sport a single OLED display and ship shortly after the first.  Although it might appear unlikely at first glance, word of a Samsung Galaxy X can be found dating all the way back to 2011. Regardless of budget or personal necessity, Samsung is bound to have something for you in its – as always – vast array of mobile devices set to hit the road in 2017. 2017 in Samsung tablets and computers Now we’re not going to sit here and pretend Samsung’s computing business has been stellar these past few years, but we’re also not opposed to admitting that this year was pretty damn great for Samsung PCs. The cylindrical ArtPC Pulse tempted us with its potent specs and luscious Mac Pro sense of style. Meanwhile the Samsung Notebook 7 Spin put the MacBook Pro to shame with an aggressive price point and uniquely HDR display. Sure, the company had some compatibility issues with Windows 10 earlier in the year, but with PCs as proficient as the Samsung Notebook 9 at the helm, we couldn’t complain too much. While we haven’t heard much about Samsung’s 2017 PC lineup, the company will undoubtedly introduce new hardware come the new year.  Though it’s not a proper home computer per sé, the Galaxy Tab S2 is expected to drop in the first quarter of 2017. This will come not even a year after the release of Samsung’s most recent tablet, the Windows 10-equipped Galaxy TabPro S.  With the strong critical reception to its first shot at Windows on a tablet, we wouldn’t be too shocked to see Samsung take things a step further, opting for a desktop OS on its more affordable tablet PC. As of now, however, all we can say based on reports is that the Galaxy Tab S3 will come in two flavors, one outfitted with LTE functionality and the other without. Meanwhile, Android tablets fading into obscurity, it would make sense to maintain an exclusive 2-in-1 focus in regard to tablets. SamMobile confirmed back in August that a Galaxy TabPro S2 will arrive across four models in 2017. The outlet’s sources claim that the Galaxy Tab Pro S2 will take advantage of a 12-inch, 2,160 x 1,440 screen and an Intel Core M-series processor. Outside of that, there isn’t much concrete evidence pointing to much else as far as Samsung computers go. That said, we wouldn’t be awe-struck to see a Kaby Lake revamp of the Samsung Notebook 7 Spin after seeing how it fared with reviewers. 2017 in Samsung 4K TVs You might say this year was the year that 4K TVs finally managed to truly shake the scene. Whether it’s owed primarily to Black Friday sales or more widely available 4K high-dynamic range (HDR) content, there’s no denying that Ultra HD is the way to go heading into 2017.  With that in mind, Samsung’s KS9500 range leads the pack when it comes to delivering HDR imaging and high quality sound. Because of its overwhelmingly positive reviews, it makes sense that Samsung wants to continue from where it left off in 2017. In doing so, however, this means making some concessions while other companies move on to embrace new technologies.  While the likes of LG and Sony have been quick to employ OLED display panels, VP of Samsung Display, Park Dong-Gun, admitted earlier this year that the Korean tech company would be reluctant to follow suit. Instead, Samsung plans on iterating on its existing Quantum Dot technology, which has demonstrated better clarity and brightness over its OLED counterpart.  Moreover, an emphasis on Quantum Dot will allow for more competitive pricing, enabling Samsung to circumvent its OLED-hoisting opponents. Rather than taking a risk in a polluted OLED market, Samsung is choosing instead to remain at the top of a category it already reigns supreme in. Lastly, though we shouldn’t expect a consumer version to make its way to brick-and-mortar anytime soon, Samsung filed a patent back in January 2016 for a holographic TV that projects images literally off the screen. Being the ambitious pipe dream that it is, you shouldn’t expect to secure a holographic TV in 2017, but it wouldn’t take us aback to see a working prototype as imminently as CES.  2017 in VR and beyond We may have only just recently gotten our hands on the third round of Gear VR headsets, and while it’s the perfect gateway drug for Samsung users eager to jump into PC-powered VR, it’s also far from perfect.  Auspiciously, Samsung knows this. That’s why, perhaps with its next Gear VR rendition, the company plans on adding eye and mouth detection for an added layer of immersion (and virtual oddities). This is all just patent hearsay, so don’t sue us if it doesn’t come to fruition, but this does seem like a reasonable next step for Gear VR – aside from better apps and a higher resolution. All in all, Samsung has a busy year ahead of it, jam-packed with new devices and software across a wide range of categories. Truthfully, it’s rare for companies like this to deliver so many exceptional product offerings across a breadth of different hardware divisions. Here’s to hoping that in 2017, things really blow up for Samsung – just not in the way they literally did this year.   Now, let’s see what you can expect from Microsoft in 2017 Tags MacBook Pro ABOUT THE AUTHOR Gabe Carey Gabe has been writing about video games and technology since he was 16 years old.

Antonia Gallagher from Birmingham, says that became terrified by the experience and the phone was bought recently from an Apple Store before it exploded in her jacket while she was walking down the street. The Apple device exploded, her skin got burned and the explosion caused a giant hole in her coat, blouse, and pants. Antonia published the photographic evidence on social media. All users can clearly see how the phone looks completely destroyed while her clothes got ruined. ‘I tried to get the phone out but I couldn’t because it was so hot, but then it stopped smoking.’ “I was very scared. I was simply walking down the street and I heard a loud snap, then I realized that my phone was on fire in my coat pocket”, said Antonia for Daily Mail. The youngster stated that she contacted some representatives of Apple but received they refused to offer her an explanation and an apology. “They looked at the phone and said they will announce me about what measures will be taken, but they never returned my calls. It seems they do not care”, complains Antonia. “They haven’t apologized at any stage. They haven’t taken any responsibility.” Lately, they reported other incidents with iPhones that caught fire. Most times, the explosions were caused by an unauthorized repair or the use of faulty cables. 243SHARES ShareTweet Subscribe TAGS Antonia Gallagher from Birmingham Her iPhone exploded in her pocket SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleBaby undergoes heart surgery at just 48 hours after birth Next articleTrump’s inaugural speech will be inspired by Reagan and Kennedy Nilgun Salim RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Hi-Tech Bentley launches the “most powerful” car Hi-Tech The official release date for the new Samsung Galaxy S8 was revealed Hi-Tech BlackBerry launches new phone LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply * Copy This Password * * Type Or Paste Password Here * 14,189 Spam Comments Blocked so far by Spam Free Wordpress Notify me of follow-up comments by email.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Next-Gen AirPods may use a Radically Different Design with Ear Magnets to keep them from Falling Out | Main | Foxconn/Sharp Aim to Grab iPhone Lens Module Business from Apple » December 29, 2016 Apple Patent Filing Shows new MacBook Pro Touch Bar Possibly coming to their Magic Keyboard and beyond   In November Patently Apple posted a report titled "It Appears that Apple's 'Touch Bar' is Copying Heavily from Microsoft's 2010 Adaptive Keyboard Concept." In 2010 Microsoft's Applied Sciences Group sponsored the Student Innovation Contest at UIST. Microsoft's web page notes that their 2010 contest was focused on an experimental keyboard that they were working on. Our November report presented a video illustrating the Touch-Bar-like concept.   Today, the US Patent & Trademark Office published a patent application from Apple that reveals their 'Touch Bar' patent application. The history of the patent is very difficult to track down on USPTO's database to establish this as an original Apple patent or one the acquired. Oddly this patent has surfaced in the U.S. years after it was filed in Europe. The only reason I find it odd is that the so-called 'Touch Bar' patent never, ever mentions an OLED display as if that was added to the invention at a later date by Apple. It's unclear whether Apple acquired this patent so as to not get sued and then updated with a twist moving to an OLED display. .   Suspicions of the history of this patent aside, Apple's patent FIG. 1 noted below is a perspective view of a computing device incorporating a sample I/O device; FIG. 2A is an enlarged top plan view of the sample I/O device in a first configuration; FIG. 17 is an enlarged top plan view of the example computing device illustrating edge lighting for the sample I/O device; and FIG. 21 is a top perspective view of the sample computing device, showing a sample antenna region.   Considering that the entire patent application is focused on using an e-ink layer for the Touch Bar rather than an OLED display, it's hard to think that Apple will in the future revert backwards to an e-ink display design.   You could review the patent for yourself here, as I see no reason to delve into this invention any further considering that seems to already be outdated.   One of Apple's patent figures illustrates as noted below shows an e-ink bar placed at one side of an iPad. This concept is already available via Duet Display as noted in the graphic below.     Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

Apple's most powerful and priciest iPad to date, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, has a starting price of £679, and is claimed to be a device that is capable of replacing laptops. It has a faster processor than the other iPads (except the smaller iPad Pro), with a new 64-bit A9X and M9 combination under the hood, which Apple claims rivals most portable PCs.

Apple has done away with the headphone jack from the iPhone 7, and with it, sounded the death knell for cables. Wires are annoying: they get tangled into impossible knots, caught on pieces of clothing, and mean you have to keep your phone in your pocket. We’ve put up with them because they’re reliable, and because the alternatives have been worse: Bluetooth headphones in the past were almost universally poor quality, expensive, lasted for just a couple of hours and were a pain to connect. That’s all starting to change, and Apple has put its hat into the wireless headphone ring with the £159 AirPods, which after a couple of months of delays, finally went on sale in December. The wireless AirPods with their case Credit: Reuters But these aren’t just another set of Bluetooth headphones - in true Apple fashion they come with their own set of idiosyncracies which are at times delightful, at times frustrating, but always dividing opinion. How they work The AirPods comprise a pair of independent earphones and a magnetic case which does the job of carrying and charging them. The case itself is charged via a Lightning port, the same as on the iPhone or iPad. The AirPods do connect to your iPhone via Bluetooth, but that’s where the similarities with other wireless headphones stop. They use a combination of software in iOS and a special chip to make connecting to your phone a piece of cake. Whereas setting up Bluetooth headphones has always been a faff - turn them on, put them in pairing mode, find the right setting on your phone, wait, try again - with the AirPods, you just open the case, and a screen pops up on your iPhone asking you to connect. airpods-2 Once set up, the AirPods will also be connected to other devices on the same iCloud account - iPads, Macs, Apple Watch etc. It’s a little thing, but a nice touch and the sort of benefit Apple gets by owning the whole experience. They can function as typical Bluetooth headphones for Android phones - the pairing button is on the case - but something tells me that the vast majority of owners are going to be iPhone users. Each AirPod has a microphone on the end, so you can make phone calls, and instead of controls for skipping tracks and changing the volume, you double tap a headphone to talk to Siri. Are they any good? The AirPods sound good - while not the greatest set of earphones, they are loud, and certainly better than the iPhone’s bundled headphones. They’re also much more reliable than Bluetooth headphones of yore - the proprietary Apple chip (which also features in the latest Beats headphones) means connections are flawless, without stuttering, and the range is really impressive - I made it around 50 metres from my phone before the signal started to cut out - so you can easily have your phone on charge and walk around the house with the AirPods in. At a glance | AirPods There’s no turning the AirPods on or off: you just open the case and pop them (or just one) in. Infrared sensors in the AirPods detect that they’re in your ear and voila, when you play music it plays through the AirPods. Take a headphone out and the music pauses, put it in again and it restarts. This means that when you’re done listening, you just take the headphones out and put them in the case, without having to touch your phone to stop the music. The whole system is really well thought out, from start to finish, and it’s one of the best things Apple has done in years: the old Apple slogan “It just works” feels like it’s back again. Carrying around your headphones in the neat little magnetic case is also much nicer than a tangled set of wires at the bottom of your pocket, or the pouches that most wireless headphones come in, and it's a neat way of charging them - each AirPod has a five hour battery life but with the case you get 24. The microphone picks up your voice well and I’ve found myself using the AirPods for phone calls a lot. Siri The AirPods are a big moment for Siri: you’re supposed to use the virtual assistant, activated by double tapping the earphones, to control them. It’s why there are no volume or skip controls on the AirPods themselves (although as mentioned above you can pause just by taking one out). It sounds great in theory - a real-life version of the assistants in the film “Her”. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work quite as well in practice. Siri requires an internet connection, so any time you’re without one it’s useless. The voice recognition, and ability to act on it, is patchy (say “louder” to turn it up, and Siri suggests I ring Claudia), and after a while I just found myself using my phone or Apple Watch to control the music. Watch | Apple unveil wireless AirPods and drop headphone jack 02:05 You can use Siri to do all sorts of things apart from playing music, and Apple encourages you to do so with the AirPods - ask for directions home, for example. But the problem is that when you do this, you get the results on the iPhone’s screen rather than back through your ear. You may as well have not used Siri in the first place. If you’re used to something like Amazon’s Alexa, it’s a little disappointing, especially because a voice-controlled in-ear assistant has so much potential. But do they stay in? The first question everyone has asked me about the AirPods is “Do they stay in your ears?” and for the most part, they do. While I’ve never got on with the EarPod headphones that come with your iPhone, the AirPods are better. While the fit is the same as the EarPods, the fact that they don’t have a cable pulling them down means they sit in the ear more easily. You can shake your head around and they’ll stay there. And after a week of using the AirPods, I haven’t lost one. However, I did have some problems: when running (or briskly walking) for the train they’ve felt on the verge of falling out, and I’ve had to adjust them to keep them in. They did fall out of my ears when I was lying horizontally, and I definitely wouldn’t feel comfortable taking them for a run or falling asleep on a plane wearing them. The AirPods are fine when stationary or walking, but all-rounders they are not. Even though they do stay in fairly reliably, this often wasn’t with a perfect fit, so I felt like the speakers weren’t pointed at my eardrum and I was constantly thinking about whether I would have to rescue one. That said, everyone has different ears, and Apple’s design is supposed to be the one that suits the most people, I guess that just doesn't include me. Many users haven’t had any problems with the AirPods’ fit, so it will really depend on your own ears. I just wish there was an in-ear version. The AirPods stick out a little Credit: Bloomberg As for the design, I’ve definitely had a few looks. They have a noticeable stalk coming down from the earbud that houses the battery and microphone, and in trademark Apple white they stand out a fair bit, but I imagine it’s something we’ll get used to. All Bluetooth earbuds look a little weird. Verdict The AirPods are one of the most intriguing things Apple has done in a long time, and most of the time are a delight to use: the set-up is simple, using them is easy and the sound quality is good. At the same time there are frustrations: Siri is not as good as it could be after five years, and at £159, they’re not cheap, although few decent sets of wireless headphones are. Still, when they work, it’s a definite improvement on bog-standard Bluetooth - as long as they fit in your ears. Pros Making them work with your phone and using them is really easy The carrying case is neat and provides great battery life They stay in your ears (mostly) Cons Using Siri to control your music can be frustrating Some people won’t find them suited to exercise or movement due to fit May attract funny looks Price and availability Apple Airpods cost £159 and are available now from Apple.  Follow Telegraph Science & Tech READ MORE ABOUT: Gadgets iPhone iOS Apple Apple Airpods Show more Technology latest 06 Jan 2017, 5:20pm Driverless cars will cause congestion on Britain's roads to worsen for years, study finds 01:03 06 Jan 2017, 4:31pm Who was Sandford Fleming?

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Apple leads in holiday device activations, down 5 percent year over year Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Thursday, December 29th, 2016, 05:45 Category: Android, Hardware, iOS, iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, News, Samsung, Software The Christmas gifts have been exchanged, the Chanukah ones are being given this week and it looks like Apple is leading the pack in terms of smartphone activations for the 2016 holidays. This year, 44% of new phone and tablet activations were Apple devices with Samsung seeing 21%. While Samsung is slowly growing in popularity throughout the holiday season, up 1% from last year, Apple devices continue to be the gift to give. Holding the third and fourth positions for activations are Huawei and LG; which is remarkable, as both manufacturers do not have an individual device within the top 35 devices activated. Their high rank is likely due to the fact that they have wide variety of devices and affordable options (hundreds of phablet and medium phones) for consumers to choose from. As expected, phablet devices (5″ to 6.9″ devices) continue to chomp away at the medium phone (3″ to 4.9″) market share, although medium phones saw the most activations during the week preceding the holidays. Phablets continue to gain popularity and market share, albeit at the expense of medium phones. Tablet device activations have stabilized and are relatively flat year over year. This indicates that users find purpose for their purchase, albeit the devices cater to more niche use. As with years past, Christmas Day proved the biggest day for app downloads and the Flurry blog once again tracked twice the app installs on Christmas Day as on an average day in December. Key categories included Messaging & Social, Games, Music, Media, & Entertainment, and Kids & Family apps. Mobile users were catching up with loved ones, entertaining their guess and distracting kids, all on their devices.

Vendors, partners still lag behind customer expectations Howard Fast 29 December 2016 Tweet   Facebook   LinkedIn   Google plus   Send to   0 Comments No computer, device or software makers were among customer experience researcher Temkin's five excellence award winners for 2016. The overall list of candidates, which included IT hardware notables Acer, Apple, Dell, HP and Toshiba, and software heavyweights McAfee (Intel Security), Microsoft and Symantec, spanned a group of 294 companies across 20 industries. Considering the IT industry labors to find new ways to improve the customer experience, Temkin's assessment are notable. Winners were judged to have provided what their customers want and how and when they want it, in a so-called omni-channel approach in which they engaged at multiple points in the marketing and sales process. Related articles Can CMOs drive the 'customer experience' to transform partners' sales strategies? Channelnomics' top five stories of the week - 30 December 2016 Editor's voice: The week's channel chatter - 30 December 2016 Vendor Q&A Series: May Mitchell, Symantec The results were a bit of a comedown from last year, when EMC's global services was among the final three winners of Temkin's awards. Two years earlier, Apple and HP took the top spots among computer makers, but placed 119th and 144th overall out of the 268 companies measured in 19 industries. Certainly, Temkin's judgements don't live in a vacuum. In part, they can be seen as a reflection of marketing strategies, as well as sales and service. Indeed, in that regard, IT's customer experience fortunes might improve with the increasingly expanding role of the chief marketing officer (CMO), some of whom have taken a seat in the C-suite as the orchestrator of revenue growth strategies. For channel partners, it may turn out that customer experience strategies - as plotted and executed by CMOs at the vendor level - will permeate their sales philosophies and practices, suggests Liz Miller, SVP of the Chief Marketing Officer Council, a network of 10,500 members who collectively control about $500 billion in aggregated annual marketing expenditures. The CMO Council, in concert with IBM, has just produced a study of 198 senior marketing executives, entitled Connected Interaction to Power Brand Attraction and that forecasts a continuing struggle next year to understand how best to interact with customers on a more personal, content-rich level. "The rate at which we're evolving to that point will still leave us still behind the expectations of the customer," says Miller. "Channel and brand have to get together quickly to figure out if our systems can talk to each other," she explains. To do so "requires a certain understanding of customer behavior", according to Miller. That understanding is based on how customers, from individuals to SMBs to large corporations, engage in the sales process, she says. "If you look at VARs, in many cases they've been relegated to a certain part of the customer experience," Miller notes. "For a lot of customers, VARs are the like the order taker at a food court - they must pick individual ingredients to make the dishes customers want." It's not that vendors don't support the channel or don't want to see the channel succeed or aren't fully committed to the channel - quite the opposite, the SVP says. It's that vendors want to connect with their end customers and in so doing, create platforms, touch points and opportunities to reach them. That means they collect customer data, and a lot of it. The resulting information, however, which could help partners construct solutions that resonate not just with the customer's solution needs, but also with its business model and culture, rarely ends up in the hands of the channel, Miller notes. The triangulation between vendors, partners and customers, powered by customer behavior data, never gets made. "It's channel partners who are the front line for vendors," says Miller. "But it's the vendors who want to have the relationship with the installed base. All that customer intelligence and insight doesn't get to the channel." Too many organizations are stuck with what she calls a "limited vantage point" into channel partners. "They don't know what the customer is doing once they engage with channel partners," she says. "They have a view of the sales and marketing journey, but not the customer journey." Of course, just how that will change is the question. A new type of partnership can be the answer, offers Miller. "Partnerships between vendors and the channel can be about much more than delivering the best solutions to a customer," she asserts. "The idea is to showcase what's possible if you have an organization that understands the technology infrastructure, tied in with consultants that can see what is possible."

There have been some spectacular fails that have brought a more realistic perspective to the fundamental belief that technology improves with time. In part, this is because we have now pushed hardware and software to its limits, and certainly beyond our ability to guarantee that it will work as promised, or even secretly hoped. 2016 was the year that technology hit a wall, with significant challenges that will need to be overcome before it can pick up again and start to bring any of its promised future benefits. When batteries fail This was certainly the case with batteries, as Samsung was forced to abandon an entire product, the Galaxy Note 7 because of faulty batteries that spontaneously caught fire. In the end, the problems with the batteries were brought about because of the drive to each year produce new model phones that are thinner and have greater battery life. With each cycle, the engineering challenge becomes greater and the margin of error smaller. Samsung just happened to push beyond that point this year and it ended up costing them around US $3 billion with untold damage to its brand. Samsung were not the only phone company with battery problems however. Apple has had ongoing battery issues where iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S models of iPhone abruptly shut down with the battery percentage still showing anywhere from 30% to 50%. Apple maintained that the problem affected only a small number of iPhones and offered a limited replacement but has now admitted that the problem is more widespread than it first thought. Battery issues are not confined to mobile phones however. Apple’s new MacBook Pro has failed to be endorsed by the US Consumer Reports because its battery life was so erratic in tests that the consumer organisation was not able to determine what a reasonable consumer expectation would be for the product. In a set of tests of the 13-inch TouchBar model, Consumer Reports found that battery life varied from 19.5 hours to 4.5 hours. This mirrored what MacBook owners themselves were finding. Apple has now acknowledged the issue and is working with Consumer Reports to replicate its tests. Toxic Twitter and Facebook fake news 2016 was also the year where the world realised that social networks were not only not infallible but also suffering from problems so systemic that it has rendered them almost toxic. Twitter failed to find a buyer this year basically because of its reputation as being a haven for bullies, trolls, racists and misogynists. The fact that Donald Trump and his followers found their element in Twitter only seemed to confirm this. Twitter’s troll problem dwarfed its other fundamental issue which was that it still hasn’t worked out how to make any money. Facebook and Twitter became the principal purveyors of fake news during the US election and like Apple and Samsung with their battery issues, eventually “‘fessed up” to the fact that it had it was responsible for this new, and socially damaging, phenomenon. Facebook was trying to stave off admitting that it was responsible because it now has to find a solution and it is really not clear that there is one. This was the year in which Yahoo proved once and for all that it really didn’t care about its customers’ security in admitting that it had been hacked at least twice and lost details of 1 billion accounts to unknown hackers. Yahoo insiders talked of a culture that refused to properly fund security in the period before the hacks happened. The hacks may be enough to jeopardise Yahoo’s sale to Verizon, or at least shave billions off the already low price. Nazi AI Artificial Intelligence proved this year that it is a way off from dooming humanity as Microsoft unleashed a chat bot Tay that quickly became offensive, sending out racist, Nazi and anti-feminist tweets. Of course, one could argue that the chat bot was simply adapting to its Twitter environment but as the point was produce an AI with real intelligence, the experiment failed. 2016 was the year chat bots were due to be the next big thing in customer engagement but Microsoft illustrated quite dramatically the limitations of the technology. When things attack Probably the biggest wake-up call of 2016 was the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks that succeeded in bringing down a large part of the Internet. The DDoS attack was launched from large numbers of infected Internet of Things (IoT) devices which have been rushed to market with poor to non-existent security. As the number of these devices is already in the billions, the risks that compromised devices may pose is only really becoming fully appreciated. The list doesn’t end there of course. The US election was hacked by Russia, the Australian government proved it couldn’t run a website to conduct the census, and the movie industry continued to believe that spending money on ineffective blocks of torrent sites was better than making good movies universally available to customers. We can only hope that 2017 proves a better year for tech.

David Nield | Gizmodo MediaDec 28, 2016, 07.00 PM IST FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedinReddit mobileImage Credit Image: Screenshot/Gizmodo We put two of the heavyweight video streaming services head-to-head in all the key categories that matter to see which one comes out on top: Netflix and Amazon Prime Video (or just Amazon Video). So which service is most worthy of your monthly subscription? Prices and devices Image: Netflix There are three Netflix plans available right now. $7.99 a month gets you Basic Netflix, with no HD and 1 stream at a time; $9.99 a month is the Standard level, with HD and 2 streams; and $11.99 a month is the price for Premium, with Ultra HD content and 4 simultaneous streams across your devices. As for supported devices, you can get Netflix just about everywhere: the web, iOS, Android, Apple TV, smart TVs, Rokus, games consoles... it's hard to find a bit of kit that Netflix won't work on, and there's an exhaustive list online. Image: Amazon Amazon Prime Video, meanwhile, is bundled with a Prime membership ($99 a year or $10.99 a month), which gives you access to a limited amount of 4K content (if you're watching on a Fire TV device) but only one stream at a time. In many parts of the world you can now also sign up for it separately for a slightly lower monthly fee. In terms of device support, the list isn't quite as long as the one for Netflix. Most smart TVs are supported, as well as iOS and Android, but there are no apps for Apple TV or Android TV (unless you use workarounds). Content and originals Image: Netflix Exactly what you can watch on Netflix and Amazon Prime Video depends on where you are in the world and what month it is, so it's hard to come up with a definitive list. According to the Video Advertising Bureau, earlier this year Netflix was offering 6,155 movies and 2,604 TV titles, compared with the 18,163 movies and 2,017 TV titles on Amazon Prime Video. Image: Amazon Confusing the issue further though is the iTunes-style component built into Amazon's offering-not everything you see on Prime Video is available to watch for no extra charge. Some of the latest films can be bought or rented for a fee, as on iTunes, which helps to explain the large discrepancy. If you're having to choose between these two platforms the best option is to sign up for the free trials of both and look for your favorite shows and flicks. Even then though, there's no guarantee the content will stick around. Image: Netflix Comparing original shows made by Netflix and Amazon themselves is easier. Netflix has the likes of House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, Stranger Things, Master of None, The Crown, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Black Mirror, Arrested Development and the recently restarted Gilmore Girls. On the Amazon side there are shows such as The Man in the High Castle, Hand of God, Bosch, Goliath, Transparent, and of course The Grand Tour. The list isn't quite as impressive but it also locks down various exclusives now and then, like Mr. Robot. Interface and apps Image: Screenshot Wherever you watch Netflix, it follows the famous Apple mantra of just working. The navigation screens are slick and intuitive, the playback screens are simple but have all the options you need, and it's a service you can click (or tap) around with much thought. Amazon Prime Video is more cluttered, particularly in terms of browsing for content-as you might expect if you've been shopping on the Amazon website lately-and getting back to something you've watched in the past, for example, can be frustratingly tedious. Image: Screenshot When you get to actually watching something, Prime Video is more impressive. Simple pause, fast forward and rewind buttons are always available, and the X-Ray feature is a handy way of getting information about actors currently on screen. Both platforms offer solid, reliable streaming across multiple devices-at least based on our testing-with a minimal amount of buffering and bugs. As for mobile apps, and apps for smart TVs and other devices, it's a similar story. Both Netflix and Amazon Prime Video feature well-designed, functional playback screens, though Amazon's apps can be harder to navigate around and more clunky in general. Not exactly a dealbreaker, but Netflix leads the way in this department, and has an interface that's more consistent across devices. In addition, both services now offer downloads for offline viewing, though the content you can cache will depend on your region. In the past it's been a reason to opt for Amazon Prime Video, though Netflix has now caught up. In conclusion Right now you'd struggle to make a case that Amazon Prime Video is better than Netflix, whether that's in terms of its original programming, its ease of use, or its availability on pretty much any device. On the other hand, Amazon's offering is cheaper (if you have Prime), adds the option of renting and buying more recent movies and shows, and is a fantastic added bonus if you're already a Prime member. If it has your favorite stuff then you really don't need Netflix. We'd also note that Amazon Prime Video is improving and expanding all the time as well. It added features such as offline viewing first, and is obviously intent on catching up with Netflix as quickly as possible. Ultimately though Netflix is still the video streaming service everyone's trying to beat, with its growing number of 4K titles, smooth and stable streaming, and multiple user support. If it can start to grab hold of more content again then it should remain the leader for some time to come.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

While many believed Apple would have it easy this season due to Samsung's Galaxy Note7 crisis, Baker said that "Apple's own lack of a wowing product this year" meant that woeful Note7 owners opted for other high-end Galaxy phones, and not the iPhone 7. “Most of those who bought or wanted to buy a Note 7 opted for a different high-end Galaxy phone,” Mr. Baker said. “Samsung was able to fend off other Android competition, and Apple, too, thanks to Apple’s own lack of a wowing product this year.” Apple decided to not release the first weekend sales numbers for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus back in September, because it felt the results were "no longer a representative metric" due to demand outweighing supply. Samsung officially halted sales of the Galaxy Note7 worldwide in early October, but another industry analyst, Chetan Sharma, continued Baker's thread by commenting on the iPhone 7's lack of "a compelling enough feature set," which wasn't enough to convince owners of potentially exploding Note7 devices to switch ecosystems. “Apple has the strongest ecosystem, with its hardware, software and app and content stores,” said consumer tech and mobile industry consultant Chetan Sharma. “IPhone users looking for an upgrade stick with Apple. But in a year when Samsung dropped the ball in a huge way,” he said, Apple “didn’t have a phone with a compelling enough feature set to lure Samsung owners away.” Earlier this week, Yahoo-owned mobile analytics firm Flurry released data surrounding the top device activations by manufacturer between 12/19 and 12/25, confirming that Apple was again at the top of the list with 44 percent activations, while Samsung came in second at 21 percent. In comparison to the previous year, Apple dropped from 49 percent and Samsung climbed slightly from 19 percent. Ultimately, the two analysts admitted that both Apple and Samsung "made mistakes this year that cost them growth." Sharma said that "the timing couldn’t have been worse for Samsung and it couldn’t have been better for Apple. But the truth is neither company capitalized this year.” In the first few days of December, financial firm Oppenheimer summed up the current negative cloud surrounding Apple -- fueled by mixed-to-negative consumer reception and its first revenue decline since 2003 -- and stated that the company could be heading into a "decade-long malaise" if it doesn't turn things around.

Remember - Apple is never first, but usually always the best. People get upset over a headphone jack, but not over an exploding phone. And yet people question the values of Apple and not Samsung. I would argue the dual camera / telescopic zoom is a major feature as the jump in camera quality between the 6s is quite large. Rating: 42 Votes maflynn 1 week ago Can't say that I'm overly surprised. I think the iPhone 7 is a nice phone, but its not that much different the 6s. There's a fairly large disparity on features with Android phones vs. the iPhone Rating: 39 Votes maflynn 1 week ago How are you a moderator on an Apple site? If you can't make sense of it there really isn't any other way to explain it Are you saying that I cannot hold an independent thought and I must blindly agree to everything Apple does? As pointed out, Apple made a statement about how antqiuated the headphone jack is, and yet they included it in the MBP Beside, I already said the iPhone 7 is a nice phone, my wife has one. I think its good, but I am critical of them removing something that many of us use. As I stated, I cannot use the iPhone 7, having it charging and listen to music on my headphones - something I do all the time. Rating: 29 Votes OllyW 1 week ago They removed the headphone jack to make space in a tiny device - the MacBook Pro is considerabley larger than the iPhone. I think the reason people are confused by Apple retaining the headphone socket in the new MBP is because of the outright condemnation of the same socket by Apple executives when the iPhone 7 was announced. The audio connector is more than 100 years old", "It had its last big innovation about 50 years ago. You know what that was? They made it smaller. It hasn't been touched since then. It's a dinosaur. It's time to move on", "We are removing the audio jack because we have developed a better way to deliver audio", "We've got this 50-year-old connector -- just a hole filled with air -- and it's just sitting there taking up space, really valuable space" If they genuinely feel it's that bad and outdated, wouldn't you expect them to remove it from all of their new product releases? Rating: 27 Votes hlevolve 1 week ago I agree. The iPhone 7 doesn't have any "wow" factor to it. More just things we have come to expect because the other manufactures already do most of it (aside from dual camera) but for the general user... I don't think that's much to care about and we have come to expect the faster graphics and CPU every year anyway so that's nothing new either. I kept my iPhone 6 Plus. Nothing I cared about in 6S or the 7 so far. I'm hoping the 2017 iPhone changes that.

But 2016 was also the year that gadgets weren’t necessarily the most important thing at Apple. The company’s most critical moment actually had its roots in the end of 2015, and it’s something that may be of even more importance in 2017. Things were tweaked, lost ports, or gained some sensors, but ultimately most things looked the same First: the products. Early this year, Apple rolled out a smaller 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and upgraded the internals of the iPhone 5 and called it the iPhone SE. The fact that Apple literally shrunk its existing products rather than completely reimagining them escaped no one, and the theme was carried on throughout the year: things were tweaked, lost ports, or gained some sensors, but ultimately most things looked the same. Apple Watch now has GPS. There’s a Touch Bar on the MacBook Pro. The wire-free AirPod headphones that were announced in September were delayed for weeks, though did end up on sale before the holidays. One of the biggest changes to Apple’s product lineup had to do with its software, and it’s a change we haven’t been able to fully measure the impact of yet: in June Apple said it would change its revenue split with subscription-based app developers, and expanded the categories of apps that could charge people for subscription services. The move showed that the app economy had in fact matured, but was also made in reaction to complaints from developers that making apps doesn’t make them any money. iMessage finally caught up to the times, but Apple TV is still in a will-we-or-won’t-we-work-with-cable purgatory. An obvious PR push in the final quarter of the year would probably be enough for the most hardened grader to grudgingly bestow a “B” upon the company, but Apple’s most important and critical product is one that doesn’t appear on launch stages or get many public updates: its emphasis on privacy and security. The company’s most critical moment actually had its roots in the end of 2015 Apple has almost always offered industry-standard encryption, but its commitment to additional layers of security and privacy, down to the physical chip inside iPhones, was seriously tested following the 2015 San Bernardino shooting. Despite immense pressure in the months that followed, Apple refused to create — in fact, said it couldn’t create — software for the government that would give it access to the passcode-protected iPhone. The FBI was eventually able to gain access through a tool provided by an undisclosed third-party. Apple, as far as we know, didn’t provide assistance with that tool. How much access government agencies will have is still unknown Whether you think Apple’s steadfast refusal to create a backdoor for the government is admirable or atrocious probably depends on your feelings about national security. But it was also around this time that another voice emerged, that of now-President-elect Donald Trump. At the height of the Apple-FBI fracas Trump called for a boycott of the company’s products, establishing himself early on as an adversary to the world’s largest tech company. Exactly how much access government agencies will have to consumers’ data during a Trump presidency is still unknown. In the past, Trump has said that the NSA should be given “as much leeway as possible” to the extent that the agency can do what it has to do without violating the Fourth Amendment; two of his top picks for leaders of law enforcement and intelligence agencies have argued that expanded surveillance is needed in the US. The clashes between government and Silicon Valley, which holds the keys to our most personal bits of digital information, have only just begun. Apple, for now, hasn’t wavered. Which may just be as good as it gets in a year like 2016.

But long before that, prophets of gloom and doom have long been circling around tablets like vultures waiting for a critter to expire. Especially when it comes to Android tablets. With perhaps the sole exception of the Lenovo Yoga Book, this year hasn’t seen any significant movement in the Android tablet front, whether it be from major manufacturers or even the Android community at large. But as the success of the Microsoft Surface Pro and Apple iPad Pro showed, there is still a market for tablets, even expensive ones. Fortunately, the Android platform can still catch up, and most of the solutions can even be done through software only, though it will definitely take some guts from OEMs to make it happen. Get apps to work in landscape One of the biggest complaints tablet users have, especially those with 10.1-inch or larger slates, is that not all apps work well in a tablet’s landscape orientation. Granted, this is a malady that also afflicts iPads, but it is admittedly more pronounced on Android. Google doesn’t exercise an iron fist in terms of app quality, so the onus is on the app developers. That said, just like Apple has a compromise when using iPhone apps on iPads, Android could perhaps do one better. One that can at least make it possible to use the app in landscape. Of course, the better and more proper fix is for developers to ensure their apps aren’t limited to just one form factor. Tablets aren’t the only “not-a-smartphone” Android device anyway. Have a set of strong “poster boy” apps Corollary to that is the fact that Android needs a showcase of the best tablet apps out there, especially in the Google Play Store. Google has annual awards and presentations for the best designed apps or the most popular games, but almost none for tablets. That is perhaps damning evidence of Google’s own indifference to tablets. If Google is still interested in pushing Android to tablets (and it should), it needs to have a regularly updated list of apps that not only work good on tablets but are actually great for them. Android Nougat right out of the box OEMs don’t always put the latest and greatest Android version on their devices, but anyone aiming to put out a tablet next year should forget about any Android version older and 7.0 Nougat. Or at least provide a quick update to it. Among all the new features it brings, Nougat’s muti-tasking enhancements, from split screen to floating windows to even quick app switching, just screams “tablets!” These features truly bring out the best of tablets, allowing users to accomplish things that aren’t easily done on the small screens of even the largest phablets. Create an interface designed for tablets It’s nearly 2017 and tablets are no longer just gigantic versions of smartphones. That may have been true in the early days of tablets, but these devices are now starting to find their own, new identity as more than just consumption devices. And yet Google’s own facade for the Pixel C, so far its last tablet, is simply just a stretched Nexus launcher. Google might be trying to keep it from looking too different from Android on the smartphone, but that reasoning flies in the face of the Android TV or Android Auto UI. And tablets are just as unique now as those. Samsung’s version of TouchWiz on the Galaxy Note Pro as well as Microsoft’s “Metro/Modern” interface go in the right direction of taking advantage of tablets’ wider screen real estate. Bring out a high-end champion All these software enhancements will come to naught if slapped on a device than can barely match a mid-range smartphone in terms of performance. With few exceptions, almost all of today’s Android tablets are left lying on the mid, even low, end of the device tier. Aside from the almost abandoned Pixel C, Google has not shown any hints of a new Android tablet reference device. Even Samsung seems to have given up on making more powerful slates like it did before. Few people are interested in buying new tablets because there just isn’t any tablet that can sweep them off their feet like a Surface or iPad Pro can. And manufacturers shy from investing in high-end tablets because few people are interested in buying them. It’s a vicious cycle that needs a company daring enough to break it, just like what Lenovo did with the Yoga Book. It might not be the best out there in terms of typing, but it’s got everyone talking and some even drooling. Don’t skimp on ports (or use USB-C) The tablets of tomorrow will, or should, be seen more as productivity devices than simple book readers and portable TVs. They will, more often than not, be compared to laptops. As such, they can’t be stingy when it comes to ports, especially USB ones. Unless aiming for something the thickness of a Surface Pro, it might be too much to ask for at least two full-sized USB ports. At the very least, two USB-C ports will be ideal, especially when one is dedicated to charging. While there will be a case for USB hubs, not all of those draw enough power to, for example, spin external hard drives. Design with keyboard and mouse in mind productivity devices won’t really be productive until you can use then with a keyboard and a mouse. Android is sadly a bit schizophrenic on this point, especially with mice. While the platform fortunately has support for those, unlike iOS, it is half-baked and, at times, even counter-productive. Text selection, right-clicking, middle-clicking, these common computing gestures can be a huge pain on Android. Keyboards are less of an issue, but some apps and interfaces, like web browsers and e-mail clients, can do with support for keyboard shortcuts. This is an area where both third-party app developers as well as platform makers like Google should pitch in. Include a stylus The big boys in the tablet market all carry a stylus. It has become a sort of badge to prove that the tablet is serious business. Although where to store the stylus is still a recurring issue, it is actually less of a concern with tablets than it is with smartphones. And styluses aren’t just an artist’s tool, as it can also be put to good use for note-taking or, in the absence of a mouse, a more precise pointer. Build cost might be an issue for OEMs, but if you’re going to put out a high-end tablet, might as well go all out. Wrap-up Unlike smartwatches, tablets seem to have found their new calling, enough to weather the years ahead. Once the champion of tablet innovation, Android has sadly fallen by the wayside. It isn’t too late and, at least for the software fixes, it might not be too difficult to catch up. It just needs the right people, like those turning the wheels, to pick up the slack. Here’s to hoping 2017 will see some more interesting Android slates in the market.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars Follow us on social: BOTS Apple needs to fix its sticker problem or it risks losing big in the chat wars Khari Johnson@kharijohnson December 29, 2016 5:00 AM Tags: Apple, iMessage, iMessage App Store, iOS 10, iPhone, top-stories Above: Apple Store Image Credit: Håkan Dahlström Apple has a sticky problem on its hands, and until it’s resolved, it’s throwing a wet blanket over the experience of millions of people using iMessage and its new App Store. Stickers are like emojis you can buy or download from the iMessage App Store and share in iMessage. If you’ve perused the marketplace since the launch of iOS 10 in September, you’ll know that they’re everywhere, and that there are increasingly stickers of all kinds. There are cats shooting lasers, ugly sweaters, and stickers for video games like Goat Simulator and Galaxy on Fire. These stickers offer diversity for both cats and people. There have been woman in hijab stickers on iMessage long before the Unicode Consortium will finalize plans to release its hijab emoji next year. There are hundreds of millions of women in the world who practice the Muslim faith. Many wear the hijab and had no representation of themselves in iMessage until stickers filled that gap, and that’s awesome. Generally, the iMessage App Store and app extensions bring some of the best apps available inside conversations. Some of my favorite apps — like Evernote, Square Cash, and Canva — have extensions in iMessage that make taking notes, paying friends, and sharing visuals that I’ve made pretty simple. As I mentioned in an initial look at what I love and hate about iMessage a few months back, the experience is perhaps second to none when compared with other major chat apps or chatbots. And Apple smartly chose to lean against its robust existing App Store ecosystem. But here’s the problem: Stickers are scattered in every category of the App Store. Sometimes they’re labeled as stickers and sometimes they’re not, so it’s extremely common to select an app, and instead of finding functionality that extends into iMessage, get a collection of stickers. If this happened on occasion, you might just be annoyed or perplexed, but that isn’t the case. It happens all the time, and it muddies the waters and adds an unnecessary pain point to the iMessage App Store experience. That’s why Apple needs to do something about these damned stickers, like, oh, I don’t know — leave them in the Stickers category, or put them in a subcategory of each store category. Because it is not a pleasant surprise to download Trello in the iMessage App Store and then find out it has zero functionality and is just a collection of husky stickers. That’s not what you want out of your favorite productivity app. Why the hell does Starbucks give me stickers in iMessage instead of its new AI assistant? How could HomeAdvisor, an app meant to help you find talented people to remodel your home, do anyone any good by sharing stickers of air conditioning fans or awnings? Consumers need to be given the option to see the full force of what’s possible when the App Store comes inside messaging. I don’t need a sticker with slices of guacamole on toast from Whole Foods. I need the functionality of the Whole Foods app. Send people down this wrong road too many times and you risk turning them off iMessage before they see what it can actually accomplish. It’s not all bad news: Stickers do appear to be making some money. Check the top 50 paid items in the iMessage App Store today, and they are almost entirely stickers. But what is the purpose of the App Store? If the purpose is to create an ecosystem capable of making money for Apple, developers, and businesses, then people need to be able to locate amazing iMessage apps without falling into a bunch of stickers. Microsoft, Facebook, and now Amazon are all busy trying to build their own chatbot ecosystems, but they don’t have Apple’s head start. And if bots are truly going to kill apps, who is going to be the biggest loser among companies in the chat wars? Clearly it’s Google and Apple, owners of Google Play and App Store. So Apple better get these stickers out of the way, or it risks being hindered by a lot more than delayed AirPods and the removal of the classic headphone jack.

Davey Alba Business Date of Publication: 12.29.16. 12.29.16 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am This Was the Year Tech Stocks Became Sure Bets Getty Images 2016 was the year tech got “fangs.” Well, not literally. FANGs was a term coined by CNBC business guru Jim Cramer in 2015 to describe the high-performing stocks of the massively successful tech companies Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google (now called Alphabet). Today, it’s not these particular companies that are technically at the top of the Wall Street leaderboard—that distinction falls to Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook. But “FANGs” has become convenient shorthand for a phenomenon that emerged in 2016: the value of tech couldn’t be shaken, no matter what volatility existed out in the wider world. This was the year the new giants of tech became a truly dominant market force. The big moral lesson of the dot-com bubble in the late 90s was that tech could be incredibly risky. Tech stocks were inflated, largely because of buzz and hype. Shareholders soon discovered that a lot of these companies did not end up delivering on their promises of value. (Remember Webvan, Pets.com, Kozmo, and Flooz? Yep, that’s the point.) With abounding opportunities in other sectors of the economy, including retail, healthcare, oil and energy, tech just seemed like less of a sure thing. Yes, the mentality didn’t last forever. Eventually, the world grew to count on the likes of IBM and Cisco as reasonably well-performing stocks. But in 2016, things were markedly different. Now, tech isn’t just “reasonably well-performing” as an industry. In fact, for at least a few days mid-year, tech absolutely dominated market rankings, pushing out every other industry in the world. Nowadays, there’s a new tech world order, too. The handful of titans you might’ve guessed would be successful forever have revealed their growing irrelevance. The turnover of power to the new giants of tech is well underway. And the emergence of tech’s fangs this year proved it. Tech Top Five Just look at what happened for a few hours in late July, and definitively the next month. At the close of the public trading market on the first Monday of August, the top companies in the world by market value were all American technology companies: No. 1 was Apple; followed closely by Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook. (Netflix, an original FANG, is still a very successful—and growing—company in its own right. But at least in the law-defying world of enormous tech triumphs, it’s not quite made its mark yet.) Such a sweeping takeover by tech in the market didn’t happen even during the dot-com boom. And this means American tech companies surpassed behemoths in other industries often thought of as stubborn mainstays in the top rungs of the public market, like Berkshire Hathaway, GE, and Exxon Mobil. American tech companies surpassed behemoths often thought of as stubborn mainstays in the top rungs of the public market, like Berkshire Hathaway and Exxon Mobil. It’s important to note that the “biggest companies by market cap” doesn’t really mean these companies make the most money in the world, or produce the most products of value in the world. It only means the company’s shares are worth the most at the moment, when you take share price and multiply it by the total number of shares held by investors. And as any good businessperson well knows, the fates of the markets change quickly. These days, Berkshire Hathaway and Exxon Mobil are back up the leaderboard, pushing Amazon’s and Facebook’s rankings down. (As of this writing, Apple’s market cap stands at $626.3 billion; Google’s is $553.92 billion; Microsoft’s at $493.14 billion; Amazon at $367.7 billion; and Facebook at $342.5 billion. Breaking this solid tech front is Berkshire Hathaway, with a market cap of $410.54 billion, and Exxon at $375 billion.) This proves that Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook have matured to the point of operating like much more conventionally successful companies. “They justify their valuations with actual financial performance,” says Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. “Aside from a macro-tech economic failure, I expect these companies to remain at the top,” says Patrick Moorhead, tech analyst at the market industry research firm Moor Insights and Strategy. What gives these companies their ability to be so sprawling is that each has a dependable, profitable business, Dawson points out. Alphabet has Google search, and its other ad businesses. Facebook has News Feed advertising, its stranglehold on the media as nearly half of American adults head to the social network to get their news, and its domination of mobile through various Facebook-owned apps. Apple has its money-making iPhone and other hardware products. Microsoft’s traditional software businesses have been able to carry the company through. And Amazon has its pioneering Amazon Web Services cloud computing arm, which has been estimated to run 1 percent of the entire internet. “These companies have a core that’s predictable, that throws up a massive amount of profits,” says Dawson. More Stories If the Unicorn Bubble Bursts, Workers Will Feel It Worst Tech Was Supposed to Crash in 2016. It Got Real Instead Overstock Begins Trading Its Shares Via the Bitcoin Blockchain That’s because they share a few key features. “They hit their financial goals, which then gives them ‘market permission’ to take risks,” says Moorhead. “They have a lot of believers that they will get even bigger in the future based on the big risks they are taking. And these companies hit their product targets in that they deliver what they say they are delivering, typically on-time.” GoPro and FitBit, which struggled in 2016, didn’t share in any of these characteristics. Meanwhile, the tech top five’s unique qualities gave them the ability to experiment in everything from self-driving cars to internet-beaming drones, among so many other moonshot projects. “They can afford to dabble in other stuff. If the only business you’re in is the stuff that people are dabbling in, you become a much riskier investment,” says Dawson. And these tech top five stand out in a year where the big tech bubble was supposed to have burst. For so long, pundits had been warning that too much money had been pouring into the tech industry, and a reckoning was nigh. That assumption wasn’t quite right; instead, tech got real. But there were still challenges. The investing climate chilled, and stock prices of once-darling hardware companies plummeted. A retail startup that promised an internet-savvy approach to selling furniture sold itself to the conventional giant it promised to upend. All throughout, these tech five remained massive—and stable. Tech as Blue Chip This is not just a market shift. It’s a cultural shift in the perception of tech stocks, too. “I think this is the first time these companies are being considered as blue-chip companies, when these have tended to be staid, very stable companies in industries that don’t change that much,” Dawson says. Yet even  big believers in those staid companies are themselves investing in these new-order giants, he points out. Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, revealed this year that his company had invested more than a billion dollars’ worth of stock in Apple—and Berkshire increased its stake in the Cupertino company even further in later months. This is the first time these companies are being considered as blue-chip companies. Jan Dawson Of course, saying that the long-term success of tech’s big five is a foregone conclusion would be foolish. The fortunes of companies rise and fall, and the evidence of this is in history books. For Google and Facebook, the advertising market is only so big. Apple is still struggling to find its next big hardware hit. And so on and so forth. The biggest, most imminent challenge facing these companies? How tech will be affected by a Trump presidency in 2017. But there’s no way to know exactly how things will shake out at this point. Trump could deliver on his promise to pull offshore cash back, a growth driver for tech companies. But he could also broadly reduce regulation, a good thing. Or he could put massive pressure on Apple to start manufacturing iPhones in the US, a policy that would be both logistically impossible and economically disastrous. It all depends on the bigger question of whether Trump’s campaign promises were literal. But given tech’s initial encounters with the president-to-be, one thing’s for sure: tech and the government will have an awkward time of it in 2017. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Apple � The Supreme Court Limits Damages In Design Patent Cases Last Updated: December 29 2016 Article by Paul D. Ackerman and Jeff C. Dodd Andrews Kurth LLP Your LinkedIn Connections at Firm In a closely watched case involving the cell phone "war" between Apple and Samsung, a unanimous Supreme Court reversed a damages award against Samsung of nearly $400 million, and moved the law regarding damages for infringement of design patents into a new area of uncertainty.1 The case involved a successful claim by Apple that Samsung infringed three Apple design patents directed to various ornamental features of a cell phone.2 In a design patent infringement action, besides the traditional measure of patent damages �adequate to compensate for the infringement� available to all patent holders under 35 U.S.C. � 284, there is an �additional remedy for infringement of a design patent� available under 35 U.S.C. � 289 which allows recovery of an infringers �total profit.� Specifically, the statute provides that if an infringer �(1) applies the patented design, or any colorable imitation thereof to any article of manufacture for the purpose of sale, or (2) sells or exposes for sale any article of manufacture to which such design or colorable imitation has been applied shall be liable to the owner to the extent of his total profit� .�3 It was under this statute that Apple secured its damages award in a jury trial that was affirmed by the Federal Circuit. The issue presented to the Supreme Court was whether the phrase �article of manufacture� used in Section 289 necessarily referred to the product being sold or could include components of the thing sold. Apple argued that neither the district court�s jury instructions nor the Federal Circuit�s opinion required that �the relevant article of manufacture must always be the entire product as sold,� but rather the question as to the relevant �article of manufacture� on �which the infringer�s �total profit� should be awarded is, when disputed, a factual question for the jury.� This very factual issue the jury determined against Samsung�at least according to Apple.4 Samsung, predictably enough, disagreed, arguing that the Federal Circuit�s opinion created a categorical rule that the design-patent holder prevailing in an infringement case would always be awarded �the infringer�s total profit on the entire product as sold�no matter how partial the patent or how limited the contribution of the patented feature to the product�s value or sales.�5 Samsung also argued that an award of infringer�s profits should be limited to the profit �attributable to the �article of manufacture� to which an infringing design is �applied�� and ��made from the infringement�� (i.e. the patent owner would have the burden to prove profits were �attributable to infringement of the patented design.�).6 The United States appeared as amicus curiae supporting neither party. It rejected Samsung�s apportionment limitation, arguing that Section 289 �unambiguously permits a patent holder to recover the infringer�s entire profits from the �article of manufacture� to which the design was applied, regardless of the extent to which those profits are attributable to the infringing design.� However, it also maintained that the ��article of manufacture� will not always be the finished product that is sold in commerce. Rather, the relevant article will sometimes be a component of the ultimate item of sale. In such cases, the patentee is entitled only to the infringer�s total profit for that component, not its total profit for the finished item.� In this it disagreed with the Federal Circuit�s approach, which it characterized, contrary to Apple�s position, as invariably making the �article of manufacture� the �entire product as sold.� This the United States maintained �would result in grossly excessive and essentially arbitrary awards.� Instead, the United States offered that the ��article of manufacture� inquiry entails a case-specific examination of the relationship among the design, any relevant components, and the product as a whole� and it suggested several detailed considerations that should be weighed in the inquiry.7 The Supreme Court set out a two part test for a recovery of an infringer's profits under Section 289: �First, identify the 'article of manufacture' to which the infringed design has been applied. Second, calculate the infringer's total profit made on that article of manufacture."8 Thus, it accepted the United States� position that the focus initially was on what the article of manufacture in issue was and that the award of profits would be determined based on the article of manufacture, not based on the extent to which the profits were attributable to the infringing design. Moreover, the Supreme Court held that the �term �article of manufacture� is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product.�9 After acknowledging that the predecessor of Section 289 was instituted by Congress in direct response to an 1885 Supreme Court decision10�which limited damages for design patent infringement�the Supreme Court engaged in a construction of the statute that has the potential to significantly limit damages, or at least make establishing proof of damages in many design patent cases more difficult. Specifically, contrary to the longstanding interpretation by the Federal Circuit that the �article of manufacture� in the statute is the product being sold, the Supreme Court held that "article of manufacture" in Section 289 was a broad term embracing anything "made by hand or by machine," which would include both a product sold to customers or the components thereof.11 After broadly defining "article of manufacture," however, the Supreme Court declined to articulate a test for determining �the relevant article of manufacture at the first step of the �289 damages inquiry.�12 Instead, it remanded the case to the Federal Circuit to tussle with the issues related to this all-important determination. For products where the product being sold is the �article of manufacture��for example a dinner plate or fork�there should be little change in the application of Section 289. For multicomponent products, however, the Supreme Court�s two-step test has the potential to present significant challenges for litigants and the courts. Absent an analytical framework from the Supreme Court for determining when a design patent is directed to the complete product or a component of the product, this test will likely develop over time as the district courts and the Federal Circuit wrestle with the issue. Further, once the �article of manufacture� is found in the first step, if it is an unsold component of the product, it may be equally challenging to determine the �total profit� attributable to the component. For example, one of the design patents at issue is directed to �a grid of 16 colorful icons on a black screen.�13 It is not hard to imagine significant disputes regarding what the �article of manufacture� is in this case (the screen, the screen apportioned by the time that the icons are displayed, the entire device, since in order to display the icons, the entire device must be operational, etc.). If the conclusion from the first step is that the article of manufacture is a component that is not separately sold, the parties will then likely dispute how to apportion profits of the product sold to that component. Clearly, this is far more challenging than the straight forward calculation of �total profit� that is applicable when the product sold is the relevant �article of manufacture.� Finally, we note that when Congress first approved the predecessor to Section 289, it was responding to and overruling Dobson v. Dornan,14 which had held that the �plaintiff must show what profits or damages are attributable to the use of the infringing design.� Courts will need to proceed with caution to insure that the new two-step test articulated by the Supreme Court does not simply restore the Dobson analysis expressly rejected by Section 289�all without the benefit of clear guidance from the Supreme Court as to the relevant article of manufacture. Nonetheless, although the Court�s decision introduces some uncertainty into one measure of available damages, design patents may still have significant strategic importance as part of an overall intellectual property strategy. Going forward, careful consideration regarding the scope of new design patent applications in view of the developing law regarding what �article of manufacture� is being claimed may be important in maximizing the value of a design patent portfolio going forward.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Retiring Lead Lawyer in the 2012 Apple v. Samsung Trial says that Apple is One of the Most Important Companies in the U.S. | Main | Apple Patent Filing Shows new MacBook Pro Touch Bar Possibly coming to their Magic Keyboard and beyond » December 29, 2016 Next-Gen AirPods may use a Radically Different Design with Ear Magnets to keep them from Falling Out Top Patent Report of the Day posted at 3.44 am PST   Today the US Patent & Trademark Office published a patent application from Apple that reveals next-gen wireless AirPods and wired EarPods that utilizes a new wraparound mechanism for the ear that uses magnets that could be attracted through ear tissue to keep the pods from falling out of a user's ears.   Patent Background   Earphone assemblies are often worn by users that are exercising or performing other activities. However, such active use often dislodges an earphone assembly from its functional position with respect to a user's ear.   Apple Invention   Apple's invention relates to earphone assemblies and, more particularly, to earphone assemblies with magnets for anchoring to a user.   Apple notes as an example, an earphone assembly for use by a user's ear may be provided that may include a hook member including a functional component, a body, an audio output component positioned at least partially within the body, a first magnet physically coupled to the body, and a second magnet, wherein, when the body is positioned against the user's ear in a functional position that is operative to direct sound from the audio output component into the user's ear, the first magnet and the second magnet are operative to be positioned on opposite sides of a wall of the ear and are operative to be magnetically attracted to one another via the wall for holding the body in the functional position, and wherein a first end of the hook member is physically coupled to the body, a second end of the hook member is a free end, the second magnet is coupled to the hook member adjacent the second end of the hook member, and the functional component includes at least one of an antenna functionally coupled to the audio output component and a battery functionally coupled to the audio component.   As another example, an earphone assembly for use by a user's ear may be provided that may include a body, an audio output component positioned at least partially within the body, a hook member including a first end physically coupled to the body, a second end that is a free end, and a hook member part extending between the first end and the second end, a first magnet physically coupled to the body, a second magnet provided at a first position along the length of the hook member part, and a third magnet provided at a second position along the length of the hook member part, wherein, when the body is positioned against the user's ear in a functional position that is operative to direct sound from the audio output component into the user's ear, the first magnet and the second magnet are operative to be positioned on opposite sides of a first portion of a wall of the ear and are operative to be magnetically attracted to one another via the first portion of the wall for holding the body in the functional position, and, when the body is positioned against the user's ear in another functional position that is operative to direct sound from the audio output component into the user's ear, the first magnet and the third magnet are operative to be positioned on opposite sides of a second portion of the wall of the ear and are operative to be magnetically attracted to one another via the second portion of the wall for holding the body in the other functional position.   As yet another example, an earphone assembly for use by a user's ear may be provided that may include a body, an audio output component including a first magnet positioned at least partially within the body and a second magnet, wherein, when the body is positioned against the user's ear in a functional position that is operative to direct sound from the audio output component into the user's ear, the first magnet and the second magnet are operative to be positioned on opposite sides of a wall of the ear and are operative to be magnetically attracted to one another via the wall for holding the body in the functional position.     Apple's patent FIG. 3 is a perspective view of an illustrative earphone assembly worn by a user; FIGS. 3A – 3C are different cross-sectional views of a portion of the assembly.   Magnetism through Ear Tissue   More specifically in FIG. 3A noted above we're able to see magnets #252 and #282 highlighted. These magnets may be aligned for attracting one another with magnetism (e.g., magnetism MG) through ear tissue #301 of any suitable portion of ear #300.   In some embodiments, in addition to or as an alternative to hook member #280, another ear hook member #284 may be coupled to and may extend away from body #250. Hook member #284 may include a free end (e.g., similar to free end #281 of hook member #280) that may be positioned behind the ear when a portion of member #284 is directed away from the body down and under ear lobe #314.   Member #284 may be made of any suitable material, such as plastic, rubber, glass, and/or the like, that may include at least a flexible coupling with the body and/or that may be flexible along at least a portion of the length of member #284 for enabling the member to be flexible, deformable, and/or reconfigurable to be positioned as shown in FIG. 3.   Apple's patent application 20160381448 was filed back in Q2 2016. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office.

Despite the damage done to Samsung’s reputation, and the opportunity that created for Apple to persuade owners to switch platform, most Note 7 buyers ended up replacing it with another high-end Galaxy phone, said Stephen Baker, primary hardware analyst at tech industry research firm NPD. Samsung was able to fend off other Android competition, and Apple, too, thanks to Apple’s own lack of a wowing product this year. Mobile industry consultant Chetan Sharma agreed with NPD’s assessment …  Apple has the strongest ecosystem, with its hardware, software and app and content stores. iPhone users looking for an upgrade stick with Apple. But in a year when Samsung dropped the ball in a huge way, Apple didn’t have a phone with a compelling enough feature set to lure Samsung owners away. Indeed, although Apple topped the charts, the figures suggest that Apple’s sales declined while Samsung’s rose. Apple products accounted for 44% of activated smartphones and tablets in the period, while Samsung’s smartphones and tablets accounted for 21%, Flurry said […] That is a dip for Apple, which claimed 49.1% for a similar period in 2015. For Samsung, it was a bump up from 19.8%. Analysts noted that while the iPhone 7 achieved strong sales, it wasn’t yet clear whether its performance was enough to reverse the decline. Apple’s decision not to reveal opening weekend sales – due, it said, to constrained supply – means that it has been much harder to estimate the popularity of the device.

Twitter Facebook 5 signs we're finally getting our act together on security Despite all the bad news in information security in 2016, some positive developments may finally shift momentum Fahmida Y. Rashid (InfoWorld) 29 December, 2016 22:00 - - - - print email Comments The high-water line in information security gets higher each year. Just as we think we’ve finally figured out how to defend against attacks, then attackers come up with something new and we are right back to trying to figure out what to do next. For example, ransomware has surged in the last year. Although that kind of malware has been around for years, the current model of encrypting user files to hold data hostage came about just recently. Infections quadrupled in 2016, with the FBI estimating an average of 4,000 attacks a day. A recent IBM survey of 600 business leaders in the United States found that one in two had experienced a ransomware attack in the workplace, and that companies paid the ransom 70 percent of the time. As a result, criminals are on track to make nearly $1 billion this year from ransomware, IBM X-Force said.

Just ask Yahoo. Or the Democratic National Committee. Even the FBI was able to find a firm to hack into the Apple iPhone 5c, which for a while seemed unhackable. For IT and security professionals, this endless fire fighting gets exhausting. Old threats come back in new forms, and new attacks keep making the list of things to worry about even longer. Malicious word macros are back. Exploit kits still love Flash. SMS text messages with one-time codes for second-factor authentication proved hackable. It all makes you want to give up and curl up in a dark corner. But 2016 wasn’t all bad news for enterprise security, and there are some wins that give hope for a more secure future. 1. We’re looking at passwords in a better light Authentication, especially how we use passwords, was a recurring theme with every data breach. Yes, password reuse is still a problem and weak passwords like “password1” and “123456” are still a thing, but we are seeing more people use password managers to secure their online accounts and fingerprint sensors to lock their physical devices. “Biometrics will no longer be seen as novel in 2017, but necessary,” said Daniel Ingevaldson, CTO of security company Easy Solutions. There are fingerprint sensors on the market today with security features including TLS 1.2 and 256-bit encryption, anti-spoofing technologies, live-or-dead detection, and match-in-sensor architectures, said Anthony Gioeli, a vice president at Synaptics’s biometrics division. Apple has had hardware-secured fingerprint sensors in its mobile devices for several years, and now in its newest MacBook Pro. Samsung and Google use similar technology in their latest smartphones. And Microsoft has built in support for biometrics in Windows 10 and beefed up the security in this year’s Windows 10 Anniversary Update. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is also tackling the problem. The draft version of the Digital Authentication Guideline document includes new guidance on password policies, such as allowing for longer passwords; allowing spaces and other characters; removing special character requirements (such as what combination of letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters must be used); and doing away with password hints. NIST also said in the draft that sending unique passcodes via SMS messages should not be used as part of a two-factor authentication scheme, and that stronger authentication schemes should be adopted. Although the guidance is still in draft form and the official public comment period doesn’t start until early 2017, IT departments can use it to start thinking about how to improve authentication, such as rolling out multifactor authentication and changing password requirements. Another bonus: NIST’s Mary Theofanos said mandatory password changes don’t make sense, so IT departments can now work on alternative methods — and stop torturing users. 2. We may finally be taking IoT security seriously Last year, we could see the ransomware wave coming. This year, it’s internet of things (IoT) security — or the extreme lack thereof — that is clearly on the horizon. The distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks this fall, which spread through home security cameras, VCRs, and other connected devices, took down the internet and seemed to be the industry wakeup call that finally worked. Made up of compromised IoT devices, the Mirai botnet launched large attacks against French service provider OVH, the website of security blogger Brian Krebs, and networking company Dyn. The last time DDoS was the big story, it was about hacktivists and online pranksters targeting financial websites and other visible targets. This time, botnets are launching large, multivector attacks that can exceed 1 terabit per second — and interrupt internet access for millions.   Security experts have been warning for some time about the millions of devices that are connected to the internet without even the most basic security features, so the Mirai attack shouldn’t have been a surprise. And with Mirai’s source code publicly available, it is safe to assume there are other IoT botnets waiting in the shadows to strike. With all these devices connecting to the internet, we are ripe for an IoT worm, said Lamar Bailey, senior director of security research and development at Tripwire. Fixing the problem will require a lot of coordination, creativity, and persistence, but perhaps people are actually seeing the risks. The silver lining is that the Mirai attack was a “fairly cheap lesson in what a compromised IoT [threat] would look like while there’s still time to do something about it,” said Geoff Webb, vice president of solution strategy at Micro Focus. But IoT vendors need to get serious about security fast — and consumers should avoid their products until they do. 3. We’re getting other benefits on the coattails of new security technology It’s always a good sign when adopting something for security reasons winds up having other benefits. New protocols like Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 and HTTP2 will make the web safer, but there are clear performance improvements as well. It’s very likely the uptick in adoption of TLS 1.3 and HTTP2 by web developers will be spurred by the increased speeds the protocols enable, said Ryan Kearny, CTO of networking company F5 Networks. “In 2017, the increase in web speed will spur rapid adoption of TLS 1.3 —- and that will, in turn, make the web more secure,” Kearny said. 4. We’re getting more realistic about security Security was one of those things people never really understood. TV shows and movies didn’t help, with slick graphics and fancy dramatizations of what hacking supposedly looks like. Then, along came the TV show “Mr. Robot,” and the show’s star, Rami Malek, winning an Emmy for his portrayal of Elliott Alderson. “Out of all the attempts that Hollywood has made to tell a compelling story using cyber as the backdrop, Mr. Robot is the most complete,” said Rick Howard, CSO of networking security company Palo Alto Networks. If nothing else, nonsecurity professionals now have a better understanding of just how bad things can get. It’s no longer just that one weak password, one link in an email, or that one old software application that hasn’t been updated. There is no need to oversensationalize the security issues in “Mr. Robot” — the reality is bad enough. That better understanding should help users understand why they need to pay more attention to at least security basics. And why they keep getting breach notices from the likes of Yahoo and Dailymotion. But it doesn’t help that there’s still a culture of silence about breaches among security pros and the companies they work for. No one likes to talk about their failures or to be a headline. But because no one is sharing what mistakes were made, the same breaches keep happening over and over. That’s why the formation of new Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISAC) is a positive — though small — development, a sign of realism creeping into the security professionals’ culture, too. Although existing ISAC and commercial information-sharing platforms are expanding to include more enterprises, they need to become even more widespread. Developers have plenty of places where they can post code snippets and get programming help. IT and security professionals should have forums where they can share their security stories, ask questions without judgment, and learn about what worked for their peers, said Jeannie Warner, a security strategist at WhiteHat Security. “The bad guys have Tor, Reddit, and other social networks to share information and tools. The good guys need to adopt theirs just as freely,” Warner said. It’s easy to see information security as a never-ending stream of attacks. Perhaps the most distressing thing about the year’s outages and breaches is the fact that there is an awful lot happening that IT doesn’t know about. Security experts frequently warn that just because there is no evidence of a breach doesn’t mean there isn’t a breach. That was definitely true at Yahoo: The internet company disclosed two gigantic breaches, but the scariest thing wasn’t the number of victims — it was the fact that they happened years ago and no one even suspected. “We went years with billions of records being sucked out from right under our noses and we didn’t even know it,” wrote security expert Troy Hunt. He called the current mindset “conscious incompetence,” where we know we have a big problem. That’s a better place to be than the previous stage, where the prevailing attitude was, “It won’t happen to me.” The big question is knowing where to go next. “How much more are we going to discover over the next year? Or not discover at all?” Hunt asked. If we’re finally getting real about security, and come out of the shadows, we should finally begin to make real progress. 5. We may finally get security promises we can bank on As consumers, we demand money back when we are not satisfied with a product’s performance or functionality. But IT typically doesn’t get that option with security products. Only 25 percent of U.S. IT security decisionmakers said their primary security vendor is willing to guarantee their product by covering the costs of a breach, including lawsuits and ransoms, according to a recent survey by endpoint security company SentinelOne. But most IT security professionals in the survey said they would like security vendors to offer a guarantee their products would deliver on their promises — and 88 percent claimed they would change providers if a competitor offered such a guarantee. “The industry has reached a tipping point, where security vendors will need to guarantee that their products will hold up against cyberattacks and assume responsibility if they fail to do so,” said Jeremiah Grossman, chief of security strategy at SentinelOne. “Customers are tired of paying additional fees to address security breaches, especially when they have already paid for security defenses in the first place.” There are now a handful of companies that offer security guarantees. SentinelOne’s guarantee covers $1,000 per endpoint, or $1 million per company payout, in the event of a successful ransomware infection after installing SentinelOne’s Endpoint Protection Platform. Cymmetria covers the costs incurred in notifying victims, hiring attorneys, bringing in digital forensics investigators, and repairing the damage in case of an advanced persistent threat gaining unauthorized access, moving laterally through the network, and stealing protected information from compromised systems in organizations that have deployed Cymmetria’s MazeRunner cyber-deception platform. Trusona and WhiteHat Security also have similar product guarantees. As we’ve seen over the past few months, even security products can have vulnerabilities. But in several of the cases, the mistakes seemed fairly basic, even avoidable — not at all at the level of what a security provider should be delivering. Providing product guarantees should wring out such sloppiness from security providers, because they’ll finally pay a real price for their own neglect. “It’s high time people in our industry started putting their money where their mouth is and taking responsibility for what they sell, assuring what they do works,” said Gadi Evron, Cymmetria’s CEO.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending Buying Guides CES 2017 Nintendo Switch Samsung Galaxy S8 iPhone 8 MacBook Pro iOS 10.2 News How USB-C could kill the headphone jack How USB-C could kill the headphone jack By Mary Branscobe Mobile phones   2017: the beginning of the end for your favorite headphones Shares 2016 will be a year remembered for far too many things more important than changes in the tech world - but still, the loss of the 3.5mm headphone jack on smartphones is something that’s going to see massive changes for the way we consume audio. Let’s not forget that the 3.5mm jack has been around for a rather long time. The larger quarter-inch version (the one you might use to plug in an electric guitar, or to connect up stereo components such as including high-end headphones) dates back to 1878, when it was used in telephone exchanges. Sony put a smaller 3.5mm connector on a radio in 1964, and the Walkman cemented its popularity for portable electronics.  In every smartphone going, the headphone socket was universal and ubiquitous, but it has its disadvantages, and this year big brands like HTC, Motorola and most notably Apple have launched phones ditching the archaic port. Why drop the headphone jack? We’ve heard about how ‘courageous’ Apple was in dropping the headphone jack, but why are Android phone manufacturers doing the same thing? Well, now that USB Type-C (USB-C) connections are appearing on phones, the headphone jack is the thickest port you have to fit into a phone design.  “To a large degree, [USB-C] constrains the form factor [of devices],” explains Brad Saunders, the chairman of the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF), a non-profit organisation formed by companies involved in the creation of USB.  “Because now it's the thickest connector on the device, it's the deepest connector, and to some degree it's even the widest connector, [as] because it's an analog port that you need to put space around, because you can't have it interfering with other things. ”Get rid of the headphone jack, and your phone could be a millimetre thinner." (That might not sound like much, but it’s a marketer’s dream to lose that much width in the cut-throat world of smartphone sales.) The headphone jack is also surprisingly fragile. When you push a headphone connector in, the tip, the ring and the sleeve all have to make contact with the right parts of the socket; it’s the way your phone knows the headphones are connected, so it can switch audio from the speaker to the headphones.  That’s how some devices without speakers automatically pause the audio when you pull your headphones out – there’s no point wasting battery if you can’t hear the music. If you follow trends in smartphone design, moving parts are kept to a minimum - fewer mobile elements means less chance of something breaking.  The same applies to the headphone jack: after having headphones pushed in and pulled out hundreds of times the connectors can become damaged, leaving your device convinced that the headphones are always in – or that they’re never connected, in which case you won’t hear anything. Plus, the port is one more way for water to get into your phone and fry it - HTC and Apple both released waterproof phones that dropped the headphone jack, as  fewer places for water to get inside the phone means it's cheaper to make it water-resistant. Out with the old Assuming there’s not some huge backlash from consumers, it’s fair to assume that the headphone jack is going to diminish in importance in smartphone design in the future. So if there's a lot of interest in getting rid of the headphone connector, what technology will be used instead in Android phones?  Saunders told TechRadar: “One way of getting rid of it is to have digital audio, USB Audio, and the USB Type-C connector”.  USB Audio isn’t new; any time you plug a VoIP headset or USB speakers into your PC, you’re using USB Audio. Android has supported USB Audio since the rollout of Lollipop in 2014 - and Samsung is rumored to be using the system to replace the headphone jack in the Galaxy S8. “We have USB Audio, it already works,” Saunders points out. “The headphones I use at my desk plug into my USB port and they're Skype-compatible – we're all used to using Skype headsets with our desktop and notebook PCs, but that's about as far as it goes. No headphone jack, and a waterproof phone - it's no coincidence on the HTC 10 Evo “We don't use them on phones, we don't use them on simpler devices like iPods and the like. The problem is that USB Audio hasn't been adopted as broadly across the [operating systems] and platforms like phones. The biggest OS vendor in the world doesn't support the latest version of our spec and it's a 10-year-old spec. ”USB Audio has some distinct advantages. It doesn’t just send the audio; it also sends information about the capability of the headphones or speakers, the volume to play the audio at and so on. The USB port can power the Digital to Audio Converter you need to turn the audio signal into sound, and it can do that further away from components inside the device that might cause interference and degrade the audio quality. That’s not new either; it’s the way Bluetooth headphones work, only USB Type-C headphones won’t need batteries. The power could also drive active noise cancellation without you needing to put batteries in your headphones. An imperfect system But USB-C audio has also had some drawbacks, which the USB-IF has been working to fix. The organisation published its USB Audio Device Class 3.0 Specification in September, which laid out a defined standard for pumping audio out over the USB-C connection. “What we've done is we've tried to work out what the shortcomings were and we've embraced all the major OS vendors, a lot of audio silicon suppliers and the OEMs in an effort to bring the 10-year-old USB audio spec up to contemporary standards,” Saunders told us, prior to the specification’s publication. That includes reducing the amount of power needed to run USB audio, and adding support for ‘hotwords’ like "Okay Google" and "Hey Cortana", so that your headset can tell when you want to give your phone commands and wake it up. But the main thing is to make USB Audio easier to build into phones and easier to use. “Critically, we want to make it easier to use from a design perspective,” Saunders told us.  “What we're trying to do is make it so you can take any Type-C headset and plug it into the adaptor, and even the dumbest source can know how to use that headset. Apple's decision to drop the headphone jack has lead to manufacturers bringing out Lightning-connected cans “We’re simplifying the enumeration process and configuration process. We're updating the audio elements as well, but the key is the simplification and getting all the right suppliers in the same room so they own the solution and don't run away from it.” What Saunders is hoping is that USB Audio over a Type-C connector becomes the standard way to plug in anything that needs digital audio: audio headsets, docking stations, gaming setups, VR headsets as well as headphones. Given most Android manufacturers are likely to adopt the USB-C standard in 2017’s flagship phones, it’ll be interesting to see how many decide it’s time to drop the headphone jack as well. That’s a convenience to trade against the fact that you’ll likely have to use an adapter if you want to charge your phone at the same time as listening to music or making a call on a headset. Whether or not USB-C is the dominant format for delivering audio from your phone, given manufacturers are keen to cut costs and girth of their phones, you should probably start making peace with the fact you’ll either need an adaptor to use your favorite pair of headphones, or bite the bullet and join the wireless revolution.

Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About Behold: The very best of CES 2017 Entertainment A restaurant in San Fransisco is plating food on iPads Zach Epstein @zacharye December 28th, 2016 at 11:09 AM Share Tweet With a prime location in San Francisco’s Financial District, Quince is widely heralded as one of the city’s finest restaurants. It has plenty of buzz, premium pricing, an extensive wine list, and it was recently awarded its third Michelin Star. Now, it also has a dish that is served using an iPad as a plate. Because… San Francisco. Don't Miss: A man waited 416 days to see what happened when his iPod stopwatch passed 9,999 hours Just about everything else on the planet has a touchscreen and Wi-Fi connectivity baked in these days, so why shouldn’t the plates at fine restaurants? Chef Michael Tusk has a James Beard award, Michelin Stars and two critically acclaimed restaurants to his credit, so it’s difficult to question any of his decisions at this point. His latest decision is as close as he’s gotten to a questionable one, though. A relatively new addition to the beloved menu at Quince is called “A Dog In Search Of Gold,” and it’s plated on an iPad Pro. SFist first reported on a tweet from San Francisco chef Richie Nakano, who was made aware of the crazy new dish from a friend who texted him a photo, as seen in the tweet below. pic.twitter.com/Q5vrsoZB44 — Richie Nakano✨🚀🛰🌙 (@linecook) December 27, 2016 The person who texted Nakano described the dish as “white truffle croquettes on iPads playing videos of water dogs on the truffle-hunt.” Sure, why not? SFist notes that several restaurants in the UK have been plating various dishes on iPads since last year, but this appears to be the first time a notable restaurant in America has jumped on what we sincerely hope is a remarkably short-lived trend.

Rashid (InfoWorld) 29 December, 2016 22:00 - - - - print email Comments The high-water line in information security gets higher each year. Just as we think we’ve finally figured out how to defend against attacks, then attackers come up with something new and we are right back to trying to figure out what to do next. For example, ransomware has surged in the last year. Although that kind of malware has been around for years, the current model of encrypting user files to hold data hostage came about just recently. Infections quadrupled in 2016, with the FBI estimating an average of 4,000 attacks a day. A recent IBM survey of 600 business leaders in the United States found that one in two had experienced a ransomware attack in the workplace, and that companies paid the ransom 70 percent of the time. As a result, criminals are on track to make nearly $1 billion this year from ransomware, IBM X-Force said.

Just ask Yahoo. Or the Democratic National Committee. Even the FBI was able to find a firm to hack into the Apple iPhone 5c, which for a while seemed unhackable. For IT and security professionals, this endless fire fighting gets exhausting. Old threats come back in new forms, and new attacks keep making the list of things to worry about even longer. Malicious word macros are back. Exploit kits still love Flash. SMS text messages with one-time codes for second-factor authentication proved hackable. It all makes you want to give up and curl up in a dark corner. But 2016 wasn’t all bad news for enterprise security, and there are some wins that give hope for a more secure future. 1. We’re looking at passwords in a better light Authentication, especially how we use passwords, was a recurring theme with every data breach. Yes, password reuse is still a problem and weak passwords like “password1” and “123456” are still a thing, but we are seeing more people use password managers to secure their online accounts and fingerprint sensors to lock their physical devices. “Biometrics will no longer be seen as novel in 2017, but necessary,” said Daniel Ingevaldson, CTO of security company Easy Solutions. There are fingerprint sensors on the market today with security features including TLS 1.2 and 256-bit encryption, anti-spoofing technologies, live-or-dead detection, and match-in-sensor architectures, said Anthony Gioeli, a vice president at Synaptics’s biometrics division. Apple has had hardware-secured fingerprint sensors in its mobile devices for several years, and now in its newest MacBook Pro. Samsung and Google use similar technology in their latest smartphones. And Microsoft has built in support for biometrics in Windows 10 and beefed up the security in this year’s Windows 10 Anniversary Update. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is also tackling the problem. The draft version of the Digital Authentication Guideline document includes new guidance on password policies, such as allowing for longer passwords; allowing spaces and other characters; removing special character requirements (such as what combination of letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters must be used); and doing away with password hints. NIST also said in the draft that sending unique passcodes via SMS messages should not be used as part of a two-factor authentication scheme, and that stronger authentication schemes should be adopted. Although the guidance is still in draft form and the official public comment period doesn’t start until early 2017, IT departments can use it to start thinking about how to improve authentication, such as rolling out multifactor authentication and changing password requirements. Another bonus: NIST’s Mary Theofanos said mandatory password changes don’t make sense, so IT departments can now work on alternative methods — and stop torturing users. 2. We may finally be taking IoT security seriously Last year, we could see the ransomware wave coming. This year, it’s internet of things (IoT) security — or the extreme lack thereof — that is clearly on the horizon. The distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks this fall, which spread through home security cameras, VCRs, and other connected devices, took down the internet and seemed to be the industry wakeup call that finally worked. Made up of compromised IoT devices, the Mirai botnet launched large attacks against French service provider OVH, the website of security blogger Brian Krebs, and networking company Dyn. The last time DDoS was the big story, it was about hacktivists and online pranksters targeting financial websites and other visible targets. This time, botnets are launching large, multivector attacks that can exceed 1 terabit per second — and interrupt internet access for millions.   Security experts have been warning for some time about the millions of devices that are connected to the internet without even the most basic security features, so the Mirai attack shouldn’t have been a surprise. And with Mirai’s source code publicly available, it is safe to assume there are other IoT botnets waiting in the shadows to strike. With all these devices connecting to the internet, we are ripe for an IoT worm, said Lamar Bailey, senior director of security research and development at Tripwire. Fixing the problem will require a lot of coordination, creativity, and persistence, but perhaps people are actually seeing the risks. The silver lining is that the Mirai attack was a “fairly cheap lesson in what a compromised IoT [threat] would look like while there’s still time to do something about it,” said Geoff Webb, vice president of solution strategy at Micro Focus. But IoT vendors need to get serious about security fast — and consumers should avoid their products until they do. 3. We’re getting other benefits on the coattails of new security technology It’s always a good sign when adopting something for security reasons winds up having other benefits. New protocols like Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 and HTTP2 will make the web safer, but there are clear performance improvements as well. It’s very likely the uptick in adoption of TLS 1.3 and HTTP2 by web developers will be spurred by the increased speeds the protocols enable, said Ryan Kearny, CTO of networking company F5 Networks. “In 2017, the increase in web speed will spur rapid adoption of TLS 1.3 —- and that will, in turn, make the web more secure,” Kearny said. 4. We’re getting more realistic about security Security was one of those things people never really understood. TV shows and movies didn’t help, with slick graphics and fancy dramatizations of what hacking supposedly looks like. Then, along came the TV show “Mr. Robot,” and the show’s star, Rami Malek, winning an Emmy for his portrayal of Elliott Alderson. “Out of all the attempts that Hollywood has made to tell a compelling story using cyber as the backdrop, Mr. Robot is the most complete,” said Rick Howard, CSO of networking security company Palo Alto Networks. If nothing else, nonsecurity professionals now have a better understanding of just how bad things can get. It’s no longer just that one weak password, one link in an email, or that one old software application that hasn’t been updated. There is no need to oversensationalize the security issues in “Mr. Robot” — the reality is bad enough. That better understanding should help users understand why they need to pay more attention to at least security basics. And why they keep getting breach notices from the likes of Yahoo and Dailymotion. But it doesn’t help that there’s still a culture of silence about breaches among security pros and the companies they work for. No one likes to talk about their failures or to be a headline. But because no one is sharing what mistakes were made, the same breaches keep happening over and over. That’s why the formation of new Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISAC) is a positive — though small — development, a sign of realism creeping into the security professionals’ culture, too. Although existing ISAC and commercial information-sharing platforms are expanding to include more enterprises, they need to become even more widespread. Developers have plenty of places where they can post code snippets and get programming help. IT and security professionals should have forums where they can share their security stories, ask questions without judgment, and learn about what worked for their peers, said Jeannie Warner, a security strategist at WhiteHat Security. “The bad guys have Tor, Reddit, and other social networks to share information and tools. The good guys need to adopt theirs just as freely,” Warner said. It’s easy to see information security as a never-ending stream of attacks. Perhaps the most distressing thing about the year’s outages and breaches is the fact that there is an awful lot happening that IT doesn’t know about. Security experts frequently warn that just because there is no evidence of a breach doesn’t mean there isn’t a breach. That was definitely true at Yahoo: The internet company disclosed two gigantic breaches, but the scariest thing wasn’t the number of victims — it was the fact that they happened years ago and no one even suspected. “We went years with billions of records being sucked out from right under our noses and we didn’t even know it,” wrote security expert Troy Hunt. He called the current mindset “conscious incompetence,” where we know we have a big problem. That’s a better place to be than the previous stage, where the prevailing attitude was, “It won’t happen to me.” The big question is knowing where to go next. “How much more are we going to discover over the next year? Or not discover at all?” Hunt asked. If we’re finally getting real about security, and come out of the shadows, we should finally begin to make real progress. 5. We may finally get security promises we can bank on As consumers, we demand money back when we are not satisfied with a product’s performance or functionality. But IT typically doesn’t get that option with security products. Only 25 percent of U.S. IT security decisionmakers said their primary security vendor is willing to guarantee their product by covering the costs of a breach, including lawsuits and ransoms, according to a recent survey by endpoint security company SentinelOne. But most IT security professionals in the survey said they would like security vendors to offer a guarantee their products would deliver on their promises — and 88 percent claimed they would change providers if a competitor offered such a guarantee. “The industry has reached a tipping point, where security vendors will need to guarantee that their products will hold up against cyberattacks and assume responsibility if they fail to do so,” said Jeremiah Grossman, chief of security strategy at SentinelOne. “Customers are tired of paying additional fees to address security breaches, especially when they have already paid for security defenses in the first place.” There are now a handful of companies that offer security guarantees. SentinelOne’s guarantee covers $1,000 per endpoint, or $1 million per company payout, in the event of a successful ransomware infection after installing SentinelOne’s Endpoint Protection Platform. Cymmetria covers the costs incurred in notifying victims, hiring attorneys, bringing in digital forensics investigators, and repairing the damage in case of an advanced persistent threat gaining unauthorized access, moving laterally through the network, and stealing protected information from compromised systems in organizations that have deployed Cymmetria’s MazeRunner cyber-deception platform. Trusona and WhiteHat Security also have similar product guarantees. As we’ve seen over the past few months, even security products can have vulnerabilities. But in several of the cases, the mistakes seemed fairly basic, even avoidable — not at all at the level of what a security provider should be delivering. Providing product guarantees should wring out such sloppiness from security providers, because they’ll finally pay a real price for their own neglect. “It’s high time people in our industry started putting their money where their mouth is and taking responsibility for what they sell, assuring what they do works,” said Gadi Evron, Cymmetria’s CEO. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Apple to Launch 5.8-Inch iPhone Next Year with Samsung AMOLED Display GO New report claims that Apple is planning 3 different iPhones Dec 29, 2016 10:59 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  ​If you’re a long-time Apple watcher, you probably heard that headline before, but here’s something which, according to a new report, is all but confirmed. We’ve known for a while that Apple is working on three different iPhones for the 2017 generation, and while the first two are likely to come with the same dimensions as the existing models, the third has been pretty much an enigma for all of us. Digitimes, however, claims that Taiwan-based supply chain makers are already aware of Apple’s plans to build a third model with a 5.8-inch display that would be manufactured by Samsung. This particular model is expected to boast an OLED panel, just like we’ve heard before, and feature a new form factor, possibly without bezels and a Home button. It goes without saying that we should all take this report with a pinch of salt, but the same source says that Apple will stick with LCD panels for the other two models, while working with Samsung (exclusively!) on building the third iPhone with a 5.8-inch display. Bigger iPhone, smaller bezels Apple reportedly expects to sell up to 70 million iPhones with an OLED screen and Samsung is the only manufacturer that has such a high manufacturing capacity. Additionally, Apple has signed a deal with Japan-based Nissha Printing to receive touch sensors that will be used on models with AMOLED displays, while assembling will be the responsibility of Samsung Display or TPK Holding and General Interface Solution. The same source notes that Apple is aiming to start production of the new iPhone in March next year before a possible September launch. Previously, we’ve seen reports indicating that the next-year iPhone could come with a completely new form factor that would entirely remove bezels and integrate all front-facing part in the display for a more consistent design. It’s not clear if this is still the plan for Apple, but now it’s all but confirmed: a third model is coming and it’ll have an OLED display. #Apple#iPhone#iPhone 7s#iPhone 8#Samsung subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news First iPhone 7 Jailbreak (iOS 10.1.1) Now Available for Download The Jet White iPhone 7 Looks Stunning in This Mockup - Video Apple Suppliers Unwilling to Move iPhone Production to the US 5-Inch iPhone to Launch Next Year with Vertical Dual-Camera System Nokia E1 Could Be Unveiled at MWC 2017 Alongside Nokia D1, Here Are Its Specs 2015 VPN Android Bug Still There in Nougat (And It’s Pushing Users to iPhones) KillDisk System Destructive Malware Now Targeting Linux FBI Hack Most Likely a Hoax, CMS Maker Says Google Assistant on Pixel Phones to Get Support for Keyboard Input Galaxy S7 edge Blue Coral Variant to Land in Europe Soon Samsung Galaxy C5 Pro Allegedly Leaks in Live Blurry Image Google Calendar for Android and iOS Integrated with Fitness Goals    A bigger iPhone will launch next year with a Samsung display new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments iOS Bug Can Crash Messages App on Any New iPhone more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

By mariaea Posted on December 29, 2016 Rumored iPhone 8 Share Tweet Share Share Email iPhone SE reviews and rumors about the upcoming iPhone 8 have raised several similarities. As such, some may wonder if it will be smart to wait for the latter?s unconfirmed release date. Apple introduced iPhones with bigger screens back in 2014. This was primarily influenced by the market?s demand for it, given the popularity of Note phablets and the like. However, the Cupertino-based company eventually discovered that more people supposedly still prefer smaller devices. iPhone SE This resulted to Apple launching the iPhone SE. Released during the first half of 2016, it is the same size as an iPhone 5s. The four-inch device received mostly positive feedback due to its iPhone 6s-like hardware. Because of its success, many believe that Apple will come out with its upgraded versions to make it a full-fledged product line. Related: iPhone 2017 Rumors Roundup: Apple to launch OLED iPhone 8 in limited quantities? 5-Inch iPhone 8 However, there are reports that the SE might be too similar to the company?s next flagship smartphone. Rumored for release this 2017, the iPhone 8 series will supposedly have a version that will only measure five inches. BGR said the traditional home button will supposedly be ditched. This will allow more screen space even though the overall size will allegedly be reduced. However, it is unsure if the bezel will be relocated, removed entirely, or will just be made smaller. The iPhone 8 will also reportedly have Touch ID functionality and other related features. Related: Apple iPhone 8 to Have Dual-Sim Capabilities iPhone SE vs iPhone 8: The Verdict The report pointed out how Apple tends to make designs uniform across all devices. As such, an updated iPhone SE version will most likely look very similar to a five-inch iPhone 8. In fact, there are rumors and alleged leaks about all-screen design. However, the similarities have raised questions as to which of the two devices will be worth the wait for Apple patrons worldwide. BGR reminded that the iPhone SE does not have much 3D Touch support. Being the smallest and most affordable iPhone model, some of its features have also been compromised. The iPhone 8?s release date still hasn?t been confirmed. However, the abovementioned details leads to the conclusion that cash-strapped techies can perhaps settle for the SE. For those with extra money, the iPhone 8 seems to be worth the wait.

There are claims that it can do everything from halting hiccups to whiten teeth, and even banish dandruff. Whether or not it’s capa­ble of all these, there is some solid research to back up ap­ple cider vinegar as a healthy elixir, as long as you use it correctly. One promising benefit: It seems to help regulate blood sugar. A study published in Diabetes Care looked at men and women with type 2 dia­betes. The researchers found that when the participants downed two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar be­fore bed with a snack (one ounce of cheese), they had lower blood sugar levels the next morning, compared to when they ate the same bed­time snack paired with two tablespoons of water. Another study published in the same journal com­pared the effects of apple cider vinegar on healthy adults, people with pre-dia­betes, and people with type 2 diabetes. Study participants in all three groups had bet­ter blood glucose readings when they consumed less than an ounce of apple ci­der vinegar with a high-carb meal (a white bagel with butter and orange juice), compared to when they had the same meal and drank a placebo. People with pre-diabe­tes improved their blood glucose levels with vinegar by nearly half, while people with diabetes cut their blood glucose concentrations by 25 per cent. Some research also sug­gests that apple cider vine­gar may ward off scale creep. In a study published in the Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry, mice fed a high-fat diet along with acetic acid -- vinegar’s key component -- developed up to 10 per cent less body fat than control rodents. The researchers believe the findings support the notion that acetic acid turns on genes that trigger enzymes to break down fat and pre­vent weight gain. To investigate this effect in humans, Japanese scien­tists conducted a double-blind trial on obese adults with similar body weights and waist measurements in 2009. They divided the par­ticipants into three groups. Every day for 12 weeks, one group drank a beverage containing half an ounce of apple cider vinegar. Anoth­er group drank a beverage with one ounce of apple ci­der vinegar. And the third group had a drink contain­ing no vinegar at all. At the end of the study, the people who drank one of the beverages with vine­gar had less belly fat, lower triglycerides and waist mea­surements, and a lower body weight and BMI, compared to the no-vinegar group. Apple cider vinegar may also be a boon to digestive health, based on the results of a study done on mice with ulcerative colitis. The re­searchers found that when acetic acid was added to their drinking water, they had higher levels of good bacteria in their guts, such as Lactobacillus and Bifido­bacteria, and reduced symp­toms of the gastrointestinal disease. My go-to recipe: Whisk together one tablespoon each apple cider vinegar and lemon juice, add a half teaspoon of minced garlic, a dash of ground black pepper, and a few fresh basil leaves, chopped. It’s fantastic driz­zled over fresh leafy greens, broad beans, or cooked, chilled fingerling potatoes. Just remember, making vinegar a daily habit won’t cancel out the effects of over­eating. Think of it as one piece of your wellness puz­zle, and not a panacea.     SHARE ON: Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

ZHENGZHOU: A vast, boxy customs center acts as a busy island of commerce deep in central China. Government officers race around wooden pallets piled high with boxes — counting, weighing, scanning and approving shipments. Unmarked trucks stretch for more than a mile awaiting the next load headed for Beijing, New York, London and dozens of other destinations. The state-of-the-art facility was built several years ago to serve a single global exporter: Apple, now the world’s most valuable company and one of China’s largest retailers. The well-choreographed customs routine is part of a hidden bounty of perks, tax breaks and subsidies in China that supports the world’s biggest iPhone factory, according to confidential government records reviewed by The New York Times, as well as more than 100 interviews with factory workers, logistics handlers, truck drivers, tax specialists and current and former Apple executives. The package of sweeteners and incentives, worth billions of dollars, is central to the production of the iPhone, Apple’s best-selling and most profitable product. It all centers on Zhengzhou, a city of 6 million people in an impoverished region of China. Running at full tilt, the factory here, owned and operated by Apple’s manufacturing partner Foxconn, can produce 500,000 iPhones a day. Locals now refer to Zhengzhou as “iPhone City.” The local government has proved instrumental, doling out more than $1.5 billion to Foxconn to build large sections of the factory and nearby employee housing. It paved roads and built power plants. It helps cover continuing energy and transportation costs for the operation. It recruits workers for the assembly line. It pays bonuses to the factory for meeting export targets. All of it in support of iPhone production. “We needed something that could really develop this part of the country,” said Li Ziqiang, a Zhengzhou official. “There’s an old saying in China: ‘If you build the nest, the birds will come.’ And now, they’re coming.” U.S. officials have long decried China’s support of its state-owned companies, calling the subsidies and other aid an unfair competitive advantage in a global marketplace. But the Zhengzhou operation shows the extent of China’s effort to entice overseas multinationals to set up production in the country. Local and provincial officials have courted manufacturers with incentive packages that make it easier and cheaper to do business. Beijing, for decades, has encouraged such efforts at the national level, by developing special economic zones that offer tax breaks to multinationals and exempt them from costly and cumbersome rules. In this way, China is not unlike other countries, including the United States, where states and cities vie for companies. To compete in the era of globalization, multinationals, which face pressures from shareholders and customers, must seek the best opportunities, increasingly by relying on a highly interconnected supply chain spread across the world. In China, the competition for companies is secretive and rarely exposed to public scrutiny or debate — and it is often focused on manufacturing partners, rather than multinationals themselves. While Apple came later than many technology companies, it now generates nearly a quarter of its revenues from sales in China and has some of the fattest profit margins in the business. As such, the Zhengzhou operation provides an especially illustrative look at China’s importance to U.S. technology companies — and specifically iPhone production and, more recently, Apple’s consumer sales. A 32-gigabyte iPhone 7 costs an estimated $400 to produce. It retails for roughly $649 in the United States, with Apple taking a piece of the difference as profit. The result: Apple manages to earn 90 percent of the profits in the smartphone industry worldwide, even though it accounts for only 12 percent of the sales, according to Strategy Analytics, a research firm. It is difficult to tally the total value of government benefits for the Zhengzhou operation or to determine the exact effect on the profits of Foxconn or Apple. The subsidies aren’t disclosed by the Chinese government or Foxconn. They aren’t available in public records. And Apple says it was not a party to Foxconn’s negotiations. As China’s largest private employer, Foxconn, a Taiwanese company, has enormous leverage in the negotiations for those incentives. The company’s size and scale is connected to Apple. Foxconn is Apple’s largest supplier. Apple is Foxconn’s largest customer. The two companies are intertwined in Zhengzhou. When the factory opened, Apple was Foxconn’s only customer here. Even now, the U.S. technology company accounts for almost all of the production at the Zhengzhou plant, where about half of the world’s iPhones are made. Apple is also the main exporter using the customs facility here. A growing backlash against globalization puts Apple and other big multinationals directly in the sightlines of two increasingly combative giants: the United States and China. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to bring down the full force of the government on U.S. companies that move jobs overseas, threatening punitive tariffs on the goods they sell back at home. Apple has been a frequent target of Trump. China, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, is growing less tolerant and more suspicious of Western influence, particularly U.S. technology companies and the huge influence they have over Chinese consumers. A state-owned publication called Apple one of the “guardian warriors” that have “seamlessly penetrated” China and may pose a threat to national security. China, no longer content with just being the world’s factory floor, is moving aggressively to develop its own technology giants. Beijing is pressuring local governments to cut subsidy programs that the country heartily encouraged just a few years ago. And big exporters, courted and protected for decades by Beijing, now face broad scrutiny. Regulators shut down Apple’s iTunes Movies and iBooks Store last spring. The Chinese authorities fined the technology giant for failure to fully pay its taxes. And Apple went through a national security review in China for the iPhone 6, delaying its release in the country. Apple is now engaged in the corporate version of shuttle diplomacy. In December, the company’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, along with other Silicon Valley executives, met with Trump in New York, part of an effort to build bridges with the incoming administration. It followed a similar goodwill tour in China in August, when Cook sat down with the country’s vice premier at Zhongnanhai, the government’s walled leadership compound in what was once part of Beijing’s Imperial City. The two countries are playing a high-stakes game. Apple, like many multinationals, depends on a vast global supply chain that includes multiple companies and countries, each with its own expertise and advantages — a complexity that is often lost in the political debate over trade. The iPhone is a collection of intricate parts that are made around the world and assembled in China, spurring employment in many countries; Apple says it supports 2 million jobs in the United States. As China and the United States both brandish a new form of economic nationalism, they risk disrupting the system, without necessarily achieving their goals. And multinationals and their manufacturing partners would face serious financial trade-offs. As the Zhengzhou operation shows, China not only provides a large pool of labor; it also offers incentives that would be difficult to replicate in the United States or anywhere else. The benefits in Zhengzhou flow through the production process for the iPhone, from the factory floor to the retail store. Foxconn receives a bonus when it meets targets for exports. Those subsidies, according to the government records, totaled $56 million in the first two years of production, when the factory was exclusively dedicated to the iPhone. The Zhengzhou government eliminated corporate taxes and value-added taxes that Foxconn pays for the first five years of production; they are half the usual rate for the next five. The city lowered Foxconn’s social insurance and other payments for workers, by up to $100 million a year. The customs operation is also in a so-called bonded zone, an area that China essentially considers foreign soil, subject to different import and export rules. This setup allows Apple to sell iPhones more easily to Chinese consumers. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

The makers of Siri went on to create Viv, a realisation of their original vision for Siri. Viv was acquired by Samsung this year. Despite the initial head start with Siri, Apple lost ground over the subsequent years by being very secretive about its research. As Apple employees were not allowed to publish research, the best talent was not attracted to the company. All that changed with the hire of prominent Carnegie Mellon University researcher Russ Salakhutdinov earlier in the year. Apple has already gone ahead and published its first research paper. Apple’s research allows them to train machines on image data sets, without annotations of the details. Image: University of Cambridge/ Max Planck Institute for Informatics Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google remarked on the onset of a remarkable new disruptive technology at the October hardware event by Google. Every ten years or so, a transformational technology comes along that changes everything. In the mid 80s this was the desktop computer, in the mid 90s, this was the internet, in the mid 2000s, the smartphone revolution began. We are in the mid 2010s, and the next big change will come about because of Artificial Intelligence. US President Barack Obama said in an interview that it was necessary to imbibe artificial intelligences with human values. Humans have to make harsh decisions, and Obama raised the question of whether machines should be allowed to make such decisions. For example: Can a self driving car be trusted to decide between running over a pedestrian or involving the passengers of the vehicle in a fatal crash? The International Convention on Conventional Weapons meet for a review conference, where they agreed to regulate lethal autonomous vehicle systems (LAWS), or killer robots. The White House said that it was tweaking policy to handle the huge number of human jobs that are now going to be done by machines. The Amazon Echo and the Google Home The year saw the growth of an all new product category called smart speakers. The Echo by Amazon was a pioneer in this category, with a voice controlled digital assistant hardware for living spaces. The Amazon Echo Dot was introduced this year and Google made its debut in the smart speaker space with Google Home. Microsoft hinted at a high-end smart speaker by Harman Kardon. According to analyst firm, Gartner, smart home speakers are expected to be a $2.1 billion industry by 2020.

Rohit KVN   December 29, 2016 15:29 IST 1 Shares 1 Shares [Representational Image] Apple iOS 10.1.1 Jailbreak status: Luca Todesco’s Yalu beta version out for iPhone 7, 6S and iPad Pro series. In Picture: iOS 10Apple Official Website While many thought that Apple had fixed all loopholes in iOS 10, which offered leeway for jailbreaking iOS 9-based devices, it turns out that the belief was mistaken. Popular jailbreak coder Luca Todesco has released the firmware to liberate select iPhone and iPad models. Popular iOS coders Luca Todesco and Ian Beer have developed a fully working Cydia compliant Yula Jailbreak software. There is one caveat though. It is a beta version and hence supports only select devices — iPhone 7, 7 Plus, iPhone 6S, 6s Plus and iPad Pro, Cult of Mac reported. Also read: Android Nougat release schedule news: Xiaomi Mi Mix to get MIUI 9.0 firmware soon The good news is that other Apple device owners need not wait long for the jailbreak code, as Todesco has promised to release a more stable version in the coming days, which will be compatible with all Apple devices. As of now, iPhone 7, 6s and iPad Pro series owners can go ahead to install Yalu jailbreak code (HERE) to liberate devices. They just need to side load the .ipa file to iPhones and iPads via iTunes from a PC or a Mac. However, we suggest that you wait for a few more days for the stable version to get released and try jailbreaking, as there will less risk of losing data or bricking the device. If you still want to install Yalu Jailbreak, make sure you have backed up all the data on your device. Watch this space for more updates on Apple iOS and products.

On Wednesday, Yahoo's Flurry Analytics looked at new phone and tablet "activations" between Dec 19 and Dec 25. Both Apple and Samsung still dominated but Apple saw a fall in share while Samsung saw a slight increase. This year, 44 percent of activations globally were Apple devices, a decline from the 49.1 percent seen in a similar period in 2015, and 51.3 percent in 2014. Meanwhile, 21 percent of activations were Samsung devices, a tiny rise from 19.8 percent last year. Peter Macdiarmid | Getty Images Both figures might be surprising, firstly given Apple released two new flagship iPhones in September and Samsung went through the Note 7 scandal. It's important to note that activations are not the same as sales. Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 and larger-screen iPhone 7 Plus in September. Reaction to the model was underwhelming but many reviewers at the time noted that there were some big under-the-hood upgrades. After the pre-order period in September, Apple said iPhone 7 Plus supplies had sold out. The popularity of the larger screen iPhone appears to be in line with Flurry's figures which showed phablet devices – those with 5 inch to 6.9 inch screens – accounted for 37 percent market share, up from 27 percent in 2015. Apple has not released any official figures for sales over the holiday period but Chief Executive Tim Cook told CNBC on Wednesday that it has been a "great holiday" period. It's been a difficult year for the U.S. technology giant which saw its first annual revenue decline since 2001 when it reported yearly results in October. Apple has struggled in China, and perhaps part of the lackluster holiday performance could be down to this. UBS analysts suggest that the iPhone 7 should help Apple see single-digit iPhone unit growth in its fiscal 2017 year, while growth should be double-digit in fiscal 2018. Rumors suggest Apple will be releasing a special edition iPhone 8 in 2017 to mark the device's tenth anniversary, which could drive sales. It may also seem surprising that Samsung managed to see a rise in activations during the holiday period given that it had to recall all Note 7 devices in September after a few caught fire. The South Korean electronics giant let users exchange their faulty Note 7 phones with its flagship Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge, something that has mitigated the damage to sales. Surveys suggest that Samsung has a loyal brand following. A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll carried out between October 26 and November 9 found that 91 percent of current Samsung users would likely purchase another Samsung smartphone. Google 'struggled' to excite Flurry Analytics also found Chinese manufacturer Huawei was the third-most popular brand with three percent of new phone or tablet activations produced by the company. Huawei has been aggressively expanding its smartphone division, launching both high-end and mid-range phones to attract a range of consumers. "Holding the third and fourth positions for activations are Huawei and LG; which is remarkable, as both manufacturers do not have an individual device within the top 35 devices activated. Their high rank is likely due to the fact that they have wide variety of devices and affordable options (hundreds of phablet and medium phones) for consumers to choose from," Flurry said in a blog post. "Perhaps not so surprisingly, missing from this chart is the Google Pixel. With only two devices, the Pixel and Pixel XL, and mixed market reception, Google struggled to drum up excitement this holiday season."

Is there anything that affected customers can do to fix the problem?  ( Apple ) Advertisement The next battery issue brought to light against an Apple product — after the 2016 version of the MacBook Pro became the first MacBook to fail in getting a recommendation from Consumer Reports due to battery life problems — involves the newly released AirPods. Some users are complaining about battery drain issues on the charging case that comes with the AirPods, which only recently started shipping out to customers. AirPods Charging Case Battery Drain The charging case of the AirPods comes with its own battery, and when the AirPods are placed inside the case, they will be charged up. According to Apple, the charging case can hold a charge worth 24 hours, but some users have reported that they have experienced rapid battery drain on their charging case even though the AirPods are fully charged and there is not much Bluetooth activity happening. One of the AirPods owners who experienced the issue was Redditor severinskulls, who wrote in a thread in the Apple subreddit that when he had his AirPods and charging case at full charge before going to sleep, he would wake up to see that 15 percent to 20 percent of the battery of the charging case was drained. Other users, however, are claiming to have noticed drains reaching as much as 40 percent, which is a massive problem for a charging case that would serve as the backup source of power for the AirPods. What Can Apple Do To Fix The AirPods Charging Case Battery Drain Problem? Apple is not known to be a company that quickly fixes battery problems in its products as evidenced by the bug currently experienced by iOS users that see their devices suddenly shutting down even while having more than 30 percent battery charge. Apple was expected to fix the problem with the iOS 10.2 update, but it seemed that the bug became even worse for some users. Fortunately, it is a different story for the battery drain issue of the AirPods charging case. For severinskulls, after visiting an Apple Store and getting a replacement for his charging case, the switch seemingly fixed the problem. When he went to sleep with a 100 percent charge on both his AirPods and the charging case, he woke up to see that the battery level on both of them were still at 100 percent. How Widespread Is The AirPods Charging Case Defect? It would seem that AirPods charging cases that see their battery levels draining rapidly is a defect on the charging case itself, and a quick replacement from Apple will solve the problem. It is unclear, however, how widespread the defect in the AirPods charging case is, though there is speculation that the issue is due to a problem experienced by the charging case on its initial charge cycle. Many users have reported that the battery of their AirPods charging cases are working fine, so if you are among the unfortunate customers to get a defective one, send in your AirPods charging case for a replacement.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

Opening date for 24 new Princes... 1 Man and woman found dead at a home in Lincolnshire 1 Comments (0) A TEACHER or lecturer who has inspired and engaged the region's learners will be given the ultimate recognition by being decorated with a prestigious Golden Apple Award. A whole host of awards will be handed to educational establishments or people who work or learn in it will with an award. They are returning for a second year and will look to recognise schools, academies, colleges, staff and students to shout from the rooftops about all that is good about our region's education. The teacher or lecturer award was previously won by Kelly Mitchell, of Humberston Park Special School, last year. It is not just aimed at people in schools, and judges will be looking for a teacher or lecturer who has gone the extra mile to try to help students do the best they possibly can in the classroom. More news: Timely £1,100 boost to The Ark from generous social work staff This person should be someone who inspired and engaged students to fulfil their potential during the academy year 2015-16. Whether it be by providing extra tutoring or by offering extra support during exam periods, this teacher or lecturer must have made a real difference to students' lives. Michelle Lalor, editor at the Grimsby Telegraph, said: "The students of today are the professional adults of tomorrow. "They are the ones who will take this country forward, who will contribute to the success of industry, business, manufacturing and care in the UK. "When we see children in classrooms, we must all remember that and realise that, to get the best for Britain, we must ensure our teaching is as good as it possibly can be. "Recognition of success, of going the extra mile and of making a true effort within education is therefore vital. "We have much to be proud of in Northern Lincolnshire, with a tremendous amount of work going into getting the best results possible – both academically and socially – for our children. "How many times have you heard how a good teacher has inspired a pupil to go on and succeed in a particular profession? "We need to attract and retain the best and the Golden Apples certainly does highlight that we do have some of 'the best' in our region. Thank you to all of you who go that extra mile – these awards are for you." More news: Public Health England warns of 'middle-aged health crisis' Following on from last year's hugely successful campaign, the awards are returning for a second year aimed at once again recognising the talent, skills and hard work that goes into teaching and providing education in North and North East Lincolnshire. They also raise the profile of great teaching in our community and reward those whose work deserves to be recognised among their peers. Nominations are now open for an eight-week period. Finalists will be shortlisted in February by an independently selected judging panel and invited to attend the awards ceremony at the Forest Pines Hotel on Thursday, March 2. We are looking to once again recognise and celebrate the very best in education that Northern Lincolnshire has to offer. A huge 11 awards will be handed out, and will look to add to the fantastic stories unearthed during the first Golden Apple Awards ceremony earlier this year.

LOCAL STORIES  |  420  |  OPINIONS          CALENDAR  |  ARTS&CULTURE  |  MUSIC  |  DINING  |  FILM  |  GUIDES  |  N&R EVENTS          CLASSIFIEDS Tweet Time killer Assassin's Creed By Jim Lane This article was published on 12.29.16. Just pretend he’s still playing Hamlet. Advertisement No movie based on a video game is worth a damn. But Assassin’s Creed never even rises to the level of “not worth a damn.” The picture is directed by Justin Kurzel and stars Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard; last year, the three worked together on the latest screen version of Shakespeare’s Macbeth. They have literally gone from the sublime to the ridiculous. And Assassin’s Creed is even more ridiculous than Shakespeare is sublime. The moronic plot involves the ancient conflict between the Knights Templar and the Assassins for control of the Apple of Eden, which contains “the seed of mankind’s first disobedience.” The movie opens in 1492, then swoops through 1986 before finally landing in 2016 with the execution of career criminal Callum Lynch (Fassbender). Lynch dies on the table, only to awaken to find Sofia Rikkin (Cotillard) bending over him. He is in the labyrinthine headquarters of an organization called Abstergo, and has been saved because he is descended from the Assassins. Sofia and her father Alan (Jeremy Irons in full Boris Karloff mode) hope to plumb Lynch’s genetic memories of an exploit back in 1492 when the Assassins gained control of the Apple of Eden. (That fruit must be getting pretty moldy by now.) By learning where the Assassins hid the apple, they aim to reprogram aggression out of the human race and “create a world free of violence.” Abstergo is really a front for the Knights Templar, whose idea of world peace is world control, while Assassins are the guardians of free will. Or something. Not that it matters. Nor does naming the movie’s bad guys for an order of Christian crusader knights, while the heroic Assassins are clearly aligned with the Moors of medieval Spain; I’ll let some rabid conspiracy theorist speculate on that. Anyhow, it’s claptrap, courtesy of writers Michael Lesslie, Adam Cooper and Bill Collage (sharing blame, perhaps, with the game’s creators, Patrick Désilets, Corey May and Jade Raymond). Their script is so historically illiterate that it suggests Christopher Columbus knew he was sailing off to discover America. At one point, Alan Rikkin’s overseer Ellen Kaye (Charlotte Rampling) tells him, “The council feels that giving you $6 billion a year would be better spent elsewhere.” Yes, it’s true—these writers can’t put together a simple English sentence. (By the way, Jeremy Irons morphed into Karloff some 20 years ago, but when did Charlotte Rampling?) Again, it doesn’t matter. It’s all about the video game action in Lynch’s genetic memories of 1492, accessed by strapping him into a machine called the Animus, which looks like a thrill ride in some theme park in one of Dante’s circles of hell. This unleashes not only the full catalog of CGI clichés but the cacophonous music of Jed Kurzel (who is about as good at his craft as his brother Justin is at directing). If somebody wants to create a world without violence, a good first step would be to stop making movies like this.

Samsung Drops One Of Its Many Law Suits Against Apple Posted Jul 4, 2011 by Jordan Crook (@jordanrcrook) 0 SHARES Next Story Amazon Acquires UK-Based Online Book Retailer The Book Depository For International Expansion It’s looking like Samsung and Apple got a bit carried away there for a while. Apparently the web of litigation surrounding the mobile giants has become too complicated for Samsung, who has chosen to drop one of its counter-suits against Apple. Specifically, the South Korea-based company will dismiss its counter-suit against Apple’s original April filing alleging that the Galaxy line of phones and tablets mimic the iPad and iPhone. Nam Ki Yung, a spokesman for Samsung, today explained to Bloomberg that the company dropped the suit “to streamline legal proceedings.” However, this one suit won’t slim down Samsung or Apple’s legal files any time soon. The companies are wrapped up in litigation in five different countries, including Germany, South Korea, the U.K., Japan, and of course, here in the States. “Samsung will continue to actively defend and protect our intellectual property,” said Mr. Nam. This is just the latest in a string of patent suits and counter-suits between the two tech giants. Most recently, Samsung revised its patent violation allegations against Apple, and added sarcastically that what Apple is perceiving as “copyist,” is merely competition, despite “Apple’s efforts to avoid such competition.” Hopefully Samsung’s streamlined vision will end this copycat drama once and for all.

However, on digging further, we were greeted with a ‘6 weeks’ estimate time for shippment on the AirPods product page. According to reports by MacRumors the AirPods are showing the same shipping estimate since the first day. The product will not be available till mid-February in the Apple Pickup stores. This comes right after the reports that some customers are finding the charging case of AirPods malfunctioning after some usage. According to previous reports, the delay in the launch of AirPods was caused because of Technical issues and difficulty in manufacturing. According to the details, one of the issues was an audio sync problem between the individual pods and the iPhone. But the shipping delay is not an important parameter because we don’t know the number of initial AirPods shipped and the manufacturing capacity of the production facilities that are making the AirPods.

Written by Varun Sharma | Updated: January 1, 2017 9:22 am The new year 2017 has just begun and smartphones are expected to see some radical design changes. Here’s a look at the top smartphones to expect from 2017. (Image Source: Reuters) The year has come to an end and while the list of favourite smartphones is done and dusted, leaks around what 2017 will offer in the mobile world continue to take place. There’s no doubt that in 2017 there are great expectations from the smartphone industry; we’re hoping to see new designs, faster phones, and innovation that will be useful. Plus old favourites are planning a comeback, with Nokia getting ready to re-enter the market in 2017. Samsung will focus on a virtual assistant with the Galaxy S8, and the next iPhone promises to usher in a big design change. Here’s a look at the top expectations from the smartphone world in 2017. Apple Apple is expected to bring a major upgrade to its 2017 flagships. The iPhone 8 has already been the centre of many leaks, with some reports suggesting the upcoming iPhone will finally get an OLED display. Apple might also do away with the aluminium casing in favour of an all-glass body, similar to iPhone 4/4s series. Apple iPhone 8 is expected to finally get an OLED display, along with a bezel-less design An iPhone 8 with a bezel-less display and no actual physical home button is also rumoured. The 2017 iPhone could also bring wireless charging to the mix, a feature that has been long awaited. Read: Apple iPhone 7 review: This phone still sets the benchmarks Samsung Following the untimely demise of the Galaxy Note 7, Samsung’s next flagship will be closely watched. The Galaxy S8 will make an appearance in February 2017, though some reports suggest April, and it is likely to be the first smartphone to have Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 835 chipset. Samsung Galaxy S8 is expected to be the first smartphone to run on Snapdragon 835 processor Latest rumours suggest Galaxy S8 have a 6-inch display version packed with 8GB of RAM. Samsung is expected to do away with the 3.5mm headphone jack and introduce a USB Type-C port for charging. A tipster from Weibo has hinted at the S8 getting a dual (13MP + 12MP) camera setup, but conflicts with most reports which suggests that Samsung will not be introducing this. We can also expect Samsung to launch the Galaxy Note 8 next year. Read: Samsung Galaxy S7 edge review: Android Perfection Nokia-branded smartphones Nokia plans to jump right back into the smartphone market in 2017, following the expiry of a non-compete clause it signed with Microsoft when the latter acquired its mobile business. Once a dominant and well established brand, Nokia will re-enter the market with new Android devices which will be manufactured by HMD Global using the Nokia brand. Nokia D1C is expected to be the first smartphone to be launched by the company in 2017 Nokia D1C is expected to be one of the first phones to be out next year at MWC 2017. The Android OS based smartphone is expected to come in two variants – 2GB/3GB RAM, priced at roughly Rs 10,000 and Rs 13,000 respectively. According to leaks on NokiaPowerUser, D1C will be powered by a Snapdragon 430 processor, and will come in two display sizes; a 5-inch and 5.5-inch version along with a 13MP rear camera and an 8MP front camera.

The phone is likely to feature a 23MP rear camera fitted with Carl Zeiss optics and will have a Quad HD resolution display. Nokia P is expected in the second half of 2017. BlackBerry BlackBerry is no longer making smartphones in-house, but instead will partner with China’s TCL; the latter will manufacture and distribute BlackBerry-branded phones. TCL is expected to announce BlackBerry-branded smartphones at CES 2017 and BlackBerry Mercury could be revealed at the show. BlackBerry Mercury is reported to be featuring a Snapdragon 625 processor and come with 3GB RAM. BlackBerry Mercury images were leaked earlier this month, which show a device sporting a full QWERTY keyboard.

The phone will be running Android 7.0 Nougat and come with 32GB of on-board storage. OnePlus  OnePlus has said in the past the company will be concentrating on launching just one flagship smartphone every year, and OnePlus 4 is expected to be the next big thing for 2017. According to Weibo tipster KJuma, OnePlus 4 will be featuring 6GB or 8GB of RAM, and some claim the company could skip the number ‘4’ in favour of OnePlus 5, considering that four is considered unlucky in Chinese culture. Rumours suggest the OnePlus 4 might actually be called the OnePlus 5 OnePlus 4 is expected to be powered by either a Qualcomm Snapdragon 830 chipset, or a Snapdragon 835 SoC, have 128GB storage and a larger 4000 mAh battery.

Google Pixel and Pixel XL have received rave reviews from the audience, and have been priced in the premium segment to take on the iPhone. Pixel devices bring a much deeper integration to Google compared to other Android devices, and have a new Google Assistant – which is a significant improvement over Google Now. Pixel devices are best known for their superior camera function, and Google will likely upgrade this in the Pixel 2.0 series. We could also see an improved design for the next generation of Pixel phones. Google Pixel’s successor in 2017 is expected to feature a better camera setup Lenovo, Motorola Lenovo-owned Motorola launched Moto Z, it’s first modular smartphone in 2016. The philosophy of the modular design is to let customers tweak their device to enjoy improvements in hardware.

Lenovo has also been working with Google on Project Tango, and while the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro has only gone on sale in US so far, it remains to be seen what happens with this partnership in 2017. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: Apple BlackBerry HTC LG microsoft nokia OnePlus Samsung Xiaomi Yearender 2016 Best of Express Model Code of Conduct: EC asks Govt to respond to Opposition's Budget delay demand EntertainmentOm Puri passes away after a massive heart attack, funeral at 6 pm EntertainmentDangal box office collection day 15: Aamir Khan film sets new benchmarks for industry EntertainmentSwami Om out of Bigg Boss 10 for peeing on contestants.

Currently, Indian law requires that certain product details be printed on the device itself, but Apple has asked that it be allowed to print the information on the packaging or provide it as part of the software, The Economic Times said. Apple had made the request to the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP), which has now been forwarded to the Department of Revenue and Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeITY), said the report. Relaxation on labelling is one of the several sops that Apple has sought from the Indian government for manufacturing in the country. It has also sought tax incentives, which are currently being reviewed by the country’s finance ministry, said the report. Manufacturing products in India will allow Apple to open its stores in the country, where its smartphone market share is a minuscule 5%. At the moment, the company sells goods in India mainly through exclusive franchise stores. A few months ago, the Indian government relaxed its foreign direct investment (FDI) rules, under which a foreign-owned single brand could open its outlets in India on the condition that it would buy at least 30% of its manufacturing materials from local vendors after three years of setting up. India had rejected Apple’s plan to sell imported, refurbished iPhones in the country in May this year. With a handful of high-end phone-part makers in India to buy from, Apple may face manufacturing challenges in the country but, at the same time, the move will give Apple visibility and allow it to enhance buyers’ in-store experience. Currently, most of Apple’s products are assembled in China, primarily by Foxconn Technology Group, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Like this report?

That’s because Apple is reportedly getting ready to launch a new iPhone 7 colour. Tipped to join the existing Silver, Gold, Rose Gold, Black and Jet Black colour schemes, is a new Jet White option. The crisp, clean hue, which has previously been mooted as being in the works, has now reportedly been caught on camera, with footage of white iPhone 7 bodies being shown off on the Twitter feed of reputed Apple tipster Sonny Dickson. Shown to feature a shiny, gloss finish, the Jet White iPhone 7 body has been teased alongside a similarly toned take on the iPhone 7 Plus. Related: iPhone 7 vs Samsung Galaxy S7 Despite the latest leak, however, it’s currently unclear when, or indeed if, Apple plans to launch a sixth iPhone 7 colour. First mutterings of a ‘Jet White’ iPhone 7 emerged back in November, with a pre-Christmas release having been teased. With that timeframe having failed to yield the new Apple handset, the rumour mill looks to be cranking back into gear, with the latest leak following on from teasing comments from those ever faithful ‘supply chain sources’. Apple’s next major product launch isn’t expected to take place until March 2017, with a refreshed range of iPads and potentially an iPhone SE replacement expected to make an appearance. It’s possible that a Jet White iPhone 7 could drop around this time, marking the midway point of the handset’s year-long lifecycle and kicking a bit of renewed energy into Apple’s handset sales.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

Photos Videos Topics Live PAK 128/5 (53) - AUS 241/2 (32) Home India Locality World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Mahendra Singh Dhoni Bengaluru Assembly polls West Bengal CES 2017 Home Money Inter-ministerial group to discuss Apple's demands next month (AFP) Shares3 Thu, 29 Dec 2016-12:51pm , New Delhi , PTI Apple has sought major tax and other incentives to set up a manufacturing unit in India. A group of senior officials from ministries, including commerce and finance, will deliberate on the incentives sought by US-based iPhone maker Apple early next month, to set up a manufacturing unit in the country. Officials from departments of commerce, industrial policy and promotion (DIPP), revenue, environment and forest, electronics and information technology (DeITY) will attend the meeting. The group is likely to meet in the first week of January to discuss the issue, sources said. In a communication to the government, the Cupertino-based technology major has asked for several tax and other incentives to enter India's manufacturing sector. However, government sources said the technology-major should set up the manufacturing unit in India without seeking additional support. "Several companies in India are manufacturing mobile phones here. Nobody is asking for additional incentives. Currently, the government provides sufficient support to boost electronic manufacturing," they added. The government provides benefits under Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (MSIPS) to boost electronic manufacturing in the country. The scheme provides financial incentives to offset disability and attract investments in the electronics hardware segment. It also gives subsidy for investments in Special Economic Zones, among other benefits. Currently, Apple's products are manufactured in six countries, including Korea, Japan and the US. Earlier, the finance ministry in May had rejected relaxing the 30% domestic sourcing norms, as sought by the iPhone and iPad maker as a pre-condition for bringing in FDI to set up single-brand retail stores in the country. The company had sought exemption on the ground that it makes state-of-the-art and cutting-edge technology products for which local sourcing is not possible. The government had also turned down the firm's proposal to import refurbished phones and sell them in India. The company sells its products through Apple-owned retail stores in countries like China, Germany, the US, the UK and France, among others. It has no wholly-owned store in India and sells its products through distributors such as Redington and Ingram Micro. The government has announced incentives to promote electronic manufacturing in India and reduce the import bill. Total import of electronics goods were valued at Rs 2.25 lakh crore in 2014-15 as against Rs 1.95 lakh crore in the previous year.

Image: EPA By Sohini Mitter2016-12-29 07:13:42 UTC Now that Apple intends to start manufacturing iPhones in India, it has decided to get a few things sorted upfront.  India has strict labeling rules for products and Apple wants its government to relax them. The smartphone giant will not disturb its minimalist design by printing product-related information directly onto devices, the Economic Times reported.  SEE ALSO: Apple might finally start manufacturing iPhones in India Apple has submitted a proposal to India's Department of Revenue and Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeITY) requesting the same.  It will provide product details that are required by law in India as part of the software of the device or on the packaging, instead of tinkering with the product look-and-feel, the report added.  Apple currently prints the bare minimum regulatory information on the back of its iPhones, with other details made available through the Settings menu in iOS. Apple India refused to comment on the matter when Mashable reached out to them.  Last month, Apple had reportedly sought tax incentives from the Indian government with regards to setting up its manufacturing unit in the country. India currently imposes heavy taxes on imported electronic devices, in order to boost local assembly of smartphones. Governments, both at central and state level, offer tax breaks and other incentives to companies that set up their manufacturing.  India is one of Apple's top-growth markets. iPhone sales shot up more than 50% this year. During an earnings call for the fiscal fourth quarter, Apple CEO Tim Cook had said that the recent improvements in infrastructure and penetration of 4G LTE networks in India could further boost iPhone sales.  Apple achieved this growth despite the fact that India is one of the most expensive countries to buy Apple products since they are not manufactured locally and are subjected to heavy import taxes. And things could only improve when it starts manufacturing in the country.  BONUS: This brilliant iPhone device projects bedtime stories to your kids Topics: Apple, Gadgets, iPhone, iPhone 7, iphone 7 plus, Mobile, Modi, Tech, tim cook About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Let's find out in round 4 of our Christmas quiz! by Nick Spence | 29 Dec 16 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Welcome to our Apple Christmas Quiz 2016! This is Round 4: Everything iOS, iPhone, iPad and iPod. Macworld reader, Apple fan? The two go hand-in-hand, but just how big an Apple fan are you?

(The final round will appear tomorrow!) Click on the questions to find out the answers - no peeking now! Round 1: The Life and Times of Steve Jobs Round 2: Apple Alumni: Woz, Ive, Cook and Co Round 3: Apple Through the Years Q1 What software did PC users use with iPods before iTunes? Q2 How many versions of the iPhone have been released? Q3 What two things did Steve Jobs say an Apple tablet must lack? Q4 How many songs did Apple offer with the US launch of the iTunes Music Store in 2003? Content continues below Q5 What’s the connection between an apartment sold by Jobs and Apple’s 2004 iPods? Q6 What did Jobs say users would need in order to use tablets with screens less than 10 inches?  Q7 At launch in 2008, how many apps were available to download from the iTunes App Store? Q8 In what year was Apple able to offer iTunes songs DRM-free? Q9 Which classic rock band allowed their back catalogue to appear on iTunes in 2012? Q10 What was the 25 billionth song to be downloaded from iTunes in February 2013? Apple Christmas Quiz 2016 round 4: The answers Q1 What software did PC users use with iPods before iTunes? Musicmatch Jukebox. In 2002, Apple launched an iPod for Windows with Musicmatch software to help manage users’ music library and transfer files. It was abandoned the following year when iTunes for Windows was introduced.  Q2 How many versions of the iPhone have been released? Six. The iPhone was announced in January 2007 and launched the following June. Since then Apple has released the 3G, 3GS, 4, 4S and most recently the iPhone 5. Apple has also offered six significant iOS software updates since the launch of the original iPhone. Q3 What two things did Steve Jobs say an Apple tablet must lack? A keyboard and stylus. A day after attending a dinner party with Bill Gates at which there was talk of a tablet PC that Microsoft was developing, Jobs reportedly gathered his team and said: “I want to make a tablet, and it can’t have a keyboard or a stylus. Users would be able to type by touching the screen with their fingers.”  Q4 How many songs did Apple offer at the US launch of the iTunes Music Store in 2003? 200,000. The iTunes Music Store was launched in the US on 28 April 2003, with songs selling at 99¢ each. Apple noted the Store offered ‘industry-standard’ AAC audio format download at 128kbps and promised exclusive tracks from over 20 artists.  Q5 What’s the connection between an apartment sold by Jobs and Apple’s 2004 iPods? U2. In 2004, not only did Jobs sell his New York apartment to U2 singer Bono for $15m, but Apple introduced the iPod U2 Special Edition. The device was part of a partnership between Apple, U2 and Universal Music Group, and featured a black enclosure and custom engraving of U2 band member signatures. You probably own an iOS device, but how much do you know about the history of the iPad, iPhone and iPod?  Q6 What did Jobs say users would need in order to use tablets with screens less than 10 inches?  Sandpaper, so they could “file down their fingers”. In October 2010, the Apple CEO warned: “There are clear limits of how close you can physically place elements on a touchscreen before users cannot reliably tap, flick or pinch them. This is one of the key reasons we think the 10in screen size is the minimum size required to create great tablet apps.” In October 2012, Apple launched 7.9in iPad mini. Q7 At launch in 2008, how many apps were available to download from the iTunes App Store? 500. “The App Store is a grand slam, with a staggering 10 million applications downloaded in just three days,” enthused Jobs shortly after its launch. The number of apps now available is believed to be in excess of 800,000. In contrast, when the original iPad launched, it had 3,000 native apps ready at launch, that figure rising to over 50,000 in just eight months. Q8 In what year was Apple able to offer iTunes songs DRM-free? Announced on 9 January 2009, Apple’s DRM-free format iTunes Plus was backed by the four major music labels and thousands of independent labels. The move also saw higher-quality 256kbps AAC encoded tracks made available.  Q9 Which classic rock band allowed their back catalogue to appear on iTunes in 2012? AC/DC’s entire back catalogue, including 16 studio albums and four live albums, were made available digitally for the first time exclusively on the iTunes Store in November 2012. The band had held out, reportedly unhappy that individual tracks could be cherry-picked rather than seen in their true context as album tracks. Q10 What was the 25 billionth song to be downloaded from iTunes in February 2013? Monkey Drums (Goksel Vancin Remix) by Chase Buch. The song was purchased by Phillip Lüpke from Germany, who received a €10,000 iTunes Gift Card in celebration of downloading the 25 billionth track. When you're ready, here's the final round!

What can users get if they are able to achieve the goals put forward by the activity?  ( Apple ) Advertisement If you are an Apple Watch owner, you might have already received a message from the smartwatch that tries to get you to lose the extra weight you might have gained over the holidays. Apple has pushed out an announcement for the Ring in the New Year Challenge to all Apple Watch users, an activity that is similar to the Thanksgiving Day 5K challenge that Apple previously launched. Apple Watch New Year Challenge Details The activity, which will begin on Jan. 2, 2017, will challenge Apple Watch wearers to complete the three activity goals of moving, exercising, and standing every day for the four whole weeks of January. Users can choose from any activity that they want to do as long as they are able to achieve their goals. Specifically, the goals will require for users to move for about one minute within every hour over a period of 12 hours, work out at least 30 minutes daily, and reach the user's personal target for calories to burn. Apple Watch owners who participate in the challenge will be able to share their achievements through social media to allow them to join the expected avalanche of people who are trying to shed pounds after all the celebration over the holiday season. Reward For Completing The Apple Watch Fitness Challenge Users who are able to achieve the challenge offered by their Apple Watch for even just one week in January will be able to receive a special achievement badge for their efforts along with free stickers for iMessage that will signify that you were able to beat Apple's Ring in the New Year Challenge. Apple has also added a dedicated section in the iPhone's Activity app that collects the Apple Watch user's seasonal medals. Accessing the section shows a placeholder for the New Year challenge, which might help in motivating users to achieve their goals for January. Most of all, though, with the challenge, Apple is applying a more proactive approach in providing utility for customers into shape, and for those who are able to complete the set goals, they will already be on their way to improving their health through exercise. How To Accept Or Decline The Apple Watch Challenge While the Ring in the New Year Challenge is ultimately a good one for everybody to participate in, Apple Watch owners can choose to decline the challenge and prevent any notifications regarding the activity to arrive on their smartwatch. The notification for the challenge will appear on the Apple Watch only once, and once the wearer declines the challenge, there will be no way to bring it back. Those who are interested in participating, therefore, need to be careful not to dismiss the notification. TAG Apple, Apple Watch, Exercise © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

Home Industry Technology Google Pixel smartphones now have a similar battery problem to Apple iPhone 7 devices Google Pixel smartphones now have a similar battery problem to Apple iPhone 7 devices According to reports, Google Pixel and Pixel XL users are now facing a battery issue which the Apple iPhone users will be highly familiar with. By: Sumit Chakraborty | Published: December 29, 2016 12:30 PM This battery error is interesting because Google might be following the footsteps of Apple even in the area of device problems. But recently it was reported that even the Nexus devices were facing the same problem, which is an indication that the issue was in the Android Nougat update more than the device or battery themselves. (Reuters) According to reports, Google Pixel and Pixel XL users are now facing a battery issue which the Apple iPhone users will be highly familiar with. Google Pixel users are now complaining that the smartphones are shutting down even when it shows a considerable amount of charge left in the device. The complaints were found on Google’s own forum called the ‘productforums’ and also on Reddit. There were other reports in 9to5Google which claimed that Google Pixel smartphones were encountering early battery shutdowns at 30% reserve battery life. This battery error is interesting because Google might be following the footsteps of Apple even in the area of device problems. But recently it was reported that even the Nexus devices were facing the same problem, which is an indication that the issue was in the Android Nougat update more than the device or battery themselves. But the issue might get resolved sooner in Pixel devices as Google has complete control over that, unlike earlier Nexus devices where the hardware manufacturer was completely different. The issue was also complained about by users of Apple devices on many forums which led to the company taking care of its iOS updates. Also read | Best smartphones of 2016: Coolest flagship devices which dominated this year On Pixel user community, a user posted, “Every time my new Google pixel gets to roughly 25% it turns itself off and claims that it has 0, despite force stopping apps using a hibernate app the battery has no issue of background apps and I’ve tried optimising it might be time to face that the phone it’s self and the fact that it keeps happening almost every day!” Meanwhile, a Reddit user posted, “My Google Pixel (32 GB), less than a month old is facing worrisome battery issues. Twice in last 5 days, has the phone shut down abruptly while I am in middle of something. In both instances, the battery was between 25-35%, and the phone under normal conditions should have lasted for at least next 3-4 hours.” The moot question now is, whether Google will own up to the issues and eventually fix the issue, unlike Apple which has been quite unresponsive when it comes to this.

New entrant LeEco looked set to shake up the smartphone space, Xiaomi had announced the Xiaomi Mi 5, Samsung was prancing around with its Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge and modular phones looked like they’d make a comeback. Rumours also started flying around that Google was ditching the Nexus line and that it was working on a brand new, Google-branded phone that would finally show the world how it was done. So what happened? How did 2016 turn out to be such a disaster for smartphones? Apple: One step forward, two steps back Nobody expected much from Apple anyway this year. The company had already told everyone that the iPhone 8 would be its focus and that the iPhone 7 would just be a speed bump. Few, however, expected that Apple would follow through with its retarded plan of ditching the headphone jack. It’s not the iPhone 7 was bad; it was just boring. The same, 3-year old design, a faster processor, and a dual-camera on the larger model don’t necessarily make for an interesting device. (Also read: Here are 5 ways that Apple ruined our future) Google: Still in beta When Google said that it was working on a Google-branded flagship, we were excited. Finally, Google would take real responsibility for Android and build a worthy rival to the iPhone. It almost succeeded. The phone’s launch event was rather tame, but the device itself seemed exceptional. While the design was boring, top-of-the-line hardware, a stellar camera system, great battery life, Google Assistant and Daydream support in one device seemed like the perfect package. The price was high, but we didn’t care. It seemed like the most amazing Android phone ever, maybe even the best smartphone ever; but it wasn’t to be. Reports started trickling in that the phone was hastily built, that it was just old HTC design with Google software, that expedience took priority over quality. Other reports of bugs popped up. Microphones that didn’t work properly, speakers that crackled, random software issues, Wi-Fi bugs, and more recently, the dreaded 30 percent battery bug from the Nexus 6P. Pixel was supposed to change the game for Android, and it did, but just not the extent that we hoped. All it ended up being was a flagship Nexus device, a beta product. Samsung: Boom! Samsung could have just trod all over 2016 with its smartphones. The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge were amazing phones. They didn’t offer anything new over the previous S6 and S6 Edge, but we weren’t asking for much more anyway. The first half of 2016 saw the company seize chunks of market share, particularly in the flagship space, from Apple and others. Image: Hui Renjie This success was to be followed up by the launch of the Galaxy Note 7, which certainly looked like another winner from Samsung. But then the explosions started and the rest, as you know, is history. Samsung’s profits tanked, people lost faith in the brand and the Note 7 is a by-word for disaster. If you want a quick refresher, be sure to check out our feature here. Modular phones: Meh Modular phones hold such promise. They are, in fact, the dream smartphone. Wouldn’t it be great to just swap out a part and upgrade, as you would a PC? Representational image for smartphones. LG made a half-hearted attempt at this with the G5, but as with all half-hearted attempts, the phone was disappointing. Lenovo too, made a valiant effort at building the ultimate modular phone. Somehow, the company messed up the design so badly that it managed to turn us off modular phones for good. LeEco: A gimmick LeEco’s phones were by far the most disappointing. The company seemed all set to shake up the smartphone market in India with its seemingly stellar Le Max 2 and Le 2, but the company only disappointed on all fronts. The phones were OK, offered good value at the price, but other than that, offered nothing else. It even preemptively removed the headphone jack from its phones when it heard that Apple was planning to do the same. The image of LeEco Le Max 2 that comes with CDLA technology Apple at least gave us a larger taptic engine (which we didn’t ask for, by the way), LeEco gave us nothing. Marketing gimmicks don’t sell phones and today, the company is under tremendous financial strain, pending a bailout from the Chinese government. Everyone else: Booring Discounting Xiaomi, OnePlus and Huawei, everyone else just pumped one uninspired iPhone clone after another into the market. The HTC 10 was a great effort, but the phone was boring. Sony tried to pawn off plastic-coated flagships as premium devices, Asus completely lost it and decided to start selling budget hardware at premium prices, The less said about Microsoft and Blackberry, the better. The stars of 2016: Value The real stars of 2016 were Xiaomi and OnePlus. Xiaomi and OnePlus had the sense to build good phones that just worked, and sold them at very reasonable prices. There was simply no reason to say “no” to these phones. And I have to admit, the Xiaomi Mi Mix looks far more appealing than any phone on sale today. Huawei can also make it to this list, but only because of its work on its camera software. The company’s partnership with Leica and excellent camera app make for a great kit.

Manufacturing job growth continues, but slows in 2016 Tennessee manufacturing employment inched up for a fifth straight year, though at a slower rate than reported in previous years, according to the 2017 Tennessee Manufacturers Register, an industrial database and directory published by Manufacturers' News, Inc. The Register said Tennessee added 847 jobs between October 2015 and October 2016, a half percent gain. Tennessee is home to 6,659 manufacturers employing 385,133. Manufacturing employment in the state has grown by 4 percent since October of 2011. "Tennessee's solid infrastructure, workforce, business costs, and incentive programs continue to be a draw for a variety of manufacturers, particularly in the transportation equipment sector," says Tom Dubin, president of the Evanston, IL-based publishing company, which has been surveying industry since 1912. "However, job growth has slowed due to a strong dollar and global competition, and many of Tennessee's neighbors offer similar site selection advantages." Manufacturing job gains in Tennessee were led by the transportation equipment industry, which grew 3.2 percent or ded 1,617 jobs over the past year German pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim has agreed to divest key animal health assets to garner regulatory approval for a multi-billion dollar deal with Sanofi, U.A. regulators announced Wednesday. Boehringer Ingelheim plans to acquire Paris-based Sanofi's animal care subsidiary, Merial, which is valued at $13.5 billion in the asset-swap transaction announced in December 2015. In exchange, Sanofi would buy Boehringer Ingelheim's consumer health business, valued at $8 billion, as well as obtain cash compensation for $5.5 billion. Sanofi is the parent company of Chattem Inc., in Chattanooga. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is requiring Boehringer Ingelheim to sell its pet vaccine business to Eli Lilly and parasite control and some other animal health assets to Bayer. Pending home sales fell 2.5 % last month Fewer Americans signed contracts to buy homes in November. The decrease likely reflects the drag caused by rising mortgage rates and the shallow inventory of properties on the market. The National Association of Realtors said Wednesday that its seasonally adjusted pending home sales index fell 2.5 percent to 107.3, the lowest reading since the start of 2016. Pending sales declined in the Midwest, South and West, while improving in the Northeast. The slowdown marks a reversal for the housing market, as sales growth has been solid for the past year. Completed sales of existing homes in November climbed their highest pace in nearly a decade, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.61 million, the Realtors said last week. But the pending sales contracts suggest that demand may be weakening now that the costs of purchasing a home have increased. Pending sales contracts are a barometer of future purchases. A sale is typically completed a month or two after a contract is signed. Qualcomm faces anti-trust charges from South Korea South Korea's antitrust regulator slapped a 1.03 trillion won ($865 million) fine on Qualcomm Inc. Wednesday for allegedly violating competition laws. The Fair Trade Commission said that the San Diego, California-based company had engaged in unfair business practices in patent licensing and chip sales, including refusing to let rival chipmakers license patents essential for chip making. The FTC said Qualcomm allegedly used its dominant position in the modem chip market to force handset makers to pay license fees for a broad set of patents under terms it set unilaterally and to coerce handset makers into signing licensing contracts. The fine, the biggest ever levied by the antitrust regulator, "will restore fair competition in the mobile communications industry," Shin Young-sun, secretary general at the Fair Trade Commission, told reporters at a briefing. Qualcomm rejected the ruling, saying it plans to appeal it in court. Qualcomm made $25.1 billion in 2015 from collecting patent royalties and selling modem chips. South Korea, home to the world's largest smartphone maker Samsung Electronics, accounts for about 20 percent of its global revenue. Dentsu chief resigns over workers suicide The president of top Japanese advertising company Dentsu Inc. said Wednesday he will resign to take responsibility for the suicide of a worker who had clocked massive overtime in her first months on the job. President Tadashi Ishii said at a Tokyo news conference he will tender his resignation at a board meeting in January although he will stay through March as a courtesy to shareholders. Earlier Wednesday, government authorities filed papers demanding prosecutorial charges against the unidentified Dentsu employee suspected of driving Matsuri Takahashi to suicide from overwork. Japanese society values conformity and tends to revere workaholic lifestyles. Death linked to exhaustion is so common it's expressed as a special term, "karoshi," which includes suicides from overwork. About 2,000 people a year kill themselves due to work-related stress, the government says. Takahashi, 24, had just started working at Dentsu in April 2015. Her workload surged in October and she often returned home at five in the morning after working all day and night. Takahashi was clocking 100 hours of overtime a month before she jumped from her company dorm balcony in December 2015.

It has taken the industry by storm but one thing is for sure, Apple will make an effort to be back on top. This is the main reason why rumor has it that the company is rushing the release of its iMac 2017. According to reports, the arrival of the Surface Studio signifies the start of Apple losing to Microsoft. It is primarily because Apple has not been that active in innovating its desktops. As a result, consumers are now looking for other machines that might as well offer them the same thing as Apple. Nick Cronan, founding partner of Branch Creative, believes that Apple has been slacking for quite some time already. Although Apple might be creating something big, still, consumers are choosing what is already available in the market. Also read: Apple iMac 2017 Specs, Updates: Why Next Year?s iMac Will Be Boring Now, because Apple obviously does not want to lose its customers, there are speculations that the release of the iMac 2017 is going to be earlier than expected. Should that be the case, enthusiasts should anticipate its arrival in the first quarter next year. Meanwhile, let us take a quick look at the rumored specs of the upcoming desktop. According to Apple Insider, it will feature Intel?s Kaby Lake processor. But, since the processor is not yet out in the market, this may delay the release of the desktop. Also read: Acer Aspire C vs Microsoft Surface Studio: Acer Has Better Specs Than Microsoft Furthermore, the upcoming iMac is going to sport a new powerful graphics card. Rumor has it that it could either be the Polaris 11 or AMD Polaris 10. Apple might also add an OLED Touch Bar to the desktop similar to what it did on the MacBook Pro. Lastly, the desktop is also expected to be Virtual Reality (VR) ready. It is pretty clear that Apple has something great in store for its customers come 2017. But, if iMac 2017 will not hit the market soon, the Cupertino-based company might lose its loyal consumers. Share your thoughts in the comment section below.

Join For Free Progressive web apps are web apps that use the latest web standards to deliver a native-like user experience. They combine what we love most about the web and what we love about native apps. No installation is required, loading time is quite short and the app is accessible from an icon on the home screen. What's So Good About Progressive Web Apps? Progressive web apps combine a native user experience with the advantages of the web apps: Discoverability: In fact, progressive web apps are the websites themselves, thus they are indexed by search engines. Easy updating: New content and updates of your progressive web app will be downloaded instantly when you launch it. Security: Since every network request will be processed by service workers, progressive web apps should be hosted over HTTPS to prevent security issues. Offline work: Unlike ordinary internet links, you will be able to launch a progressive web app from your smartphone even without internet connection. User experience: Progressive web apps offer a native-like experience and performance with minimal page refreshes. In addition, just like native apps, they can be added to the home screen. Responsive design: A progressive web app will run smoothly on a smartphone, tablet and desktop as well. Linkable: Progressive web apps can be shared like any other link to a website. Let’s dive a bit further into the details of Progressive Web Apps. Preconditions for the Emergence of Progressive Web Apps The mobile app boom, which began with the emergence of iPhone and Android, is currently subsiding. An average user has formed a certain set of apps for their day-to-day use: WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Snapchat, Instagram, Spotify, and a mobile browser which serves as a sort of “one size fits all” solution from checking email to reading the news. The rest is just not necessary. People don’t want to install any more apps, they are satisfied with what they already have. A couple dozen of the most popular and well-established apps absolutely dominate the mobile app space. They have a very tight squeeze of the app market. They collect the majority of the revenue and don’t easily give way to others why are also trying to “get a piece of the pie”. As this chart from Statista shows, in 2016 half of the smartphone users in the United States didn’t install any new apps, 13% installed only one app per month: App loyalty is also suffering. The average retention rate for mobile applications is only 25% after 90 days, which means that 75% of the people who download an app end up deleting it. What does this mean? Is the era of mobile apps over? Are there other ways to engage customers without the hassle and expense of developing a native application and submitting it to the app store that is already filled to the brim with more than 2 million apps? Are there any technological alternatives to mobile apps that won’t annoy people with downloading and installation? Let’s find out. The Era of Mobile Applications The launch of the iPhone in 2007 created a frenzy not only in the consumer sector but also in the manufacturing sector (Nokia lost its market share while Samsung gained a big slice of it). Apple had changed the paradigm of interaction between the user and their smartphone. A small device became not just a means of communication with the outside world, but also something very personal. Today’s smartphone owners largely identify themselves with their devices. It’s hard to imagine a modern man without a smartphone. Technological innovations have significantly improved our lives: now it is much easier to get a sense of direction and orient oneself to the surrounding terrain thanks to Google Maps, keep in touch with loved ones via WhatsApp, find entertainment with funny YouTube videos, etc. The advent of smartphones temporarily halted the rapid development of web technologies. The era of mobile apps and their marketplaces began, thus starting a full-scale war for customers between device manufacturers. Some of them have fallen (Goodbye Nokia), some emerged as victors (Long live Samsung). But platform vendors, in this case, Apple and Google, have benefited the most. Web applications could not compete with mobile apps which provided better usability, more features, and the best overall mobile experience. At the beginning everyone was happy. Mobile data traffic was growing rapidly and technology experts proudly declared the imminent demise of the Web. Due to competition and a wide range of mobile devices, prices decreased significantly and even in developing countries most people could afford their own handsets. For example, in Indonesia, with a population of 260 million people, it is projected that by 2018 there will be more than 100 million smartphone users. Already, most Internet users (80 million) in this country access the Internet via mobile devices. Everything seemed to be going fine, but building mobile apps became harder and harder each time because of: Mobile device fragmentation. In the sphere of Android devices, there’s complete chaos. Manufacturers offer a whole range of devices, from small to large and from cheap to flagship, stuffed with advanced hardware and software. Until recently Apple had a strict policy in relation to its devices: fragmentation was much lower and iOS itself was closed. Developing for iOS was less painful than for Android. But the market dictates the rules, and to get the maximum profit it’s necessary to be flexible. Now Apple releases devices for almost all sectors of the population. Multiple operating systems. In today’s world Android holds a leading position among the mobile operating systems, followed by iOS, Windows Mobile, and others. From a business perspective, a product must be present on at least two of the above-mentioned platforms. This, in turn, carries certain costs for the development and support of both platforms. The relevance of information. Never before have we been confronted with so much information as in these days. Information is meaningless if it is not relevant. Competition is growing with every new day and it is essential to deliver a new product into the market and into the customers’ hands as soon, and as early as possible. From the viewpoint of a producer, the internet is nothing more than a cheap and effective means of delivering products and services to the end user. In this context, mobile apps are not the best means for disseminating information because of: application development and maintenance takes a lot of time deployment delays due to marketplace approvals device fragmentation increases the occurrence of errors and non-standard behaviors on various devices customers are reluctant to update applications Cross-platform Alternative If there wasn’t need for multiple platform support, such tools as Electron, React Native, or Angular Mobile Toolkit wouldn’t have gained recognition and become widespread. It is not difficult for a good front-end developer to write a cross-platform mobile application that would run on all major platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS) like a native app. However, cross-platform apps could not compete with native apps due to their slow performance and limited access to the phone’s native APIs. In addition, they do not solve the problem of the oversaturated mobile apps market since they also have to be downloaded and installed just like their native companions. The Wind of Change: Going for Progressive Standards Time does not stand still. Web technologies become more and more mature offering innumerable capabilities for developing complex web applications which are in no way inferior to mobile apps. For example, a modern web application like Google Docs by no aspects concedes to its desktop counterpart Microsoft Word, and this is just the beginning. Web app development is starting to push desktop applications into the abyss and it seems that in the near future we will only need a browser. In 2015 Google introduced a new model for building web applications called Progressive Web Apps. It combines the best of web and mobile applications and takes advantage of the latest browser capabilities. A progressive web app can be described as a hybrid between a web page and a mobile application. Actually the term “Progressive Web Apps” is just a buzzword. At its core they aren’t any different from ordinary web applications, they are made of HTML, CSS and Javascript and “live” in the browser but offer more capabilities and more access to the underlying operating system and hardware (more access to the phone’s native APIs). Just like a native app, a PWA can be added to the home screen with a custom icon. A native app may be incompatible with some devices, because the OS, hardware or firmware may not be supported, which is not the case for PWAs. The reason why they are called ‘progressive’ is because they will work regardless of the technical environment and will only be implemented if it’s available on the device without damaging or sacrificing the content. There’s nothing new about it, progressive enhancement has already been implemented in web apps for years now. But they shouldn’t be confused with the aforementioned cross-platform mobile applications made with such tools like Cordova, React Native or Electron. All these technologies wrap the source code (HTML, CSS, and Javascript) into executable files (.apk, .exe) which then have to be downloaded and installed. The main idea behind PWAs and what makes them really stand out from all the aforementioned technologies is that PWAs don’t require installation. To be able to use a PWA all you need to do is to visit its webpage and save it to the home screen. That’s it. All the source code and resources will be cached locally (saved in local storage) allowing the PWA to work offline. Service Workers The main workhorse that powers a PWA and allows it to function even if there’s no internet connection is a new technology called Service Workers. Once cached, a PWA will always load from the local storage. If there’s new content available or any new versions of the app, the service worker will automatically update it behind the scenes next time you connect to the Internet. Another cool thing worth mentioning is that PWAs can send push notifications, a privilege which only native apps could use until recently. Here’s just a small subset of the capabilities already available in PWAs (besides those mentioned above): access to hardware features such as webcam, microphone, Bluetooth, battery status, accelerometer, gyroscope, compass and a whole bunch of sensors (ambient light sensor, proximity sensor, etc) search engine indexing full-screen mode access to the file system ability to add an icon to the home screen clipboard access hardware-accelerated 3D graphics using WebGL PWAs can be easily shared via URL Safari is a little behind in implementing progressive web apps, namely their core feature – Service Workers, but it’s only a matter of time before it will catch up with other browsers. All of the other new web APIs listed above, including push notifications, are available. To learn more about PWAs and their capabilities visit the Google Developers website. What This Means for Tomorrow's Startups Again Google is ahead of the curve with its “Progressive Web Apps”. We can foresee huge demand for PWAs in the near future and they will certainly revive web application development. PWAs eliminate the need to download and install something onto your mobile device, which became a stumbling block during the proliferation of mobile applications. PWAs can do the job for most use cases and can also be a much better investment .There’s no need to develop and maintain three separate code bases for Android, iOS, and Web. There’s no need to compete for attention in app stores.  You can use good old SEO techniques to attract visitors and convert them into customers. Does this mean that native apps are doomed? Not necessarily. There are still specific use cases where there is no alternative to native apps. Pursuing both strategies still remains the best option, at least for the time being. A win-win strategy would be building: PWA + iOS app since Apple doesn’t provide full support for Progressive web apps yet. Native apps that haven’t received widespread recognition on marketplaces could be rewritten as PWAs to get a “second breath”. Like This Article?

REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach - RTX2QRGC 4 By tech2 News Staff /  29 Dec 2016 , 10:46 Apple is one of the most influential companies in the technology industry and consumers highly anticipate the arrival of the latest generation of its products. Possible reports about the next generation of Apple devices start as soon as the current generation device is launched, or sometimes earlier (iPhone 8 rumours in the case of Apple iPhone 7 launch.). According to a report by University Herald, the company is expected to launch a number of updated products this year. The report details that the company is currently working on an iPad Pro with a screen size of 9.7 inches, though rumours indicate that the size can increase to 12.7-inch. The new iPad Pro is expected to launch in January along with a four-speaker setup, rear camera flash along with Smart Connector and Apple Pencil support. One interesting thing is that according to the report, Apple will launch a new iPhone generation called the iPhone X. There are no details about the new generation with only guesses about the fact that iPhone 7s and iPhone 8 will come under this generation. Apart from the new label to the generation, other rumours like the use of OLED screen is nothing new that we are observing. Another thing to note is that reports indicate that the company is working on a new 5-inch iPhone model with vertical dual-camera system and this new offering will be offered as a ‘Medium’ offering. Last but not the least, the company is working on revamped MacBooks and iMacs with improved graphics and Type-C connectors to compete with Microsoft. There is no official timeline of the launch or any confirmation on the details so its better if you take the rumours with a pinch of salt.   Tags: Apple, Apple Pencil, iMAc, iPad Pro, IPhone X, MacBook, Medium, OLED, smart connector, Tim Cook Also read Apple iPhone 7s with 5-inch display, dual vertical cameras rumoured to be in the works Apple engineer shares what it was like to work on the first iPhone X Recommended For You Apple did try out a iPhone with an iPod click wheel Government is discussing the extra concessions demanded by Apple, says Nirmala Sitharaman Apple App Store hits a record $240 million worth of app purchases on New Year’s Day Apple pulls New York Times app from Chinese app store after China reports the app Subscribe to our newsletter GO You are Now Subscribed to our Newsletter - Stay Tuned !

Home Industry Technology Best smartphones of 2016: Coolest flagship devices which dominated this year Best smartphones of 2016: Coolest flagship devices which dominated this year As 2016 is about to get over, we should take a look at the smartphones which dominated the year and became hugely popular because of the features they brought with them. The past year was generally a very good time for smartphones, as flagship devices from most of the manufacturers were good and were loved by the consumers. By: Sumit Chakraborty | Published: December 29, 2016 11:02 AM It is rare that so many decent smartphones were launched in one year. 2016 was particularly important as there were some new additions to the phone market and each went with a different strategy. While some tried modular smartphones, others went completely the opposite way. (Photo – Reuters) As 2016 is about to get over, we should take a look at the smartphones which dominated the year and became hugely popular because of the features they brought with them. The past year was generally a very good time for smartphones, as flagship devices from most of the manufacturers were good and were loved by the consumers. In fact, it is rare that there were so many decent smartphones launched in one year. 2016 was particularly important as there were some new additions to the phone market and each went with a different strategy. While some tried modular smartphones, others went completely the opposite way. Here is a list of the best smartphones that we found to pack the latest features and justified its ‘flagship’ branding. Most of the devices listed here are in the premium category as those of the ones which have the most features introduced in them. However, with the entry of new manufacturers and their aggressive pricing, more and more devices are coming in which compete in the specifications area with the flagship models, and that too at affordable pricing. Here is a list of flagship devices which we found to have dominated 2016: Apple iPhone 7 (Source: Reuters) Apple has always been known to be a vertically integrated company which designs both hardware and software and hardware. The way iOS and iPhones merge together in the new device, it has been touted to be one of the best smartphones ever. Apple had announced both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in September and the most notable feature was the dual camera system. There was a huge upgrade in the camera department with many new, and a wide range of features introduced in the device. Both the devices are dust and water resistant as well. Google Pixel (Image credits: blog.google ) Google has recently been foraying into a lot of different sectors, with an aim to expand its operations, so how could smartphones be far behind. After making Android OS for a long time, Google decided to introduce the new Pixel and Pixel XL flagship smartphones with Made By Google logo in October 2016 and got rid of the previous Nexus lineup. Google has achieved something that no other device-maker, bar Apple, has’an integration of devices and software to build a strong ecosystem. Pixel competes head-to-head with the iPhone on all parameters, be it OS, app stores, cloud storage, online assistance and even price. The Pixel smartphones also introduced arguably the smartest virtual ‘Assistant’ ever. OnePlus 3 OnePlus, a Chinese company made a good noise when it launched its much-awaited flagship smartphone OnePlus 3 in June at a price of Rs 27,999. The device and the company, in general, have been known to be flagship killers by bringing devices with the latest technology and at affordable pricing. The smartphone’s performance in UI, battery life and camera has impressed one and all. The company also rolled out an upgraded version of the smartphone recently, called the OnePlus 3T. Motorola MotoZ Motorola (MotoZ and Moto Z Force) users can snap in optional ‘Moto Mods’ accessories, which include a battery pack (Incipio Offgrid), a speaker and a projector (InstaShare). (Picture: Motorola website) Motorola surprised us all with the way it was successful in making phones with modular designs, called the Moto Z. The company introduced many new tricks in the modular based devices. This innovative feature, led to the phone being extremely slim with the option of adding anything one wants through Mods and the 16 magnetic pins on the rear end of the phone. This also included a 3,500mAh battery with the option of adding another one at the back for extra fuel. Apart from that, there is the option of adding a Hasselblad Zoom lens, a projector and speakers. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge In spite of the Galaxy Note 7 debacle, Samsung did not disappoint with its Galaxy S7 Edge smartphone. Samsung is known to make the best display screens in the business and it is quite evident in the new device. The amazingly beautiful WQHD Super AMOLED display has a rich texture and curved edges give an appearance of bezel-less sides. Apart from that, the phone is a complete package because of a great camera and full specs. It also packs a good battery. This phone was launched early in 2016 and was later overshadowed by the Apple devices. Please Wait while comments are loading...

While the concept of smart watches is still struggling to get along well with users especially in a country like India, the company's are still banking on future demands for smartwatches which is why we saw a bunch of new players entering the smartwatch industry. On one side, where Apple continued to dominate the industry with its Apple Watch series 2, on the other side, players like Pebble and Fitbit brought in some interesting products this year in India. Yet, the year didn't close in at a happy note after Lenovo recently announced its decision to put the Moto-360 lineup on hold. And how can we forget Fitbit buying Pebble for a deal tipped to be just less than $40 million. Nevertheless, if you are one of those who can't wait to buy a smartwatch, here is our top five smartwatches you can buy right now. Apple Watch series 2 - Rs 34,900 Apple Watch was one of the most successful wearables when it was launched back in 2015. While Apple continued to ponder on to the smartwatch lineup, the series 2 Apple Watch clearly had its focus on health and fitness. Running on WatchOS 3, Apple didn't change much of the design on the new Apple Watch. The new model comes with 2x Brighter OLED Retina Display with Force Touch technology and is, even more, water resistant up to 50 meters. Hence, apart from normal physical activity tracking functionality, it can also track your pool activities as well recording laps, distance and stroke style while you dip in water. Digging deep, the new Apple Watch 2 is powered by the dual-core S2 processor with inbuilt GPS which was missing on the original Apple Watch. Apart from that, the new Apple Watch also comes with built-in Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n 2.4 GHz, Bluetooth, Call functionality etc. The new model comes in three variants, Space Grey Aluminium, Stainless Steel and Silver Aluminium. The dial on the Apple Watch 2 measures at 42.5 x 36.4 x 11.4 mm making it slightly thicker than the original Apple Watch. The slightly more thickness now packs in a larger battery which Apple claims can last you up to 18 hours. Moto 360 2nd Generation and Sport Edition - Rs 17,999 (starting) Though launched late last year, Lenovo launched the Moto 360 earlier this year, hence, the smartwatch made it to this list. Besides, Moto 360 is probably the best smartwatch running on Android Wear right now. However, the Moto 360 2nd Gen might be your last chance to grab a Moto watch as Lenovo recently announced about its plans to not launch any subsequent Moto 360 watch soon. Nevertheless, The Android Wear-powered Moto 360 Sport features a 1.37-inch LCD display at 360 x 325 pixels resolution offering a pixel density of 263ppi. Apart from Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection, the screen on the Moto 360 2nd Gen can automatically adopt its brightness based on the surroundings. Going inside, the device is powered by a 1.2GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor with Adreno 305 with GPU coupled with 512MB of RAM. Further, there is 4GB of storage and the new Sport variant comes with features like Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g and also packs barometric altimeter, accelerometer, ambient light, and gyroscope sensors while also houses a vibration/ haptics engine. These bunch of sensors on this smartwatch along with built-in GPS helps it track various physical activities along with parameters like distance, speed, heart rate etc. Lastly, the Moto 360 2nd Gen is built out of waterproof silicon material which also prevents it from fading. Pebble Time- Rs 9,999 Pebble entered India back in May 2016 with the launch of four smartwatches. While the Pebble Time is not the standard LCD smartwatch, it has its own take on smartwatch industry. Pebble though now sold to Fitbit, made some extremely well-designed smartwatches in our opinion. The Pebble Time, for example, comes in with a polycarbonate design but in no way it feels cheap on the wrist. Further, you also get a bunch of customization options with swappable straps. Moving on to the specification front, Pebble Time, unlike other smartwatches comes with 1.25-inch coloured e-Paper display which is an ultra-low-powered Sharp LCD display with a resolution of 144 x 168 pixels. While the e-Paper display is in no way better than the normal LCD display but its energy efficient capabilities help this smartwatch last more than 7 days in a single charge. For the software, we get the new Pebble OS which brings in the Timeline feature through which one can easily navigate the notifications as well as all the updates available through apps downloaded on the smartwatch. No touchscreen here as the users have to navigate by pressing the up, middle and down buttons placed on the right side of the device. Compatible with both iOS and Android, the new voice replies feature can come in really handy especially while replying to messages on WhatsApp or Facebook. Apart from this, Pebble Time can also track your steps, sleep, workout and other physical activities, thanks to the dedicated Health app on the Pebble App store. Sadly, post-Fitbit acquisition, Pebble smartwatches are rarely available. 1 2 Next Smartwatches Smartphones Apple Watch 2 Moto 360 2nd Gen Pebble Fitbit Blaze Samsung Gear Fit 2 Top smartwatches 2016 Apple First Published : Thursday, December 29, 2016 - 10:32 Related Stories Vodafone Red postpaid offers upgraded, now offers free calls and additional mobile data by: Nirupam Manik | 06 Jan, 2017 Interestingly, earlier this week, Airtel introduced a new offer in which users would get additional 3GB 4G data each month for 12 months.

Now, The Economic Times reports that one concession Apple is fighting for in India is related labeling laws so it doesn’t have to print product info on devices. Currently, Indian law requires that certain product details be printed on the device itself, but Apple has asked that it be allowed to print the information on the iPhone’s packaging or somewhere in iOS. Apple wants the government to relax labelling rules so that it doesn’t have to print product-related information directly onto devices to avoid cluttering up their minimalist design. That’s one of the concessions Apple has sought after expressing its intention to start manufacturing in India, an official said. Apple’s request was initially made to the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, but has now been forwarded to the Department of Revenue and Department of Electronics and Information Technology. Lax labeling laws are one of several incentives Apple has sought in India as it plans to open manufacturing facilities in the country. Apple has also sought tax incentives for manufacturing in the country, which are currently being reviewed by the country’s finance ministry. Apple’s fight to open retail stores in India has been a long one. Indian law requires that a company with retail locations manufacture a portion of the goods in the country, and while it was initially thought that Apple might be able to circumvent that requirement, the company is now believed to be working with Foxconn on establishing manufacturing in the country. The finance ministry had rejected an earlier proposal by Apple to set up wholly owned outlets in the country that sought exemption from the compulsory 30% local sourcing norm. The company had sought the exemption on the grounds that it was bringing “state-of-the-art” and “cutting-edge technology,” making it difficult to meet the sourcing condition. Apple and Tim Cook have touted India as the next big market for the iPhone for several years now. A retail presence in the country would allow for more timely device releases, lower prices, and more power in helping expand cellular service. Guides AAPL Company Breaking news from Cupertino.

Apple TV has typically been proprietary with media, always suggesting to buy or rent from the iTunes store rather than show you where you can find titles in other streaming apps. The TV app changes all of that, allowing users to quickly find movies and TV shows to watch through recommendations and a watchlist (“Up Next”). Clicking on a title in the TV app plays the video in the streaming app where it is available. This means that what you want to watch on Hulu will be listed next to what you want to watch on NBC or other streaming services that have partnered with Apple. Plus, it is synced with other Apple Devices so you can continue watching on your iPhone or iPad. You access the app via the TV icon button on the Apple TV remote that was previously used to return to the home screen. (You can choose whether you want it to open the TV app or the home screen in the the Settings menu.) The app aggregates popular titles from a number of services, including Hulu, NBC, CBS, The CW, MTV, History Channel, Food Network, A&E, AMC, Comedy Central, Tribeca Shortlist, Starz, HBO Now (not HBO Go), Showtime, Crunchyroll, Mubi, and more. Apple CEO Tim Cook described the app as a "unified TV experience that's one place to access all of your TV shows and movies, one place to discover great new content to watch.” To make it easier to access the shows you want to watch, or to continue shows you have started watching, the app displays the titles at the top of the home menu along with a beefy selection of recommended shows. A Watch Now section displays a curated list of popular movies and TV shows for browsing. The main screen also has a list of genres or you can drill down to sub-genres in the Collections section, featuring Workplace Comedies, Travel Shows, and Music Documentaries. Up Next is basically a watchlist of titles that you’ve added, pulled together in a single list and “presented in the order you are most likely to watch first. While Netflix and HBO Go don’t automatically show up in the TV app, shows that are also available in iTunes do appear. While I couldn't add the Netflix original, Sense8 to my Up Next list, I was able to add House of Cards and choose to watch it via iTunes or Netflix. I chose Netflix. When I clicked on House of Cards in the TV app, it took me directly to the Netflix app. The same was true for HBO Go. While the Apple TV found HBO’s new show Divorce, I couldn’t add it to the TV app. On the other hand, the series Girls could be added because earlier seasons are available in iTunes. Up Next is quite handy. When looking for a movie I wanted to watch in Hulu, I stumbled upon a title I’ve been wanting to see. I was able to add the movie to my Up Next list by simply clicking on it. The Library tab includes all of your previous iTunes TV show and movie purchases. The Store tab makes it easy to find anything you want to buy or rent in iTunes without leaving the TV app. The Search tab shows trending TV shows and movies and displays the results of titles you are seeking. During setup after the Apple TV update (or available in the settings menu) you have the opportunity to use a single sign-on for all apps that require authentications from your TV provider—Dish, DirecTV, and other cable and telecom partners. At this time a number of apps still require separate authentication on a web browser. The idea is that once you sign in with your TV provider, all subsequent apps can access it and not require a special login. This update also makes Siri voice control more useful and responsive. If you know the movie or TV show title, you can say “Play (Title).” With Apple’s more open approach, the title will open in its “home” app. Saying “Play Homeland, for example, offered to start playback in Showtime Anytime instead of iTunes. Siri will also launch apps and find them in the app store if they are not on the Apple TV. When I said, “Launch Tribeca Shortlist,” Siri replied “You don’t have an app called Tribeca Shortlist but I found this in the App Store.” I clicked on the displayed icon to download it. Siri can control playback in more apps too. Play, pause, fast forward, rewind, and fast forwarding or rewinding for a specified length of time—5-minutes, 20-minutes, etc.—is supported in most streaming apps. If you ask, “What did he just say?” Siri will rewind the video several seconds and show the closed captioning during playback. The closed captioning turns off when you reach the place where you originally asked for clarification. When asked, Siri was also able to display a list of NFL games scheduled for the upcoming weekend with the channel information. Many Siri commands are similar to those used for the iPhone and iPad. You can use Siri to display the weather, game scores, and more. Home control via Apple’s home kit makes it possible to unlock doors, turn on lights etc. using Siri on the Apple TV. When I’m ready to watch a movie, I can turn off the Philips Hue lights in my media room by simply asking Siri. The new updates have moved the Apple TV to the top of my list of favorite streaming devices. If only Apple would add Amazon Instant Video, I’d disconnect some of my other devices.

On December 28th, the company pushed a notification to every Apple Watch owner encouraging them to participate in a Ring in the New Year Challenge starting January 2nd, 2017. If you complete all three of your activity goals (Move, Exercise, Stand) every day for at least one week in January, you'll get a special achievement medal (above) and an iMessage sticker pack to help you brag about your performance. The concept of seasonal Apple Watch achievements isn't strictly new. Apple introduced a Thanksgiving Day 5K challenge on November 24th with similar rewards. However, the Cupertino crew is being more aggressive about notifying users. Also, you're much more likely to realize that you can get achievements like this -- there's now a dedicated section in your iPhone's Activity app that shows seasonal medals, including a placeholder for the not-yet-active New Year's competition. Not every Apple Watch owner is going to appreciate the campaign, to be sure. The alert could easily rub you the wrong way if you can't (or just don't care to) take up the challenge. However, it's not shocking to see Apple go this route. In addition to promoting good health, the seasonal events offer an incentive to keep wearing your watch. You may be more likely to use the Apple Watch every day if you know that you'll have something to show for that commitment, and that increases the chances that you'll be interested in a future model instead of letting your current watch languish in a drawer.

Seville, Spain | Thu, December 29, 2016 | 09:24 am Apple CEO Tim Cook announces the new iPhone 7 during an event to announce new products Wednesday, Sept. 7, 2016, in San Francisco. (AP/Marcio Jose Sanchez) Topics Apple ICT Trade technology Share this article  share on facebook  share on twitter  share on google plus  share on Linkedin  share on whatsapp  comment  share on email share this article follow Us    The Indonesian government has just enacted the new Industry Ministry Regulation No. 65/2016 on local content. Information and Communications Technology (ICT) companies, especially those producing laptop computers, smartphones and tablets, are the main targets. They are now required to meet a threshold of 30 percent domestic content in terms of hardware, software or investment. In response, Apple, a United States giant tech company headquartered in Cupertino, California, has pledged to dedicate funding of about US$44 million to support a three-year Research and Development (R&D) program in Indonesia. In return, Apple now has the right to market all types of its iPhone in the country. Apple lags slightly behind its competitors. Samsung is now leading the Indonesian smartphone market, obtaining a quarter share, followed by China’s new baby Oppo with one-fifth. Thus, for some, the R&D policy offered by Apple might be seen solely as an effort to facilitate penetration of its latest iPhone 7 in Indonesia, the largest market in Southeast Asia. However, irrespective of its motives, we can still perceive the initiative as a big milestone that will potentially re-address the pathways of the Indonesian economy toward a more knowledge based-nation. Previous studies have defined the importance of investment in R&D and human resources. Renowned economist Paul Romer ( 1990 ) explains these two aspects are essential elements for countries aiming to achieve a greater economic output. Robert Barro ( 1991 ) empirically studied the performance of 98 countries from 1960 to 1985 and assured poorer countries they could catch up with richer nations provided that they invested in a higher level of human capital. Therefore, Apple’s commitment has sent Indonesia at least three important signals. First, R&D has long been missing vocabulary. Indonesian R&D performance remains very, very weak. At the country level, we trail far behind other developing nations, let alone advanced ones. The ratio of Indonesia’s gross R&D expenditure (GERD) to gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010 was only 0.08 percent, the lowest among Asian countries. Taiwan, Japan and Korea are not only leading the region but also the world. Mulyanto ( 2014 ) recapped that Indonesia’s ratio was among the lowest in ASEAN, compared to Thailand (0.25 percent), the Philippines (0.11 percent) and Vietnam (0.19 percent) At the industry level, Indonesian companies have disappeared from the map of the 2,500 most R&D intensive companies in the world (European Commission, 2015). There is not even one Indonesian company on the list, against 24 Indian firms, six each in Hong Kong and Singapore, three Malaysian, a Thai and couple of hundred Japanese, Chinese and Taiwanese companies combined. Just to remind us, Indonesia is the third most populated country in Asia and fourth in the world. Second, Indonesia as a knowledge economy is still quite up in the sky. The knowledge economy is all about innovation. The Oslo Manual defines R&D as input for innovative capabilities. Consequently, the amount spent on R&D by a country or a company should support both technical and non-technical innovations. Moreover, activities should go far beyond the confines of research labs. They can occur in both the public and private sectors and are conducted across borders, sectors and institutions. Nevertheless, the policy directed toward increasing the role of private R&D in Indonesia is also somewhat limited. To exemplify, given the importance of R&D data, the Indonesian Central Statistics Agency (BPS) has even dropped the questions that address research activities carried out by industry. Consequently, the last release of the annual manufacturing survey in 2011 served as the lone and the latest data point to observe this variable. Hence, talking about the triple helix in R&D stages and innovative capabilities of industry, they are still a long way off this goal. Third, the importance of becoming an ICT R&D hub. High-tech ICT companies are now leading the landscape of world industries. Companies like Google, Facebook and Apple are not only making big sales but are also among the most R&D -intensive companies in the world. ICT industries are, in general, five times more R&D intensive than non-ICT companies (European Commission, 2015). Just to better imagine the size of these companies, based on the Industrial Scoreboard (European Commission, 2015), Google recorded net sales of €77 billion (US$80.6 billion) in 2014, which equals 60 percent of Indonesian government revenues. It also spent €10 billion on R&D, which equals one-third of Indonesia’s education budget. Facebook spent €2.2 billion on R&D. Apple’s $44-million R&D funding commitment in Indonesia only accounts for 0.8 percent of its total R&D spending in 2014. Based on the classification of ICT industries defined by the OECD ( 2009 ), we can only identify 22 Indonesian ICT players among 23,370 companies covered in the annual manufacturing survey (BPS, 2011) — indeed an atomistic portion. They performed less convincingly in R&D and innovation. Thus, if domestic Indonesian firms cannot rival top-notch ICT companies, we can alternatively serve as an ICT R&D hub. In return, the country is always endowed with a large and enthusiastic market where all tech-gadgets are sold out just in seconds. To give a stronger emphasis, ICT R&D hubs should go beyond building factories in, for instance, Bekasi or Karawang, both east of Jakarta. Moreover, the Apple success story can be used as a blueprint for other tech giants to engage Indonesia not only as a solid final consumer — which has been well proven — but also as an important partner in building a sustainable ICT ecosystem. To conclude, as a long awaited gift, we should identify closely with these signals from Apple, secure the commitment and provide a clear action plan involving all stakeholders, including universities, and make sure that the R&D activities are mutually beneficial.

Police think so – but Amazon won’t give up her data BREAKING NEWS December 28, 2016 When police responded to a home in Bentonville, Arkansas, one Sunday morning last November, they discovered Victor Collins’s dead body in the backyard. Police records describe a grim scene: Collins’s body was floating face up in a hot tub, and his left eye and lips dark and swollen. The resident who had called 911, James A. Bates, told police that he and a few work buddies, including Collins, had stayed up the night before watching football and drinking. Bates agreed to let two of them crash at his house, he told police, then went to bed. Shortly after he awoke, he claimed he spotted Collins’s lifeless body in the spa. Upon further investigation, however, police began suspecting foul play: Broken knobs and bottles, as well as blood spots around the tub, suggested there had been a struggle. A few days later, the Arkansas chief medical examiner ruled Collins’s death a homicide – and police obtained a search warrant for Bates’s home. Inside, detectives discovered a bevy of “smart home” devices, including a Nest thermometer, a Honeywell alarm system, a wireless weather monitoring system and an Amazon Echo. Police seized the Echo and served a warrant to Amazon, noting in the affidavit there was “reason to believe that Amazon.com is in possession of records related to a homicide investigation being conducted by the Bentonville Police Department.” That warrant threw a wrinkle into what might have been a traditional murder investigation, as first reported by the Information, a news site that covers the technology industry. While police have long seized computers, cellphones and other electronics to investigate crimes, this case has raised fresh questions about privacy issues regarding devices like the Amazon Echo or the Google Home, voice-activated personal command centers that are constantly “listening.” Namely, is there a difference in the reasonable expectation of privacy one should have when dealing with a device that is “always on” in one’s own home? The Echo is equipped with seven microphones and responds to a “wake word,” most commonly “Alexa.” When it detects the wake word, it begins streaming audio to the cloud, including a fraction of a second of audio before the wake word, according to the Amazon website. A recording and transcription of the audio is logged and stored in the Amazon Alexa app and must be manually deleted later. For instance, if you asked your Echo, “Alexa, what is the weather right now?” you could later go back to the app to find out exactly what time that question was asked. (Amazon makes the Echo, and Jeff Bezos is the chief executive of Amazon and owner of The Washington Post.) Police did not specify what data they expected to find on Bates’s Echo – nor is it clear what the device could have captured that would have been relevant to the case. Only if someone happened to have triggered his device with its wake word would it have begun recording any audio. Even then, it seems unlikely that audio would be conclusive evidence of an alleged murder. At least part of the search warrant indicated police may not have had a full understanding of how the Echo worked. “The Amazon Echo device is constantly listening for the ‘wake’ command of ‘Alexa’ or Amazon,’ and records any command, inquiry, or verbal gesture given after that point, or possibly at all times without the ‘wake word’ being issued, which is uploaded to Amazon.com’s servers at a remote location,” the affidavit read in part. “It is believed that these records are retained by Amazon.com and that they are evidence related to the case under investigation.” That allegation – that the Echo is possibly recording at all times without the “wake word” being issued – is incorrect, according to an Amazon spokesperson. The device is constantly listening but not recording, and nothing is streamed to or stored in the cloud without the wake word being detected. Amazon, for its part, has refused to comply with the warrants, according to court records. A company spokeswoman said she could not comment on this specific case. “Amazon will not release customer information without a valid and binding legal demand properly served on us,” a company spokeswoman said in an email to The Post. “Amazon objects to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course.” The case and its implications are reminiscent of one earlier this year, in which the FBI demanded Apple’s help in cracking an iPhone belonging to terrorists who opened fire at a work party last December and killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California. Apple refused to comply, and the FBI ended up paying professional hackers to crack the phone. As The Post’s Hayley Tsukayama reported in May: — The ensuing debate drove a wedge between Silicon Valley and Washington, as the tech industry, already wary of government surveillance, rushed to rally behind Apple. Amazon joined Microsoft, Google and a dozen other tech firms when it filed a legal brief supporting Apple’s position in March. “[The] government’s order to Apple exceeds the bounds of existing law and, when applied more broadly, will harm Americans’ security in the long run,” the filing said. — In the midst of that public fight, Bezos said Amazon was among the many tech companies backing up Apple – and that they were embracing technology that would make it difficult for government officials to access any personal information on its devices, even when those authorities have a warrant. A Bentonville police spokesman did not return a call requesting comment Tuesday. Bates, who was charged with first-degree murder, pleaded not guilty in April and has been out on bail, court records show. His trial is set to begin in 2017. Bates’s defense attorney, Kimberly Weber, told the Information she was alarmed by the police request of Amazon, which she viewed as an invasion of her client’s privacy. “You have an expectation of privacy in your home, and I have a big problem that law enforcement can use the technology that advances our quality of life against us,” Weber told the news site. Undeterred by Amazon’s refusal to turn over Bates’s Echo data, detectives sought the help of a far closer source: the Bentonville utilities department. According to police records, a city utility billing and collections manager told detectives that, on the night of Collins’s death, 140 gallons of water were used at Bates’s home between 1 and 3 a.m., an amount of water usage that exceeded all other periods there since October 2013. “In comparison, while all four [men] were together earlier that evening, they never used more than 10 gallons of water in an hour,” police reports said. “The amount of water used between 0100-0300 hours was consistent with spraying down the back patio area, which may have resulted in the wet concrete patterns observed on the morning of November 22nd.” The utility department’s source? Each home in Bentonville was on a smart meter, police were told, to measure and record the exact consumption of electricity and water every hour.
